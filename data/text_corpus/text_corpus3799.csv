biofiltration 1 introduction strategies for controlling microbial growth in distributions systems vary globally to protect public health against waterborne pathogens in some european countries where use of oxidant residuals are less common source water protection and advanced multibarrier treatment are strictly practiced to minimize the amount of biodegradable organic carbon entering the distribution system preventing growth of organisms in case of insufficient inactivation or regrowth due to inappropriate plumbing materials prest et al 2016 semenza and menne 2009 van der kooij and van der wielen 2014 the united states environmental protection agency usepa on the other hand requires systems using surface waters to have greater than 0 2 mg l of chlorine at the point of entry and a detectable residual in the distribution system us epa 1999 in either case the amount of biodegradable organic carbon must be properly measured and managed to minimize the risk of biofouling in the distribution system rosario ortiz et al 2016 water utilities aim to achieve biological stability throughout the water network biological stability refers to a condition where drinking water does not promote changes in bacterial concentration and composition prest et al 2016 rittmann and snoeyink 1984 a biostable water would have the same microbial quality in the distribution system and the consumers taps as the water coming out of the treatment facility prest et al 2016 several variables may impact biostability including changing seasons and high temperature e g drought during water main breaks diminished oxidant residuals increased nutrient loading from runoff events and fluctuating hydraulic conditions e g stagnation biofilm detachment prest et al 2016 van der kooij and van der wielen 2014 to meet bacteriological water quality standards in distribution systems water utilities monitor residual disinfectants in addition to total coliforms and e coli according to the revised total coliform rule which aims to prevent incidences of fecal contamination and exposure to waterborne pathogens us epa 2013 if the system is more vulnerable to contamination e g absence of chlorine residuals additional assessments are performed and corrective actions are required to assess the potential of water to grow heterotrophic bacteria several studies proposed measuring growth limiting constituents such as inorganic nutrients e g phosphorus and nitrogen and assimilable organic carbon aoc and biodegradable organic carbon bdoc formed from oxidation of natural organic matter hammes et al 2006 yavich et al 2004 van der kooij et al 1989 demonstrated that biostable waters should not have aoc greater than 10 μg l others have reported regrowth concerns reported as coliform occurrence with 50 μg l aoc lechevallier et al 1991 recently lechevallier et al 2015 recommended a threshold value of 120 μg l aoc 1 8 mg l dissolved organic carbon doc and 0 8 mg l phosphate as practical indicators of biostability for chlorinated systems in terms of bdoc niquette et al 2001 showed that a value 0 25 mg l bdoc at the outlet of the plant would be sufficient to limit bacterial growth in distribution systems others recommended to limit bdoc to less than 0 15 mg l to have biologically stable waters van der kooij and van der wielen 2014 these methods however rely on certain bacterial strains e g aoc p fluorescens p17 and spirillum nox table s1 and seed bacteria e g bdoc bacteria fixed on sand that may not be representative of the indigenous organisms present in the actual water sample van der kooij and van der wielen 2014 other methods for biostability have therefore focused on direct measurements of growth of indigenous bacteria i e adenosine triphosphate atp flow cytometry fcm cell counts following nutrient addition and incubation atp has received significant attention in recent years due to its simplicity and fast analysis time delahaye et al 2003 hammes et al 2010 van der kooij et al 2017 it can serve as a suitable surrogate for bulk viable biomass as evident from its good correlation with aoc van der kooij et al 2017 and intact cell counts hammes et al 2010 nescerecka et al 2014 a recent study of van der kooij et al 2017 employed periodic atp measurements to determine biomass production potentials bpp in water supplies in netherlands employing slow sand filtration that study involved direct incubation 25 c of water samples with nitrogen and phosphorus and subsequent measurement of cumulative atp concentrations farhat et al 2018 also proposed a bacterial growth potential assay based on fcm and atp measurements after inoculating various samples e g non chlorinated tap waters seawater river water wastewater effluent with indigenous bacterial community upstream treatment processes have a direct influence over the resulting microbial quality of treated waters pinto et al 2012 for example ozonation can inactivate organisms while also producing biodegradable compounds from its reaction with organic matter von sonntag and von gunten 2012 biofilters which are primarily applied to control biodegradable carbon and prevent regrowth urfer et al 1997 can leak certain organisms affecting the effluent quality pinto et al 2012 and possibly acting as seed bacteria for regrowth downstream uv treatment can induce bacteria into its dormant state which can later revive and proliferate zhang et al 2015 as a final barrier disinfection by chlorine is widely used however similar to other oxidants chlorine oxidation can increase aoc van der kooij 2003 some organisms e g gram positive bacteria were also found to survive after chlorination norton and lechevallier 2000 and combined with aoc could promote bacterial growth with non optimized chlorine dose regrowth might occur due to fast chlorine decay and diminished ability to inactivate microorganisms lechevallier et al 1996 nescerecka et al 2014 all these scenarios suggest the need to investigate the response of microorganisms with various upstream treatment and disinfection processes ensuring that bacterial growth is suppressed within the facility is an important step towards a more biostable drinking water quality this study aims to determine synergies that exist among unit treatment processes i e ozonation chlorination and biofiltration with respect to biostability as determined from growth based methods involving indigenous bacterial community i e atp proliferation bpp the effect of full scale treatment with sustained chlorination and biological filtration on microbial quality was first evaluated using molecular methods such as 16s rrna gene sequencing quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and intracellular atp catp regrowth of indigenous microorganisms in water samples subjected to various upstream treatment and biodegradable carbon concentrations was further assessed by measuring temporal catp changes lastly an online atp method that can continuously measure bacterial growth phases was reported for an improved bpp evaluation 2 experimental 2 1 water samples water samples were collected from big bend bbwtp and alfred

sustained chlorination wtp scl2 were measured based on the method reported by van der kooij et al 2017 briefly 600 ml water samples n 2 contained in autoclaved flasks were incubated in the dark at 25

biomass growth during incubation and achieve uniform n and p conditions across different samples to achieve the target c n p ratio waters with 0 3 mg l 25 μm bioavailable carbon typical for both wtp

was added chlorine containing water samples were first quenched with 0 1 mm na2s2o3 further details about the bpp experiments are provided in table s3 all spiked solutions were filter sterilized using nalgene sfca membrane filters 0 2 μm an ultrapure water blank with nutrients was also used as a negative control intracellular atp was measured at different days to determine the cumulative biomass

natural communities in both wtps i e unlike cultivation based methods and because it was found to be a suitable alternative to conventional aoc test lechevallier et al 1993 van der kooij et al 2017 it also accounts for all complex factors affecting microbial growth under various water quality conditions which may not be covered using other surrogate measures for bioactivity e g uv absorbance fluorescence nutrients turbidity particle counts 2 4 organic carbon challenge testing experiments to evaluate the response of indigenous bacteria with varying bioavailable carbon concentrations were also carried out the first part investigated the effect of ozone dose and subsequent oxidation byproduct formation on bpp ozonation was conducted in batch mode at doses of 0 0 25 0 5 and 1 mgo3 mgdoc using filter sterilized raw water samples from wtp scl2 total volume 500 ml ozone stock solution 1 mm o3 was generated from pure oxygen 99 995 with an ozonia cfs 1a ozone generator and standardized spectrophotometrically at 260 nm ɛ 3200 m 1cm 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 once all ozone has fully reacted 0 02 mg l po4 3 p and 0 07 mg l nh3 n were added into each water sample followed by spiking of 2 ml aliquot of unfiltered raw water the spiked raw water aliquot 40 microbial equivalents ml served as an inoculum of a diverse indigenous community the initial filter sterilization step

degrees depending on the ozone dose microbial consumption of carboxylic acids i e formate acetate and oxalate and aldehydes i e formaldehyde acetaldehyde propanal butanal hexanal produced after addition of 1 mgo3 mgdoc was also measured at days 0 3 7 and 14 along with changes in catp aldehydes and carboxylic acids were analyzed using epa method 556 eurofins eaton analytical ca which involved derivatization of analytes to their corresponding pentafluorobenzyl oximes followed by extraction with hexane and analysis by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gcms the second part involves sodium acetate addition to confirm the dependence of biomass production on biodegradable carbon and the sensitivity of the bpp method acetate was added as sole carbon source to 600 ml ultrapure water at the following concentrations 0 05 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 mg c l this was followed by addition of nutrients 0 02 mg l po4 3 p and 0 07 mg l nh3 n and 2 ml unfiltered raw water into each sample atp production at higher acetate concentrations 0 5 and 1 2 mg c l were also tested using wtp bf raw water the last part of this section involved testing the activity of the wtp bf s indigenous bacteria to utilize dihaloacetic acids dhaas a known biodegradable pollutant in drinking water systems de vera et al 2016 14 μg l of each analyte bromochloro dibromo dichloroacetic acid was added to 600 ml raw water and filter effluent samples containing 0 05 mg l po4 3 p and 0 4 mg l nh3 n and incubated in dark for 14 days at 25 c 60 ml aliquots were taken at days 0 3 7 and 14 for haa extraction derivatization with methanol and analysis by gcms epa method 552 3 eurofins eaton analytical ca sodium azide 10 mg l was added as a preservative into each vial to quench microbial activity at the time of sampling singer et al 2002 2 5 regrowth evaluation using an online atp analyzer this study also reports an automatic atp analyzer method to evaluate regrowth of indigenous bacteria in drinking water samples online the schematic diagram of the set up is shown in fig s3 the online atp method is based on the chemiluminescent reaction using luciferin and luciferase i e complying with astm d4012 81 and was applied to operate in batch mode to measure atp changes in water samples every 6 h the instrument ez atp microbial load atp analyzer applitek hach usa was calibrated using atp free tris hcl buffer and 200 pg ml atp standard during analysis 100 ml aliquot from 10 l sample 25 c ph 8 was pumped through norprene and teflon tubings washed with sequential 1m hcl 1m naoh and ultrapure water the bioluminescent reaction happens in a measuring cell controlled at 25 c and detected with a photomultiplier tube pmt extracellular atp is first measured followed by cell lysis using an ultrasonic probe to release intracellular atp and calculate for total atp one full analysis cycle i e flushing sampling luciferin luciferase addition ultrasonic treatment measurement and data processing takes 7 min to demonstrate proof of concept the following water samples obtained from wtp scl2 were subjected to online atp analysis raw water raw water 0 5 mg l acetate c ozonated water and final chlorinated water samples the samples were incubated in the dark at 25 c and spiked with 0 05 mg l po4 3 p and 0 2 mg l nh3 n 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of indigenous bacteria across treatment the quantity activity and diversity of indigenous bacteria in the biofiltration plant wtp bf were investigated following varying levels and types of disinfection processes the results of the 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that most changes in bacterial community occurred prior to filtration with ozonation having the greatest impact alpha diversity indices table s4 were found to increase after ozonation i e simpson evenness 0 75 raw 0 89 ozone shannon richness and evenness 3 02 raw 4 67 ozone chao1 richness 114 0 raw 219 6 ozone this observation can be attributed to the vulnerability of raw water organisms towards oxidation potential ozone tolerance of certain organisms and or presence of more growth promoting factors e g biodegradable carbon that allow a diverse group of organisms to proliferate after filtration alpha diversity decreased e g shannon filter effluent 1 19 and only a few types of bacteria dominate at the effluent with respect to beta diversity these effluent bacteria appeared to be different table s5 to those in the raw water bray curtis bc similarity 0 05 and bottom layer of the filter media bc similarity 0 48 but were very similar with bacteria at the top of the filter bed bc similarity 0 84 these results suggest that populations near the filter surface are more prone to sloughing shaping the biological quality of the filtrate the taxonomic differences contributing to the diversity differences above are described below the major bacterial taxa present in the samples are shown in fig 2 and summarized in table s6 wtp bf raw water was dominated by proteobacteria 55 and actinobacteria 35 consistent with the phyla commonly reported in drinking water systems lautenschlager et al 2014 li et al 2017 pinto et al 2012 actinobacteria however was found to be highly susceptible to ozone dose setpoint 0 90 mg l as shown in the decrease in relative abundance from 35 to 1 similar to those observed by li et al 2017 ozone could have also altered the substrate being utilized by actinobacteria leading to its decreased abundance in contrast ozonation had non lethal effects to the genus hydrogenophaga 9 flavobacterium phylum bacteroidetes 7 and other unknown proteobacteria 28 after coagulation flocculation hydrogenophaga 26 flavobacterium 5 and unknown proteobacteria 12 24 dominated the filter influent this trend appeared to carry over the filter surface suggesting that the filter influent seeds the bacteria colonizing the biofilters at the top of the filter media hydrogenophaga 28 and flavobacterium 42 outcompeted other organisms and growth was further promoted due to nutrient rich conditions i e aoc from ozonation and the biofilm support by the media filter depth was found to impact the microbial structure it was only at the bottom layer of the filter bed where hyphomicrobium 15 became abundant alphaproteobacteria like hyphomicrobium have been described to be competitive in low nutrient settings lautenschlager et al 2014 such as those in deep filter zones after filtration the effluent and uv treated waters consistently contained hydrogenophaga 42 52 and flavobacterium 29 50 which are also the genus most prominent at the filter surface biomass sloughing is therefore evident particularly for bacteria residing at the top of the filter bed no sequencing data was available for the chlorinated water sample due to low biomass concentrations i e insufficient dna in the extract the total bacterial concentrations in wtp bf water samples were also assessed using 16s rrna qpcr fig s3 raw water bacterial concentrations were observed to have 6 4 103 copies ml 1 6 103 cells ml assuming 4 gene copies cell median value in 11278 genomes center for microbial systems university of michigan 2017 due to potential dna extraction efficiency issues this value was lower than typical bacterial concentrations in source waters as measured by flow cytometry e g lake zurich 1 106 cells ml hammes et al 2008 after ozonation at a dose of 0 90 mg l o3 bacterial concentration decreased to 1 5 103 copies ml this concentration then doubles at the filter influent 3 0 103 copies ml possibly due to sloughing of bacteria that have grown in the walls of the floc basin in the absence of an oxidant the highest bacterial concentration was observed at the filter effluent 8 8 103 copies ml consistent with biomass sloughing as discussed above this concentration decreased to 3 8 103 copies ml after uv irradiation 40 mj cm2 which may be due to dna damage or dimerization preventing amplification only final chlorination eliminated viable bacteria in the water sample the qpcr results were also compared with catp measurements at wtp bf apparent catp of the water samples decreased as follows filter effluent raw coagulated uv ozone final cl2 these results agree well with the trend observed for qpcr plotting catp versus 16s rrna gene copies fig s4 resulted in a direct linear relationship r2 0 98 slope 3 5 10 6 ng atp 16s rrna gene copy demonstrating suitability of catp as a surrogate for total bacterial concentrations in water if each bacterial cell is assumed to have four 16s rrna gene copies the correlation above suggests that each cell has an estimated atp of 1 5 10 5 ng equivalent to 3 0 10 8 nmol atp cell which is 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than previously reported values deininger and lee 2001 hammes et al 2010 this overestimation could be due to a more efficient extraction of catp than dna for qpcr and varying counts of 16s rrna gene among different species in each sample using the catp assay biomass concentrations of water samples from wtp bf were compared to those obtained from wtp scl2 fig 3 at wtp scl2 the inhibitory effect of chlorine on biomass growth catp 2 ng l was apparent for the chlorinated coagulated water sample catp values remained barely detectable after filtration 1 1 ng l which is lower than the effluent of wtp bf 30 ng l the results suggest that sustained chlorine residuals inhibited colonization of the filter media and prevented subsequent sloughing from the filter biomass the suppressed biomass growth in disinfected filters was also observed in another full scale facility river mountains rm water treatment plant utilizing the same source water and treatment processes as wtp scl2 de vera et al 2018 similarly the presence of chlorine residuals in the anthracite filter influent 1 8 mg l and effluent 1 0 mg l at rmwtp led to non detectable effluent catp the constant exposure of the filter media to chlorine led to low filter bioactivity and presence of undibacterium like taxon 45 68 de vera et al 2018 which is a genus also found abundant in other chlorinated waters jia et al 2015 3 2 biomass production potentials to further elucidate the effect of these treatment steps on bacterial inactivation and recovery of process selected communities the use of catp was extended to determine the biomass production potentials bpp of water samples using indigenous bacteria identified previously as seed organisms for cbp14 3 2 1 biofiltration plant wtp bf cbp14 of wtp bf waters decreased as follows coagulation ozone filter effluent uv raw final chlorine fig 4 a see also fig s6 for the catp data highest cbp was observed for coagulated ozonated waters due to greater biodegradable organic carbon generated from organic matter oxidation this was confirmed from δdoc measurements after the 14 day incubation period fig s5 raw water doc remained the same while ozonated and coagulated waters had δdoc of 0 25 0 4 mgc l respectively equivalent to 10 16 of raw water doc while δdoc can be useful to indirectly assess regrowth of organisms this approach can be highly dependent on the analytical capabilities of a laboratory i e method detection limits catp measurement is more advantageous in this regard due to its high sensitivity to microbial growth despite minor changes in biodegradable doc slope 2 0 103 d ngatp mg doc fig s5 in addition other studies showed that biomass production is not solely dependent on carbon but also on other inorganic nutrients e g phosphorus in such cases catp can be used to capture dynamics of biomass concentrations resulting from a variety of growth limiting factors while δdoc would only apply to scenarios where growth depends on biodegradable carbon the effect of ozone on cbp was of great interest as a strong oxidant it was not surprising to observe low catp 2 ng l day 0 after ozonation that was designed to achieve 1 2 log cryptosporidium inactivation however after 3 days of incubation catp peaked to 153 ng l fig s6 suggesting that certain organisms could have survived and tolerated oxidative conditions resulting in abundant biomass production cbp14 1229 d ngatp l this cbp slightly increased at the filter influent fig 4a cbp14 1326 d ngatp l possibly due to a different set of bacteria table s6 that utilizes the biodegradable carbon from the ozone contactor and floc basin after coagulation flocculation the cbp14 was reduced by 30 during biofiltration cbp14 934 d ngatp l regrowth after biofiltration could be attributed to slowly biodegradable compounds utilized by the sloughed biomass in the effluent although cbp decreased after uv cbp14 772 d ngatp l regrowth was still observed despite dna damage by uv growth after uv irradiation may be caused by uv tolerance of certain organisms and or non optimized irradiation conditions in the reactor e g matrix absorbance significant inhibition of biomass production cbp14 7 6 d ngatp l was only achieved at the final chlorinated water sample due to chlorine disinfection ct 247 71 mg min l cl2 certain synergies could also exist with other upstream treatment processes for example previous studies demonstrated that sequential uv cl2 disinfection scheme was more effective in controlling suspended heterotrophic bacteria and e coli than without uv pre treatment dykstra et al 2007 rand et al 2008 these studies proposed that higher bacterial log reductions were achieved because cells become more susceptible to chlorine after uv irradiation 3 2 2 sustained chlorination plant wtp scl2 fig 4b shows the cbp of water samples obtained from wtp scl2 unlike those observed in the biofiltration plant biomass production at wtp scl2 was only observed at raw and ozonated water the cbp values for raw and ozonated waters at wtp scl2 were almost twice than wtp bf which can be explained by seasonal temperature differences consistent with a previous study van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 higher bioactivity was expected during summer wtp scl2 sampling may 2018 raw water temperature 15 4 c as opposed to winter wtp bf sampling february 2018 raw water temperature 11 2 c repeating bpp experiments in may 2018 15 8 c using raw ozonated and effluent water samples of wtp bf gave 2 2 4 times higher cbp values confirming the effect of sampling period on bioactivity table s8 nevertheless the cbp results were consistent in showing that highest biomass production is achieved after ozonation at wtp scl2 no increase in cbp was observed for the coagulated water filter effluent and final disinfected water this can be attributed to sustained disinfection by chlorine across the plant the chlorine added in the rapid mix chamber 2 mg l cl2 together with the coagulant carries over to the filter influent influent chlorine is then partially consumed by the filter e g demand caused by reactions with filtered particles having a residual of 1 7 mg l at the effluent the calculated filter loading chlorine ct standard deviation at this plant is equal to 197 41 mg min l additional ct 201 41 mg min l is credited at the final chlorine boosting step to maintain a residual of 1 7 mg l cl2 for distribution the sustained presence of chlorine across the plant resulted in an overall inhibition of microbial growth from the influent to the subsequent unit processes the use of pre ozonation 1 5 mg l o3 could have also contributed in this enhanced control for microbial growth previous studies showed synergistic effects with sequential ozonation and chlorination rennecker et al 2000 in this approach ozone causes microbial inactivation by first damaging the cell surface making the organisms vulnerable for intracellular attack by chlorine a study using e coli showed that ozone primarily attacks the cell wall components evident from release of proteins lipid peroxidation and change in cell permeability cho et al 2010 in contrast as a weaker oxidant experiments with chlorine demonstrated that it can diffuse through the cell wall and attack the inner cell components without severely damaging the cell surface cho et al 2010 the mechanisms described above combined with high chlorine ct 398 81 mg min l ensured controlled microbial growth after ozone chlorine treatment 3 2 3 carbon utilization by indigenous bacteria the effect of biodegradable organic carbon on biomass production was further confirmed by conducting experiments with increasing ozone doses quantifying consumption of known ozonation byproducts i e carboxylic acids and aldehydes and spiking model biodegradable compounds e g acetate dihaloacetic acids increasing the ozone dose resulted in increased cbp14 fig 5 a 2050 d ngatp l no ozone 2810 d ngatp l 1 mgo3 mgdoc due to production of more carbon substrate for indigenous bacteria ozonation of raw water from wtp scl2 at 1 mgo3 mgdoc generated 154 μg c l total carboxylic acids formate acetate and oxalate and 19 μg c l total aldehydes formaldehyde acetaldehyde propanal butanal hexanal day 0 fig 5b when the ozonated sample was subjected to the bpp test carboxylic acids were biodegraded much faster than aldehydes at day 2 of incubation 85 of the total carboxylic acids were consumed by the indigenous bacteria while aldehydes decreased by only 10 day 2 catp was at 2 ng l which rapidly increased to 100 ng l at day 4 complete consumption of carboxylic acids and aldehydes by the indigenous bacteria occurred at day 7 where catp peaked at 324 ng l beyond this period catp decreased day 14 catp 82 ng l indicating bacterial cell death due to starvation conditions the indigenous bacteria also responded proportionally to spiked biodegradable compounds fig 5c shows that utilization of 50 μg l acetate c resulted in a cbp14 of 950 d ngatp l which increased to 2852 d ngatp l when acetate was dosed at 300 μg c l plotting cbp14 versus acetate c concentrations gave a direct linear correlation r2 0 94 and a slope of 7 5 d ngatp μg acetate c this slope is within the range of cbp14 aoc ratio 6 5 10 6 d ngatp μg acetate c equivalents reported in the study by van der kooij et al 2017 the observed atp response to biodegradable c of 300 μg l confirmed the sensitivity of the bpp assay even to small changes in available substrate raw water samples from wtp bf were also spiked with acetate but at higher concentrations 500 and 1200 μg c l fig s7 as expected cbp14 increased with increasing acetate c raw 500 μg c l 3639 345 d ngatp l raw 1200 μg c l 4806 201 d ngatp l in a separate experiment dihaloacetic acids dhaa were added as a model biodegradable pollutant to raw and filter effluent samples of wtp bf fig 5d dhaas were consumed by the indigenous bacteria at different rates depending on the water type faster dhaa biodegradation was observed at the filter effluent 7 days compared to using raw water 14 days the cbp14 for these samples was at the same order of magnitude raw water 1423 76 d ngatp l filtered water 1141 2 d ngatp l suggesting that removal of a specific compound is more influenced by the type of microbial community than the extent of biomass production since dhaas are known to be degraded by filter biomass grigorescu and hozalski 2010 zhang et al 2009 the higher degree of dhaa removal at the effluent can be ascribed to the sloughed bacteria from wtp bf biofilters some species of flavobacterium see section 3 1 have been reported to degrade chlorinated organic compounds rasul chaudhry and chapalamadugu 1991 3 3 online atp monitoring for bpp testing previous studies raised concerns about limitations of atp monitoring for assessing regrowth potential as key features of bacterial cell growth e g catp peak might be missed with less frequent atp analyses farhat et al 2018 to address this we demonstrated an online atp method for continuous catp determination the results of the online atp analyses 6 h interval fig 6 agreed well with the results obtained from discrete atp measurements raw water acetate ozonated water raw water final chlorinated water providing a proof of concept that biomass production can be successfully monitored using an online automated approach again the final chlorinated water sample from wtp scl2 did not promote biomass growth as much as the raw water spiked with acetate and ozonated water the difference in occurrence of catp peak between raw acetate and ozonated samples may be caused by the type of organisms present in the samples ozone could have killed off strains of bacteria that are rapid consumers of acetate communities that survived oxidation then utilized the ozonation byproducts but required more time to establish 4 days as shown in the delayed catp peak during the 6 day test period the online atp analyzer generated well defined catp curves lag phase exponential phase catp peak and stationary phases that can differentiate various water samples the method was also able to capture the rapid spike in atp when a simple carbon like acetate was added showing the sensitivity of the method to sudden changes in biomass production integrating the area under the continuous catp curve thus provides more accurate cbp values avoiding under over estimation that is commonly encountered with offline catp monitoring 3 4 implications this work highlights the changes in microbiological characteristics and biomass production potentials brought about by each unit treatment process sustained chlorination and possible synergies with other upstream processes were found useful in ensuring minimal cbp at the final treated water for plants without intermediate chlorination the biofilter effluent showed the highest total bacterial concentrations due to biomass sloughing as shown in this study these bacteria may subsequently promote biomass production downstream bacterial growth after oxidation chlorine ozone uv monochloramine warrants further investigation to confirm tolerance of certain populations towards oxidants and understand the factors and mechanisms leading to their survival characteristics of these surviving populations should be studied especially in the context of pathogen proliferation the complete inactivation of indigenous bacteria by chlorine resulted in having biostable waters even in presence of nutrients and growth substrate e g aoc fig s8 shows the historical aoc data of finished waters in wtp scl2 580 632 μg l and wtp bf 489 μg l due to bioactivity in wtp bf filters lower aoc was observed at wtp bf than at wtp scl2 employing conventional chlorinated filtration in both plants no regrowth was observed in the finished waters despite aoc values that are well above the recommended aoc threshold of 120 μg l and 180 μg l for chlorinated and chloraminated systems respectively lechevallier et al 2015 these results suggest that the presence of high aoc may not be representative of regrowth especially for utilities that implement secondary disinfection with chlorine e g united states limiting aoc for regrowth control is particularly important in countries without residual disinfection e g europe due to presence of viable biomass in their system a study in netherlands for example reported that slow sand filtrates with aoc 50 μg l can have cbp14 of 200 d ngatp l van der kooij et al 2017 in the current study final chlorinated waters only had cbp14 6 8 d ngatp l despite elevated aoc levels this study systematically investigates microbial dynamics in full scale treatment plants using an integrated approach that explores bacterial composition and diversity 16s rrna gene sequencing abundance qpcr viability catp offline and online and growth promotion involving natural bacterial community biodegradable c monitoring bpp tests the direct on site catp measurement and the online atp method can be useful for rapid assessment of viable biomass and impact of each unit process on bacterial abundance as a bulk water parameter it offers a more accurate way to assess bacterial viability than surrogate parameters e g uv absorbance fluorescence turbidity particle counts which may lack sensitivity and suffer from interferences from the matrix components with more data collection catp can be incorporated in hydrologic models to better understand microbial dynamics in the water network it can further serve as a good early warning parameter to signal heightened biological activity prompting immediate corrective actions and further investigations of contamination sources bioactivity hotspots and biofouling in the distribution system in addition the bpp method can complement methods such as flow cytometry farhat et al 2018 microbial fuel cell based biosensors elmekawy et al 2017 and the time consuming cultivation based techniques e g hpc coliforms aoc van der kooij and van der wielen 2014 it further addresses the limitations of the widely used aoc method such as use of pure strains that may not be representative of the natural community underutilization of potential substrates in water used by those strains inability to capture autotrophic growth and organic matter alterations due to sample preparation e g pasteurization prest et al 2016 van der kooij et al 2017 the assay also considers the complex factors affecting microbial growth of a specific water source that may not be achieved using indirect predictive approaches e g nutrient monitoring thus the bpp method can provide a more accurate description of the growth potential of the indigenous bacteria that can guide treatment engineers in selecting adequate treatment and improving current processes 4 conclusions this study investigated the microbial characteristics and biomass production from water samples of two full scale treatment plants the associated effects of treatment processes ozonation filtration chlorination on the microbiological quality of the treated waters abundance viability composition growth promotion were investigated using 16s rrna gene sequencing qpcr intracellular atp and analysis of biodegradable organic carbon and biomass production potentials the following conclusions can be drawn from this study direct on site intracellular atp measurements of indigenous bacteria were useful in monitoring biomass concentrations of water samples treatment processes shape the microbial community within the treatment plants abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes increased after ozonation and dominated the biofilter media and filter effluent cumulative biomass production of water samples using the indigenous bacteria identified via 16s rrna gene sequencing is greatly influenced by the type of treatment process highest cbp was observed after ozonation which increased with increasing ozone dose and biodegradable carbon e g carboxylic acids aldehydes the differences in seed bacteria for cbp14 testing demonstrate the role of unit processes not only for production of bioavailable carbon but also

biofiltration 1 introduction strategies for controlling microbial growth in distributions systems vary globally to protect public health against waterborne pathogens in some european countries where use of oxidant residuals are less common source water protection and advanced multibarrier treatment are strictly practiced to minimize the amount of biodegradable organic carbon entering the distribution system preventing growth of organisms in case of insufficient inactivation or regrowth due to inappropriate plumbing materials prest et al 2016 semenza and menne 2009 van der kooij and van der wielen 2014 the united states environmental protection agency usepa on the other hand requires systems using surface waters to have greater than 0 2 mg l of chlorine at the point of entry and a detectable residual in the distribution system us epa 1999 in either case the amount of biodegradable organic carbon must be properly measured and managed to minimize the risk of biofouling in the distribution system rosario ortiz et al 2016 water utilities aim to achieve biological stability throughout the water network biological stability refers to a condition where drinking water does not promote changes in bacterial concentration and composition prest et al 2016 rittmann and snoeyink 1984 a biostable water would have the same microbial quality in the distribution system and the consumers taps as the water coming out of the treatment facility prest et al 2016 several variables may impact biostability including changing seasons and high temperature e g drought during water main breaks diminished oxidant residuals increased nutrient loading from runoff events and fluctuating hydraulic conditions e g stagnation biofilm detachment prest et al 2016 van der kooij and van der wielen 2014 to meet bacteriological water quality standards in distribution systems water utilities monitor residual disinfectants in addition to total coliforms and e coli according to the revised total coliform rule which aims to prevent incidences of fecal contamination and exposure to waterborne pathogens us epa 2013 if the system is more vulnerable to contamination e g absence of chlorine residuals additional assessments are performed and corrective actions are required to assess the potential of water to grow heterotrophic bacteria several studies proposed measuring growth limiting constituents such as inorganic nutrients e g phosphorus and nitrogen and assimilable organic carbon aoc and biodegradable organic carbon bdoc formed from oxidation of natural organic matter hammes et al 2006 yavich et al 2004 van der kooij et al 1989 demonstrated that biostable waters should not have aoc greater than 10 μg l others have reported regrowth concerns reported as coliform occurrence with 50 μg l aoc lechevallier et al 1991 recently lechevallier et al 2015 recommended a threshold value of 120 μg l aoc 1 8 mg l dissolved organic carbon doc and 0 8 mg l phosphate as practical indicators of biostability for chlorinated systems in terms of bdoc niquette et al 2001 showed that a value 0 25 mg l bdoc at the outlet of the plant would be sufficient to limit bacterial growth in distribution systems others recommended to limit bdoc to less than 0 15 mg l to have biologically stable waters van der kooij and van der wielen 2014 these methods however rely on certain bacterial strains e g aoc p fluorescens p17 and spirillum nox table s1 and seed bacteria e g bdoc bacteria fixed on sand that may not be representative of the indigenous organisms present in the actual water sample van der kooij and van der wielen 2014 other methods for biostability have therefore focused on direct measurements of growth of indigenous bacteria i e adenosine triphosphate atp flow cytometry fcm cell counts following nutrient addition and incubation atp has received significant attention in recent years due to its simplicity and fast analysis time delahaye et al 2003 hammes et al 2010 van der kooij et al 2017 it can serve as a suitable surrogate for bulk viable biomass as evident from its good correlation with aoc van der kooij et al 2017 and intact cell counts hammes et al 2010 nescerecka et al 2014 a recent study of van der kooij et al 2017 employed periodic atp measurements to determine biomass production potentials bpp in water supplies in netherlands employing slow sand filtration that study involved direct incubation 25 c of water samples with nitrogen and phosphorus and subsequent measurement of cumulative atp concentrations farhat et al 2018 also proposed a bacterial growth potential assay based on fcm and atp measurements after inoculating various samples e g non chlorinated tap waters seawater river water wastewater effluent with indigenous bacterial community upstream treatment processes have a direct influence over the resulting microbial quality of treated waters pinto et al 2012 for example ozonation can inactivate organisms while also producing biodegradable compounds from its reaction with organic matter von sonntag and von gunten 2012 biofilters which are primarily applied to control biodegradable carbon and prevent regrowth urfer et al 1997 can leak certain organisms affecting the effluent quality pinto et al 2012 and possibly acting as seed bacteria for regrowth downstream uv treatment can induce bacteria into its dormant state which can later revive and proliferate zhang et al 2015 as a final barrier disinfection by chlorine is widely used however similar to other oxidants chlorine oxidation can increase aoc van der kooij 2003 some organisms e g gram positive bacteria were also found to survive after chlorination norton and lechevallier 2000 and combined with aoc could promote bacterial growth with non optimized chlorine dose regrowth might occur due to fast chlorine decay and diminished ability to inactivate microorganisms lechevallier et al 1996 nescerecka et al 2014 all these scenarios suggest the need to investigate the response of microorganisms with various upstream treatment and disinfection processes ensuring that bacterial growth is suppressed within the facility is an important step towards a more biostable drinking water quality this study aims to determine synergies that exist among unit treatment processes i e ozonation chlorination and biofiltration with respect to

the schematic diagram of the set up is shown in fig s3 the online atp method is based on the chemiluminescent reaction using luciferin and luciferase i e complying with astm d4012 81 and was applied to operate in batch mode to measure atp changes in water samples every 6 h the instrument ez atp microbial load atp analyzer applitek hach usa was calibrated using atp free tris hcl buffer and 200 pg

quantity activity and diversity of indigenous bacteria in the biofiltration plant wtp bf were investigated following varying levels and types of disinfection processes the results of the 16s rrna gene

ozonation i e simpson evenness 0 75 raw 0 89 ozone shannon richness and evenness 3 02 raw 4 67 ozone chao1 richness 114 0 raw 219 6 ozone this observation can be attributed to the vulnerability of raw water organisms towards oxidation potential ozone tolerance of certain organisms and or presence of more growth promoting factors e g biodegradable carbon that allow a diverse group of organisms to proliferate after filtration alpha diversity decreased e g shannon filter effluent 1 19 and only a few types of bacteria dominate at the effluent with respect to beta diversity these effluent bacteria appeared to be different table s5 to those in the raw water bray curtis bc similarity 0 05 and bottom layer of the filter media bc similarity 0 48 but were very similar with bacteria at the top of the filter bed bc similarity 0 84 these results suggest that populations near the filter surface are more prone to sloughing shaping the biological quality of the filtrate the taxonomic differences contributing to the diversity differences above are described below the major bacterial taxa present in the samples are shown in fig 2 and summarized in table s6 wtp bf raw water was dominated by proteobacteria 55 and actinobacteria 35 consistent with the phyla commonly reported in drinking water systems lautenschlager et al 2014 li et al 2017 pinto et al 2012 actinobacteria however was found to be highly susceptible to ozone dose setpoint 0 90 mg l as shown in the decrease in relative abundance from 35 to 1 similar to those observed by li et al 2017 ozone could have also altered the substrate being utilized by actinobacteria leading to its decreased abundance in contrast ozonation had non lethal effects to the genus hydrogenophaga 9 flavobacterium phylum bacteroidetes 7 and other unknown proteobacteria 28 after coagulation flocculation hydrogenophaga 26 flavobacterium 5 and unknown proteobacteria 12 24 dominated the filter influent this trend appeared to carry over the filter surface suggesting that the filter influent seeds the bacteria colonizing the biofilters at the top of the filter media hydrogenophaga 28 and flavobacterium 42 outcompeted other organisms and growth was further promoted due to nutrient rich conditions i e aoc from ozonation and the biofilm support by the media filter depth was found to impact the microbial structure it was only at the bottom layer of the filter bed where hyphomicrobium 15 became abundant alphaproteobacteria like hyphomicrobium have been described to be competitive in low nutrient settings lautenschlager et al 2014 such as those in deep filter zones after filtration the effluent and uv treated waters consistently contained hydrogenophaga 42 52 and flavobacterium 29 50 which are also the genus most prominent at the filter surface biomass sloughing is therefore evident particularly for bacteria residing at the top of the filter bed no sequencing data was available for the chlorinated water sample due to low biomass concentrations i e insufficient dna in the extract the total bacterial concentrations in wtp bf water samples were also assessed using 16s rrna qpcr fig s3 raw water bacterial concentrations were observed to have 6 4 103 copies ml 1 6 103 cells ml assuming 4 gene copies cell median value in 11278 genomes center for microbial systems university of michigan 2017 due to potential dna extraction efficiency issues this value was lower than typical bacterial concentrations in source waters as measured by flow cytometry e g lake zurich 1 106 cells ml hammes et al 2008 after ozonation at a dose of 0 90 mg l o3 bacterial concentration decreased to 1 5 103 copies ml this concentration then doubles at the filter influent 3 0 103 copies ml possibly due to sloughing of bacteria that have grown in the walls of the floc basin in the absence of an oxidant the highest bacterial concentration was observed at the filter effluent 8 8 103 copies ml consistent with biomass sloughing as discussed above this concentration decreased to 3 8 103 copies ml after uv irradiation 40 mj cm2 which may be due to dna damage or dimerization preventing amplification only final chlorination eliminated viable bacteria in the water sample the qpcr results were also compared with catp measurements at wtp bf apparent catp of the water samples decreased as follows filter effluent raw coagulated uv ozone final cl2 these results agree well with the trend observed for qpcr plotting catp versus 16s rrna gene copies fig s4 resulted in a direct linear relationship r2 0 98 slope 3 5 10 6 ng atp 16s rrna gene copy demonstrating suitability of catp as a surrogate for total bacterial concentrations in water if each bacterial cell is assumed to have four 16s rrna gene copies the correlation above suggests that each cell has an estimated atp of 1 5 10 5 ng equivalent to 3 0 10 8 nmol atp cell which is 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than previously reported values deininger and lee 2001 hammes et al 2010 this overestimation could be due to a more efficient extraction of catp than dna for qpcr and varying counts of 16s rrna gene among different species in each sample using the catp assay biomass concentrations of water samples from wtp bf were compared to those obtained from wtp scl2 fig 3 at wtp scl2 the inhibitory effect of chlorine on biomass growth catp 2 ng l was apparent for the chlorinated coagulated water sample catp values remained barely detectable after filtration 1 1 ng l which is lower than the effluent of wtp bf 30 ng l the results suggest that sustained chlorine residuals inhibited colonization of the filter media and prevented subsequent sloughing from the filter biomass the suppressed biomass growth in disinfected filters was also observed in another full scale facility river mountains rm water treatment plant utilizing the same source water and treatment processes as wtp scl2 de vera et al 2018 similarly the presence of chlorine residuals in the anthracite filter influent 1 8 mg l and effluent 1 0 mg l at rmwtp led to non detectable effluent catp the constant exposure of the filter media to chlorine led to low filter bioactivity and presence of undibacterium like taxon 45 68 de vera et al 2018 which is a genus also found abundant in other chlorinated waters jia et al 2015 3 2 biomass production potentials to further elucidate the effect of these treatment steps on bacterial inactivation and recovery of process selected communities the use of catp was extended to determine the biomass production potentials bpp of water samples using indigenous bacteria identified previously as seed organisms for cbp14 3 2 1 biofiltration plant wtp bf cbp14 of wtp bf waters decreased as follows coagulation ozone filter effluent uv raw final chlorine fig 4 a see also fig s6 for the catp data highest cbp was observed for coagulated ozonated waters due to greater biodegradable organic carbon generated from organic matter oxidation this was confirmed from δdoc measurements after the 14 day incubation period fig s5 raw water doc remained the same while ozonated and coagulated waters had δdoc of 0 25 0 4 mgc l respectively equivalent to 10 16 of raw water doc while δdoc can be useful to indirectly assess regrowth of organisms this approach can be highly dependent on the analytical capabilities of a laboratory i e method detection limits catp measurement is more advantageous in this regard due to its high sensitivity to microbial growth despite minor changes in biodegradable doc slope 2 0 103 d ngatp mg doc fig s5 in addition other studies showed that biomass production is not solely dependent on carbon but also on other inorganic nutrients e g phosphorus in such cases catp can be used to capture dynamics of biomass concentrations resulting from a variety of growth limiting factors while δdoc would only apply to scenarios where growth depends on biodegradable carbon the effect of ozone on cbp was of great interest as a strong oxidant it was not surprising to observe low catp 2 ng l day 0 after ozonation that was designed to achieve 1 2 log cryptosporidium inactivation however after 3 days of incubation catp peaked to 153 ng l fig s6 suggesting that certain organisms could have survived and tolerated oxidative conditions resulting in abundant biomass production cbp14 1229 d ngatp l this cbp slightly increased at the filter influent fig 4a cbp14 1326 d ngatp l possibly due to a different set of bacteria table s6 that utilizes the biodegradable carbon from the ozone contactor and floc basin after coagulation flocculation the cbp14 was reduced by 30 during biofiltration cbp14 934 d ngatp l regrowth after biofiltration could be attributed to slowly biodegradable compounds utilized by the sloughed biomass in the effluent although cbp decreased after uv cbp14 772 d ngatp l regrowth was still observed despite dna damage by uv growth after uv irradiation may be caused by uv tolerance of certain organisms and or non optimized irradiation conditions in the reactor e g matrix absorbance significant inhibition of biomass production cbp14 7 6 d ngatp l was only achieved at the final chlorinated water sample due to chlorine disinfection ct 247 71 mg min l cl2 certain synergies could also exist with other upstream treatment processes for example previous studies demonstrated that sequential uv cl2 disinfection scheme was more effective in controlling suspended heterotrophic bacteria and e coli than without uv pre treatment dykstra et al 2007 rand et al 2008 these studies proposed that higher bacterial log reductions were achieved because cells become more susceptible to chlorine after uv irradiation 3 2 2 sustained chlorination plant wtp scl2 fig 4b shows the cbp of water samples obtained from wtp scl2 unlike those observed in the biofiltration plant biomass production at wtp scl2 was only observed at raw and ozonated water the cbp values for raw and ozonated waters at wtp scl2 were almost twice than wtp bf which can be explained by seasonal temperature differences consistent with a previous study van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 higher bioactivity was expected during summer wtp scl2 sampling may 2018 raw water temperature 15 4 c as opposed to winter wtp bf sampling february 2018 raw water temperature 11 2 c repeating bpp experiments in may 2018 15 8 c using raw ozonated and effluent water samples of wtp bf gave 2 2 4 times higher cbp values confirming the effect of sampling period on bioactivity table s8 nevertheless the cbp results were consistent in showing that highest biomass production is achieved after ozonation at wtp scl2 no increase in cbp was observed for the coagulated water filter effluent and final disinfected water this can be attributed to sustained disinfection by chlorine across the plant the chlorine added in the rapid mix chamber 2 mg l cl2 together with the coagulant carries over to the filter influent influent chlorine is then partially consumed by the filter e g demand caused by reactions with filtered particles having a residual of 1 7 mg l at the effluent the calculated filter loading chlorine ct standard deviation at this plant is equal to 197 41 mg min l additional ct 201 41 mg min l is credited at the final chlorine boosting step to maintain a residual of 1 7 mg l cl2 for distribution the sustained presence of chlorine across the plant resulted in an overall inhibition of microbial growth from the influent to the subsequent unit processes the use of pre ozonation 1 5 mg l o3 could have also contributed in this enhanced control for microbial growth previous studies showed synergistic effects with sequential ozonation and chlorination rennecker et al 2000 in this approach ozone causes microbial inactivation by first damaging the cell surface making the organisms vulnerable for intracellular attack by chlorine a study using e coli showed that ozone primarily attacks the cell wall components evident from release of proteins lipid peroxidation and change in cell permeability cho et al 2010 in contrast as a weaker oxidant experiments with chlorine demonstrated that it can diffuse through the cell wall and attack the inner cell components without severely damaging the cell surface cho et al 2010 the mechanisms described above combined with high chlorine ct 398 81 mg min l ensured controlled microbial growth after ozone chlorine treatment 3 2 3 carbon utilization by indigenous bacteria the effect of biodegradable organic carbon on biomass production was further confirmed by conducting experiments with increasing ozone doses quantifying consumption of known ozonation byproducts i e carboxylic acids and aldehydes and spiking model biodegradable compounds e g acetate dihaloacetic acids increasing the ozone dose resulted in increased cbp14 fig 5 a 2050 d ngatp l no ozone 2810 d ngatp l 1 mgo3 mgdoc due to production of more carbon substrate for indigenous bacteria ozonation of raw water from wtp scl2 at 1 mgo3 mgdoc generated 154 μg c l total carboxylic acids formate acetate and oxalate and 19 μg c l total aldehydes formaldehyde acetaldehyde propanal butanal hexanal day 0 fig 5b when the ozonated sample was subjected to the bpp test carboxylic acids were biodegraded much faster than aldehydes at day 2 of incubation 85 of the total carboxylic acids were consumed by the indigenous bacteria while aldehydes decreased by only 10 day 2 catp was at 2 ng l which rapidly increased to 100 ng l at day 4 complete consumption of carboxylic acids and aldehydes by the indigenous bacteria occurred at day 7 where catp peaked at 324 ng l beyond this period catp decreased day 14 catp 82 ng l indicating bacterial cell death due to starvation conditions the indigenous bacteria also responded proportionally to spiked biodegradable compounds fig 5c shows that utilization of 50 μg l acetate c resulted in a cbp14 of 950 d ngatp l which increased to 2852 d ngatp l when acetate was dosed at 300 μg c l plotting cbp14 versus acetate c concentrations gave a direct linear correlation r2 0 94 and a slope of 7 5 d ngatp μg acetate c this slope is within the range of cbp14 aoc ratio 6 5 10 6 d ngatp μg acetate c equivalents reported in the study by van der kooij et al 2017 the observed atp response to biodegradable c of 300 μg l confirmed the sensitivity of the bpp assay even to small changes in available substrate raw water samples from wtp bf were also spiked with acetate but at higher concentrations 500 and 1200 μg c l fig s7 as expected cbp14 increased with increasing acetate c raw 500 μg c l 3639 345 d ngatp l raw 1200 μg c l 4806 201 d ngatp l in a separate experiment dihaloacetic acids dhaa were added as a model biodegradable pollutant to raw and filter effluent samples of wtp bf fig 5d dhaas were consumed by the indigenous bacteria at different rates depending on the water type faster dhaa biodegradation was observed at the filter effluent 7 days compared to using raw water 14 days the cbp14 for these samples was at the same order of magnitude raw water 1423 76 d ngatp l filtered water 1141 2 d ngatp l suggesting that removal of a specific compound is more influenced by the type of microbial community than the extent of biomass production since dhaas are known to be degraded by filter biomass grigorescu and hozalski 2010 zhang et al 2009 the higher degree of dhaa removal at the effluent can be ascribed to the sloughed bacteria from wtp bf biofilters some species of flavobacterium see section 3 1 have been reported to degrade chlorinated organic compounds rasul chaudhry and chapalamadugu 1991 3 3 online atp monitoring for bpp testing previous studies raised concerns about limitations of atp monitoring for assessing regrowth potential as key features of bacterial cell growth e g catp peak might be missed with less frequent atp analyses farhat et al 2018 to address this we demonstrated an online atp method for continuous catp determination the results of the online atp analyses 6 h interval fig 6 agreed well with the results obtained from discrete atp measurements raw water acetate ozonated water raw water final chlorinated water providing a proof of concept that biomass production can be successfully monitored using an online automated approach again the final chlorinated water sample from wtp scl2 did not promote biomass growth as much as the raw water spiked with acetate and ozonated water the difference in occurrence of catp peak between raw acetate and ozonated samples may be caused by the type of organisms present in the samples ozone could have killed off strains of bacteria that are rapid consumers of acetate communities that survived oxidation then utilized the ozonation byproducts but required more time to establish 4 days as shown in the delayed catp peak during the 6 day test period the online atp analyzer generated well defined catp curves lag phase exponential phase catp peak and stationary phases that can differentiate various water samples the method was also able to capture the rapid spike in atp when a simple carbon like acetate was added showing the sensitivity of the method to sudden changes in biomass production integrating the area under the continuous catp curve thus provides more accurate cbp values avoiding under over estimation that is commonly encountered with offline catp monitoring 3 4 implications this work highlights the changes in microbiological characteristics and biomass production potentials brought about by each unit treatment process sustained chlorination and possible synergies with other upstream processes were found useful in ensuring minimal cbp at the final treated water for plants without intermediate chlorination the biofilter effluent showed the highest total bacterial concentrations due to biomass sloughing as shown in this study these bacteria may subsequently promote biomass production downstream bacterial growth after oxidation chlorine ozone uv monochloramine warrants further investigation to confirm tolerance of certain populations towards oxidants and understand the factors and mechanisms leading to their survival characteristics of these surviving populations should be studied especially in the context of pathogen proliferation the complete inactivation of indigenous bacteria by chlorine resulted in having biostable waters even in presence of nutrients and growth substrate e g aoc fig s8 shows the historical aoc data of finished waters in wtp scl2 580 632 μg l and wtp bf 489 μg l due to bioactivity in wtp bf filters lower aoc was observed at wtp bf than at wtp scl2 employing conventional chlorinated filtration in both plants no regrowth was observed in the finished waters despite aoc values that are well above the recommended aoc threshold of 120 μg l and 180 μg l for chlorinated and chloraminated systems respectively lechevallier et al 2015 these results suggest that the presence of high aoc may not be representative of regrowth especially for utilities that implement secondary disinfection with chlorine e g united states limiting aoc for regrowth control is particularly important in countries without residual disinfection e g europe due to presence of viable biomass in their system a study in netherlands for example reported that slow sand filtrates with aoc 50 μg l can have cbp14 of 200 d ngatp l van der kooij et al 2017 in the current study final chlorinated waters only had cbp14 6 8 d ngatp l despite elevated aoc levels this study systematically investigates microbial dynamics in full scale treatment plants using an integrated approach that explores bacterial composition and diversity 16s rrna gene sequencing abundance qpcr viability catp offline and online and growth promotion involving natural bacterial community biodegradable c monitoring bpp tests the direct on site catp measurement and the online atp method can be useful for rapid assessment of viable biomass and impact of each unit process on bacterial abundance as a bulk water parameter it offers a more accurate way to assess bacterial viability than surrogate parameters e g uv absorbance fluorescence turbidity particle counts which may lack sensitivity and suffer from interferences from the matrix components with more data collection catp can be incorporated in hydrologic models to better understand microbial dynamics in the water network it can further serve as a good early warning parameter to signal heightened biological activity prompting immediate corrective actions and further investigations of contamination sources bioactivity hotspots and biofouling in the distribution system in addition the bpp method can complement methods such as flow cytometry farhat et al 2018 microbial fuel cell based biosensors elmekawy et al 2017 and the time consuming cultivation based techniques e g hpc coliforms aoc van der kooij and van der wielen 2014 it further addresses the limitations of the widely used aoc method such as use of pure strains that may not be representative of the natural community underutilization of potential substrates in water used by those strains inability to capture autotrophic growth and organic matter alterations due to sample preparation e g pasteurization prest et al 2016 van der kooij et al 2017 the assay also considers the complex factors affecting microbial growth of a specific water source that may not be achieved using indirect predictive approaches e g nutrient monitoring thus the bpp method can provide a more accurate description of the growth potential of the indigenous bacteria that can guide treatment engineers in selecting adequate treatment and improving current processes 4 conclusions this study investigated the microbial characteristics and biomass production from water samples of two full scale treatment plants the associated effects of treatment processes ozonation filtration chlorination on the microbiological quality of the treated waters abundance viability composition growth promotion were investigated using 16s rrna gene sequencing qpcr intracellular atp and analysis of biodegradable organic carbon and biomass production potentials the following conclusions can be drawn from this study direct on site intracellular atp measurements of indigenous bacteria were useful in monitoring biomass concentrations of water samples treatment processes shape the microbial community within the treatment plants abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes increased after ozonation and dominated the biofilter media and filter effluent cumulative biomass production of water samples using the indigenous bacteria identified via 16s rrna gene sequencing is greatly influenced by the type of treatment process highest cbp was observed after ozonation which increased with increasing ozone dose and biodegradable carbon e g carboxylic acids aldehydes the differences in seed bacteria for cbp14 testing demonstrate the role of unit processes not only for production of bioavailable carbon but also for bacterial selection biofiltration alone did not prevent bacterial regrowth as shown in the results from wtp bf biofiltration may therefore be more important to utilities where carbon limitation is used to control regrowth e g netherlands versus utilities that implement residual disinfection with chlorine e g united states an online atp approach confirmed results from discrete atp measurements

18996,we examined the relationship between downstream algal growth potential and the spatial environmental factors of both upland areas and stream buffer zones using spatial analysis and generalized additive models gams the models employed site representative concentrations of chlorophyll a chl a from a total of 688 national water quality monitoring stations and the spatial factors of the corresponding 688 watersheds the spatial environmental factors included topography climate land use class soil type and proximity of the monitoring station to the weir downstream and wastewater treatment plants wwtps the explanatory power adjusted r2 or radj 2 of the models was used to compare different spatial influential scales defined by stream buffers and upstream circular buffers the spatial environmental factors of the entire watershed area better explained the inter station variation in chl a than did those of the stream buffer and or upstream circular buffer areas however the spatial environmental factors of watershed areas more than 25 km upstream circular buffer zones had only minor influence on the explainability of the models with regards to the inter station variation in chl a levels generally land use patterns were more strongly related to the inter station chl a variation than were point sources of pollutants such as wwtps the two most influencing land uses on the inter station chl a variation were urban and agricultural land uses with varying relative contributions depending on the spatial influential scale in general relative contribution of urban land use was larger at a larger spatial influential scale while that of agricultural land use showed an opposite trend in addition the proximity to the weir downstream explained high chl a concentrations in the stream water relative importance and causal effects of the spatial environmental variables to instream chl a were established based on this national scale correlative analysis leading to decision making with the goal of controlling instream algal growth graphical abstract image 1 keywords chlorophyll a land use soil taxonomy watershed geographic information system generalized additive model 1 introduction algal blooms have been of increasing concern worldwide due to climate change and the increase in anthropogenic nutrients in water bodies o neil et al 2012 paerl and otten 2013 in many countries including usa france italy the uk and china social and environmental problems caused by algal blooms in coastal and inland waters have also been reported hellio et al 2004 viaroli et al 2005 scanlan et al 2007 zubia et al 2009 liu et al 2010 perrot et al 2014 harke et al 2016 in south korea sixteen instream weirs were constructed along the four major national rivers in 2012 as part of the national river restoration project aiming at flood control and water utilization as a consequence there have been an increasing number of episodic algal bloom events in the four major national rivers after weir construction due to the increased hydraulic residence time of the rivers with the prolonged dry period during summer and autumn seasons srivastava et al 2015 kme 2015 while algal growth in water bodies is a natural phenomenon the high biomass resulting from excessive growth of algae is of major concern backer 2002 excessive algal growth is usually accompanied by a reduction in the diversity of algae due to the dominance of a few harmful algal species and cyanobacteria heisler et al 2008 anderson et al 2012 in particular the excess growth of harmful algae has numerous impacts on the environment the mass mortality of wild and farmed fish and shellfish the death and illness of humans caused by toxic seafood unclean drinking water and irrigation water contamination the death and illness of marine mammals seabirds and other animals and changes in trophic structure within water bodies anderson et al 2002 algal blooms also increase the turbidity of the water and restrict light penetration into the waterbody negatively affecting the underwater habitats of benthic flora and fauna paolo and laura 2014 while also degrading aesthetics and leading to taste and odor problems in drinking water algal growth in water bodies is dependent upon internal factors such as the chemical compositions of the water nutrient cycles and availability abundance of herbivore community hydrologic disturbances water temperature and light availability munn et al 2010 elliott 2010 riseng et al 2004 xie et al 2012 large scale regional factors such as climate conditions external nutrient loadings and characteristics of the watershed can also affect algal production and biomass biggs 1995 leland et al 2000 urrea clos et al 2014 woelmer et al 2016 a growing number of studies have sought to link watershed characteristics and algal biomass e g chlorophyll a in downstream water bodies because watershed characteristics such as land use patterns can be more easily manipulated by managers than internal factors or other external influences such as climate variables woelmer et al 2016 the identification of the environmental drivers of algal growth is generally considered an important task in the management of water quality and process based or empirical models based around statistical methods can be used to do this task process based models enable precise cause and effect relationships to be identified but they typically require significant computational resources and are inherently limited in terms of describing complex natural phenomena this is because in a process based model the parameterization process that links the model to field data can be time consuming and expensive and often the direct measurement of these parameters is impossible decreasing the reliability of the model s results demeritt and wainwrite 2009 in contrast empirical methods provide a way to search for patterns in large data sets and have often been preferred as an initial approach to the understanding of the causal effects involved in algal blooms empirical models allow hypotheses that explain the patterns found in the data to be generated and their implications to be discussed demeritt and wainwrite 2009 shiffrin 2016 empirical statistical methods have been widely used to build relationships between watershed characteristics such as land use patterns and algal biomass in downstream water bodies many regional studies reported positive correlations of algal biomass with agricultural land use brett et al 2005 migliaccio et al 2007 munn et al 2010 and urban land use liu et al 2011 ding et al 2015 knoll et al 2015 some studies failed to detect statistical correlation of agricultural land use with downstream algal biomass due to interference from external factors such as wind over shallow lakes in upland areas ma et al 2016 or stronger influence of urban areas siliva and williams 2001 ding et al 2015 negative correlations between forest land use and algal biomass is a common finding in past research because areas covered by forest or vegetation can delay or attenuate nutrient transport into receiving waters decreasing algal growth potential downstream thomas et al 2004 mori et al 2015 the influences of watershed characteristics on the downstream water quality can be dependent on spatial scale land use patterns at local scales 500 1000 m such as stream buffer areas or radial buffer regions often better explain downstream nutrient concentrations or algal biomass than those at the watershed scale johnson et al 1997 busse et al 2006 klose et al 2012 the local effects of land use patterns on nutrients and algal biomass in the downstream water bodies can be enhanced during dry seasons with low delivery efficiency of nutrients due to low flows or when the point sources dominate flows klose et al 2012 urban land use can be correlated with nutrients and algal biomass more strongly at local scales 500 m while agricultural land use explain these water quality variables better at the watershed scale due to greater transport efficiency of agricultural nitrate in the watershed busse et al 2006 in this study we assessed a large number of natural and anthropogenic spatial environmental factors that could potentially affect algal biomass in streams based on chlorophyll a chl a concentration data measured at nationwide water quality monitoring stations in south korea using spatial analysis and statistical regression a generalized additive model gam was employed for the statistical regression to assess the non linear response of chl a to the spatial environmental factors the spatial environmental factors were considered to be explanatory variables for differences in chl a concentration across different geographical locations these factors include climate conditions geographical features land use soil type and environmental infrastructure facilities in addition the effect of the physical distance of upland pollutant sources from the water quality monitoring station on the instream algal growth potential was examined the spatial environmental factors of different buffer regions defined by the buffer radius and the stream buffer distance within a watershed were compared by examining the increase of explained variance of chl a with buffer radius and stream buffer distance 2 methods 2 1 data preparation 2 1 1 instream water quality data in south korea the water quality of streams across the nation is monitored with a nationwide water quality monitoring system overseen by the korea ministry of environment kme this system currently consists of 844 stations that monitor a maximum of 38 water quality parameters at 5 to 8 day intervals including water temperature ph nutrient species suspended solids chl a heavy metals and toxic substances it should be noted that this nation wide monitoring system is not aimed at recording discharge volumetric flow rate but is instead designed to track daily trends in water quality at each station using routine monitoring as such discharge is not monitored by these water quality monitoring stations to overcome this the total area of the watershed was used as a replacement for discharge as an explanatory variable in the regression analysis because previous studies have reported a close relationship between stream discharge and watershed area chang and boyer 1977 gianfagna et al 2015 in this study data for water temperature chl a total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp measured from 2013 to 2015 at 688 water quality monitoring stations in streams were used fig 1 at each water quality monitoring station more than two water samples are manually collected from the surface layer of the stream and combined for laboratory analysis water temperature is measured in situ using a thermometer tn tp and chl a are determined in the laboratory according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater clesceri et al 1999 more details on sample collection and handling and laboratory analysis have been provided elsewhere kme 2001 chang 2008 cha et al 2017 this study period was selected because the stream environment in particular water volume and retention time was altered due to the construction of instream weirs in the four major rivers in korea fig 1 a project which was completed in 2012 and has caused an increasing number of episodic algal bloom events srivastava et al 2015 kme 2015 2 1 2 spatial data collection and processing the following spatial environmental factors were investigated in the present study due to their potential effect on instream chl a concentration 1 topographical characteristics that can influence the nutrient export to receiving waters such as the slope and area of the watershed ahearn et al 2005 2 local climate conditions potentially affecting erosion and transport of nutrients from catchments hydrodynamic conditions of streams and the growth rate of algae debele et al 2008 3 areal fractions of different land uses as nonpoint sources of nutrients for algal growth siliva and williams 2001 4 areal fractions of different soil types as natural nutrient sources for algal growth chang 2008 with the taxonomic classification of soils used in this study 5 the distance of the monitoring station from a large scale hydraulic structure i e instream weirs in the four major rivers in korea downstream which significantly increases the hydraulic retention time cha et al 2016 and 6 the number and or treatment capacity of environmental infrastructure facilities acting as point sources of nutrients for algal growth hendriks and langeveld 2017 we initially considered a total of 23 spatial environmental factors as potential explanatory variables for instream chl a concentration table 1 watersheds were delineated using a nationwide digital elevation model dem with a 30 m 30 m resolution by identifying the water quality monitoring station at the outlet point of the target watershed johnson 2009 a total of 688 watersheds were thus delineated and their spatial environmental factors were correlated with the chl a concentration of the corresponding water quality monitoring station i e the outlet point of the watershed the topographical features of each watershed were extracted including the spatially averaged slope and total area daily values of total precipitation and total radiation time for the three years from 2013 to 2015 were obtained from the korea meteorological administration kma for 91 meteorological stations across the nation the radiation intensity was not used in the regression analysis because the data were only available at 31 of the 91 meteorological stations mostly located in the southern part of south korea producing biased results when spatially interpolated each meteorological station is equipped with an automatic weather system aws that measures irradiation wind direction wind velocity and precipitation using a tipping bucket rain gauge at 1 min intervals a land use map of south korea 2013 with six land use classes urban agricultural forest grassland bareland and wetland was obtained from the kme a soil map of south korea based on united states department of agriculture usda soil taxonomy was obtained from the korea rural development administration krda the soil found in south korea largely comprises 7 types inceptisols andisols histisols alfisols entisols ultisols and mollisols in this study areal fractions of four soil types inceptisols alfisols entisols and ultisols were used because the other soil types account for only 1 47 of all soil in korea data for locations and capacities of environmental infrastructure facilities were obtained from the korea water resources management information system wamis in order to investigate how the spatial factors of the watersheds were related to downstream chl a concentration time series data from 2013 to 2015 for climate conditions precipitation and radiation time and chl a concentration was reduced to single site representative values that is the median med third quartile q3 and maximum max values for daily precipitation p over the three years and the average daily total radiation time trad over the three years were used as the site representative values for each meteorological station for the site representative chl a concentration for each water quality monitoring station the med q3 and max concentrations of chl a over the three years were used in the regression med was used to represent the centroid of the data points while the q3 and max concentrations of chl a were examined because the excessive growth of algae was of particular interest in this study and q3 and max might better represent higher algal growth events to extract spatially representative values for the variables potentially affecting the instream chl a concentration spatially discontinuous climate data and other spatial data such as land use and soil type were treated using the following process johnson 2009 1 to define the geographic region influencing the water quality of the monitoring station spatial influential scale the corresponding watershed for each water quality monitoring station was delineated 2 to investigate the effect of the physical distance between upstream pollutant sources and the water quality monitoring station on the chl a concentration the influential radius bc was defined by the circular buffer around each water quality monitoring station the value of bc varied from 5 km to 35 km at 5 km intervals 3 the stream buffer areas measured relative to the buffer distance from the stream sides were then determined the stream buffer distances bs examined were 500 m 1000 m and an infinite distance i e the entire watershed area 4 for each combination of bc and bs values the influential region spatial influential scale was set as the area in which the watershed the circular buffer area and the stream buffer area overlapped fig s1 the maximum influential region for a water quality monitoring station was the entire area of the corresponding watershed 5 spatially discrete climate variables such as p and trad were transformed into spatially continuous data using inverse distance weighting idw which is a simple but widely used interpolation method for climate data keblouti et al 2012 noori et al 2014 6 for each influential region the spatially averaged values for p and trad were obtained 7 areal fractions of different land uses and soil types within each influential region were calculated 8 the point sources data such as number of small scale local sewage treatment plants and total capacities of public sewage treatment plants industrial wastewater treatment plants and livestock wastewater treatment plants within each influential region were obtained these point sources data were normalized by the area of the influential region for the regression analysis the above mentioned procedure was applied to each water quality monitoring station fig s1 resulting in a total of 688 data sets for all possible combinations of bc and bs containing the site representative values of the spatial environmental properties all the above geoprocessing spatial mapping and numerical calculations were performed using arcgis 10 0 esri california usa a statistical model can be weakened by the inter dependency of its explanatory variables concurvity in a gam which undermines the reliability of the output he et al 2007 in particular strong correlations among the spatially averaged slope slope and the areal fractions of some land uses agricultural and forest and among soil types inceptisols and entisols were confirmed by a correlation analysis for the explanatory variables fig s2 however correlations between soil types and slope or between soil types and the areal fractions of land uses were insignificant therefore principal component analyses pca were performed independently for slope and land use fractions and for soil types and important latent factors principal components were extracted for further statistical analysis the principal components pcs were selected for the regression analysis based on the cumulative percent variance method valle et al 1999 in this study pcs that cumulatively explained more than 90 of the total variance of the original data were extracted and rotated using the varimax method the dominant variables of each extracted pc were identified based on the component loadings i e the correlation coefficients between the original variables and pcs a total of 17 explanatory variables and three types of response variables i e the med max and q3 chl a concentrations were eventually used for the regression analysis table 2 variables with high skewness and dispersion were log transformed for the regression analysis the distribution diagnostic plots for individual variables are provided in supplementary material figs s3 s6 the log transformed variables included the chl a concentration in the stream chl a watershed area area and total treatment capacity normalized by the area of the influential region of public sewage treatment plants pstps industrial waste water treatment plants iwtps and livestock wastewater treatment plants lwtps the distance between the monitoring station and the downstream weir was inverse transformed to represent the proximity of the monitoring station to the downstream weir weir for the water temperature tw of the water quality monitoring stations the q3 values for the three years of data were considered to be the most site representative after comparing the explanatory power radj 2 of the regression model i e gam at the watershed scale entire watershed area as the influential region using the mean med the first quartile q1 and q3 values of water temperature table s2 for the site representative precipitation variable p the gams at the watershed scale respectively using the med q3 or max values of daily precipitation for the three years data were compared for their radj 2 values and the median value was chosen for the site representative precipitation variable p for the regression analysis because it resulted in the largest radj 2 value 2 2 generalized additive model gam the gam is an additive non linear regression model for response variable y that follows an exponential family distribution normal binomial poisson distribution etc the gam is an extension of the generalized linear model glm and can be written as follows wood 2006 1 g e y i α s 1 x 1 i s 2 x 2 i s p x p i where yi is chl a μg l for the ith water quality monitoring station xi is an explanatory variable for the ith water quality monitoring station p is the total number of explanatory variables i e the spatial properties of a watershed α is an intercept s is a smooth function for xi and g is a link function the response variable yi is the chl a concentration whose log normality was confirmed using the shapiro wilk test table s3 we used the thin plate regression spline tprs as the smooth function tprs is computationally expensive for large data sets but can avoid the knot placement problems of conventional regression spline modeling wood 2006 the link function g e yi e yi was used because chl a was log normally distributed hastie and tibshirani 1986 we focused on identifying the explanatory variables that were strongly correlated with chl a rather than the prediction or forecasting of chl a significant explanatory variables in the gam were selected using restricted maximum likelihood reml estimation which generally outperforms other variable selection methods in a gam in terms of prediction marra and wood 2011 preliminary analyses for selecting site representative values of response med max or q3 concentration of chl a and explanatory variables mean med q1 or q3 value of p and med max or q3 value of tw were conducted and applied in the gam based on its explanatory power for the inter station variation in chl a the statistical software r r core team 2015 was used for all of the statistical analyses 2 3 sensitivity analysis of the explanatory variables in order to measure the relative impact of the spatial environmental variables on the variation in chl a in the gams a sobol sensitivity analysis was used sobol 2001 sobol sensitivity is variance based decomposing the variance of the model output into fractions attributed to different inputs to the model this sensitivity method can handle non linear functions and models and provide main effect indices si and total effect indices sti which represent the sole contributions and interactive contributions of the individual input variables respectively a more detailed explanation of the principles and mathematical representations of sobol sensitivity analysis can be found elsewhere nossent et al 2011 r software uses a monte carlo sampling technique to numerically calculate si and sti which can introduce numerical error therefore in this study the sample size was increased up to 3 105 until convergences in si and sti were obtained following this 1000 repeated calculations were conducted to obtain the significant intervals for si and sti we only report sti because a gam is an additive model in which si is equal to sti nossent et al 2011 3 results 3 1 principal components associated with slope land uses and soil types from the pca for slope and the six land use classes at the watershed scale five principal components pcs were extracted explaining 97 72 of the total variation in the original data table s4 pc l1 consists of several dominant variables slope and forest were strongly negatively loaded and agricultural was strongly positively loaded urban grassland bareland and wetland were the dominant land uses in pc l2 pc l3 pc l4 and pc l5 respectively the signs of the component loadings for forest were opposite to those of the dominant land uses for all pcs indicating that all the other types of land development might decrease the areal fraction of forest in a given watershed three pcs were extracted from the pca for soil type at the watershed scale explaining 98 09 of the total variation in the original data table s5 inceptisols and entisols which were strongly and negatively correlated with each other combined as pc s1 indicating immature soil development usda 1999 ultisols and alfisols were the dominant soil types in pc s2 and pc s3 respectively the pca at local influential scales influential regions with bc and bs values resulted in similar factor correlations with those at the watershed scale for example at a local scale with the influential regions defined by bc 25 km and bs 1 km five pcs were extracted from the original variables of slope and land uses explaining 98 67 of the total variation of the original data with similar correlations between the pcs and the original variables to those at the watershed scale table s6 three pcs were extracted from the original soil variables explaining 98 55 of the total variation in the original data with similar correlations between the pcs and the original soil variables to those at the watershed scale table s7 3 2 performance of the gams at different spatial scales from the preliminary analysis using the entire watershed scale the model that employed the q3 value of chl a generally had a higher radj 2 value than the models using med and max and was thus selected for further analysis also the q3 values better represents the excessive growth of algae than the med values which was particular interest in this study the gams using the q3 values of chl a were compared for different bc and bs values in fig 2 the radj 2 value of the gam was always higher at the watershed scale than at any local influential scales in the gams at all bs values radj 2 proportionally increased as bc increased from 5 to 25 km and little noticeable increment in the radj 2 value was observed after a bc of 25 km for each bc value radj 2 proportionally increased as bs increased from 500 m until the entire watershed area was included in the defined influential region 3 3 significant explanatory variables for inter station chl a variation in this section the gam for the q3 concentration of chl a was used to identify important spatial factors of upland watershed areas with regards to the downstream algal growth potential the gams with different spatial influential scales resulted in slightly different sets of significant explanatory variables lspt was always excluded as an insignificant variable from the gam at all spatial scales p trad pc s2 and pc s3 were frequently excluded from the gam for example table 3 15 and 13 of the 17 initial variables were identified as significant at the watershed scale and a local scale with bc 25 km and bs 1 km respectively p and lstp were insignificant at the watershed scale and trad pc s2 pc s3 and lstp were insignificant at a local scale with bc 25 km and bs 1 km area tw pc l1 l5 pstp iwtp lwtp and weir were always identified significant in the gam the smooth functions of trad pc l1 pc l3 pc l4 pc l4 pc s2 pc s3 and lwtp were almost linear as their edf values were close to 1 table 3 and fig 3 on the other hand the smooth functions of area tw pc l2 pc s1 pstp iwtp and weir were highly nonlinear according to the residual plots of the smooth functions fig 3 and fig s8 chl a was in general positively correlated with area tw pc l1 pc l3 and lwtp and negatively correlated with pc l2 pc l4 pc l5 and pc s1 although several variables aforementioned were nonlinearly correlated little noticeable sign correlations with chl a were observed for the other variables 3 4 sensitivity of the explanatory variables sobol sensitivities of the explanatory variables were compared between the gams at the watershed scale and a local scale with bc 25 km and bs 1 km fig 4 the sobol sensitivity rankings of the explanatory variables differed between spatial influential scales in general pc l1 pc l2 and tw had relatively higher sensitive rankings than the other variables in both cases in fig 4 the sensitivity ranking of pc l2 was always the highest in the gam at the watershed scale chl a was most sensitive to pc l2 followed by pc l1 pc l4 tw pc l3 and area while the other five variables less contributed to the chl a variation sti 0 05 for each variable in the gam at a local scale with bc 25 km and bs 1 km chl a was again most sensitive to pc l2 followed by pc l2 tw lwtp iwtp and weir while contributions of the other seven variables to the chl a variation were less significant sti 0 05 for each variable sobol sensitivities of the explanatory variables varied depending on the spatial influential scales fig 5 in general tw pc l1 and pc l2 were the three most sensitive variables with values of sti varying from 0 1 to 0 4 across the spatial scales the next sensitive group of variables included area pc l4 iwtp lwtp and weir with values of sti generally varying from 0 01 to 0 15 across the spatial scales values of sti for the other variables were relatively small sti 0 05 for most cases of the spatial scale values of sti for area tw pc l1 pc l2 pc l4 lwtp and weir showed noticeable trends with respect to bc and bs the sti value of area was always greater at a smaller bs with little noticeable trend with respect to bc in contrast values of sti for tw and weir showed little dependency on the bs value while those were generally greater at a smaller bc value pc l1 generally had a greater sti value at a smaller bs or a smaller bc value while pc l2 or pc l4 had a smaller sti value at the same condition lwtp generally had a larger sti value at a smaller bs with no monotonic trend with respect to bc sti increased as bc increased from 5 to 20 km and then decreased thereafter sti values of the other variables had little noticeable trends or randomly varied across spatial influential scales 4 discussion 4 1 explanatory power of the gam for chl a the greater explanatory power of the gam using the q3 concentration of chl a compared with med table s8 indicates that the spatial factors of the influential region can better explain higher algal growth events than they can the seasonal average algal population in a stream the explanatory power of the gam for the inter station chl a variation was dependent on the spatial influential scales the explanatory power of the model gradually increased as the upstream buffer radius increased asymptotically approaching to a maximum value suggesting that the entire watershed area affects the downstream algal biomass but with weaker influences of farther upland areas from the stream location of interest busse et al 2006 in the gam the watershed characteristics beyond the 25 km circular buffer area provided little additional information in the explanting the chl a variation fig 2 and no such critical bounds of the stream buffer were observed the critical influential scale that significantly influences on the downstream algal biomass thus can be defined by the partial area of the watershed bounded by 25 km upstream circular buffer and no stream buffer bound the explanatory variables identified as significant in the gam differed between the spatial scales indicating varying relative importance of the explanatory variables depending on the spatial scale table 3 however at all spatial influential scales with several exceptions urban and agricultural land uses were identified as the two most significant factors jointly explaining over 40 of the total inter station variation in chl a figs 4 5 more details on the explanatory power of the gam and important spatial environmental factors in relation to the spatial influential scales are discussed in the following sections 4 2 natural factors correlated with downstream algal biomass the area of the watershed area was always identified as significant and positively correlated with downstream chl a concentration for all spatial influential scales table 3 fig 3 and fig s7 the positive correlation between watershed area area and chl a concentration can be explained by the fact that a location further downstream drains a larger watershed and typically has a lower water quality rowe 1999 the slope is a natural factor that can affect the efficiency of nutrient erosion and transport cai et al 1996 richard et al 2002 and was strongly negatively correlated with agricultural area r 0 64 p 0 001 and strongly positively correlated forest r 0 90 p 0 001 in pca variables associated with the slope agricultural land use and forest land use were combined into one pc variable pc l1 representing the agricultural land use generally located at gentle slope deforested areas this combined factor pc l1 was always positively correlated with chl a at all spatial scales fig 3 and fig s7 because slope and forest were negatively loaded to pc l2 these can be regarded as the natural factors negatively correlated with the downstream algal biomass the negative correlations of the slope and forest land use with downstream chl a concentration are presumably because steeper slopes are frequently left undeveloped and forested discharging less nutrients than gentler developed hillsides brett et al 2005 chang 2008 also a watershed with a steeper slope can result in a shorter hydraulic retention time of the stream water which decreases the algal growth potential cha et al 2017 of the three climate factors investigated water temperature tw was always identified as an important variable that explained a significant proportion of the inter station variation in chl a at all spatial scales i e sti 0 1 0 27 figs 4 5 as demonstrated in many previous studies bowie et al 1985 cha et al 2017 high water temperatures favour algal growth in streams and our findings are in agreement with this figs 3 and s7 the residual plots of the gam smooth functions shows that chl a increased as the water temperature increased up to around 24 c and plateaued out thereafter figs 3 and s7 indicating the existence of an optimal condition of water temperature for algal growth bowie et al 1985 although precipitation p and radiation time trad can be very important factors for algal growth debele et al 2008 they only explained small proportions of the inter station variation in chl a sti 0 001 0 08 fig 5 or were often eliminated from the models during the variable elimination procedure in this study we did not consider the seasonal variation in climate characteristics and instead used single site representative values for these variables for each monitoring station as a result the spatial variability of these climate factors between the water quality monitoring stations within the geographical region of south korea total area 10 210 km2 was too small to obtain statistically meaningful results the coefficient of variation cov was 0 11 and 0 03 for p and trad respectively the very high sensitivity of chl a concentration to water temperature figs 4 5 is the reason why tw was included as an explanatory variable in the gams during variable selection despite its low variability cov 0 08 between the water quality monitoring stations the contribution of precipitation to downstream chl a concentration can be complex an increase in precipitation may result in greater nutrient loads entering the stream from the watershed rostami et al 2018 but these increased loads may not always be translated into elevated concentrations of the nutrients available for algal growth due to the dilution effect of increased runoff huebsch et al 2014 furthermore the greater discharge during a rainfall event can wash out algal cells in a stream jeong et al 2011 for these reasons the statistical correlation between precipitation and chl a in the streams was low figs 4 5 we used a single site representative value for precipitation for each station and thus could not consider the effect of the temporal variance in rainfall on transport behaviour complex chemical and hydrodynamic interactions or their impacts on algal growth these concerns were beyond the scope of this paper and should be addressed in future research the three soil variables pc s1 s3 jointly explained only 0 3 5 9 of the chl a variation figs 4 5 this small explainability of the soil variables is presumably because the effect of soil processes on the stream water quality can be obscured by its interactive effects with land uses taka et al 2016 the soil variable dominantly associated with inceptisols and entisols pc s1 was always identified as significant in the models and showed negative correlations with chl a although it explained only 0 4 4 of the chl a variation figs 4 5 inceptisols and entisols are both immature soils with entisols being the youngest soils schoonover and crim 2015 in south korea inceptisols and entisols are two dominant soil types 79 and 17 of all soil respectively and are predominated by loamy and sandy materials respectively hong et al 2013 pc s1 thus represents the degree of loamy material occupation in relatively immature soils a lower value of pc s1 means a higher fraction of loamy materials in the soil the negative correlation observed between pc s1 and chl a figs 3 and s7 might result because soils with higher fractions of loamy materials have smaller particle sizes and thus have more nutrient contents ge et al 2019 and greater erodibilities usda 2013 supplying more nutrients for algal growth downstream the soil variables dominantly associated with ultisols pc s2 and alfisols pc s3 were frequently removed from the models as insignificant or chl a was little sensitive to these variables table 3 and figs 4 and 5 and s7 alfisols and ultisols are well developed clay enriched soils bockheim and hartemink 2013 which may favours algal growth downstream due to high nutrient adsorption capacity and erodibility of clay materials johnson et al 1997 siliva and williams 2001 mori et al 2015 however they are generally associated with forested landscape usda 1999 and occupy only minor fractions of the entire area of south korea 3 and 1 respectively having little noticeable impacts on the downstream algal biomass 4 3 activities in the watershed correlated with downstream algal biomass all of the five variables associated with land uses pc l1 pc l5 were identified as significant explanatory variables for the chl a variation at all spatial scales except for the local scales with a stream buffer distance of 500 m where pc l5 wetland dominant was always eliminated as an insignificant variable considering the signs of the component loadings and residual plots between the smooth functions for the pc variables table s6 and figs 3 and s7 all land use types except for the forest land use were positively correlated with chl a in particular variables associated with agricultural and urban land uses were always most significantly correlated with downstream algal biomass the high correlations of agricultural and urban land uses with algal biomass observed are in agreement with many previous studies dodds et al 2002 ahearn et al 2005 ding et al 2015 the variable associated with grasslands pc l3 was positively correlated with chl a considering the sign of the component loading of this factor it can be concluded that greater areal fraction of grasslands contributes to higher chl a concentrations although the sensitivity of chl a to pc l3 was relatively low sti ranged from 0 to 0 06 across all spatial scales fig 5 the observed positive correlation between grasslands and chl a contrasts to other studies emphasizing the role of vegetated surfaces in immobilizing nutrients and thereby reducing algal growth potential downstream sabater et al 2000 brett et al 2005 liu et al 2012 our counter intuitive result might be due to contributions from the artificial turf fields often managed with excessive agrochemicals such as herbicides and insecticides the land use class grassland used in south korea includes natural grasslands as well as artificial grasslands such as golf courses grass fields parks and cemeteries comprising approximately 48 of the total area occupied by the land uses classified as grassland these artificial grasslands contain insensitively managed turf often with excessive quantity of agrochemicals applied smith and bridges 1996 rice et al 2017 bare lands were found to be a contributor to the increased chl a considering the correlations of pc l4 with bareland and chl a table s6 and figs 3 and s7 the sobol sensitivity analysis showed that bare lands are the third significant land use class affecting downstream algal biomass with measurable explainability for the chl a variation sti ranged from 0 0006 to 0 13 fig 5 the land use class bareland includes unvegetated riparian rocks mines playgrounds and other unvegetated soils bareland is characterized by sparsely vegetated open space which is vulnerable to soil erosion increasing the nutrient transport and algal growth potential downstream liu et al 2012 correlations of pc l4 with wetland and chl a table s6 and fig 3 and s7 suggested that the areal fraction of wetlands was positively correlated with chl a however the wetland variable pc l4 had relatively low sensitivity for chl a figs 4 5 or was always eliminated from the model as an insignificant variable at the local scales with a stream buffer distance of 500 m it is generally understood that wetlands typically offer eco friendly functions such as water quality improvement flood storage fish and wildlife habitat aesthetics and biological productivity lehner and doll 2004 the findings of this study thus contradict this common knowledge in south korea the wetland land use classification includes not only conventional wetlands but also various types of wetted land such as ditches grassed riverside areas and wet fallow lands 734 km2 and 1065 km2 for conventional wetlands and other types of wetted land respectively agricultural ditches and fallow lands should be reclassified as agricultural land use which is known to be a nutrient source in addition even conventional wetlands can be a source of algae for downstream waters when the effluent of the wetland is poorly managed causing algal washout wu and mitsch 1998 steinmann et al 2003 gold et al 2017 consequently the results of this study highlight the importance of managing the effluent of wetlands to prevent secondary pollution of streams in the vicinity in addition a nationwide field survey of the classification of wetlands in relation to downstream water quality is suggested variables associated with public sewage treatment plants pstp industrial wwtps iwtp and livestock wwtps lwtp were always significant and positively correlated with downstream chl a concentration suggesting their role as point pollutant sources that directly affect water quality in streams the nutrient concentrations in the effluent of all four types of wwtp were considerably higher than those in the streams fig s8 indicating that it is still necessary to control the point sources in particular the tn and tp concentrations of effluent from livestock wwtps varied greatly with very high concentrations at episodic intervals compared to the other point sources thus suggesting the need for appropriate management practices the sensitivity analysis indicated that livestock wwtps have the most significant impacts on the downstream algal biomass among the four types of wwtps explained up to 22 of the interstation chl a variation fig 5 the number density of small scale local sewage treatment plants lswp was always eliminated as an insignificant variable probably due to the fact that the total amount of effluents from all small scale plants is significantly smaller than that from other wwtps approximately 2 1 of total sewage nationwide kme 2013 and thus their impacts might be also relatively smaller than others the proximity of the water quality monitoring station to the weir downstream was found to be a significant explanatory variable with a relatively high sensitivity sti ranged from 0 03 0 19 across the spatial influential scales fig 5 the positive impact of instream weirs on algal blooms via the increase in hydraulic residence time has been reported in several previous studies park et al 2012 cha et al 2016 2017 4 4 scale effects and relative importance of the variables the impacts of upland pollutant sources on the downstream to some degree depend on the proximity of those sources to that location strayer et al 2003 in the present study the upland regions more than 25 km from the stream location provided little additional information to increase the explainability of the models in terms of the inter station variation of chl a no such critical influential region for the stream buffer was found the critical influential scale on the algal biomass depends on land use climate and hydrogeomorphology of the watershed in a watershed with widespread agricultural activities downstream nutrients and algal biomass might be well influenced by the entire watershed than by local regions because nitrate a primary nutrient species from agricultural land use travels a long distance due to its high mobility through surface and subsurface components of the watershed busse et al 2006 the critical influential scales vary depending on the rainfall and hydromorphological conditions e g slope morphology and surrounding soils influencing the surface and subsurface flow involving nutrient flux klose et al 2012 a larger flow produces a higher nutrient flux increasing the critical influential scale in this study the critical influential scale might be site dependent because each of the 688 watersheds has its own site specific conditions of the abovementioned factors influencing the scale effects therefore the critical influential scale 25 km of the upstream circular buffer observed in this study should be site averaged characteristics of the 688 watersheds in south korea from the sensitivity analyses fig 5 noticeable scale dependencies of the relative contribution to chl a variation were observed for several explanatory variables with relatively high sensitivity values such as tw pc l1 pc l2 pc l4 pc l5 iwtp lwtp and weir note that the inter scale variation of the sensitivity value for each variable only indicates how the statistical correlation of that variable with chl a varies across the scales rather than true causal effect of that variable on the chl a because the interactive effects between different variables were not explicitly considered in the regression models contribution of water temperature tw to the inter station chl a variation decreased as the circular buffer radius increased with little change with respect to the stream buffer scale it was reported in literature that upland activities such as intensive land development increases water temperature downstream hu et al 2015 furthermore temperature of point source discharge can influence on the stream water temperature we presumed that at a larger circular buffer scale water temperature and upland spatial characteristics were more interactively correlated with chl a resulting in a smaller proportion of the chl a variation explained by water temperature i e a lower sobol sensitivity of water temperature trends in the relative contributions of different land uses and point sources were noticeable impacts of agricultural land use pc l1 on chl a became greater as the spatial scale decreased for both circular buffer and stream buffer a stronger influence of agricultural land at a smaller scale observed in this study contradicts to previous studies strayer et al 2003 busse et al 2006 claiming that agricultural areas have large scale impacts on the downstream nitrate concentration the contradicting result of this study can be explained by the strong dependency of the algal biomass on phosphorous rather than nitrogen as the limiting nutrient in the south korean streams yun and an 2016 the influence of agricultural phosphorous on the stream algal biomass should be stronger from the agricultural areas at a closer location due to the low mobility of phosphorous thorough soil alfonso et al 2015 the larger relative contribution of urban land use at a larger scale for both circular and stream buffers was found a possible explanation of a larger relative importance of land use at a larger spatial scale is that nutrient export from urban land use is generally through runoffs over impervious surfaces and pipe systems efficiently delivering nutrients far downstream relative contributions of barelands and wetlands to chl a were generally greater at smaller circular buffer scales the primary mechanism of nutrient export from barelands is erosion of soils and delivery ratio of the eroded soils generally decreases as the watershed area increases verstraeten et al 2003 thus the stream water quality can be more correlated with barelands at smaller scales standing waters such as ponds and wetlands can be a direct source of chl a gold et al 2017 influencing more on the chl a level when they are closer for the point sources such as industrial wwtps and livestock wwtps their relative contributions to chl a were generally smaller at smaller stream buffer scales and larger circular buffer scales 15 km of radii this scale dependency can be explained by the fact that in south korea wwtps are typically located near streams to discharge effluents directly impacting stream water quality however note that the total contribution from all land uses showed an opposite scale dependency to that from these point sources in the statistical regression the scale dependencies of different explanatory variables were dependent of each other because interactive effects of the variables were not explicitly factored out in the gam statistical importance of the proximity of the downstream weir decreased as the circular buffer scale increased and little scale dependency was observed with respect to the stream buffer scale this scale dependency in the contribution of the weir proximity might be due to the different degrees of inter correlations between upland activities and downstream hydraulic conditions weirs at different scales jointly affecting downstream algal biomass the inter correlations between upland activities and downstream weirs might be greater at larger scales resulting in relatively smaller proportions of the chl a variation explained by the weir proximity 4 5 implications and limitations of the study the aim of this study was to examine how watersheds with different spatial environmental factors influence downstream algal growth potential using chl a concentration as a proxy for algal biomass this examination was expected to allow identification of important environmental variables their relative importance with respect to spatial scales and spatial boundaries and factors to be prioritized in establishing watershed management plans however there are several limitations of this study which should be addressed in future studies our study focused on time averaged correlations between spatial environmental factors and algal biomass in a nationwide scale and thus could not consider the seasonal effects and local variability in the correlations depending on watershed specific conditions the critical spatial scales and relative importance of the spatial environmental factors can vary depending on the watershed specific conditions such as hydrogeomorpholoty climate stream size and watershed size furthermore multiple environmental factors interactively influence on chl a for example interactive effects can be significant between radiation and temperature walter et al 2014 between upland activities and hydrologic conditions welde and gebremariam 2017 and between soil and land use taka et al 2016 therefore interactive effects of environmental variables should be further elucidated in addition the upland characteristics can be correlated across the spatial scales in our study because 1 the smaller spatial scales are nested in the larger spatial scales 2 the spatial activities occurring in a watershed can be homogeneous across the entire watershed area and 3 in some local scale analyses the entire areas of the relatively small watersheds can be always included in the influential regions regardless of the spatial scale providing similar watershed characteristics for different spatial scale analyses this scale dependency issue for watershed characteristics remained for future studies 5 conclusions we examined the correlations between spatial environmental properties in influential upland regions within a watershed and downstream chl a concentration site representative values for 17 spatial environmental variables in these regions were extracted from spatial analysis and used as explanatory variables for downstream chl a concentration generalized additive models gams were used to identify the significant explanatory variables using data from 688 water quality monitoring stations from this study the following conclusions can be drawn inter station variation in chl a was statistically better explained by an analysis of the entire watershed than by a buffer scale analysis however the spatial environmental factors of upland areas more than 25 km from the stream location did little to increase the explainability of the models in terms of chl a variation the site representative spatial environmental factors of influential upland regions better explained the inter station variation of third quartile concentrations than they did the median concentration of chl a in streams thus the spatial factors of the influential region can better explain higher algal growth events than they can the seasonal average algal population in a stream natural factors including watershed area water temperature and radiation time were identified significant to explain inter station variation of chl a water temperature was the most important explanatory variable for chl a and its relative contribution to the inter station variation of chl a was more significant at smaller scales explainability of the soil types for chl a was statistically insignificant because of their potential interactive effects with land uses land use patterns were confirmed to be a strong predictor of downstream chl a concentration in particular agricultural and urban land uses were the two most important land uses strongly associated with chl a these two land uses jointly over 40 of the total inter station variation of chl a the observed scale dependencies of contributions of agricultural and urban land uses suggested that management of these land uses should be better focused on local scales and on the entire watershed scale respectively hydraulic residence time as represented by the distance between the monitoring location and a downstream weir was found to be a statistically important predictor of high concentrations of chl a its relative contribution to the inter station variation of chl a was smaller at a larger spatial buffer scale potentially because the effects of weir and upland activities are more interactively correlated with chl a at a larger scale analysis of the four types of wastewater treatment plants livestock wastewater treatment plants were generally more strongly related to chl a levels than others relative contributions of point sources to the inter station chl a variation were smaller at larger scale analyses as those of land use patterns become more significant at larger scale analyses we examined relative importance and its scale dependency of natural and man made spatial properties of the watershed for determining downstream algal growth potential this information can support managers in establishing cost effective watershed management plans as well as motivate further research to examine interactive effects of the environmental factors and their mechanisms to elucidate the

18996,we examined the relationship between downstream algal growth potential and the spatial environmental factors of both upland areas and stream buffer zones using spatial analysis and generalized additive models gams the models employed site representative concentrations of chlorophyll a chl a from a total of 688 national water quality monitoring stations and the spatial factors of the corresponding 688 watersheds the spatial environmental factors included topography climate land use class soil type and proximity of the monitoring station to the weir downstream and wastewater treatment plants wwtps the explanatory power adjusted r2 or radj 2 of the models was used to compare different spatial influential scales defined by stream buffers and upstream circular buffers the spatial environmental factors of the entire watershed area better explained the inter station variation in chl a than did those of the stream buffer and or upstream circular buffer areas however the spatial environmental factors of watershed areas more than 25 km upstream circular buffer zones had only minor influence on the explainability of the models with regards to the inter station variation in chl a levels generally land use patterns were more strongly related to the inter station chl a variation than were point sources of pollutants such as wwtps the two most influencing land uses on the inter station chl a variation were urban and agricultural land uses with varying relative contributions depending on the spatial influential scale in general relative contribution of urban land use was larger at a larger spatial influential scale while that of agricultural land use showed an opposite trend in addition the proximity to the weir downstream explained high chl a concentrations in the stream water relative importance and causal effects of the spatial environmental variables to instream chl a were established based on this national scale correlative analysis leading to

of the national river restoration project aiming at flood control and water utilization as a consequence there have been an increasing number of episodic algal bloom events in the four major national rivers after weir construction due to the increased hydraulic residence time of the rivers with the prolonged dry period during summer and autumn seasons srivastava et al 2015 kme 2015 while algal growth in water bodies is a natural phenomenon the high biomass resulting from excessive growth of algae is of major concern backer 2002 excessive algal growth is usually accompanied by a reduction in the diversity of algae due to the dominance of a few harmful algal species and cyanobacteria heisler et al 2008 anderson et al 2012 in particular the excess growth of harmful algae has numerous impacts on the environment the mass mortality of wild and farmed fish and shellfish the death and illness of humans caused by toxic seafood unclean drinking water and irrigation water contamination the death and illness of marine mammals seabirds and other animals and changes in trophic structure within water bodies anderson et al 2002 algal blooms also increase the turbidity of the water and restrict light penetration into the waterbody negatively affecting the underwater habitats of benthic flora and fauna paolo and laura 2014 while also degrading aesthetics and leading to taste and odor problems in drinking water algal growth in water bodies is dependent upon internal factors such as the chemical compositions of the water nutrient cycles and availability abundance of herbivore community hydrologic disturbances water temperature and light availability munn et al 2010 elliott 2010 riseng et al 2004 xie et al 2012 large scale regional factors such as climate conditions external nutrient loadings and characteristics of the watershed can also affect algal production and biomass biggs 1995 leland et al 2000 urrea clos et al 2014 woelmer et al 2016 a growing number of studies have sought to link watershed characteristics and algal biomass e g chlorophyll a in downstream water bodies because watershed characteristics such as land use patterns can be more easily manipulated by managers than internal factors or other external influences such as climate variables woelmer et al 2016 the identification of the environmental drivers of algal growth is generally considered an important task in the management of water quality and process based or empirical models based around statistical methods can be used to do this task process based models enable precise cause and effect relationships to be identified but they typically require significant computational resources and are inherently limited in terms of describing complex natural phenomena this is because in a process based model the parameterization process that links the model to field data can be time consuming and expensive and often the direct measurement of these parameters is impossible decreasing the reliability of the model s results demeritt and wainwrite 2009 in contrast empirical methods provide a way to search for patterns in large data sets and have often been preferred as an initial approach to the understanding of the causal effects involved in algal blooms empirical models allow hypotheses that explain the patterns found in the data to be generated and their implications to be discussed demeritt and wainwrite 2009 shiffrin 2016 empirical statistical methods have been widely used to build relationships between watershed characteristics such as land use patterns and algal biomass in downstream water bodies many regional studies reported positive correlations of algal biomass with agricultural land use brett et al 2005 migliaccio et al 2007 munn et al 2010 and urban land use liu et al 2011 ding et al 2015 knoll et al 2015 some studies failed to detect statistical correlation of agricultural land use with downstream algal biomass due to interference from external factors such as wind over shallow lakes in upland areas ma et al 2016 or stronger influence of urban areas siliva and williams 2001 ding et al 2015 negative correlations between forest land use and algal biomass is a common finding in past research because areas covered by forest or vegetation can delay or attenuate nutrient transport into receiving waters decreasing algal growth potential downstream thomas et al 2004 mori et al 2015 the influences of watershed characteristics on the downstream water quality can be dependent on spatial scale land use patterns at local scales 500 1000 m such as stream buffer areas or radial buffer regions often better explain downstream nutrient concentrations or algal biomass than those at the watershed scale johnson et al 1997 busse et al 2006 klose et al 2012 the local effects of land use patterns on nutrients and algal biomass in the downstream water bodies can be enhanced during dry seasons with low delivery efficiency of nutrients due to low flows or when the point sources dominate flows klose et al 2012 urban land use can be correlated with nutrients and algal biomass more strongly at local scales 500 m while agricultural land use explain these water quality variables better at the watershed scale due to greater transport efficiency of agricultural nitrate in the watershed busse et al 2006 in this study we assessed a large number of natural and anthropogenic spatial environmental factors that could potentially affect algal biomass in streams based on chlorophyll a chl a concentration data measured at nationwide water quality monitoring stations in south korea using spatial analysis and statistical regression a generalized additive model gam was employed for the statistical regression to assess the non linear response of chl a to the spatial environmental factors the spatial environmental factors were considered to be explanatory variables for differences in chl a concentration across different geographical locations these factors include climate conditions geographical features land use soil type and environmental infrastructure facilities in addition the effect of the physical distance of upland pollutant sources from the water quality monitoring station on the instream algal growth potential was examined the spatial environmental factors of different buffer regions defined by the buffer radius and the stream buffer distance within a watershed were compared by examining the increase of explained variance of chl a with buffer radius and stream buffer distance 2 methods 2 1 data preparation 2 1 1 instream water quality data in south korea the water quality of streams across the nation is monitored with a nationwide water quality monitoring system overseen by the korea ministry of environment kme this system currently consists of 844 stations that monitor a maximum of 38 water quality parameters at 5 to 8 day intervals including water temperature ph nutrient species suspended solids chl a heavy metals and toxic substances it should be noted that this nation wide monitoring system is not aimed at recording discharge volumetric flow rate but is instead designed to track daily trends in water quality at each station using routine monitoring as such discharge is not monitored by these water quality monitoring stations to overcome this the total area of the watershed was used as a replacement for discharge as an explanatory variable in the regression analysis because previous studies have reported a close relationship between stream discharge and watershed area chang and boyer 1977 gianfagna et al 2015 in this study data for water temperature chl a total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp measured from 2013 to 2015 at 688 water quality monitoring stations in streams were used fig 1 at each water quality monitoring station more than two water samples are manually collected from the surface layer of the stream and combined for laboratory analysis water temperature is measured in situ using a thermometer tn tp and chl a are determined in the laboratory according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater clesceri et al 1999 more details on sample collection and handling and laboratory analysis have been provided elsewhere kme 2001 chang 2008 cha et al 2017 this study period was selected because the stream environment in particular water volume and retention time was altered due to the construction of instream weirs in the four major rivers in korea fig 1 a project which was completed in 2012 and has caused an increasing number of episodic algal bloom events srivastava et al 2015 kme 2015 2 1 2 spatial data collection and processing the following spatial environmental factors were investigated in the present study due to their potential effect on instream chl a concentration 1 topographical characteristics that can influence the nutrient export to receiving waters such as the slope and area of the watershed ahearn et al 2005 2 local climate conditions potentially affecting erosion and transport of nutrients from catchments hydrodynamic conditions of streams and the growth rate of algae debele et al 2008 3 areal fractions of different land uses as nonpoint sources of nutrients for algal growth siliva and williams 2001 4 areal fractions of different soil types as natural nutrient sources for algal growth chang 2008 with the taxonomic classification of soils used in this study 5 the distance of the monitoring station from a large scale hydraulic structure i e instream weirs in the four major rivers in korea downstream which significantly increases the hydraulic retention time cha et al 2016 and 6 the number and or treatment capacity of environmental infrastructure facilities acting as point sources of nutrients for algal growth hendriks and langeveld 2017 we initially considered a total of 23 spatial environmental factors as potential explanatory variables for instream chl a concentration table 1 watersheds were delineated using a nationwide digital elevation model dem with a 30 m 30 m resolution by identifying the water quality monitoring station at the outlet point of the target watershed johnson 2009 a total of 688 watersheds were thus delineated and their spatial environmental factors were correlated with the chl a concentration of the corresponding water quality monitoring station i e the outlet point of the watershed the topographical features of each watershed were extracted including the spatially averaged slope and total area daily values of total precipitation and total radiation time for the three years from 2013 to 2015 were obtained from the korea meteorological administration kma for 91 meteorological stations across the nation the radiation intensity was not used in the regression analysis because the data were only available at 31 of the 91 meteorological stations mostly located in the southern part of south korea producing biased results when spatially interpolated each meteorological station is equipped with an automatic weather system aws that measures irradiation wind direction wind velocity and precipitation using a tipping bucket rain gauge at 1 min intervals a land use map of south korea 2013 with six land use classes urban agricultural forest grassland bareland and wetland was obtained from the kme a soil map of south korea based on united states department of agriculture usda soil taxonomy was obtained from the korea rural development administration krda the soil found in south korea largely comprises 7 types inceptisols andisols histisols alfisols entisols ultisols and mollisols in this study areal fractions of four soil types inceptisols alfisols entisols and ultisols were used because the other soil types account for only 1 47 of all soil in korea data for locations and capacities of environmental infrastructure facilities were obtained from the korea water resources management information system wamis in order to investigate how the spatial factors of the watersheds were related to downstream chl a concentration time series data from 2013 to 2015 for climate conditions precipitation and radiation time and chl a concentration was reduced to single site representative values that is the median med third quartile q3 and maximum max values for daily precipitation p over the three years and the average daily total radiation time trad over the three years were used as the site representative values for each meteorological station for the site representative chl a concentration for each water quality monitoring station the med q3 and max concentrations of chl a over the three years were used in the regression med was used to represent the centroid of the data points while the q3 and max concentrations of chl a were examined because the excessive growth of algae was of particular interest in this study and q3 and max might better represent higher algal growth events to extract spatially representative values for the variables potentially affecting the instream chl a concentration spatially discontinuous climate data and other spatial data such as land use and soil type were treated using the following process johnson 2009 1 to define the geographic region influencing the water quality of the monitoring station spatial influential scale the corresponding watershed for each water quality monitoring station was delineated 2 to investigate the effect of the physical distance between upstream pollutant sources and the water quality monitoring station on the chl a concentration the influential radius bc was defined by the circular buffer around each water quality monitoring station the value of bc varied from 5 km to 35 km at 5 km intervals 3 the stream buffer areas measured relative to the buffer distance from the stream sides were then determined the stream buffer distances bs examined were 500 m 1000 m and an infinite distance i e the entire watershed area 4 for each combination of bc and bs values the influential region spatial influential scale was set as the area in which the watershed the circular buffer area and the stream buffer area overlapped fig s1 the maximum influential region for a water quality monitoring station was the entire area of the corresponding watershed 5 spatially discrete climate variables such as p and trad were transformed into spatially continuous data using inverse distance weighting idw which is a simple but widely used interpolation method for climate data keblouti et al 2012 noori et al 2014 6 for each influential region the spatially averaged values for p and trad were obtained 7 areal fractions of different land uses and soil types within each influential region were calculated 8 the point sources data such as number of small scale local sewage treatment plants and total capacities of public sewage treatment plants industrial wastewater treatment plants and livestock wastewater treatment plants within each influential region were obtained these point sources data were normalized by the area of the influential region for the regression analysis the above mentioned procedure was applied to each water quality monitoring station fig s1 resulting in a total of 688 data sets for all possible combinations of bc and bs containing the site representative values of the spatial environmental properties all the above geoprocessing spatial mapping and numerical calculations were performed using arcgis 10 0 esri california usa a statistical model can be weakened by the inter dependency of its explanatory variables concurvity in a gam which undermines the reliability of the output he et al 2007 in particular strong correlations among the spatially averaged slope slope and the areal fractions of some land uses agricultural and forest and among soil types inceptisols and entisols were confirmed by a correlation analysis for the explanatory variables fig s2 however correlations between soil types and slope or between soil types and the areal fractions of land uses were insignificant therefore principal component analyses pca were performed independently for slope and land use fractions and for soil types and important latent factors principal components were extracted for further statistical analysis the principal components pcs were selected for the regression analysis based on the cumulative percent variance method valle et al 1999 in this study pcs that cumulatively explained more than 90 of the total variance of the original data were extracted and rotated using the varimax method the dominant variables of each extracted pc were identified based on the component loadings i e the correlation coefficients between the original variables and pcs a total of 17 explanatory variables and three types of response variables i e the med max and q3 chl a concentrations were eventually used for the regression analysis table 2 variables with high skewness and dispersion were log transformed for the regression analysis the distribution diagnostic plots for individual variables are provided in supplementary material figs s3 s6 the log transformed variables included the chl a concentration in the stream chl a watershed area area and total treatment capacity normalized by the area of the influential region of public sewage treatment plants pstps industrial waste water treatment plants iwtps and livestock wastewater treatment plants lwtps the distance between the monitoring station and the downstream weir was inverse transformed to represent the proximity of the monitoring station to the downstream weir weir for the water temperature tw of the water quality monitoring stations the q3 values for the three years of data were considered to be the most site representative after comparing the explanatory power radj 2 of the regression model i e gam at the watershed scale entire watershed area as the influential region using the mean med the first quartile q1 and q3 values of water temperature table s2 for the site representative precipitation variable p the gams at the watershed scale respectively using the med q3 or max values of daily precipitation for the three years data were compared for their radj 2 values and the median value was chosen for the site representative precipitation variable p for the regression analysis because it resulted in the largest radj 2 value 2 2 generalized additive model gam the gam is an additive non linear regression model for response variable y that follows an exponential family distribution normal binomial poisson distribution etc the gam is an extension of the generalized linear model glm and can be written as follows wood 2006 1 g e y i α s 1 x 1 i s 2 x 2 i s p x p i where yi is chl a μg l for the ith water quality monitoring station xi is an explanatory variable for the ith water quality monitoring station p is the total number of explanatory variables i e the spatial properties of a watershed α is an intercept s is a smooth function for xi and g is a link function the response variable yi is the chl a concentration whose log normality was confirmed using the shapiro wilk test table s3 we used the thin plate regression spline tprs as the smooth function tprs is computationally expensive for large data sets but can avoid the knot placement problems of conventional regression spline modeling wood 2006 the link function g e yi e yi was used because chl a was log normally distributed hastie and tibshirani 1986 we focused on identifying the explanatory variables that were strongly correlated with chl a rather than the prediction or forecasting of chl a significant explanatory variables in the gam were selected using restricted maximum likelihood reml estimation which generally outperforms other variable selection methods in a gam in terms of prediction marra and wood 2011 preliminary analyses for selecting site representative values of response med max or q3 concentration of chl a and explanatory variables mean med q1 or q3 value of p and med max or q3 value of tw were conducted and applied in the gam based on its explanatory power for the inter station variation in chl a the statistical software r r core team 2015 was used for all of the statistical analyses 2 3 sensitivity analysis of the explanatory variables in order to measure the relative impact of the spatial environmental variables on the variation in chl a in the gams a sobol sensitivity analysis was used sobol 2001 sobol sensitivity is variance based decomposing the variance of the model output into fractions attributed to different inputs to the model this sensitivity method can handle non linear functions and models and provide main effect indices si and total effect indices sti which represent the sole contributions and interactive contributions of the individual input variables respectively a more detailed explanation of the principles and mathematical representations of sobol sensitivity analysis can be found elsewhere nossent et al 2011 r software uses a monte carlo sampling technique to numerically calculate si and sti which can introduce numerical error therefore in this study the sample size was increased up to 3 105 until convergences in si and sti were obtained following this 1000 repeated calculations were conducted to obtain the significant intervals for si and sti we only report sti because a gam is an additive model in which si is equal to sti nossent et al 2011 3 results 3 1 principal components associated with slope land uses and soil types from the pca for slope and the six land use classes at the watershed scale five principal components pcs were extracted explaining 97 72 of the total variation in the original data table s4 pc l1 consists of several dominant variables slope and forest were strongly negatively loaded and agricultural was strongly positively loaded urban grassland bareland and wetland were the dominant land uses in pc l2 pc l3 pc l4 and pc l5 respectively the signs of the component loadings for forest were opposite to those of the dominant land uses for all pcs indicating that all the other types of land development might decrease the areal fraction of forest in a given watershed three pcs were extracted from the pca for soil type at the watershed scale explaining 98 09 of the total variation in the original data table s5 inceptisols and entisols which were strongly and negatively correlated with each other combined as pc s1 indicating immature soil development usda 1999 ultisols and alfisols were the dominant soil types in pc s2 and pc s3 respectively the pca at local influential scales influential regions with bc and bs values resulted in similar factor correlations with those at the watershed scale for example at a local scale with the influential regions defined by bc 25 km and bs 1 km five pcs were extracted from the original variables of slope and land uses explaining 98 67 of the total variation of the original data with similar correlations between the pcs and the original variables to those at the watershed scale table s6 three pcs were extracted from the original soil variables explaining 98 55 of the total variation in the original data with similar correlations between the pcs and the original soil variables to those at the watershed scale table s7 3 2 performance of the gams at different spatial scales from the preliminary analysis using the entire watershed scale the model that employed the q3 value of chl a generally had a higher radj 2 value than the models using med and max and was thus selected for further analysis also the q3 values better represents the excessive growth of algae than the med values which was particular interest in this study the gams using the q3 values of chl a were compared for different bc and bs values in fig 2 the radj 2 value of the gam was always higher at the watershed scale than at any local influential scales in the gams at all bs values radj 2 proportionally increased as bc increased from 5 to 25 km and little noticeable increment in the radj 2 value was observed after a bc of 25 km for each bc value radj 2 proportionally increased as bs increased from 500 m until the entire watershed area was included in the defined influential region 3 3 significant explanatory variables for inter station chl a variation in this section the gam for the q3 concentration of chl a was used to identify important spatial factors of upland watershed areas with regards to the downstream algal growth potential the gams with different spatial influential scales resulted in slightly different sets of significant explanatory variables lspt was always excluded as an insignificant variable from the gam at all spatial scales p trad pc s2 and pc s3 were frequently excluded from the gam for example table 3 15 and 13 of the 17 initial variables were identified as significant at the watershed scale and a local scale with bc 25 km and bs 1 km respectively p and lstp were insignificant at the watershed scale and trad pc s2 pc s3 and lstp were insignificant at a local scale with bc 25 km and bs 1 km area tw pc l1 l5 pstp iwtp lwtp and weir were always identified significant in the gam the smooth functions of trad pc l1 pc l3 pc l4 pc l4 pc s2 pc s3 and lwtp were almost linear as their edf values were close to 1 table 3 and fig 3 on the other hand the smooth functions of area tw pc l2 pc s1 pstp iwtp and weir were highly nonlinear according to the residual plots of the smooth functions fig 3 and fig s8 chl a was in general positively correlated with area tw pc l1 pc l3 and lwtp and negatively correlated with pc l2 pc l4 pc l5 and pc s1 although several variables aforementioned were nonlinearly correlated little noticeable sign correlations with chl a were observed for the other variables 3 4 sensitivity of the explanatory variables sobol sensitivities of the explanatory variables were compared between the gams at the watershed scale and a local scale with bc 25 km and bs 1 km fig 4 the sobol sensitivity rankings of the explanatory variables differed between spatial influential scales in general pc l1 pc l2 and tw had relatively higher sensitive rankings than the other variables in both cases in fig 4 the sensitivity ranking of pc l2 was always the highest in the gam at the watershed scale chl a was most sensitive to pc l2 followed by pc l1 pc l4 tw pc l3 and area while the other five variables less contributed to the chl a variation sti 0 05 for each variable in the gam at a local scale with bc 25 km and bs 1 km chl a was again most sensitive to pc l2 followed by pc l2 tw lwtp iwtp and weir while contributions of the other seven variables to the chl a variation were less significant sti 0 05 for each variable sobol sensitivities of the explanatory variables varied depending on the spatial influential scales fig 5 in general tw pc l1 and pc l2 were the three most sensitive variables with values of sti varying from 0 1 to 0 4 across the spatial scales the next sensitive group of variables included area pc l4 iwtp lwtp and weir with values of sti generally varying from 0 01 to 0 15 across the spatial scales values of sti for the other variables were relatively small sti 0 05 for most cases of the spatial scale values of sti for area tw pc l1 pc l2 pc l4 lwtp and weir showed noticeable trends with respect to bc and bs the sti value of area was always greater at a smaller bs with little noticeable trend with respect to bc in contrast values of sti for tw and weir showed little dependency on the bs value while those were generally greater at a smaller bc value pc l1 generally had a greater sti value at a smaller bs or a smaller bc value while pc l2 or pc l4 had a smaller sti value at the same condition lwtp generally had a larger sti value at a smaller bs with no monotonic trend with respect to bc sti increased as bc increased from 5 to 20 km and then decreased thereafter sti values of the other variables had little noticeable trends or randomly varied across spatial influential scales 4 discussion 4 1 explanatory power of the gam for chl a the greater explanatory power of the gam using the q3 concentration of chl a compared with med table s8 indicates that the spatial factors of the influential region can better explain higher algal growth events than they can the seasonal average algal population in a stream the explanatory power of the gam for the inter station chl a variation was dependent on the spatial influential scales the explanatory power of the model gradually increased as the upstream buffer radius increased asymptotically approaching to a maximum value suggesting that the entire watershed area affects the downstream algal biomass but with weaker influences of farther upland areas from the stream location of interest busse et al 2006 in the gam the watershed characteristics beyond the 25 km circular buffer area provided little additional information in the explanting the chl a variation fig 2 and no such critical bounds of the stream buffer were observed the critical influential scale that significantly influences on the downstream algal biomass thus can be defined by the partial area of the watershed bounded by 25 km upstream circular buffer and no stream buffer bound the explanatory variables identified as significant in the gam differed between the spatial scales indicating varying relative importance of the explanatory variables depending on the spatial scale table 3 however at all spatial influential scales with several exceptions urban and agricultural land uses were identified as the two most significant factors jointly explaining over 40 of the total inter station variation in chl a figs 4 5 more details on the explanatory power of the gam and important spatial environmental factors in relation to the spatial influential scales are discussed in the following sections 4 2 natural factors correlated with downstream algal biomass the area of the watershed area was always identified as significant and positively correlated with downstream chl a concentration for all spatial influential scales table 3 fig 3 and fig s7 the positive correlation between watershed area area and chl a concentration can be explained by the fact that a location further downstream drains a larger watershed and typically has a lower water quality rowe 1999 the slope is a natural factor that can affect the efficiency of nutrient erosion and transport cai et al 1996 richard et al 2002 and was strongly negatively correlated with agricultural area r 0 64 p 0 001 and strongly positively correlated forest r 0 90 p 0 001 in pca variables associated with the slope agricultural land use and forest land use were combined into one pc variable pc l1 representing the agricultural land use generally located at gentle slope deforested areas this combined factor pc l1 was always positively correlated with chl a at all spatial scales fig 3 and fig s7 because slope and forest were negatively loaded to pc l2 these can be regarded as the natural factors negatively correlated with the downstream algal biomass the negative correlations of the slope and forest land use with downstream chl a concentration are presumably because steeper slopes are frequently left undeveloped and forested discharging less nutrients than gentler developed hillsides brett et al 2005 chang 2008 also a watershed with a steeper slope can result in a shorter hydraulic retention time of the stream water which decreases the algal growth potential cha et al 2017 of the three climate factors investigated water temperature tw was always identified as an important variable that explained a significant proportion of the inter station variation in chl a at all spatial scales i e sti 0 1 0 27 figs 4 5 as demonstrated in many previous studies bowie et al 1985 cha et al 2017 high water temperatures favour algal growth in streams and our findings are in agreement with this figs 3 and s7 the residual plots of the gam smooth functions shows that chl a increased as the water temperature increased up to around 24 c and plateaued out thereafter figs 3 and s7 indicating the existence of an optimal condition of water temperature for algal growth bowie et al 1985 although precipitation p and radiation time trad can be very important factors for algal growth debele et al 2008 they only explained small proportions of the inter station variation in chl a sti 0 001 0 08 fig 5 or were often eliminated from the models during the variable elimination procedure in this study we did not consider the seasonal variation in climate characteristics and instead used single site representative values for these variables for each monitoring station as a result the spatial variability of these climate factors between the water quality monitoring stations within the geographical region of south korea total area 10 210 km2 was too small to obtain statistically meaningful results the coefficient of variation cov was 0 11 and 0 03 for p and trad respectively the very high sensitivity of chl a concentration to water temperature figs 4 5 is the reason why tw was included as an explanatory variable in the gams during variable selection despite its low variability cov 0 08 between the water quality monitoring stations the contribution of precipitation to downstream chl a concentration can be complex an increase in precipitation may result in greater nutrient loads entering the stream from the watershed rostami et al 2018 but these increased loads may not always be translated into elevated concentrations of the nutrients available for algal growth due to the dilution effect of increased runoff huebsch et al 2014 furthermore the greater discharge during a rainfall event can wash out algal cells in a stream jeong et al 2011 for these reasons the statistical correlation between precipitation and chl a in the streams was low figs 4 5 we used a single site representative value for precipitation for each station and thus could not consider the effect of the temporal variance in rainfall on transport behaviour complex chemical and hydrodynamic interactions or their impacts on algal growth these concerns were beyond the scope of this paper and should be addressed in future research the three soil variables pc s1 s3 jointly explained only 0 3 5 9 of the chl a variation figs 4 5 this small explainability of the soil variables is presumably because the effect of soil processes on the stream water quality can be obscured by its interactive effects with land uses taka et al 2016 the soil variable dominantly associated with inceptisols and entisols pc s1 was always identified as significant in the models and showed negative correlations with chl a although it explained only 0 4 4 of the chl a variation figs 4 5 inceptisols and entisols are both immature soils with entisols being the youngest soils schoonover and crim 2015 in south korea inceptisols and entisols are two dominant soil types 79 and 17 of all soil respectively and are predominated by loamy and sandy materials respectively hong et al 2013 pc s1 thus represents the degree of loamy material occupation in relatively immature soils a lower value of pc s1 means a higher fraction of loamy materials in the soil the negative correlation observed between pc s1 and chl a figs 3 and s7 might result because soils with higher fractions of loamy materials have smaller particle sizes and thus have more nutrient contents ge et al 2019 and greater erodibilities usda 2013 supplying more nutrients for algal growth downstream the soil variables dominantly associated with ultisols pc s2 and alfisols pc s3 were frequently removed from the models as insignificant or chl a was little sensitive to these variables table 3 and figs 4 and 5 and s7 alfisols and ultisols are well developed clay enriched soils bockheim and hartemink 2013 which may favours algal growth downstream due to high nutrient adsorption capacity and erodibility of clay materials johnson et al 1997 siliva and williams 2001 mori et al 2015 however they are generally associated with forested landscape usda 1999 and occupy only minor fractions of the entire area of south korea 3 and 1 respectively having little noticeable impacts on the downstream algal biomass 4 3 activities in the watershed correlated with downstream algal biomass all of the five variables associated with land uses pc l1 pc l5 were identified as significant explanatory variables for the chl a variation at all spatial scales except for the local scales with a stream buffer distance of 500 m where pc l5 wetland dominant was always eliminated as an insignificant variable considering the signs of the component loadings and residual plots between the smooth functions for the pc variables table s6 and figs 3 and s7 all land use types except for the forest land use were positively correlated with chl a in particular variables associated with agricultural and urban land uses were always most significantly correlated with downstream algal biomass the high correlations of agricultural and urban land uses with algal biomass observed are in agreement with many previous studies dodds et al 2002 ahearn et al 2005 ding et al 2015 the variable associated with grasslands pc l3 was positively correlated with chl a considering the sign of the component loading of this factor it can be concluded that greater areal fraction of grasslands contributes to higher chl a concentrations although the sensitivity of chl a to pc l3 was relatively low sti ranged from 0 to 0 06 across all spatial scales fig 5 the observed positive correlation between grasslands and chl a contrasts to other studies emphasizing the role of vegetated surfaces in immobilizing nutrients and thereby reducing algal growth potential downstream sabater et al 2000 brett et al 2005 liu et al 2012 our counter intuitive result might be due to contributions from the artificial turf fields often managed with excessive agrochemicals such as herbicides and insecticides the land use class grassland used in south korea includes natural grasslands as well as artificial grasslands such as golf courses grass fields parks and cemeteries comprising approximately 48 of the total area occupied by the land uses classified as grassland these artificial grasslands contain insensitively managed turf often with excessive quantity of agrochemicals applied smith and bridges 1996 rice et al 2017 bare lands were found to be a contributor to the increased chl a considering the correlations of pc l4 with bareland and chl a table s6 and figs 3 and s7 the sobol sensitivity analysis showed that bare lands are the third significant land use class affecting downstream algal biomass with measurable explainability for the chl a variation sti ranged from 0 0006 to 0 13 fig 5 the land use class bareland includes unvegetated riparian rocks mines playgrounds and other unvegetated soils bareland is characterized by sparsely vegetated open space which is vulnerable to soil erosion increasing the nutrient transport and algal growth potential downstream liu et al 2012 correlations of pc l4 with wetland and chl a table s6 and fig 3 and s7 suggested that the areal fraction of wetlands was positively correlated with chl a however the wetland variable pc l4 had relatively low sensitivity for chl a figs 4 5 or was always eliminated from the model as an insignificant variable at the local scales with a stream buffer distance of 500 m it is generally understood that wetlands typically offer eco friendly functions such as water quality improvement flood storage fish and wildlife habitat aesthetics and biological productivity lehner and doll 2004 the findings of this study thus contradict this common knowledge in south korea the wetland land use classification includes not only conventional wetlands but also various types of wetted land such as ditches grassed riverside areas and wet fallow lands 734 km2 and 1065 km2 for conventional wetlands and other types of wetted land respectively agricultural ditches and fallow lands should be reclassified as agricultural land use which is known to be a nutrient source in addition even conventional wetlands can be a source of algae for downstream waters when the effluent of the wetland is poorly managed causing algal washout wu and mitsch 1998 steinmann et al 2003 gold et al 2017 consequently the results of this study highlight the importance of managing the effluent of wetlands to prevent secondary pollution of streams in the vicinity in addition a nationwide field survey of the classification of wetlands in relation to downstream water quality is suggested variables associated with public sewage treatment plants pstp industrial wwtps iwtp and livestock wwtps lwtp were always significant and positively correlated with downstream chl a concentration suggesting their role as point pollutant sources that directly affect water quality in streams the nutrient concentrations in the effluent of all four types of wwtp were considerably higher than those in the streams fig s8 indicating that it is still necessary to control the point sources in particular the tn and tp concentrations of effluent from livestock wwtps varied greatly with very high concentrations at episodic intervals compared to the other point sources thus suggesting the need for appropriate management practices the sensitivity analysis indicated that livestock wwtps have the most significant impacts on the downstream algal biomass among the four types of wwtps explained up to 22 of the interstation chl a variation fig 5 the number density of small scale local sewage treatment plants lswp was always eliminated as an insignificant variable probably due to the fact that the total amount of effluents from all small scale plants is significantly smaller than that from other wwtps approximately 2 1 of total sewage nationwide kme 2013 and thus their impacts might be also relatively smaller than others the proximity of the water quality monitoring station to the weir downstream was found to be a significant explanatory variable with a relatively high sensitivity sti ranged from 0 03 0 19 across the spatial influential scales fig 5 the positive impact of instream weirs on algal blooms via the increase in hydraulic residence time has been reported in several previous studies park et al 2012 cha et al 2016 2017 4 4 scale effects and relative importance of the variables the impacts of upland pollutant sources on the downstream to some degree depend on the proximity of those sources to that location strayer et al 2003 in the present study the upland regions more than 25 km from the stream location provided little additional information to increase the explainability of the models in terms of the inter station variation of chl a no such critical influential region for the stream buffer was found the critical influential scale on the algal biomass depends on land use climate and hydrogeomorphology of the watershed in a watershed with widespread agricultural activities downstream nutrients and algal biomass might be well influenced by the entire watershed than by local regions because nitrate a primary nutrient species from agricultural land use travels a long distance due to its high mobility through surface and subsurface components of the watershed busse et al 2006 the critical influential scales vary depending on the rainfall and hydromorphological conditions e g slope morphology and surrounding soils influencing the surface and subsurface flow involving nutrient flux klose et al 2012 a larger flow produces a higher nutrient flux increasing the critical influential scale in this study the critical influential scale might be site dependent because each of the 688 watersheds has its own site specific conditions of the abovementioned factors influencing the scale effects therefore the critical influential scale 25 km of the upstream circular buffer observed in this study should be site averaged characteristics of the 688 watersheds in south korea from the sensitivity analyses fig 5 noticeable scale dependencies of the relative contribution to chl a variation were observed for several explanatory variables with relatively high sensitivity values such as tw pc l1 pc l2 pc l4 pc l5 iwtp lwtp and weir note that the inter scale variation of the sensitivity value for each variable only indicates how the statistical correlation of that variable with chl a varies across the scales rather than true causal effect of that variable on the chl a because the interactive effects between different variables were not explicitly considered in the regression models contribution of water temperature tw to the inter station chl a variation decreased as the circular buffer radius increased with little change with respect to the stream buffer scale it was reported in literature that upland activities such as intensive land development increases water temperature downstream hu et al 2015 furthermore temperature of point source discharge can influence on the stream water temperature we presumed that at a larger circular buffer scale water temperature and upland spatial characteristics were more interactively correlated with chl a resulting in a smaller proportion of the chl a variation explained by water temperature i e a lower sobol sensitivity of water temperature trends in the relative contributions of different land uses and point sources were noticeable impacts of agricultural land use pc l1 on chl a became greater as the spatial scale decreased for both circular buffer and stream buffer a stronger influence of agricultural land at a smaller scale observed in this study contradicts to previous studies strayer et al 2003 busse et al 2006 claiming that agricultural areas have large scale impacts on the downstream nitrate concentration the contradicting result of this study can be explained by the strong dependency of the algal biomass on phosphorous rather than nitrogen as the limiting nutrient in the south korean streams yun and an 2016 the influence of agricultural phosphorous on the stream algal biomass should be stronger from the agricultural areas at a closer location due to the low mobility of phosphorous thorough soil alfonso et al 2015 the larger relative contribution of urban land use at a larger scale for both circular and stream buffers was found a possible explanation of a larger relative importance of land use at a larger spatial scale is that nutrient export from urban land use is generally through runoffs over impervious surfaces and pipe systems efficiently delivering nutrients far downstream relative contributions of barelands and wetlands to chl a were generally greater at smaller circular buffer scales the primary mechanism of nutrient export from barelands is erosion of soils and delivery ratio of the eroded soils generally decreases as the watershed area increases verstraeten et al 2003 thus the stream water quality can be more correlated with barelands at smaller scales standing waters such as ponds and wetlands can be a direct source of chl a gold et al 2017 influencing more on the chl a level when they are closer for the point sources such as industrial wwtps and livestock wwtps their relative contributions to chl a were generally smaller at smaller stream buffer scales and larger circular buffer scales 15 km of radii this scale dependency can be explained by the fact that in south korea wwtps are typically located near streams to discharge effluents directly impacting stream water quality however note that the total contribution from all land uses showed an opposite scale dependency to that from these point sources in the statistical regression the scale dependencies of different explanatory variables were dependent of each other because interactive effects of the variables were not explicitly factored out in the gam statistical importance of the proximity of the downstream weir decreased as the circular buffer scale increased and little scale dependency was observed with respect to the stream buffer scale this scale dependency in the contribution of the weir proximity might be due to the different degrees of inter correlations between upland activities and downstream hydraulic conditions weirs at different scales jointly affecting downstream algal biomass the inter correlations between upland activities and downstream weirs might be greater at larger scales resulting in relatively smaller proportions of the chl a variation explained by the weir proximity 4 5 implications and limitations of the study the aim of this study was to examine how watersheds with different spatial environmental factors influence downstream algal growth potential using chl a concentration as a proxy for algal biomass this examination was expected to allow identification of important environmental variables their relative importance with respect to spatial scales and spatial boundaries and factors to be prioritized in establishing watershed management plans however there are several limitations of this study which should be addressed in future studies our study focused on time averaged correlations between spatial environmental factors and algal biomass in a nationwide scale and thus could not consider the seasonal effects and local variability in the correlations depending on watershed specific conditions the critical spatial scales and relative importance of the spatial environmental factors can vary depending on the watershed specific conditions such as hydrogeomorpholoty climate stream size and watershed size furthermore multiple environmental factors interactively influence on chl a for example interactive effects can be significant between radiation and temperature walter et al 2014 between upland activities and hydrologic conditions welde and gebremariam 2017 and between soil and land use taka et al 2016 therefore interactive effects of environmental variables should be further elucidated in addition the upland characteristics can be correlated across the spatial scales in our study because 1 the smaller spatial scales are nested in the larger spatial scales 2 the spatial activities occurring in a watershed can be homogeneous across the entire watershed area and 3 in some local scale analyses the entire areas of the relatively small watersheds can be always included in the influential regions regardless of the spatial scale providing similar watershed characteristics for different spatial scale analyses this scale dependency issue for watershed characteristics remained for future studies 5 conclusions we examined the correlations between spatial environmental properties in influential upland regions within a watershed and downstream chl a concentration site representative values for 17 spatial environmental variables in these regions were extracted from spatial analysis and used as explanatory variables for downstream chl a concentration generalized additive models gams were used to identify the significant explanatory variables using data from 688 water quality monitoring stations from this study the following conclusions can be drawn inter station variation in chl a was statistically better explained by an analysis of the entire watershed than by a buffer scale analysis however the spatial environmental factors of upland areas more than 25 km from the stream location did little to increase the explainability of the models in terms of chl a variation the site representative spatial environmental factors of influential upland regions better explained the inter station variation of third quartile concentrations than they did the median concentration of chl a in streams thus the spatial factors of the influential region can better explain higher algal growth events than they can the seasonal average algal population in a stream natural factors including watershed area water temperature and radiation time were identified significant to explain inter station variation of chl a water temperature was the most important explanatory variable for chl a and its relative contribution to the inter station variation of chl a was more significant at smaller scales explainability of the soil types for chl a was statistically insignificant because of their potential interactive effects with land uses land use patterns were confirmed to be a strong predictor of downstream chl a concentration in particular agricultural and urban land uses were the two most important land uses strongly associated with chl a these two land uses jointly over 40 of the total inter station variation of chl a the observed scale dependencies of contributions of agricultural and urban land uses suggested that management of these land uses should be better focused on local scales and on the entire watershed scale respectively hydraulic residence time as represented by the distance between the monitoring location and a downstream weir was found to be a statistically important predictor of high concentrations of chl a its relative contribution to the inter station variation of chl a was smaller at a larger spatial buffer scale potentially because the effects of weir and upland activities are more interactively correlated with chl a at a larger scale analysis of the four types of wastewater treatment plants livestock wastewater treatment plants were generally more strongly related to chl a levels than others relative contributions of point sources to the inter station chl a variation were smaller at larger scale analyses as those of land use patterns become more significant at larger scale analyses we examined relative importance and its scale dependency of natural and man made spatial properties of the watershed for determining downstream algal growth potential this information can support managers in establishing cost effective watershed management plans as well as motivate further research to examine interactive effects of the environmental factors and their mechanisms to elucidate the

process water ospw adsorption results demonstrated that the mesoporous carbonaceous material can successfully be used to adsorb persistent and toxic organic contaminants from ospw carbon xerogel cx made at ph 5 5 showed high surface area 573 m2 g and removed a larger amount of aef than cx made at ph 6 9 391 m2 g the adsorption equilibrium was reached by 24 h for both aef and classical nas 74 6 of aef and 88 8 of classical nas were removed by cx5 5 during 24 h adsorption with respect to classical nas a larger the carbon number resulted in higher na removal carbon number had more influence on na removal when compared with hydrogen deficiency resulting from rings or unsaturated bonding formation z number the equilibrium adsorption capacity was found to be 15 mg aef g and 7 8 mg nas g for cx5 5 adsorption of aef and classical nas onto cx5 5 followed pseudo second order kinetics with respect to diffusion of aef and nas there were three distinct diffusion regions bulk film and pore pore diffusion had the lowest rate constant in all cases analyzed and was thus the rate limiting step the results of this study showed that a mesoporous carbonaceous material such as cx may have the potential to be utilized in a fixed bed adsorption filtration systems for continuous treatment of ospw or as a semi passive treatment method in pit lakes for the removal of organic constituents from ospw keywords oil sands process water adsorption carbon xerogel naphthenic acids mesoporous carbonaceous adsorbent 1 introduction as one of the largest oil deposits in the world the alberta oil sands are composed of approximately 10 bitumen mixed with 5 water and 85 mineral solids allen 2008a zubot et al 2012 the high content of mineral solids mainly sand clay and silt renders it necessary to first extract the bitumen from the oil sands by the clark caustic hot water extraction method which requires approximately 3 m3 of water for every m3 of oil sands processed resulting in the production of 4 m3 of tailings government of alberta 2011 alberta energy regulator 2014 water that has come into contact with oil sands or has been released from tailings is referred to as oil sands process

although nas account for less than 50 of the organic fraction of ospw some studies have indicated that nas are a contributor to the acute and chronic toxicity of ospw affecting aquatic and mammalian species jones et al 2011 klamerth et al 2015 li et al 2017 mackinnon and boerger 1986 in addition nas are also one of the primary causes of corrosion to the equipment used during bitumen extraction however they are needed during the extraction of bitumen from the sand derungs 1956 fan 1991 quinlan and tam 2015 research on treatment methods for ospw started as early as the 1970s and initially focused on solid liquid separation aimed at enhancing settling rates of tailings and recovery of process water some remediation methods have included adsorption gamal el din et al 2011 pourrezaei et

shown that nas among other constituents in ospw contribute to the acute and sub chronic toxicity of ospw to aquatic and mammalian species adsorption is an effective method that can be used to remove organic contaminants from an aqueous solution this includes nas zubot et al 2012 initially ospw was treated by adsorption in order to remove oil and other organic foulants so that the water could be further used in the bitumen extraction process but currently adsorption of ospw has been investigated with the intent of removing or reducing the na concentration allen 2008b islam et al 2014

advantageous for adsorption the presence of bulky organic contaminants can pose a problem when using an ac composed of mainly micropores as some of the surface area thought to be available for adsorption on or within ac may not be accessible to the larger organic contaminants wu and zhao 2011 carbon xerogels cx are polymer derived mesoporous materials which can be customized in order to accommodate larger sized adsorbates mahata et al 2007 cx can have high surface area 400 1200 m2 g controllable pore size and high adsorption capacity these qualities make cx a potential adsorbent

understanding of the kinetics involved in the removal of aef and nas by cx and 5 determine the types of diffusion involved in the adsorption of aef and nas by cx using a diffusion model this manuscript presents the only study that uses a mainly mesoporous material with a high surface area carbon xerogel cx for adsorption of organics in ospw and presents detailed information regarding adsorption capacity adsorption kinetics and adsorption mechanism the synthesis of the cx was not a focus of the study 2 materials and methods 2 1 ospw and chemicals raw ospw was collected from an oil

preparation technique involving the polycondensation of formaldehyde and resorcinol job et al 2004 mahata et al 2007 messele et al 2017 two types of cx were prepared denoted as cx5 5 and cx6 9 cx5 5 was prepared at ph 5 5 and cx6 9 was prepared at ph 6 9 detailed information regarding the synthesis of the carbon xerogel adsorbent material can be found in the supporting information si 2 3 carbon

1mp quanthachrome usa the detailed methods of cx textural property characterization techniques are provided in the si 2 4 effect of adsorbent dose experiments the effect of adsorbent dose was studied by varying the amount of carbon xerogel added to a specified volume of ospw for 24 h adsorption time the following doses of each type of carbon xerogel cx5 5 and cx6 9 were added to a specific amount of ospw 0 5 g l 1 g l 1 5 g l 2 g l 2 5 g l 3 g l 4 g l 5 g l 6 g l for each reactor 50 ml of raw ospw was transferred to an erlenmeyer flask the calculated amount of adsorbent material was weighed out and added to a reactor ready with raw ospw and the start time was recorded the reactor was covered and placed on a new brunswick innova 2100 platform shaker eppendorf inc usa set at 200 rpm for 24 h after 24 h the ospw and the carbon xerogel were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter to remove the adsorbent material from the ospw the filtered ospw sample was collected and saved for ft ir extraction analysis and uplc ms tof analysis 2 5 equilibrium time experiments and kinetics experiments equilibrium time experiments ete and kinetics experiments were conducted together the data were used to determine the equilibrium time required in order for a sample of cx in ospw to reach equilibrium with respect to adsorption of aef and or nas additionally the data could be used to study the kinetics of aef and na adsorption for the equilibrium time and kinetics experiments the adsorbent used was cx5 5 and the adsorbent dose was 3 g l the adsorption times for the reactors were as follows subscript denotes the sampling time with unit t0min t5min t10min t15min t0 5hr t2hr t4hr t6hr t18hr and t24hr a separate reactor was required for each time as the sample volume of raw ospw used was at least 35 ml each experiment was conducted in duplicate a control experiment was conducted without carbon xerogel 2 6 data analyses the amount of adsorbate removed by the adsorbent for a certain time can be represented by q t shown by equation 1 1 q t c 0 c t v m where qt is the amount of adsorbate removed by the adsorbent at time t mg adsorbate g adsorbent ct is the concentration of adsorbate in the bulk solution at time t mg adsorbate l c0 is the concentration of the adsorbate in bulk solution at the starting time mg adsorbate l v is the volume of the aqueous phase containing the adsorbate l and m is the mass of the adsorbent material g when the rate of adsorption equals the rate of desorption then equilibrium is achieved at this point the capacity of the adsorbent has been reached at equilibrium the concentration of adsorbate in the aqueous phase will show little to no change over time and is denoted by ce which replaces ct in equation 1 to give the adsorption capacity q e aef experimental concentration data for varying doses and 24 h adsorption time were fit to the langmuir and freundlich isotherm equations these equations are shown in more detail in the si experimental aef concentration data and the classical na concentration data resulting from 3 g l dose and varying adsorption times 0 24 h were fit to the pseudo first order pfo model and pseudo second order pso model in order to examine adsorption kinetics these equations are presented in the si experimental aef concentration data and the classical na concentration data resulting from 3 g l dose and varying adsorption times 0 24 h were fit to the weber and morris intraparticle diffusion model in order to determine diffusion mechanism and rate limiting steps during adsorption the weber morris intraparticle diffusion model is described in more detail in the si 2 7 chemical analyses the ospw was analyzed by looking at the aef and the classical nas the aef extraction method and ft ir analysis method are found in detail elsewhere rogers et al 2002 zubot et al 2012 and provided in the si ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with time of flight mass spectrometer uplc tof ms was used to quantify nas wang et al 2016b six samples were chosen for analysis by uplc tof ms raw ospw ospw following adsorption with 3 g l dose of cx5 5 for time of 10 min 30 min 2 h 6 h and 24 h all experiments treatments were conducted in duplicate however only one of the duplicate samples was analyzed in uplc tofms analyses injecting only one sample proceeds the checking and confirmation of the consistency of the two sets of the treated samples using other analyses additionally raw ospw as well as standards were injected to adjust and confirm the calibration the consistency and the accuracy of the uplc system 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbon xerogel properties table 1 gives physical properties for the cx adsorbent material that was used for the adsorption experiments the brunauer emmet and teller bet surface area is shown in the first column for each type of cx of the two types of cx made cx5 5 had the larger bet surface area of 573 10 m2 g approximately 87 of the pore volume contained in the sample of cx5 5 was due to the presence of mesopores cx6 9 had a smaller bet surface area 391 m2 g and about 42 of the pore volume contained in the sample was due to the presence of micropores the total pore volume for cx5 5 was almost 6 times that for cx6 9 the pore size distributions of carbon xerogel fig s1 in si section showed that both types of cx did contain both mesopores and micropores cx5 5 had a broader range of mesopores 3 32 5 nm with most of the pores occurring in the region from 3 to 17 5 nm around a maximum of about 10 nm cx6 9 had a much narrower pore size distribution in the mesopore region 2 5 5 nm with a maximum of about 4 nm based upon these results alone one can conclude that the adsorbent material which will perform better for the adsorption of aef from ospw is cx5 5 this is due to the higher surface area and the higher total volume due to pores for cx5 5 3 2 effect of adsorbent dose the effect of adsorbent dose on adsorption of aef in ospw is shown in fig 1 for both cx5 5 and cx6 9 higher doses of adsorbent material resulted in higher aef removal this same trend was seen by pourrezaei et al 2014a b for both aef and chemical oxygen demand cod removal using petroleum coke pc as well islam et al 2018 found that higher doses of granular activated carbon gac resulted in higher removal of aef and classical nas the trend seen is most likely because a higher adsorbent mass means that there is more surface area available for the aef to readily adsorb onto resulting in higher aef removal khan et al 2011 there was a notable difference between the removal by cx5 5 and cx6 9 cx5 5 achieved 89 removal for 6 g l dose and adsorption time of 24 h while cx6 9 only resulted in slightly more than 14 removal using the same dose and adsorption time for doses higher than 1 g l removal by cx5 5 continued to increase but at a decreasing rate on the other hand removal by cx6 9 increased very little initially and began to plateau by a dose of 4 g l the low removal by cx6 9 can be linked directly to the cx properties table 1 and narrow pore size distribution fig s1 lower removal of aef by cx6 9 in comparison to cx5 5 was expected due to the higher pore size distribution higher bet surface area and total pore volume for cx5 5 niasar et al 2016 due to the low aef removal at all tested doses it was concluded that cx6 9 was not an efficient adsorbent for the treatment of ospw even with very high doses of cx6 9 it seems unlikely that aef removal above 25 could be achieved using cx6 9 therefore all further adsorption studies were conducted using only cx5 5 from table 1 a dose of 3 g l of cx5 5 achieved a removal of 73 5 aef after this dose the removal of aef achieved with each added g of cx5 5 decreases to less than 10 per added g of cx for this reason the dose of 3 g l of cx5 5 was chosen as the dose for the kinetic studies this dose achieves a fairly high removal but attempts to keep down the amount of cx added 3 3 aef and na removal the results of the equilibrium time and kinetics experiments for adsorption of aef by cx5 5 are shown in fig 2 a for a 3 g l dose of cx5 5 aef concentration decreased rapidly in the first 6 h from 6 h to 18 h aef concentration decreased in the treated ospw but at a decreasing rate between 18 and 24 h the aef concentration levels out reaching a plateau around 74 6 by 18 h a sample of cx5 5 in ospw reached equilibrium with respect to removal of aef a similar trend was reported for the adsorption of aef in ospw onto gac islam et al 2018 in addition to aef concentration data raw ospw and treated ospw samples post adsorption were analyzed by uplc tof ms in order to obtain classical na concentration fig 2b shows the classical nas concentration and removal curves as a function of time for ospw that was treated by adsorption for up to 24 h using a 3 g l dose of cx5 5 the results were very similar to those obtained using the aef concentration data for adsorption with cx5 5 fig 2a the main difference being that classical na removal was nearly 89 for 24 h adsorption and aef removal was 74 6 for the same adsorption time in the first 2 h of adsorption there was a drastic reduction of classical na concentration 72 by an adsorption time of 6 h there was an 86 3 reduction in classical nas after this time the removal increased a few percent to a final removal of 88 8 for 24 h adsorption time figure s2 shows the classical na concentration profiles in ospw as a function of carbon and z numbers before and after treatment with 3 g l cx5 5 for a 24 h time adsorption nas found in raw ospw fig s2a were in the carbon range of 9 21 and had z values ranging from 0 to 18 with respect to carbon number the majority of nas were found in the range of 12 18 with the peak value occurring for carbon number 14 with respect to z the na distribution was bimodal with two distinct peaks the larger peak occurred at z value of 4 however it is important to note that the second largest concentration of na occurred for z value of 6 after this the na concentrations decreased for z values of 8 and 10 the lesser peak occurred at z value of 12 this was the third largest concentration of nas with respect to z value therefore a majority of the classical nas in the raw ospw were bicyclic tricyclic and hexacyclic the differences between the raw ospw described here and elsewhere are due to the widely varying nature of ospw in combination with differences in the bitumen ore sampling dates and changes in extraction methods gamal el din et al 2011 post adsorption the ospw classical na concentration was reduced from 26 3 mg l to 2 94 mg l classical nas with carbon number 17 and above were almost completely removed nas with carbon number 19 20 and 21 were removed in totality for the nas remaining post adsorption the peak concentration occurred for carbon number 12 this means that more carbon number 14 was removed by adsorption than carbon number 12 this is supported by results shown in fig s3a which shows the normalized classical na concentration profiles as a function of time for each carbon number in general nas with the higher carbon numbers experienced greater removal as demonstrated by the data for carbon number 12 and above classical nas with carbon numbers 9 through 11 had the least removal by adsorption nas with higher carbon number have higher hydrophobicity which leads to greater adsorption zubot et al 2012 these results are consistent with results reported by islam et al 2018 pourrezaei et al 2014a b and zubot et al 2012 figure s3b shows the normalized classical na concentration profiles as a function of time for each z number results from fig s2 in combination with data shown in fig s3b indicate that cx5 5 was effective at adsorbing nas with higher cyclicity these findings are consistent with previous results for adsorption treatment of ospw gamal el din et al 2011 pourrezaei et al 2014a b zubot et al 2012 with respect to z the classical na distribution was no longer bimodal post adsorption for values of z greater than or equal to 8 classical na concentrations were present in amounts less than 0 2 mg l a peak concentration of 1 04 mg nas l occurred at z value of 4 this was also the z value with the highest concentration in raw ospw classical nas with z value of 2 were the least removed unlike the results obtained for na removal as a function of carbon number complete removal of na for any z number were not observed this indicates that carbon number had a greater influence on adsorption of nas than z these results are consistent with results found by pourezzaei et al 2014a b the removal of classical nas as a function of carbon number and z number in raw and treated ospw for different adsorption times is shown in fig 3 greater adsorption time led to greater na removal as also shown by fig 2b the removal results for 6 h adsorption are not far below the final removal after 24 h adsorption for both carbon and z numbers for 24 h adsorption time only carbon numbers 13 through 21 experienced at least 80 removal nas with carbon number less than 12 had removal values that varied between 38 and 47 with no clear removal trend for 24 h adsorption time nas with z values of 4 18 resulted in at least 80 removal there was a wider range of resulting na removal as a function of carbon number 38 4 100 compared to z number 54 9 97 9 this further supports the previous statement that carbon number had a greater influence on na adsorption than z number 3 4 adsorption capacity of cx5 5 the equilibrium adsorption capacity of cx5 5 as a function of equilibrium aef concentration is shown in fig s4 the equilibrium adsorption capacity for cx5 5 was at a minimum for the lowest resulting equilibrium aef concentration which occurred with the highest cx5 5 dose 6 g l and conversely the highest resulting equilibrium adsorption capacities occurred for the highest equilibrium aef concentrations which occurred with the lowest cx5 5 doses 0 5 and 1 g l the same trend of an increasing adsorbent dose resulting in a decreasing adsorption capacity was also reported by pourrezaei et al 2014a b khan et al 2011 and islam et al 2018 at low adsorbent dose the adsorption sites become saturated and after a point are no longer able to adsorb organic material this leads to the lower removal efficiencies xing et al 2008 when higher amounts of adsorbent were present some adsorption sites remained unsaturated during the adsorption process thus lowering the adsorption capacity but increasing the removal efficiency khan et al 2011 the langmuir and freundlich adorption isothems for the aef concentration data resulting from cx5 5 adsorption experiments with raw ospw for adsorption time of 24 h are shown in fig s5 si the constants for the linearlized langmuir isotherm were as follows kads of 0 058 l mg qmax of 30 77 mg g cx5 5 and correlation coefficient of 0 971 the constants for the linearized freundlich isotherm are as follows kf of 3 41 l1 n mg 1 1 n g 1 1 n of 0 513 and correlation coefficient of 0 982 the freundlich model showed the best correlation for the aef data indicating that adsorption of aef was multilayered this was to be expected as islam et al 2018 observed the same result for adsorption of both aef and nas in ospw using gac for the freundlich isotherm islam et al 2018 obtained a higher kf value 4 46 and 1 n value 0 74 it is important to note that the langmuir qmax value obtained using gac varied in literature islam et al 2018 reported a value of 98 5 mg aef g gac while pourrezaei et al 2014a reported a qmax value of 51 mg aef g gac the value reported by pourrezaei et al 2014a was closer to that obtained by the cx5 5 the experimental adsorption capacities of aef by cx5 5 ranged from 6 7 mg g to approximately 24 mg g for cx5 5 doses from 0 5 g l to 6 g l respectively in a previous study for gac doses from 0 05 g l to 2 g l the resulting adsorption capacities for aef ranged from about 65 mg g to 104 mg g islam et al 2018 for a 50 g l dose of non activated pc gac and pac the resulting aef adsorption equilibrium capacities were 1 02 mg l 50 5 mg g and 71 0 mg g respectively pourrezaei et al 2014a b in general the adsorption capacities for cx5 5 fell between the resulting adsorption capacities for pc and gac pac however a direct comparison of resulting adsorption capacities is not possible since different sources of raw ospw were used and since different doses of adsorbent material were used by islam et al 2018 and pourezzaei et al 2014a b zubot et al 2012 demonstrated that very high dose of up to 40 wt pc in ospw 400 g l can lead to very low aef adsorption capacities ranging from 0 1 to 0 43 mg g in general the adsorption capacity results obtained for cx5 5 fell in the general range to be expected when considering that the bet surface area for cx5 5 was higher than that for pc 7 7 m2 g but lower than that for pac 800 m2 g and gac 912 m2 g pourrezaei et al 2014a b comparison of experimental equilibrium adsorption capacities of aef and nas by cx5 5 3 g l dose is shown in fig s6 the equilibrium adsorption capacity obtained by aef concentration data was 15 mg aef g cx5 5 and by overall tof ms classical na concentration data was 7 8 mg nas g cx5 5 the adsorption capacity obtained using the na concentration data was approximately half of that obtained using the aef concentration data this is to be expected since the initial concentrations of aef and classical nas in the raw ospw were 61 2 mg l and 26 3 mg l respectively the equilibrium adsorption capacities of classical nas by cx5 5 in ospw were determined for each carbon and z numbers fig 4 in the case of carbon number highest adsorption capacity occurred for carbon number 14 with respect to z number the adsorption capacities had a bimodal distribution peak values at z of 4 and 12 the equilibrium adsorption capacity of nas by carbon number and z number followed the same trend that was obtained for the raw ospw classical na concentration data fig s2a this is a strong indication that the adsorption capacity of nas onto cx5 5 was highly dependent on the initial na concentration in ospw these results are also supported by the amount of classical nas adsorbed onto cx5 5 qt as a function of time and carbon number fig s7 the resulting curves followed the same trends found for the initial na concentrations in raw ospw as well islam et al 2018 found that differences in adsorption capacities obtained for adsorption of nas onto gac were a result of initial concentrations found in the raw ospw another possible explanation regarding the bimodal trend for adsorption capacity with respect to z might be due to the pore size distribution fig s1 fig s1 shows a pore size distribution for cx5 5 that only has one peak however if more data points closer to 0 å were added this might result in another peak in the range of 0 25 å for both types of cx while qe as a function of carbon number fig 4 followed a trend very similar to the initial na concentration data presented in fig s2a it was not always the case that a carbon number with a higher initial na concentration than a different carbon number would result in an adsorption capacity that was higher as well the initial na concentrations for carbon numbers 13 and 17 were 3 3 and 3 1 mg l respectively carbon number 13 had a higher initial concentration but a lower adsorption capacity 0 90 mg g than carbon number 17 1 0 mg g this phenomenon occurred for carbon numbers 12 and 19 11 and 20 and 10 and 21 these results indicate that adsorption capacity was not only a function of initial na concentration but also a function of carbon number to some exent for carbon numbers having similar initial concentrations the higher adsorption capacity resulted for the nas with a higher carbon number 3 5 kinetics of adsorption kinetics of adsorption is the study of how fast the adsorbate attaches to the adsorbent surface and is important to understand in order to design a full scale batch process with optimum operating conditions kalavathy et al 2005 kinetics of adsorption data were analyzed using two kinetic models pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso models the pfo kinetic model using the aef concentration data is shown in fig 5 a as seen the entire data set was not linear but consists of two different linear regions called phase a and phase b each of the regions was modeled separately to obtain the highest correlation coefficient values the kinetic parameters for the pfo model of aef adsorption is shown in table 2 for comparison with the aef pfo kinetics results the classical na concentration data were used to model the adsorption of classical nas onto cx5 5 the pfo modeling of adsorption of classical nas is shown in fig 6 a with corresponding kinetic parameters found in table 2 as with aef data the two apparent phases for the na concentration data were modeled separately using the pfo model fig 6a the pseudo second order pso kinetic model of the aef concentration data is shown in fig 5b with the corresponding kinetic parameters summarized in table 2 the resulting pso modeling for adsorption of classical nas is shown in fig 6b and all of the corresponding rate constants are found in table 2 with respect to correlation coefficients the pso kinetic model resulted in coefficient values that were 1 0 for both aef and nas correlation coefficient values for the pfo model ranged from 0 93 to 1 0 for the different phases if the data were not modeled in separate phases the correlation coefficients would be farther off from 1 0 although the pso kinetic model resulted in correlation coefficients of 1 0 this by itself was not enough to determine which model best represented the data if one takes into consideration the error that can be calculated by comparing the experimental equilibrium adsorption capacity qe with the equilibrium adsorption capacity obtained by use of the model in question qmod then it becomes more clear which model is more representative of the kinetics of adsorption onto cx5 5 for the pfo kinetic model the error for the aef data was 4 61 and 56 1 for phase a and phase b and for the nas data the error is 10 3 and 56 7 for phase a and phase b for the pso kinetic model the error for the aef data was 2 63 and for the na data the error was 1 16 thus the pso kinetic model was more representative of adsorption of aef and nas onto cx5 5 this result was in agreement with published findings by islam et al 2018 when comparing pfo and pso modeling of ospw aef and na adsorption data onto gac using the na concentration data it was possible to take a closer look at the adsorption kinetics of classical nas with specific carbon numbers and z numbers initially a lower carbon number resulting in a low adsorption capacity n 12 and a higher carbon number n 15 resulting in a higher adsorption capacity were chosen for analysis as well the two z values z 4 and 12 resulting in the two peak na uptake values were chosen for analysis the resulting pfo and pso models for carbon number 12 and 15 are presented in fig s8 and those for z of 4 and z of 12 are shown in fig s9 comparison of correlation coefficients and calculated qe mod values for each kinetic model table 2 show that the kinetics of adsorption for each carbon number 12 and 15 and z number 4 and 12 followed pso kinetics for the pso kinetics model it should be noted that the rate of adsorption for nas with carbon number 12 was 6 05 g mg h this rate constant was much higher than that obtained using total na concentration data 0 418 g mg h or classical nas with carbon number 15 concentration data 2 41 g mg h to further understand this phenomenon additional pso rate constants at different carbon number 13 17 and 18 were determined and are shown in table s1 as carbon number increased or decreased away from carbon number 14 the rate constant increased this same trend was reported by islam et al 2018 for pso rate constants found for different carbon number in raw nas in general the pso rate constant seemed to be inversely proportional to the initial concentration of nas for different carbon number also shown in table 2 there was a lower rate constant for those nas that were initially present at higher concentration a similar trend in the relation between initial adsorbate concentration and pso rate constants was observed by wang et al 2018 for the adsorption of different nitrosamines by nanoscale zero valent iron gac composites to determine if a relationship existed between carbon number or z number and the adsorption rate constants obtained for the pso kinetic model the effect of initial na concentration on the resulting equilibrium adsorption capacity had to be reduced two carbon numbers 13 and 17 with very similar initial na concentrations and two z numbers 10 and 16 with similar initial na concentrations were chosen for analysis table s1 shows the resulting rate constants for the pso model for n or z value the concentration of nas with carbon number 13 was slightly higher than that of nas with carbon number 17 and the rate of adsorption was 1 4 times higher for carbon number 17 part of this may be due to the phenomenon previously discussed higher initial concentration resulted in a higher pso rate constant but it also seems that nas with higher carbon number may have had a role nas with higher carbon numbers were more completely removed even when they had a smaller initial concentration as shown by the classical na concentration removal data fig 3 as discussed in section 3 3 nas with higher carbon number were more completely removed pourrezaei et al 2014a b zubot et al 2012 the concentration of nas with z number 16 was slightly higher than that of nas with z of 10 however in this case the rate constant of nas with z of 16 was 1 3 times higher than that for nas with z of 10 with the effect of the initial na concentration reduced it can be seen that nas with higher z number result in a higher pso rate constant despite having the higher pso rate constant 92 9 of nas with z value of 16 were removed after 24 h while 94 6 of nas with z value of 10 were removed after 24 h this shows that with respect to z value carbon number has a greater influence on adsorption of nas than z as mentioned in section 3 3 3 6 adsorption mechanisms the weber and morris intraparticle diffusion model in combination with the classical nas concentration data were used to determine the diffusion mechanism and rate limiting steps during adsorption as discussed by nethaji et al 2013 if the plot of q t versus t 1 2 passes though the origin then this indicates that the intraparticle diffusion is the sole rate limiting step however if the plot does not pass through the origin but instead though an intercept c then the rate limiting step is a result of additional steps the intercept c is an indicator of the boundary layer effect a larger intercept indicates that a particular step plays a more significant role in the determination of the rate limiting step kalavathy et al 2005 in general adsorption is thought to consist of three steps 1 mass transfer across the film boundary layer surrounding the adsorbent 2 internal or external adsorption on the adsorbent surface with physical or chemical binding considered extremely rapid 3 adsorbate diffusion to adsorption sites by pore diffusion or solid surface diffusion mechanisms cheung et al 2007 the intraparticle diffusion model for adsorption of aef onto cx5 5 is shown in fig 5c the plot was multilinear with three linear regions which suggests that three steps governed the adsorption of aef onto cx5 5 this is in contrast to the results obtained by islam et al 2018 which showed only two distinct regions representing film and pore diffusion table 2 summarizes the rate constants calculated for each region in fig 5c each region represented one of three types of diffusion bulk film and pore the first region shown on the far left side represented bulk diffusion this region had the highest rate constant of 12 mg g h1 2 the second region shown in the middle represented film diffusion this was mass transfer through the film surrounding the adsorbent material that took more time when compared with mass transfer through the bulk liquid the third region shown on the right hand side represents pore diffusion this was mass transfer within the pores of the adsorbent material the pore diffusion region encompassed the most amount of time and had the lowest rate constant for all three regions 0 369 mg g h1 2 once the mass travels through the bulk liquid it begins to slow down as it travels into and through the film surrounding the adsorbent the mass slows down even more once it encounters the actual adsorbent material and begins to traverse first through the larger macropores and down into the mesopores pore diffusion was the rate limiting step in addition to film diffusion for the adsorption of aef by cx5 5 this result was in agreement with that presented by islam et al 2018 pore diffusion was rate limiting for adsorption of aef using gac a similar trend was observed for the classical na concentration data treated using the weber and morris model there were three distinct phases present fig 6c with the values of rate constants for each region table 2 following the same trend as seen for the aef concentration data ki bulk ki film ki pore the intraparticle diffusion model was applied to specific nas with certain carbon number and certain z numbers the results are shown in tables 2 and s1 unlike the pso rate constants the intraparticle diffusion model rate constants for the bulk and film regions were directly proportional to the initial concentration of the nas since they generally followed the same trend as the initial concentration data deviation from the initial concentration data trend was found for nas with higher carbon number 17 and 18 for higher carbon number the intraparticle diffusion model rate constant for the bulk diffusion region tended to be higher than a similar starting concentration for nas with lower carbon number for carbon number 17 the rate constant for the film diffusion region was higher when compared with carbon number 13 which had a slightly higher starting initial concentration these deviations support the earlier claim that nas with higher carbon number had some influence on the removal of those particular nas the rate constant for the pore diffusion region also showed high dependence on the initial concentration of the nas however there were also some deviations based upon carbon number and z number nas with carbon number 13 had the highest rate constant but had the second highest initial concentration in addition nas with z of 16 had the lowest rate constant in the pore diffusion region but had the second lowest initial concentration in the pore diffusion region this may suggest that although initial na concentration was a major factor in determination of the rate constant smaller nas carbon number that were less bulky z number tended to diffuse faster within the pores of the carbon xerogel 4 conclusions the results of this study demonstrated that a mesoporous carbonaceous material can successfully be used to adsorb persistent and toxic organic contaminants from ospw of the two different types of cx used cx made at ph 5 5 removed a substantially larger amount of aef than cx made at ph 6 9 due to its higher surface area and pore diameter the adsorption equilibrium was reached by about 24 h for both aef and classical nas after 24 h of adsorption 74 6 of aef and 88 8 of classical nas were removed upon closer examination of classical na removal it was found that the larger the carbon number the higher the removal was carbon number had more influence on nas removal when compared with z number for a 3 g l dose of cx 5 5 the equilibrium adsorption capacity was found to be 15 mg aef g cx5 5 and 7 8 mg nas g cx5 5 adsorption of aef and classical nas onto cx5 5 followed pseudo second order kinetics with respect to diffusion of aef and nas there were three distinct regions bulk diffusion film diffusion and pore diffusion the rate limiting step in all cases analyzed was pore diffusion in general cx made at ph 5 5 exhibited excellent adsorption performance due to its highly mesoporous characteristics so it could be used in engineered reactors or as a pre or post treatment for passive semi passive treatment approaches such as in tailing ponds pit lakes constructed wet lands for the removal of organic matters

18997,this study illustrated the preparation characterization and the use of carbon xerogel materials for the adsorption of acid extractable fractions aef and naphthenic acids nas from oil sands process water ospw adsorption results demonstrated that the mesoporous carbonaceous material can successfully be used to adsorb persistent and toxic organic contaminants from ospw carbon xerogel cx

of aef and 88 8 of classical nas were removed by cx5 5 during 24 h adsorption with respect to classical nas a larger the carbon number resulted in higher na removal carbon number had more influence on

cx5 5 adsorption of aef and classical nas onto cx5 5 followed pseudo second order kinetics with respect to diffusion of aef and nas there were three distinct diffusion regions bulk film and pore pore

are composed of approximately 10 bitumen mixed with 5 water and 85 mineral solids allen 2008a zubot et al 2012 the high content of mineral solids mainly sand clay and silt renders it necessary to first extract the bitumen from the oil sands by the clark caustic hot water extraction method which requires approximately 3 m3 of water for every m3 of oil sands processed resulting in the production of 4 m3 of tailings government of alberta 2011 alberta energy regulator 2014 water that has come into contact with oil sands or has been released from tailings is referred to as oil sands process

advantageous for adsorption the presence of bulky organic contaminants can pose a problem when using an ac composed of mainly micropores as some of the surface area thought to be available for

1mp quanthachrome usa the detailed methods of cx textural property characterization techniques are provided in the si 2 4 effect of adsorbent dose experiments the effect of adsorbent dose was studied by varying the amount of carbon xerogel added to a specified volume of ospw for 24 h adsorption time the following doses of each type of carbon xerogel cx5 5 and cx6 9 were added to a specific amount of ospw 0 5 g l 1 g l 1 5 g l 2 g l 2 5 g l 3 g l 4 g l 5 g l 6 g l for each reactor 50 ml of raw ospw was transferred to an erlenmeyer flask the calculated amount of adsorbent material was weighed out and added to a reactor ready with raw ospw and the start time was recorded the reactor was covered and placed on a new brunswick innova 2100 platform shaker eppendorf inc usa set at 200 rpm for 24 h after 24 h the ospw and the carbon xerogel were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter to remove the adsorbent material from the ospw the filtered ospw sample was collected and saved for ft ir extraction analysis and uplc ms tof analysis 2 5 equilibrium time experiments and kinetics experiments equilibrium time experiments ete and kinetics experiments were conducted together the data were used to determine the equilibrium time required in order for a sample of cx in ospw to reach equilibrium with respect to adsorption of aef and or nas additionally the data could be used to study the kinetics of aef and na adsorption for the equilibrium time and kinetics experiments the adsorbent used was cx5 5 and the adsorbent dose was 3 g l the adsorption times for the reactors were as follows subscript denotes the sampling time with unit t0min t5min t10min t15min t0 5hr t2hr t4hr t6hr t18hr and t24hr a separate reactor was required for each time as the sample volume of raw ospw used was at least 35 ml each experiment was conducted in duplicate a control experiment was conducted without carbon xerogel 2 6 data analyses the amount of adsorbate removed by the adsorbent for a certain time can be represented by q t shown by equation 1 1 q t c 0 c t v m where qt is the amount of adsorbate removed by the adsorbent at time t mg adsorbate g adsorbent ct is the concentration of adsorbate in the bulk solution at time t mg adsorbate l c0 is the concentration of the adsorbate in bulk solution at the starting time mg adsorbate l v is the volume of the aqueous phase containing the adsorbate l and m is the mass of the adsorbent material g when the rate of adsorption equals the rate of desorption then equilibrium is achieved at this point the capacity of the adsorbent has been reached at equilibrium the concentration of adsorbate in the aqueous phase will show little to no change over time and is denoted by ce which replaces ct in equation 1 to give the adsorption capacity q e aef experimental concentration data for varying doses and 24 h adsorption time were fit to the langmuir and freundlich isotherm equations these equations are shown in more detail in the si experimental aef concentration data and the classical na concentration data resulting from 3 g l dose and varying adsorption times 0 24 h were fit to the pseudo first order pfo model and pseudo second order pso model in order to examine adsorption kinetics these equations are presented in the si experimental aef concentration data and the classical na concentration data resulting from 3 g l dose and varying adsorption times 0 24 h were fit to the weber and morris intraparticle diffusion model in order to determine diffusion mechanism and rate limiting steps during adsorption the weber morris intraparticle diffusion model is described in more detail in the si 2 7 chemical analyses the ospw was analyzed by looking at the aef and the classical nas the aef extraction method and ft ir analysis method are found in detail elsewhere rogers et al 2002 zubot et al 2012 and provided in the si ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with time of flight mass spectrometer uplc tof ms was used to quantify nas wang et al 2016b six samples were chosen for analysis by uplc tof ms raw ospw ospw following adsorption with 3 g l dose of cx5 5 for time of 10 min 30 min 2 h 6 h and 24 h all experiments treatments were conducted in duplicate however only one of the duplicate samples was analyzed in uplc tofms analyses injecting only one sample proceeds the checking and confirmation of the consistency of the two sets of the treated samples using other analyses additionally raw ospw as well as standards were injected to adjust and confirm the calibration the consistency and the accuracy of the uplc system 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbon xerogel properties table 1 gives physical properties for the cx adsorbent material that was used for the adsorption experiments the brunauer emmet and teller bet surface area is shown in the first column for each type of cx of the two types of cx made cx5 5 had the larger bet surface area of 573 10 m2 g approximately 87 of the pore volume contained in the sample of cx5 5 was due to the presence of mesopores cx6 9 had a smaller bet surface area 391 m2 g and about 42 of the pore volume contained in the sample was due to the presence of micropores the total pore volume for cx5 5 was almost 6 times that for cx6 9 the pore size distributions of carbon xerogel fig s1 in si section showed that both types of cx did contain both mesopores and micropores cx5 5 had a broader range of mesopores 3 32 5 nm with most of the pores occurring in the region from 3 to 17 5 nm around a maximum of about 10 nm cx6 9 had a much narrower pore size distribution in the mesopore region 2 5 5 nm with a maximum of about 4 nm based upon these results alone one can conclude that the adsorbent material which will perform better for the adsorption of aef from ospw is cx5 5 this is due to the higher surface area and the higher total volume due to pores for cx5 5 3 2 effect of adsorbent dose the effect of adsorbent dose on adsorption of aef in ospw is shown in fig 1 for both cx5 5 and cx6 9 higher doses of adsorbent material resulted in higher aef removal this same trend was seen by pourrezaei et al 2014a b for both aef and chemical oxygen demand cod removal using petroleum coke pc as well islam et al 2018 found that higher doses of granular activated carbon gac resulted in higher removal of aef and classical nas the trend seen is most likely because a higher adsorbent mass means that there is more surface area available for the aef to readily adsorb onto resulting in higher aef removal khan et al 2011 there was a notable difference between the removal by cx5 5 and cx6 9 cx5 5 achieved 89 removal for 6 g l dose and adsorption time of 24 h while cx6 9 only resulted in slightly more than 14 removal using the same dose and adsorption time for doses higher than 1 g l removal by cx5 5 continued to increase but at a decreasing rate on the other hand removal by cx6 9 increased very little initially and began to plateau by a dose of 4 g l the low removal by cx6 9 can be linked directly to the cx properties table 1 and narrow pore size distribution fig s1 lower removal of aef by cx6 9 in comparison to cx5 5 was expected due to the higher pore size distribution higher bet surface area and total pore volume for cx5 5 niasar et al 2016 due to the low aef removal at all tested doses it was concluded that cx6 9 was not an efficient adsorbent for the treatment of ospw even with very high doses of cx6 9 it seems unlikely that aef removal above 25 could be achieved using cx6 9 therefore all further adsorption studies were conducted using only cx5 5 from table 1 a dose of 3 g l of cx5 5 achieved a removal of 73 5 aef after this dose the removal of aef achieved with each added g of cx5 5 decreases to less than 10 per added g of cx for this reason the dose of 3 g l of cx5 5 was chosen as the dose for the kinetic studies this dose achieves a fairly high removal but attempts to keep down the amount of cx added 3 3 aef and na removal the results of the equilibrium time and kinetics experiments for adsorption of aef by cx5 5 are shown in fig 2 a for a 3 g l dose of cx5 5 aef concentration decreased rapidly in the first 6 h from 6 h to 18 h aef concentration decreased in the treated ospw but at a decreasing rate between 18 and 24 h the aef concentration levels out reaching a plateau around 74 6 by 18 h a sample of cx5 5 in ospw reached equilibrium with respect to removal of aef a similar trend was reported for the adsorption of aef in ospw onto gac islam et al 2018 in addition to aef concentration data raw ospw and treated ospw samples post adsorption were analyzed by uplc tof ms in order to obtain classical na concentration fig 2b shows the classical nas concentration and removal curves as a function of time for ospw that was treated by adsorption for up to 24 h using a 3 g l dose of cx5 5 the results were very similar to those obtained using the aef concentration data for adsorption with cx5 5 fig 2a the main difference being that classical na removal was nearly 89 for 24 h adsorption and aef removal was 74 6 for the same adsorption time in the first 2 h of adsorption there was a drastic reduction of classical na concentration 72 by an adsorption time of 6 h there was an 86 3 reduction in classical nas after this time the removal increased a few percent to a final removal of 88 8 for 24 h adsorption time figure s2 shows the classical na concentration profiles in ospw as a function of carbon and z numbers before and after treatment with 3 g l cx5 5 for a 24 h time adsorption nas found in raw ospw fig s2a were in the carbon range of 9 21 and had z values ranging from 0 to 18 with respect to carbon number the majority of nas were found in the range of 12 18 with the peak value occurring for carbon number 14 with respect to z the na distribution was bimodal with two distinct peaks the larger peak occurred at z value of 4 however it is important to note that the second largest concentration of na occurred for z value of 6 after this the na concentrations decreased for z values of 8 and 10 the lesser peak occurred at z value of 12 this was the third largest concentration of nas with respect to z value therefore a majority of the classical nas in the raw ospw were bicyclic tricyclic and hexacyclic the differences between the raw ospw described here and elsewhere are due to the widely varying nature of ospw in combination with differences in the bitumen ore sampling dates and changes in extraction methods gamal el din et al 2011 post adsorption the ospw classical na concentration was reduced from 26 3 mg l to 2 94 mg l classical nas with carbon number 17 and above were almost completely removed nas with carbon number 19 20 and 21 were removed in totality for the nas remaining post adsorption the peak concentration occurred for carbon number 12 this means that more carbon number 14 was removed by adsorption than carbon number 12 this is supported by results shown in fig s3a which shows the normalized classical na concentration profiles as a function of time for each carbon number in general nas with the higher carbon numbers experienced greater removal as demonstrated by the data for carbon number 12 and above classical nas with carbon numbers 9 through 11 had the least removal by adsorption nas with higher carbon number have higher hydrophobicity which leads to greater adsorption zubot et al 2012 these results are consistent with results reported by islam et al 2018 pourrezaei et al 2014a b and zubot et al 2012 figure s3b shows the normalized classical na concentration profiles as a function of time for each z number results from fig s2 in combination with data shown in fig s3b indicate that cx5 5 was effective at adsorbing nas with higher cyclicity these findings are consistent with previous results for adsorption treatment of ospw gamal el din et al 2011 pourrezaei et al 2014a b zubot et al 2012 with respect to z the classical na distribution was no longer bimodal post adsorption for values of z greater than or equal to 8 classical na concentrations were present in amounts less than 0 2 mg l a peak concentration of 1 04 mg nas l occurred at z value of 4 this was also the z value with the highest concentration in raw ospw classical nas with z value of 2 were the least removed unlike the results obtained for na removal as a function of carbon number complete removal of na for any z number were not observed this indicates that carbon number had a greater influence on adsorption of nas than z these results are consistent with results found by pourezzaei et al 2014a b the removal of classical nas as a function of carbon number and z number in raw and treated ospw for different adsorption times is shown in fig 3 greater adsorption time led to greater na removal as also shown by fig 2b the removal results for 6 h adsorption are not far below the final removal after 24 h adsorption for both carbon and z numbers for 24 h adsorption time only carbon numbers 13 through 21 experienced at least 80 removal nas with carbon number less than 12 had removal values that varied between 38 and 47 with no clear removal trend for 24 h adsorption time nas with z values of 4 18 resulted in at least 80 removal there was a wider range of resulting na removal as a function of carbon number 38 4 100 compared to z number 54 9 97 9 this further supports the previous statement that carbon number had a greater influence on na adsorption than z number 3 4 adsorption capacity of cx5 5 the equilibrium adsorption capacity of cx5 5 as a function of equilibrium aef concentration is shown in fig s4 the equilibrium adsorption capacity for cx5 5 was at a minimum for the lowest resulting equilibrium aef concentration which occurred with the highest cx5 5 dose 6 g l and conversely the highest resulting equilibrium adsorption capacities occurred for the highest equilibrium aef concentrations which occurred with the lowest cx5 5 doses 0 5 and 1 g l the same trend of an increasing adsorbent dose resulting in a decreasing adsorption capacity was also reported by pourrezaei et al 2014a b khan et al 2011 and islam et al 2018 at low adsorbent dose the adsorption sites become saturated and after a point are no longer able to adsorb organic material this leads to the lower removal efficiencies xing et al 2008 when higher amounts of adsorbent were present some adsorption sites remained unsaturated during the adsorption process thus lowering the adsorption capacity but increasing the removal efficiency khan et al 2011 the langmuir and freundlich adorption isothems for the aef concentration data resulting from cx5 5 adsorption experiments with raw ospw for adsorption time of 24 h are shown in fig s5 si the constants for the linearlized langmuir isotherm were as follows kads of 0 058 l mg qmax of 30 77 mg g cx5 5 and correlation coefficient of 0 971 the constants for the linearized freundlich isotherm are as follows kf of 3 41 l1 n mg 1 1 n g 1 1 n of 0 513 and correlation coefficient of 0 982 the freundlich model showed the best correlation for the aef data indicating that adsorption of aef was multilayered this was to be expected as islam et al 2018 observed the same result for adsorption of both aef and nas in ospw using gac for the freundlich isotherm islam et al 2018 obtained a higher kf value 4 46 and 1 n value 0 74 it is important to note that the langmuir qmax value obtained using gac varied in literature islam et al 2018 reported a value of 98 5 mg aef g gac while pourrezaei et al 2014a reported a qmax value of 51 mg aef g gac the value reported by pourrezaei et al 2014a was closer to that obtained by the cx5 5 the experimental adsorption capacities of aef by cx5 5 ranged from 6 7 mg g to approximately 24 mg g for cx5 5 doses from 0 5 g l to 6 g l respectively in a previous study for gac doses from 0 05 g l to 2 g l the resulting adsorption capacities for aef ranged from about 65 mg g to 104 mg g islam et al 2018 for a 50 g l dose of non activated pc gac and pac the resulting aef adsorption equilibrium capacities were 1 02 mg l 50 5 mg g and 71 0 mg g respectively pourrezaei et al 2014a b in general the adsorption capacities for cx5 5 fell between the resulting adsorption capacities for pc and gac pac however a direct comparison of resulting adsorption capacities is not possible since different sources of raw ospw were used and since different doses of adsorbent material were used by islam et al 2018 and pourezzaei et al 2014a b zubot et al 2012 demonstrated that very high dose of up to 40 wt pc in ospw 400 g l can lead to very low aef adsorption capacities ranging from 0 1 to 0 43 mg g in general the adsorption capacity results obtained for cx5 5 fell in the general range to be expected when considering that the bet surface area for cx5 5 was higher than that for pc 7 7 m2 g but lower than that for pac 800 m2 g and gac 912 m2 g pourrezaei et al 2014a b comparison of experimental equilibrium adsorption capacities of aef and nas by cx5 5 3 g l dose is shown in fig s6 the equilibrium adsorption capacity obtained by aef concentration data was 15 mg aef g cx5 5 and by overall tof ms classical na concentration data was 7 8 mg nas g cx5 5 the adsorption capacity obtained using the na concentration data was approximately half of that obtained using the aef concentration data this is to be expected since the initial concentrations of aef and classical nas in the raw ospw were 61 2 mg l and 26 3 mg l respectively the equilibrium adsorption capacities of classical nas by cx5 5 in ospw were determined for each carbon and z numbers fig 4 in the case of carbon number highest adsorption capacity occurred for carbon number 14 with respect to z number the adsorption capacities had a bimodal distribution peak values at z of 4 and 12 the equilibrium adsorption capacity of nas by carbon number and z number followed the same trend that was obtained for the raw ospw classical na concentration data fig s2a this is a strong indication that the adsorption capacity of nas onto cx5 5 was highly dependent on the initial na concentration in ospw these results are also supported by the amount of classical nas adsorbed onto cx5 5 qt as a function of time and carbon number fig s7 the resulting curves followed the same trends found for the initial na concentrations in raw ospw as well islam et al 2018 found that differences in adsorption capacities obtained for adsorption of nas onto gac were a result of initial concentrations found in the raw ospw another possible explanation regarding the bimodal trend for adsorption capacity with respect to z might be due to the pore size distribution fig s1 fig s1 shows a pore size distribution for cx5 5 that only has one peak however if more data points closer to 0 å were added this might result in another peak in the range of 0 25 å for both types of cx while qe as a function of carbon number fig 4 followed a trend very similar to the initial na concentration data presented in fig s2a it was not always the case that a carbon number with a higher initial na concentration than a different carbon number would result in an adsorption capacity that was higher as well the initial na concentrations for carbon numbers 13 and 17 were 3 3 and 3 1 mg l respectively carbon number 13 had a higher initial concentration but a lower adsorption capacity 0 90 mg g than carbon number 17 1 0 mg g this phenomenon occurred for carbon numbers 12 and 19 11 and 20 and 10 and 21 these results indicate that adsorption capacity was not only a function of initial na concentration but also a function of carbon number to some exent for carbon numbers having similar initial concentrations the higher adsorption capacity resulted for the nas with a higher carbon number 3 5 kinetics of adsorption kinetics of adsorption is the study of how fast the adsorbate attaches to the adsorbent surface and is important to understand in order to design a full scale batch process with optimum operating conditions kalavathy et al 2005 kinetics of adsorption data were analyzed using two kinetic models pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso models the pfo kinetic model using the aef concentration data is shown in fig 5 a as seen the entire data set was not linear but consists of two different linear regions called phase a and phase b each of the regions was modeled separately to obtain the highest correlation coefficient values the kinetic parameters for the pfo model of aef adsorption is shown in table 2 for comparison with the aef pfo kinetics results the classical na concentration data were used to model the adsorption of classical nas onto cx5 5 the pfo modeling of adsorption of classical nas is shown in fig 6 a with corresponding kinetic parameters found in table 2 as with aef data the two apparent phases for the na concentration data were modeled separately using the pfo model fig 6a the pseudo second order pso kinetic model of the aef concentration data is shown in fig 5b with the corresponding kinetic parameters summarized in table 2 the resulting pso modeling for adsorption of classical nas is shown in fig 6b and all of the corresponding rate constants are found in table 2 with respect to correlation coefficients the pso kinetic model resulted in coefficient values that were 1 0 for both aef and nas correlation coefficient values for the pfo model ranged from 0 93 to 1 0 for the different phases if the data were not modeled in separate phases the correlation coefficients would be farther off from 1 0 although the pso kinetic model resulted in correlation coefficients of 1 0 this by itself was not enough to determine which model best represented the data if one takes into consideration the error that can be calculated by comparing the experimental equilibrium adsorption capacity qe with the equilibrium adsorption capacity obtained by use of the model in question qmod then it becomes more clear which model is more representative of the kinetics of adsorption onto cx5 5 for the pfo kinetic model the error for the aef data was 4 61 and 56 1 for phase a and phase b and for the nas data the error is 10 3 and 56 7 for phase a and phase b for the pso kinetic model the error for the aef data was 2 63 and for the na data the error was 1 16 thus the pso kinetic model was more representative of adsorption of aef and nas onto cx5 5 this result was in agreement with published findings by islam et al 2018 when comparing pfo and pso modeling of ospw aef and na adsorption data onto gac using the na concentration data it was possible to take a closer look at the adsorption kinetics of classical nas with specific carbon numbers and z numbers initially a lower carbon number resulting in a low adsorption capacity n 12 and a higher carbon number n 15 resulting in a higher adsorption capacity were chosen for analysis as well the two z values z 4 and 12 resulting in the two peak na uptake values were chosen for analysis the resulting pfo and pso models for carbon number 12 and 15 are presented in fig s8 and those for z of 4 and z of 12 are shown in fig s9 comparison of correlation coefficients and calculated qe mod values for each kinetic model table 2 show that the kinetics of adsorption for each carbon number 12 and 15 and z number 4 and 12 followed pso kinetics for the pso kinetics model it should be noted that the rate of adsorption for nas with carbon number 12 was 6 05 g mg h this rate constant was much higher than that obtained using total na concentration data 0 418 g mg h or classical nas with carbon number 15 concentration data 2 41 g mg h to further understand this phenomenon additional pso rate constants at different carbon number 13 17 and 18 were determined and are shown in table s1 as carbon number increased or decreased away from carbon number 14 the rate constant increased this same trend was reported by islam et al 2018 for pso rate constants found for different carbon number in raw nas in general the pso rate constant seemed to be inversely proportional to the initial concentration of nas for different carbon number also shown in table 2 there was a lower rate constant for those nas that were initially present at higher concentration a similar trend in the relation between initial adsorbate concentration and pso rate constants was observed by wang et al 2018 for the adsorption of different nitrosamines by nanoscale zero valent iron gac composites to determine if a relationship existed between carbon number or z number and the adsorption rate constants obtained for the pso kinetic model the effect of initial na concentration on the resulting equilibrium adsorption capacity had to be reduced two carbon numbers 13 and 17 with very similar initial na concentrations and two z numbers 10 and 16 with similar initial na concentrations were chosen for analysis table s1 shows the resulting rate constants for the pso model for n or z value the concentration of nas with carbon number 13 was slightly higher than that of nas with carbon number 17 and the rate of adsorption was 1 4 times higher for carbon number 17 part of this may be due to the phenomenon previously discussed higher initial concentration resulted in a higher pso rate constant but it also seems that nas with higher carbon number may have had a role nas with higher carbon numbers were more completely removed even when they had a smaller initial concentration as shown by the classical na concentration removal data fig 3 as discussed in section 3 3 nas with higher carbon number were more completely removed pourrezaei et al 2014a b zubot et al 2012 the concentration of nas with z number 16 was slightly higher than that of nas with z of 10 however in this case the rate constant of nas with z of 16 was 1 3 times higher than that for nas with z of 10 with the effect of the initial na concentration reduced it can be seen that nas with higher z number result in a higher pso rate constant despite having the higher pso rate constant 92 9 of nas with z value of 16 were removed after 24 h while 94 6 of nas with z value of 10 were removed after 24 h this shows that with respect to z value carbon number has a greater influence on adsorption of nas than z as mentioned in section 3 3 3 6 adsorption mechanisms the weber and morris intraparticle diffusion model in combination with the classical nas concentration data were used to determine the diffusion mechanism and rate limiting steps during adsorption as discussed by nethaji et al 2013 if the plot of q t versus t 1 2 passes though the origin then this indicates that the intraparticle diffusion is the sole rate limiting step however if the plot does not pass through the origin but instead though an intercept c then the rate limiting step is a result of additional steps the intercept c is an indicator of the boundary layer effect a larger intercept indicates that a particular step plays a more significant role in the determination of the rate limiting step kalavathy et al 2005 in general adsorption is thought to consist of three steps 1 mass transfer across the film boundary layer surrounding the adsorbent 2 internal or external adsorption on the adsorbent surface with physical or chemical binding considered extremely rapid 3 adsorbate diffusion to adsorption sites by pore diffusion or solid surface diffusion mechanisms cheung et al 2007 the intraparticle diffusion model for adsorption of aef onto cx5 5 is shown in fig 5c the plot was multilinear with three linear regions which suggests that three steps governed the adsorption of aef onto cx5 5 this is in contrast to the results obtained by islam et al 2018 which showed only two distinct regions representing film and pore diffusion table 2 summarizes the rate constants calculated for each region in fig 5c each region represented one of three types of diffusion bulk film and pore the first region shown on the far left side represented bulk diffusion this region had the highest rate constant of 12 mg g h1 2 the second region shown in the middle represented film diffusion this was mass transfer through the film surrounding the adsorbent material that took more time when compared with mass transfer through the bulk liquid the third region shown on the right hand side represents pore diffusion this was mass transfer within the pores of the adsorbent material the pore diffusion region encompassed the most amount of time and had the lowest rate constant for all three regions 0 369 mg g h1 2 once the mass travels through the bulk liquid it begins to slow down as it travels into and through the film surrounding the adsorbent the mass slows down even more once it encounters the actual adsorbent material and begins to traverse first through the larger macropores and down into the mesopores pore diffusion was the rate limiting step in addition to film diffusion for the adsorption of aef by cx5 5 this result was in agreement with that presented by islam et al 2018 pore diffusion was rate limiting for adsorption of aef using gac a similar trend was observed for the classical na concentration data treated using the weber and morris model there were three distinct phases present fig 6c with the values of rate constants for each region table 2 following the same trend as seen for the aef concentration data ki bulk ki film ki pore the intraparticle diffusion model was applied to specific nas with certain carbon number and certain z numbers the results are shown in tables 2 and s1 unlike the pso rate constants the intraparticle diffusion model rate constants for the bulk and film regions were directly proportional to the initial concentration of the nas since they generally followed the same trend as the initial concentration data deviation from the initial concentration data trend was found for nas with higher carbon number 17 and 18 for higher carbon number the intraparticle diffusion model rate constant for the bulk diffusion region tended to be higher than a similar starting concentration for nas with lower carbon number for carbon number 17 the rate constant for the film diffusion region was higher when compared with carbon number 13 which had a slightly higher starting initial concentration these deviations support the earlier claim that nas with higher carbon number had some influence on the removal of those particular nas the rate constant for the pore diffusion region also showed high dependence on the initial concentration of the nas however there were also some deviations based upon carbon number and z number nas with carbon number 13 had the highest rate constant but had the second highest initial concentration in addition nas with z of 16 had the lowest rate constant in the pore diffusion region but had the second lowest initial concentration in the pore diffusion region this may suggest that although initial na concentration was a major factor in determination of the rate constant smaller nas carbon number that were less bulky z number tended to diffuse faster within the pores of the carbon xerogel 4 conclusions the results of this study demonstrated that a mesoporous carbonaceous material can successfully be used to adsorb persistent and toxic organic contaminants from ospw of the two different types of cx used cx made at ph 5 5 removed a substantially larger amount of aef than cx made at ph 6 9 due to its higher surface area and pore diameter the adsorption equilibrium was reached by about 24 h for both aef and classical nas after 24 h of adsorption 74 6 of aef and 88 8 of classical nas were removed upon closer examination of classical na removal it was found that the larger the carbon number the higher the removal was carbon number had more influence on nas removal when compared with z number for a 3 g l dose of cx 5 5 the equilibrium adsorption capacity was found to be 15 mg aef g cx5 5 and 7 8 mg nas g cx5 5 adsorption of aef and classical nas onto cx5 5 followed pseudo second order kinetics with respect to diffusion of aef and nas there were three distinct regions bulk diffusion film diffusion and pore diffusion the rate limiting step in all cases analyzed was pore diffusion in general cx made at ph 5 5 exhibited excellent adsorption performance due to its highly mesoporous characteristics so it could be used in engineered reactors or as a pre or post treatment for passive semi passive treatment approaches such as in tailing ponds pit lakes constructed wet lands for the removal of organic matters

18998,secondary disinfectants such as chlorine and chloramine have been widely applied to minimise microbial risks in drinking water during distribution key challenges have included the maintenance of stable concentrations of disinfectant residuals and the control of disinfection by products that may form as a consequence of residual decay processes many factors may influence disinfectant residual stability and the consequential formation of by products thus predictions of disinfectant stability and by product formation are multifactorial problems complete with numerous complications of parameter co dependence and feedback amplification of some key parameters the aim of this review was to derive an understanding of how disinfectant residual stability in drinking water distribution systems is impacted by various influencing factors such as water quality and operational parameters factors known to influence disinfectant stability and by product formation were critically reviewed a systematic review method was applied to identify 1809 journal articles published in the two decades from january 1998 to december 2017 from the initial screening 161 papers were selected for detailed assessment important factors were identified to include temperature water age piping material corrosion products ph hydraulic condition disinfectant residual type and dosage and microbial activity microbial activity is a particularly complex parameter on which to base predictions since many factors are known to influence the degree and nature of such activity these include temperature water age piping material corrosion products nutrients natural organic matter hydraulic condition and disinfectant residual type and dosage disinfectant types and dosages were found to be among the most important factors many knowledge gaps and research needs still remain including the need for a more complete understanding of the factors that influence the production of nitrogenous disinfection

most of this effort and much of the accompanying water quality monitoring occur at drinking water treatment plants however after exiting a water treatment plant and before delivery to a customer s tap there are numerous opportunities for water quality changes these include potential reactions with disinfection residuals and concurrent formation of disinfection by products dbps presenting additional public health risks physical components of drinking water distribution systems dwds include treated water storage reservoirs pipes and pumping stations each of these components may vary considerably in terms of water distribution capacity manufactured materials and age or condition the characteristics of a distribution system and the conditions under which it is operated may have important impacts on the potential for post treatment changes in water quality distribution distances can be relatively short or can be in excess of 100 km with a retention time commonly varying between 1 and 7 days awwa 2002 blokker et al 2016 highly variable population densities and flow rates lead to corresponding variabilities in the relationship between distribution distance and time for example delivering water 50 km requires a retention time of 12 24 h in beijing while in australian cities such as sydney and brisbane can be up to 20 days 3 5 days is not unusual prolonged water age is also influenced by the need for water storage tanks to ensure adequate availability for firefighting and other emergencies australian government 2014 awwa 2002 a free chlorine residual has been used as a disinfectant in dwds in many countries for much of the 20th century due to its high performance in disinfection and relatively low cost mcguire 2006 however some limitations with using such a reactive chemical species as a distribution residual have been observed to include rapid decay in some systems and associated production of dbps such as trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas and other halogenated dbps gagnon et al 2006 consequently many drinking water utilities have switched to alternative disinfectant residuals including chloramine and to a much lesser extent chlorine dioxide gagnon et al 2006 nhmrc and nrmmc 2011 while chloramine is well known to produce reduced chlorinated dbps cl dbps compared to free chlorine the introduction of ammonia and chlorinated amines amplifies the risk of producing nitrogenous dbps n dbps under certain conditions this is of concern since some n dbps may present greater risks to public health including carcinogenicity compared to non nitrogenous dbps richardson et al 2007 disinfectant residual decay and dbp production may be a result of biofilms which are known to occur in treated water distribution systems contributing bacterial sources and organic matter lemus pérez and rodríguez susa 2017 wang et al 2013a although chloramine is more persistent than chlorine in the absence of nitrifying conditions it decomposes more rapidly once nitrification occurs in distribution systems sathasivan et al 2008 bacteria present in distribution system biofilms release soluble microbial products smp especially proteins which accelerate chloramine decay and dbp formation herath et al 2015 2018 liu et al 2014 re chlor am ination is commonly practised to maintain disinfectant levels in distribution systems bal krishna et al 2014 2016 but may also lead to greater n dbp production zeng and mitch 2016 due to security concerns many of these re chlor am ination facilities have now switched from chlorine gas to safer disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite copeland and cody 2007 the relationships between distribution system conditions and microbial activity within networks have been investigated by many researchers lehtola et al 2006 liu et al 2017c ndiongue et al 2005 simoes et al 2006 tsvetanova and dimitrov 2012 similarly the relationships between distribution system conditions and chemical changes such as disinfectant residual decay and dbp formation have been widely reported kim et al 2014 lee et al 2007 liu et al 2012 simard et al 2011 zhang et al 2017a however microbial and chemical changes are intricately related as has been shown by research focused on the impact of nitrification processes on disinfection residuals krishna et al 2013 lemus pérez and rodríguez susa 2017 sathasivan et al 2008 wang et al 2012 zeng and mitch 2016 in addition to the interaction between microbial growth and disinfectant stability microbial and chemical changes in disinfectant stability have similar influencing factors such as water qualities and operating conditions therefore varying these influencing factors would affect microbial growth and chemical reactions of disinfectants while the change in microbial activities would further impact disinfectant stability few studies have sought to comprehensively examine both types of activities simultaneously in order to provide a more complete understanding of the inter relationships the mathematical model developed by abokifa et al 2016 showed the importance of integrating bacterial growth dynamics models with predictive dbp formation models therefore a systematic review is presented here to assess the current state of knowledge regarding disinfectant residual stability as influenced by microbial activity as well as other independent factors in dwds the objective was to draw reasonable conclusions across studies that have focused on either one or the other sub research topic the review concludes with the identification of research gaps which must be filled in order to provide a more complete understanding of the overall changes in water quality that may occur between drinking water treatment and delivery of that water to customer s taps 2 methods a systematic quantitative literature review was performed based on the method described by pickering and byrne 2014 and the protocol developed by the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta analyses prisma fig 1 moher et al 2009 research papers were searched on web of science clarivate analytics 2017 using an advanced topic search using keywords drinking water or potable water and distribution system or reticulation system and chemical or microbial or biofilm or nitrification or disinfection byproduct or disinfection by product or dbp only original english research articles published between january 1998 and december 2017 were considered abstracts and other bibliographic information were imported into endnote x8 bibliographic database software from this list two selection criteria were set to identify sufficiently relevant articles first it was required that a description of drinking water distribution systems had been addressed in the publications second selected publications had to have addressed microbial or chemical changes during drinking water delivery papers which only reported observed changes in water quality concentrations without accompanying examination of underlying processes mechanisms or influencing factors were excluded corrosion processes affected by water quality changes in distribution piping were not included in this review such processes have been recently reviewed by liu et al 2017a however the role of corrosion products including anti corrosion chemicals was included due to their potential influence on microbial growth and disinfectant residual stability after manually screening the titles and abstracts full texts of these papers were then acquired and further assessed additionally papers purely focused on mathematical modelling were not discussed in this review such predictive or kinetic models on dbp formation have been reviewed by sadiq and rodriguez 2004 chowdhury et al 2009 and brown et al 2011 unless related influencing factors were studied each of the screened papers was categorised in terms of content including each factor that influences chemical changes on disinfectant stability and microbial changes 3 results the keyword search initially returned a list of 1809 articles after manually screening 234 articles were identified as potentially fulfilling criteria mentioned in section 2 and 161 papers were then selected in this review after assessing full text disinfectant residual stability including disinfectant decay and dbp production in dwds are related to the chemical microbiological and physical characteristics of water and to the pipe materials in contact with water flow simoes et al 2006 tsvetanova and dimitrov 2012 zhang et al 2017a zhang and andrews 2013a many of these factors may influence disinfectant stability by both pathways directly and via influence to microbial activity thus appear twice in fig 2 microbial activity and nitrification 39 of the total number of selected papers was found to be the most commonly investigated factor in disinfectant residual stability followed by corrosion products 14 impacts of disinfectant residual ph and pipe material on disinfectant stability have been discussed at about the same proportion 8 9 among selected publications nevertheless similar influencing factors were found to affect microbial activity and nitrification among which pipe material 26 of selected papers in microbial category and nutrients 23 of selected papers in microbial category were the most commonly investigated factors the overall variety of publications reflects the interest of research topics and implies that microbial activity is likely to be among the most dominant influencing factors followed by pipe materials and corrosion products from pipes 4 factors that influence disinfectant residual stability there are many factors including water qualities and operating parameters that may directly or indirectly influence disinfectant residual stability water qualities refer to temperature ph nutrients natural organic matter nom dissolved oxygen do and the presence of other potentially interacting species such as bromide iodide and corrosion products there are five main operating parameters that have been considered among the literature water age hydraulic condition pipe materials and applied disinfectant residual type and concentration some influencing factors such as temperature turbidity ph and type of dbp precursors have been studied back to 1950 regarding their impacts on chlorine demand feben and taras 1950 taras et al 1950 in addition bacteria in bulk water and biofilms in dwds have been reported to deteriorate water quality by promoting nitrification disinfectant residual decay and dbp production lemus pérez and rodríguez susa 2017 wang et al 2013a zeng and mitch 2016 this is presented graphically in a bayesian network format using netica norsys 2017 fig 3 since a bayesian network may be an appropriate approach for a future multifactorial predictive model 4 1 temperature chlor am ine decay rate is known to increase with elevated temperature monteiro et al 2017 sathasivan et al 2009 this could be influenced by the change in microbial activities as discussed in section 4 10 2 1 furthermore even in the absence of microbes chlor am ine is known to undergo self decay which is a temperature dependent reaction ndiongue et al 2005 sathasivan et al 2009 increasing water temperature also accelerates the formation of dbps including thms haas haloacetonitriles hans chloral hydrate and halopropanones especially brominated thms br thms dichloropropanol and trichloropropanol ye et al 2009 zhang et al 2013a for example a sudden boost in thms and haas formation has been reported when tap water was heated 35 50 c zhang et al 2013a in some cases this increase may be observed up to a critical concentration 30 c after which concentrations decrease possibly due to dbp volatility ye et al 2009 an increase in water temperature from 5 to 25 c may also stimulate the degradation of some dbps such as chloral acetones chloral hydrate dichloroacetonitrile and trichloronitromethane tcnm abusallout et al 2017 koudjonou et al 2008 ma et al 2016 zhang et al 2013a these dbps rapidly decompose into chloroform and other organic halogens after achieving their maximum concentrations abusallout et al 2017 koudjonou et al 2008 ma et al 2016 zhang et al 2013a temperature rise may also cause increased dissolution of trace metals like copper and zinc which may further influence subsequent chemical and microbial changes section 4 4 zlatanovic et al 2017 4 2 water age water age in dwds is complicated as water with various ages is often mixed especially in networks with interconnected pipe loops or multiple sources it can be further influenced by diurnal flow patterns and seasonal demand such that more water is used in dry seasons compared to wet seasons therefore water age is often quoted as an average or a range for a particular system blokker et al 2016 increased water age does not directly influence disinfectant residual stability however it is known to result in reduced disinfectant residuals and elevated dbp formation due to a longer reaction time zhang and andrews 2013a prolonged water age often happens in stagnation and long distance distribution longer reaction time is reported to influence the relative formation of br thms compared to cl thms saidan et al 2016 for example extending reaction time from 0 to 49 h concentrations of br thm particularly chbr3 were observed to increase in low bromide containing water with an accompanying decrease in cl thm concentrations saidan et al 2016 the formation of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma has also been reported to increase with extended hydraulic retention times zhang and andrews 2013a 4 3 piping materials disinfectant decay in dwds has been reported to occur in both bulk phase and on pipe surfaces kiene et al 1998 chemical reactions of disinfectants with pipe materials and with both the biofilm and tubercles formed on pipe walls are referred to disinfectant wall decay which may vary with pipe materials hallam et al 2002 kiene et al 1998 pipe materials also have a significant impact on dbp formation zhang et al 2017a for example greater concentrations of thms were found to form in polyethylene pe pipes compared with ductile iron pipes and lower concentrations were found in stainless steel ss pipes zhang et al 2017a relative ndma formation rates were also observed for various pipe materials in the order of chlorinated polyvinyl chloride pvc fe pb cu under turbulent conditions zhang and andrews 2013a when no orthophosphate or polyphosphate corrosion inhibitors were present the formation of haas increased linearly on iron and lead surfaces but exponentially on copper with dichloroacetic acid dcaa as the dominant haas species zhang and andrews 2012 when orthophosphate was dosed ndma formation accelerated in iron pipes but slowed down in copper pipes zhang and andrews 2013a wall decay rate of chlorine has been shown to be greater for metal pipes compared to plastic pipes especially with long service age al jasser 2007 clark 2011 even among metal pipes decay rates appear to be various depending on the specific type of metal used for example chlorine decay rates were found in a declining order on cast iron steel cement lined ductile iron cement lined cast iron cu pb zhang et al 2017a a more rapid decay of chlorine residual and growth of chlorine resistant bacteria were observed in copper pipes compared to pe reducing chlorination effectiveness lehtola et al 2005 when orthophosphate was present in copper pipes however free chlorine decay rates were found to reduce while chloramine decay rates increased zhang and andrews 2012 2013a new pipes showed higher chlorine decay constants compared to pipes which had been recently used al jasser 2007 thus flushing new systems has been recommended in order to reduce chlorine decay rates al jasser 2007 although flushing may reduce disinfectant decay higher turbidity has been observed in cast iron pipes due to corrosion product detachment compared with plastic pipes douterelo et al 2014 4 4 corrosion products corrosion products are among the major factors influencing disinfectant stability in dwds corrosion products generally increase non dbp producing disinfectant demand rossman et al 2001 however corrosion products have been found to adsorb nom resulting elevated disinfectant demand hassan et al 2006 rossman et al 2001 for example decay rates for chlorine monochloramine and chlorine dioxide were accelerated by the presence of corrosion products such as copper and nickel oxides and iron corrosion products especially in moderately acidic conditions fu et al 2009 hassan et al 2006 liu et al 2013b consequentially these corrosion products accelerated rates of dbp production hu et al 2016a copper and or nickel oxides in chlorinated water have also been reported to enhance the formation of bromate and brominated dbps br dbps hu et al 2016b liu and croue 2016 liu et al 2013a chlorinated water with the presence of bromide ions and cu2o or cu2 were found to favour br dbp formation whereas bromate concentrations increased in the presence of cuo and or nio hu et al 2016b liu and croue 2016 liu et al 2013a this enhancement was observed even with low corrosion product concentrations 2 by weight and especially with high initial dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations liu et al 2013a ndma formation was also found to increase with an increase in dissolved copper which may be due to the complexation of copper with dichloramine catalysing ndma production zhang and andrews 2013b in contrast to the evidence of metals increasing formations of thms and ndma some metals appear to reduce concentrations of some dbps by stimulating their degradation as has been observed for br haas at low ph and high iron dose behbahani and seo 2016 zinc and zero valent iron zvi were reported to promote dehalogenation of haas due to their reducing potential behbahani and seo 2016 wang and zhu 2010 for example br haas were transformed into acetate and both trichloroacetic acid tcaa and dcaa were dehalogenated to monochloroacetic acid mcaa behbahani and seo 2016 wang and zhu 2010 similar reactions were observed when zn ii and iron corrosion products such as green rust and goethite were present arnold et al 2010 fu et al 2009 lee et al 2007 iron corrosion products were also found to accelerate degradation of tcnm trichloroacetonitrile and 1 1 1 trichloropropanone but not chloroform or tcaa arnold et al 2010 chun et al 2005 lee et al 2007 2008 increasing the concentration of goethite also suppressed formation of haas especially dcaa hassan et al 2006 rahman and gagnon 2014 however zvi was found to maximise the formation of iodinated dbps i dbps in chloraminated iodate containing water at ph 8 without the presence of phosphate xia et al 2017 4 5 ph ambient ph was found to influence disinfectant decay rates as well as formation and speciation of dbps inferring that disinfectant stability is highly ph dependant fu et al 2009 kinani et al 2012 zhang et al 2013b chloramine self decay occurs faster at ph 6 than at higher ph fu et al 2009 this effect is more prominent with the presence of cu2 fu et al 2009 a higher chlorine demand has also been observed in acidic water compared to neutral conditions taras et al 1950 the influence of ph on chlorine stability is a consequence of acid base speciation of hypochlorous acid the weaker disinfectant and more stable species ocl predominates at higher ph 7 5 whereas the more reactive hocl is dominant at lower ph 7 5 deborde and von gunten 2008 ambient ph also has an effect on the formation of chloramine species with an optimal range of 7 5 9 0 for monochloramine formation and acidic conditions favouring the formation of dichloramine ph 4 6 and trichloramine 4 4 kinani et al 2012 these species are known to be variably reactive and their formation has an influence on dbp production for example dichloramine formation has been associated with the production of ndma schreiber and mitch 2007 change in ph is known to affect the formation and speciation of dbps roccaro et al 2014 saidan et al 2016 for example an increase in formations of some dbps has been observed with an increase in ph hassan et al 2006 hu et al 2016a 2016b in some reports concentrations of thms especially chbr3 increased whereas haas slightly decreased when ph was increased from 5 5 to 8 5 saidan et al 2016 wang et al 2012 ye et al 2009 when iron corrosion products were present a significant elevation in haas formation was observed with higher ph rahman and gagnon 2014 elevated bromide concentration at ph 7 was reported to produce more br thms relative to cl thms compared with relative concentrations at ph 10 roccaro et al 2014 in contrast the effect of varying br cl ratios on formation of dihalogenated haas was independent of ph roccaro et al 2014 in addition br thms especially bromoform were reported to form more under high ph condition ph 8 saidan et al 2016 thus saidan et al 2016 suggested that maintaining conditions below ph 8 might inhibit formation of br thms more hans and haloketones however were produced under lower ph conditions and their formations were not affected by chlorine dose at higher ph wang et al 2012 in addition to observations regarding dbp formation dbp dehalogenation rates have been found to increase under elevated ph conditions abusallout et al 2017 for example chloral hydrate degraded faster into chloroform at ph 12 compared to ph 7 ma et al 2016 koudjonou et al 2008 showed that the impact of ph on chloral hydrate degradation was linked to temperature more chloral hydrate but slightly less chloroform was formed at 4 c with ph 8 8 compared to 7 6 koudjonou et al 2008 under ph and temperature elevation dehalogenation rates of halogenated dbps have been reported to decrease in the order of i dbps chloraminated dbps br dbps free cl dbps which indicated chloraminated dbps are less stable under these conditions than cl dbps abusallout et al 2017 4 6 hydraulic condition the flow rate of drinking water in a pipe determines its turbulence regime laminar or turbulent and generates corresponding shear stress on pipe surfaces turbulent flows are well known to occur in water mains however laminar flows could be found in dead ends and peripheral zones of dwds where intermittent flow or stagnation might occur romero gomez and choi 2011 it has been reported that disinfectant residuals decay more rapidly with an increase in flow velocity for two reasons jamwal and kumar 2016 zhang and andrews 2013a first turbulent flowrates may produce elevated concentrations of copper lead and iron and their oxidised corrosion products in the absence of orthophosphate zhang and andrews 2013a second decay reactions shift from predominantly bulk water to wall decay due to biofilm removal from pipe surfaces and mass flux transfer of disinfectant from bulk to wall surfaces jamwal and kumar 2016 however a further increase in flow rate beyond those required to produce turbulent flow regimes had negligible impacts on wall decay jamwal and kumar 2016 ndma formation was found to increase significantly in copper pipes under laminar conditions and in iron pipes under turbulent conditions zhang and andrews 2013a hydraulic condition of fluid also influences disinfectant effectiveness in conjunction with microbial impacts section 4 10 2 6 4 7 disinfectant residual disinfectant stability is various according to disinfectant type compared to free chlorine residual chloramine is known to have prolonged disinfectant stability in distribution systems as it hydrolyses slowly in aqueous solutions rice and gomez taylor 1986 chloramine was also found to be more persistent than chlorine in the absence of nitrifying conditions however it decays more rapidly once nitrification occurs in distribution systems sathasivan et al 2008 disinfectant type also influences the formation of dominant dbp species joo and mitch 2007 thms and haas are known to be the dominant dbps in chlorinated water in chloraminated water n nitrosamines and hams have been reported to be dominant n dbp species while the formations of aldehydes and halonitroalkanes have been found to increase with high cl n ratios and circumneutral ph joo and mitch 2007 liew et al 2016 dihalogenated hans were found to be the more prevalent n dbps in chlorinated water liew et al 2016 nevertheless dbps predominantly formed by chloramination processes are less chemically stable than those predominantly formed by chlorination abusallout et al 2017 as bacterial regrowth and disinfectant decay occur re chlor am ination has been practised in distribution systems to maintain disinfection effectiveness al zahrani 2016 carrico and singer 2009 momba and makala 2004 re dosing chlor am ine in distribution systems has been found to retard disinfectant decay in bulk water and temporarily mitigate nitrification jamwal and kumar 2016 xia et al 2017 zeng and mitch 2016 re chloramination has also been reported to reduce concentrations of n dbp precursors xia et al 2017 zeng and mitch 2016 however disinfectant dose is among the main factors influencing dbp formation saidan et al 2016 an extra dose of disinfectant has been reported to result in an elevation of halogenated dbps jamwal and kumar 2016 xia et al 2017 zeng and mitch 2016 varying chlorine dose did not affect thms and haas formations significantly at ph 5 5 but positively correlated to thm formation at ph 7 5 wang et al 2012 4 8 bromide iodide ions high initial bromide and iodide concentrations were found to accelerate monochloramine decay as they increased the inorganic disinfectant demand liu et al 2012 the presence of br or i in chlorinated water could shift cl dbps to increasingly toxic br dbps or i dbps xia et al 2017 for example the addition of bromide raised the formation and yield of total haas br thms and brominated haloacetamides br hams liew et al 2016 wang et al 2012 the higher reactivity of hobr which formed from br oxidisation by hocl is known to be the cause of this species shift langsa et al 2017 saidan et al 2016 however when cl br ratio was within a high range 60 mol mol the formation of total thms decreased slightly with an increase in bromide concentration saidan et al 2016 uyak and toroz 2007 4 9 other water matrix components other water matrix components such as dichloramine concentration alkalinity hardness nom and do have been also found to influence dbp formation for example ndma formation was found to increase with an increase in dichloramine concentration alkalinity and hardness but reduced with increasing nom concentrations zhang and andrews 2013b nom concentration as measured by total organic carbon toc and uv254 has been reported to have a significant positive correlation with thms formation but not so much with haas ye et al 2009 the formation of n dbps has also been found to positively correlate with concentrations of doc and ammonia liew et al 2016 the addition of phosphate from 0 to 1 5 mg l 1 decreased haas formation by more than 14 rahman and gagnon 2014 nevertheless disinfection efficiency could be affected by organic matter and turbidity zhang et al 2013b do concentration was also found to affect dbp degradation kinetics lee et al 2007 2008 for example increasing do concentration from 4 to 8 mg l 1 in the presence of zvi was reported to impede 1 1 1 trichloropropanone degradation by 50 lee et al 2007 although tcnm degradation was maintained with a high rate constant 0 15 min 1 in 0 8 mg o l 1 it was hindered at higher do concentrations when corrosion products were present lee et al 2007 2008 however since do in dwds is normally high 85 saturation it is unlikely to be a significant variable on dbp degradation 4 10 microbial impacts microbial activity is known to be among influencing factors of disinfectant residual stability which may impact disinfectant decay and dbp formation and degradation like disinfectant residual stability microbial changes in bulk water and biofilms can be also affected by water qualities and operating conditions fig 3 nitrification is a prominent example of the interaction of disinfectants and microorganisms 4 10 1 microbial impacts on disinfectant stability as mentioned previously chloramine decay associated with microbial activity occurs before the onset of nitrification and it is further accelerated by nitrification sathasivan et al 2008 microorganisms present in bulk water or in biofilms attached to pipe surfaces have been found to expedite chloramine decay adhikari et al 2012 oxidisable organic carbon produced by biofilms via metabolism of less reactive organics have been reported to accelerate disinfectant decomposition chandy and angles 2001 recent studies have found that rapid chloramine decay could also be a result of its co metabolism by ammonia oxidising bacteria aob and catalytic reaction by smp secreted by microorganisms krishna and sathasivan 2010 krishna et al 2012 maestre et al 2013 smp comprise proteins amines polysaccharides and carbohydrates namkung and rittmann 1986 as smp in wastewater and drinking water may have similar characteristics the knowledge of wastewater smp such as their influencing factors summarised by barker and stuckey 1999 may be applicable to smp in dwds extracellular polymeric substances eps excreted by microbes were also found to hinder the chloramination effectiveness on biofilms xue et al 2014 for example exopolysaccharides polysaccharide eps boosted biofilm cell viability while protein eps reacted with chloramine weakening its penetration of biofilm xue et al 2014 microbes identified under minor nitrification conditions were reported to stimulate chloramine decay as significantly as those under severe nitrification conditions herath et al 2015 therefore microbial control at early stages has been recommended to minimise further deterioration nitrifying biofilms and breakdown of bacterial cells could release doc in the form of proteins polysaccharides and nucleic acids which have been reported as important dbp precursors especially for the formation of hans wang et al 2013a zeng and mitch 2016 for example the formation of n nitrosamines and halogenated dbps in non nitrifying water was elevated after nitrifying biofilms were added zeng and mitch 2016 the yield and speciation of dbps can also be affected by the chemical composition of bacterial secretions protein based secretions having higher organic nitrogen content amino acids have been reported to form more dbps than polysaccharide based secretions wang et al 2012 2013b dbp yield however was not affected by the structures of polysaccharides wang et al 2013b for example more chloroform and haas were produced in the presence of the bacterial strain p putida which secrete protein based eps compared to p aeruginosa which secrete polysaccharide based eps wang et al 2012 similar trends were observed for n dbps with abundant hans wang et al 2012 2013b eps released from high chlorine biofilms in the form of arginine and valine were found to decrease the formation of br haas di trichloropropanone and some n dbps dibromoacetonitrile bromochloroacetonitrile lemus pérez and rodríguez susa 2017 the formation of these dbps along with chloroform and chloropicrin however was increased in low chlorine biofilm with corresponding eps lemus pérez and rodríguez susa 2017 biofilm bacteria have been reported to promote haas biodegradation with degradation rates in the order of monobromo monochloro bromochloro dichloro dibromo trichloroacetic acid bayless and andrews 2008 mcrae et al 2004 zhang et al 2009 however biodegradability of dcaa was found to be greater than monohaloacetic acids for certain bacterial isolates such as afipia felis and herminiimonas fonticola gm2 zhang et al 2009 all organisms involved in haa degradation were found to be members of the phylum proteobacteria zhang et al 2009 haa biodegradation was also reported to correlate strongly with heterotrophic bacteria with low chlorine residuals 0 3 mg l 1 but not high 0 7 mg l 1 tung and xie 2009 nevertheless water temperature was found to have a major impact on haa degradation which is at least partly due to the temperature influences on microbial activities section 4 10 2 1 pluchon et al 2013 4 10 2 factors that influence microbial activities as shown in fig 3 microbial activity is also affected by multi factors like disinfectant residual stability nutrient has been found to most influence biofilm growth followed by hydraulic condition and piping materials simoes et al 2006 disinfectant residual is also well known to be a major factor affecting bacterial activities krishna et al 2013 liu et al 2017c 4 10 2 1 temperature elevating temperature increases biofilm growth especially in the presence of bom ndiongue et al 2005 silhan et al 2006 tsvetanova and dimitrov 2012 zlatanovic et al 2017 this is often observed from seasonal temperature variations for example total and intact cell counts in distribution systems were 5 times greater in summer than in winter prest et al 2016 and biofilm activity fell 50 when the temperature dropped from 17 c to 7 c hallam et al 2001 temperature also affects bacterial density of biofilms such that biofilm heterotrophic plate count hpc was reported to fluctuate positively with temperature variation in plastic pipes tsvetanova and dimitrov 2012 for example an increase in temperature stimulated biofilm growth on polymeric materials such as cross linked polyethylene pex and pe pipes rather than metal pipes silhan et al 2006 thus disinfectant stability has often been found to decrease and consequentially produce more dbps in warmer temperature due not only to its faster chemical reaction kinetics but also to higher demands from the growth of bacteria and biofilms 4 10 2 2 water age prolonged water age encourages microbial growth lautenschlager et al 2010 tsvetanova and dimitrov 2012 supplying water intermittently even just overnight stagnation has found to accelerate bacterial growth in dwds and thus increases the risk of microbial contamination ayoub and malaeb 2006 kumpel and nelson 2013 zlatanovic et al 2017 accelerated bacterial growth would consequentially result in a rapid disinfectant decay and dbp formation as previously discussed in contrast manuel et al 2007 observed less biofilm growth in stagnant water compared to systems under continuous flow conditions this may be due to the same factors that have led to reports of rapid drops in coliform populations under a no flow condition i e dead end where low or no disinfectant residual was detected with established biofilm mcmath et al 1999 while the precise mechanisms are not clear it may be related to depletion of carbon or nutrients required for microbial growth 4 10 2 3 piping materials microbial activity density and diversity could be affected by the types of pipe materials used in distribution systems table 1 hallam et al 2001 momba and makala 2004 silhan et al 2006 tsvetanova and dimitrov 2012 yu et al 2010 for example iron pipes were found to enhance biofilm growth and density especially under oligotrophic conditions norton and lechevallier 2000 pipe materials also change the composition and disinfection resistance of biofilm bacteria norton and lechevallier 2000 the concentrations of bacteria such as mycobacterium avium were lower with free chlorine compared to chloramine on copper pipe surfaces while the opposite was observed on iron pipe surfaces due to the presence of corrosion products norton et al 2004 copper pipes were reported to inhibit biofilm development compared to pe pipes but no significant difference was observed in bacterial populations after biofilms matured lehtola et al 2004 the roughness of pipe surfaces determines bacterial adhesiveness affecting the biofilm formation as nutrients accumulated on rough pipe surfaces favour microbial growth and increase disinfectant demand chattopadhyay 2016 norton and lechevallier 2000 percival et al 1998b simoes et al 2010 for example initial developing biofilm tended to grow on ss grade 304 more so than grade 316 as ss 316 had smoother microscopic surfaces and contained molybdenum percival et al 1998a 1998b stronger bacterial adhesiveness which implies higher shear stress resistance was also observed on ductile cast iron pipe wall compared with grey cast iron and ss pipes due to its relative roughness liu et al 2017b this may be the reason that greater bacterial diversity and richness were observed after flushing plastic pipes compared with cast iron pipes douterelo et al 2014 for slower settling loose deposits there were higher affinities of total heterotrophic bacteria which contained more eps in discoloured water pocas et al 2015 despite the variable biofilm adherence observed for various pipe material types under some conditions pipe materials may have much less significance to biofilm growth under turbulent conditions manuel et al 2007 in some systems microbial activity in plastic pipes was found to be more a function of bulk water properties such as temperature and nutrient concentrations while in cast iron pipes corrosion products played an important role on bacterial composition douterelo et al 2016 experimental studies show that biofilm formations on pipe walls were not influenced by pipe age or bulk water bacteria which are of different taxa to biofilm bacteria kwon et al 2013 tsai et al 2004 there is a consensual agreement that metal surfaces accumulate more bacteria growth than plastic among metals more bacteria were found adhered to cast iron surfaces than copper and ss regarding plastics fewer bacteria were found on pvc and pe however it is unclear which type of plastic supports the lease microbial growth due to differences of water quality and incubation conditions in the experiments listed in table 1 a normalized comparison of microbial activity and density according to pipe material cannot be achieved 4 10 2 4 corrosion products corrosion products have been found to increase pipe roughness as well as extend adhesion surfaces for nutrients accumulation which favours biofilm growth norton and lechevallier 2000 this may further increase disinfectant demand and affect dbp formation as discussed in section 4 4 some species of bacteria such as agrobacterium sp were reported to promote biocorrosion of copper dutkiewicz and fallowfield 1998 overnight stagnation also promoted leaching of copper and zinc from pipes zlatanovic et al 2017 4 10 2 5 nom nutrients varying nom and available nutrients including ammonia nitrogen and soluble phosphorus influences disinfectant stability directly and indirectly by affecting the growth of suspended and biofilm embedded cells more so than other environmental factors liu et al 2017c the availabilities of nom such as assimilable organic carbon aoc and microbially available phosphorus map in drinking water have been found to correlate positively with the growth and density of biofilms and bulk water organisms but affect diversity negatively camper et al 2003 chu and lu 2004 fang et al 2009 keinanen et al 2002 lehtola et al 2002 rubulis and juhna 2007 tsai et al 2004 zhang et al 2017b in contrast enhancement of biofilm formation has also been observed under nutrient starvation conditions elhariry et al 2012 4 10 2 5 1 nom the effect of nom on microbial change has been observed especially in the absence of disinfectant residuals which caused a longer time for biofilms to reach bio stabilisation gagnon et al 2000 ndiongue et al 2005 ollos et al 2003 when bom was added or aoc level was low cell growth was found to be faster in biofilms than in bulk water gagnon et al 2000 tsai et al 2004 in an apparent contradictory observation the growth rate of heterotrophic biofilm bacteria and the yield of biomass decreased with an increase in carbon concentration ellis et al 1999 4 10 2 5 2 nutrients phosphorus is often applied to distribution systems in the form of phosphate as a corrosion inhibitor as mentioned in section 4 3 phosphorus has been reported to enhance disinfection efficiency when humic substances and iron oxide containing corrosion products were present butterfield et al 2002a fang et al 2009 2010 for example p reduced exopolysaccharide production in biofilms so that a less disinfectant resistant especially monochloramine structure was formed fang et al 2009 2010 in one case the addition of ammonium nitrate or phosphate was found to stimulate microbial growth in urban distribution systems but not obviously in suburban areas chu et al 2005 effects of p on microbial growth may depend on which nutrients may be growth limiting in the particular water supply fang et al 2009 for example p has been found to be the primary limiting nutrient among c n and fe for both yield and growth rate of microorganisms in intake water which may have similar characters to those in potable water supply systems haas et al 1988 sathasivan and ohgaki 1999 confirmed that p was the limiting inorganic nutrient for bacterial regrowth in dwds however no significant impact on bacterial regrowth or biofilm formation was observed when orthophosphate was dosed increasing map or phosphorus concentration was lower than 1 μg l 1 batte et al 2003 gouider et al 2009 rubulis and juhna 2007 although the interaction between p and bom had no impacts on hpc positive effects were observed on biofilm mass and physiological function of biofilm forming bacteria from a low to high level of p park and hu 2010 despite the evidence for the role of nutrients in some cases some studies have shown that the addition of n p and s did not promote bacterial growth in either bulk water or pipe walls as organic carbon did frias et al 2001 park and hu 2010 it might be because carbon substrate 66 was the main nutrient consumed by biofilms on plastic pipes followed by n 33 and only small quantities of p and s 1 biedron et al 2017 overall biofilm bacteria growth often with the increase in nutrient concentrations deteriorates disinfectant stability as previously discussed 4 10 2 6 hydraulic condition hydrodynamics plays a significant role in biofilm growth and biocorrosion in pipes as shear forces generated by the flow detaches biofilm bacteria tsai 2005 compared to laminar conditions a higher number of total and cultivable bacteria in biofilms was found and biofilm reached steady state faster under turbulent conditions when nil or low chlorine residual was present guan et al 2009 lehtola et al 2006 simoes et al 2006 2012 low shear stress was reported to remove a large amount of biofilm and deposits from the outer layer of biofilms while elevated shear stress could not impact the basal layer which was more cohesive and dense liu et al 2017b when chlorine was absent changing flow rate had no impact on biofilm development whereas the diversity of bacteria increased with biofilm aging guan et al 2009 with higher chlorine residual however high shear stress stimulated biofilm detachment and enhanced disinfection effectiveness by promoting chlorine penetration into biofilms tsai 2006 bacterial accumulation on pipe surfaces was reported to be initially stimulated by high wall shear rates then reach a steady state after a long exposure time paris et al 2007 high flowrate hinders cell growth in biofilms and bulk water liu et al 2017c for example the highest biofilm hpc was detected at 1 5 m s 1 in the range of 0 2 m s 1 liu et al 2017c while biofilm growth was reduced the most within flow velocities ranging 3 4 m s 1 cloete et al 2003 in a contrasting study although the maximum quantity of biofilm bacteria reduced bacteria growth rate did not decelerate at high flow velocity tsai 2005 by identifying the bacterial composition in biofilms douterelo et al 2013 showed that bacterial community structure was not affected by the hydraulic condition during initial biofilm development however fish et al 2017 recently found that hydraulic patterns affected biofilm physical structures and their eps characteristics with various response to shear stress change compared to slightly varied flow biofilms highly varied flow biofilms have been found to produce more eps and develop greater biomass volumes which have given them more compact structures to resist to pipe flushing douterelo et al 2013 fish et al 2017 although pipe flushing was found to promote biocorrosion on copper pipes due to the detachment of biofilms and sediments from the sudden increase in flow rate regular repeat flushes may improve biofilm stability because it reduces bacterial diversity by selecting great shear strength favouring bacteria douterelo et al 2016 lehtola et al 2006 pizarro and vargas 2016 4 10 2 7 disinfectant residuals types and concentration of disinfectant residuals have been reported to affect bacterial growth speciation and population that influence disinfection efficiency in distribution systems butterfield et al 2002b codony et al 2005 gagnon et al 2006 liu et al 2015b for example biofilms in organic carbon limited water continued to develop when chloramine was present but ceased with free chlorine chandy and angles 2001 gagnon et al 2006 concluded that chlorine dioxide had the highest efficiency on bacterial inactivation followed by free chlorine then chloramine however chlorine dioxide residual decomposes very quickly under neutral or basic conditions hence it is less popular compared to chlor am ination as a secondary disinfectant haas 2010 when free chlorine residual was present cell growth in both biofilm and bulk water was minimised with reduced biomass of biofilms while the specific growth rate of biofilm bacteria increased butterfield et al 2002b liu et al 2017c tsai 2006 high disinfectant residual could also suppress biofilm hpc significantly even when bacteria regrew liu et al 2015a ollos et al 2003 with a decrease in chloramine residuals nitrification metabolites increased in both concentration and diversity krishna et al 2013 the complex diversity and composition of biofilms increased the difficulties for chlorine penetrating into these more disinfectant resistant biofilms miller et al 2015 for example naegleria fowleri associated with a biofilm is more resistant to chlorine than when it exists alone in drinking water pipes miller et al 2015 however low chlorine residual 1 0 mg l 1 may encourage the initiation of microbial attachment and microbial growth especially in high aoc content water liu et al 2015a 2015b continuous and discontinuous chlorination also affects microbial production codony et al 2005 once biofilms are established for example bacteria grown under discontinuous chlorination conditions could not be fully eliminated even when re chlorination was introduced codony et al 2005 mathieu et al 2009 however no significant impact was observed on microbial regrowth between chorine dosage of 0 2 and 1 0 mg l 1 sharafimasooleh et al 2016 applying free chlorine could reduce bacterial adhesion but was not so effective for reducing aflatoxin chattopadhyay 2016 different structures of biofilm were observed between chlorinated and non chlorinated biofilms cultured in carbohydrate while similar biofilm structure was found in amino acids in carbon limited water butterfield et al 2002b proteins were found to be chlorine consumers in low chlorine biofilms while humic substance aggregators in high chlorine biofilm lemus pérez and rodríguez susa 2017 eps in biofilms grown in low chlorine environments contained more amino acids including alanine threonine proline and isoleucine which could be parts of humic substances and soluble proteins whereas more aromatic proteins were detected in high chlorine biofilm eps lemus pérez and rodríguez susa 2017 when a biofilm was initially exposed to free chlorine or monochloramine biomass was consumed resulting in decreased thickness and increased stiffness shen et al 2016 after a long term exposure 3 months however the same biofilm adapted to the disinfectant and became more rigid and resistant to detachment with an increase in its thickness and stiffness shen et al 2016 more protein biomass than polysaccharide was found in those biofilms shen et al 2016 which has been reported to decay chloramine rapidly sathasivan et al 2008 4 10 2 8 ph microorganisms have optimal conditions for growth varying ph to suboptimal growth conditions may reduce bacterial growth in distribution systems for example aob growth is favoured around ph 7 than at higher ph conditions oldenburg et al 2002 when ph was increased to 8 5 or above nitrifying bacteria growth was found to be controlled skadsen 2002 adjusting ph in distribution systems also influences other factors such as pipe corrosion section 4 5 and disinfectant stability which may produce combined influences to microbial activity for example the influence of ph on bacterial growth described above has been reported to be diminished in the presence of iron corrosion products and humic substance butterfield et al 2002a 4 10 3 nitrification nitrification is a prominent example of simultaneous changes between disinfectants and microorganisms in which chlor am ine decays and ammonia converts to nitrite and then nitrate by microbial interactions the decay of chloramine releases ammonia promoting nitrification which further decreases disinfection effectiveness pressman et al 2012 nitrite concentration was found to correspond quantitatively with aob presence which is linked to the degree of nitrification pintar and slawson 2003 smp excreted by microbes in severely nitrifying water was reported to stimulate chloramine decay and dbp formation which was recently found to be protein based herath et al 2015 2018 liu et al 2014 inactivating these protein based smp required additional free chlorine or the addition of silver bal krishna and sathasivan 2012 krishna et al 2014 thus krishna et al 2013 suggested controlling chloramine decay before nitrification occurs would be more effective temperature ph nutrients water age and disinfectant residual have been found to have high impacts on nitrification occurrence since they were reported to influence both chemical section 4 and microbial changes section 4 10 2 a summary of how these factors influence occurrence of nitrification is shown in fig 4 krishna et al 2014 nhmrc and nrmmc 2011 pintar and slawson 2003 rahman et al 2011 sarker and sathasivan 2011 sarker et al 2013 sathasivan et al 2008 skadsen 2002 yang et al 2007 zhang and edwards 2010 zhang et al 2013b zhang et al 2010 the population and activities of nitrifiers which strongly links to the extent of nitrification in distribution systems were reported to depend on pipe materials and nutrient concentrations zhang and edwards 2010 the consumption rates of chloramine and do and the rates of hpc proliferation and free ammonia production were found to decrease in the following pipe materials galvanised steel unlined cast iron hybrid pvc lined cast iron unlined cast iron and galvanised steel liu et al 2005 a more rapid disinfectant decay and far higher thm production have been observed in re chloraminated water from supply reservoirs compared to water freshly originating from a water treatment plant fisher et al 2009 simard et al 2011 this may be due to the higher microbial population especially nitrifiers found in reservoirs krishna and sathasivan 2010 observed that losses of chloramine nitrite and nh3 n in re chloraminated severely nitrified water 0 38 mg cl2 l 1 0 2 mg n l 1 were 10 times more rapid than those in mildly nitrified water 1 9 mg cl2 l 1 0 007 mg n l 1 therefore selecting a proper dosage and location for re chlor am ination is important to minimise dbp formation al zahrani 2016 application of free chlorine should be sufficient yet not exceeded for nitrification prevention in storage tanks in distribution systems zeng and mitch 2016 re chlorination is recommended at points near storage facilities where long water age is expected carrico and singer 2009 in a chloraminated system applying re chloramination just after nitrification or at near zero chloramine residuals is suggested to deaccelerate chloramine decay krishna et al 2016 5 conclusion the influencing parameters of disinfectant stability have been qualitatively investigated in this review these factors are not completely independent and may lead to positive feedback loops such that microbial growth leads to a rapid decay of disinfectant residual further promoting microbial growth the types and dosages of disinfectants would be the most important factors affecting disinfectant stability disinfectant stability can be reduced by higher temperature and more microbial activities with abundant nutrients although the effects of nutrient and nom have been well investigated for heterotrophic bacteria few studies were available for assessing this approach for controlling nitrifiers in drinking water pipe material also plays a major role in disinfectant stability as well as biofilm growth by affecting microbial activity density and diversity corrosion products increase the demand of disinfectant causing reduced disinfectant concentrations and increased dbp formation therefore it is necessary to consider what type of pipe materials to use and how it might affect final water quality when designing a water distribution system various dbp species have different responses to changes in operational factors the presence of bromide and iodide ions can further impact the speciation of dbps understanding how chemical and microbial changes relate to disinfectant residuals in distribution systems is important to facilitate safe management of drinking water quality for the protection of public health however this understanding has been hindered by most individual studies focusing either on the role of chemical changes or microbial changes in isolation therefore future study is proposed to investigate correlations of influencing factors and microbial changes to disinfectant residual stability in drinking water distribution systems acknowledgements this work was funded by

18998,secondary disinfectants such as chlorine and chloramine have been widely applied to minimise microbial risks in drinking water during distribution key challenges have included the maintenance of stable concentrations of disinfectant residuals and the control of disinfection by products that may form as a consequence of residual decay processes many factors may influence disinfectant residual stability and the consequential formation of by products thus predictions of disinfectant stability and by product formation are multifactorial problems complete with numerous complications of parameter co dependence and feedback amplification of some key parameters the aim of this review was to derive an understanding of how disinfectant residual stability in drinking water distribution systems is impacted by various influencing factors such as water quality and operational parameters factors known to influence disinfectant stability and by product formation were critically reviewed a systematic review method was applied to identify 1809 journal articles published in the two decades from january 1998 to december 2017 from the initial screening 161 papers were selected for detailed assessment important factors were identified to include temperature water age piping material corrosion products ph hydraulic condition disinfectant residual type and dosage and microbial activity microbial activity is a particularly complex parameter on which to base predictions since many factors are known to influence the degree and nature of such activity these include temperature water age piping material corrosion products nutrients natural organic matter hydraulic condition and disinfectant residual type and dosage disinfectant types and dosages were found to be among the most important factors many knowledge gaps and research needs still remain including the need for a more complete understanding of the factors that influence the production of nitrogenous disinfection

most of this effort and much of the accompanying water quality monitoring occur at drinking water treatment plants however after exiting a water treatment plant and before delivery to a customer s tap there are numerous opportunities for water quality changes these include potential reactions with disinfection residuals and concurrent formation of disinfection by products dbps presenting additional public health risks physical components of drinking water distribution systems dwds include treated water storage reservoirs pipes and pumping stations each of these components may vary considerably in terms of water distribution capacity manufactured materials and age or condition the characteristics of a distribution system and the conditions under which it is operated may have important impacts on the potential for post treatment changes in water quality distribution distances can be relatively short or can be in excess of 100 km with a retention time commonly varying between 1 and 7 days awwa 2002 blokker et al 2016 highly variable population densities and flow rates lead to corresponding variabilities in the relationship between distribution distance and time for example delivering water 50 km requires a retention time of 12 24 h in beijing while in australian cities such as sydney and brisbane can be up to 20 days 3 5 days is not unusual prolonged water age is also influenced by the need for water storage tanks to ensure adequate availability for firefighting and other emergencies australian government 2014 awwa 2002 a free chlorine residual has been used as a disinfectant in dwds in many countries for much of the 20th century due to its high performance in disinfection and relatively low cost mcguire 2006 however some limitations with using such a reactive chemical species as a distribution residual have been observed to include rapid decay in some systems and associated production of dbps such as trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas and other halogenated dbps gagnon et al 2006 consequently many drinking water utilities have switched to alternative disinfectant residuals including chloramine and to a much lesser extent chlorine dioxide gagnon et al 2006 nhmrc and nrmmc 2011 while chloramine is well known to produce reduced chlorinated dbps cl dbps compared to free chlorine the introduction of ammonia and chlorinated amines amplifies the risk of producing nitrogenous dbps n dbps under certain conditions this is of concern since some n dbps may present greater risks to public health including carcinogenicity compared to non nitrogenous dbps richardson et al 2007 disinfectant residual decay and dbp production may be a result of biofilms which are known to occur in treated water distribution systems contributing bacterial sources and organic matter lemus pérez and rodríguez susa 2017 wang et al 2013a although chloramine is more persistent than chlorine in the absence of nitrifying conditions it decomposes more rapidly once nitrification occurs in distribution systems sathasivan et al 2008 bacteria present in distribution system biofilms release soluble microbial products smp especially proteins which accelerate chloramine decay and dbp formation herath et al 2015 2018 liu et al 2014 re chlor am ination is commonly practised to maintain disinfectant levels in distribution systems bal krishna et al 2014 2016 but may also lead to greater n dbp production zeng and mitch 2016 due to security concerns many of these re chlor am ination facilities have now switched from chlorine gas to safer disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite copeland and cody 2007 the relationships between distribution system conditions and microbial activity within networks have been investigated by many researchers lehtola et al 2006 liu et al 2017c ndiongue et al 2005 simoes et al 2006 tsvetanova and dimitrov 2012 similarly the relationships between distribution system conditions and chemical changes such as disinfectant residual decay and dbp formation have been widely reported kim et al 2014 lee et al 2007 liu et al 2012 simard et al 2011 zhang et al 2017a however microbial and chemical changes are intricately related as has been shown by research focused on the impact of nitrification processes on disinfection residuals krishna et al 2013 lemus pérez and rodríguez susa 2017 sathasivan et al 2008 wang et al 2012 zeng and mitch 2016 in addition to the interaction between microbial growth and disinfectant stability microbial and chemical changes in disinfectant stability have similar influencing factors such as water qualities and operating conditions therefore varying these influencing factors would affect microbial growth and chemical reactions of disinfectants while the change in microbial activities would further impact disinfectant stability few studies have sought to comprehensively examine both types of activities simultaneously in order to provide a more complete understanding of the inter relationships the mathematical model developed by abokifa et al 2016 showed the importance of integrating bacterial growth dynamics models with predictive dbp formation models therefore a systematic review is presented here to assess the current state of knowledge regarding disinfectant residual stability as influenced by microbial activity as well as other independent factors in dwds the objective was to draw reasonable conclusions across studies that have focused on either one or the other sub research topic the review concludes with the identification of research gaps which must be filled in order to provide a more complete understanding of the overall changes in water quality that may occur between drinking water treatment and delivery of that water to customer s taps 2 methods a systematic quantitative literature review was performed based on the method described by pickering and byrne 2014 and the protocol developed by the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta analyses prisma fig 1 moher et al 2009 research papers were searched on web of science clarivate analytics 2017 using an advanced topic search using keywords drinking water or potable water and distribution system or reticulation system and chemical or microbial or biofilm or nitrification or disinfection byproduct or disinfection by product or dbp only original english research articles published between january 1998 and december 2017 were considered abstracts and other bibliographic information were imported into endnote x8 bibliographic database software from this list two selection criteria were set to identify sufficiently relevant articles first it was required that a description of drinking water distribution systems had been addressed in the publications second selected publications had to have addressed microbial or chemical changes during drinking water delivery papers which only reported observed changes in water quality concentrations without accompanying examination of underlying processes mechanisms or influencing factors were excluded corrosion processes affected by water quality changes in distribution piping were not included in this review such processes have been recently reviewed by liu et al 2017a however the role of corrosion products including anti corrosion chemicals was included due to their potential influence on microbial growth and disinfectant residual stability after manually screening the titles and abstracts full texts of these papers were then acquired and further assessed additionally papers purely focused on mathematical modelling were not discussed in this review such predictive or kinetic models on dbp formation have been reviewed by sadiq and rodriguez 2004 chowdhury et al 2009 and brown et al 2011 unless related influencing factors were studied each of the screened papers was categorised in terms of content including each factor that influences chemical changes on disinfectant stability and microbial changes 3 results the keyword search initially returned a list of 1809 articles after manually screening 234 articles were identified as potentially fulfilling criteria mentioned in section 2 and 161 papers were then selected in this review after assessing full text disinfectant residual stability including disinfectant decay and dbp production in dwds are related to the chemical microbiological and physical characteristics of water and to the pipe materials in contact with water flow simoes et al 2006 tsvetanova and dimitrov 2012 zhang et al 2017a zhang and andrews 2013a many of these factors may influence disinfectant stability by both pathways directly and via influence to microbial activity thus appear twice in fig 2 microbial activity and nitrification 39 of the total number of selected papers was found to be the most commonly investigated factor in disinfectant residual stability followed by corrosion products 14 impacts of disinfectant residual ph and pipe material on disinfectant stability have been discussed at about the same proportion 8 9 among selected publications nevertheless similar influencing factors were found to affect microbial activity and nitrification among which pipe material 26 of selected papers in microbial category and nutrients 23 of selected papers in microbial category were the most commonly investigated factors the overall variety of publications reflects the interest of research topics and implies that microbial activity is likely to be among the most dominant influencing factors followed by pipe materials and corrosion products from pipes 4 factors that influence disinfectant residual stability there are many factors including water qualities and operating parameters that may directly or indirectly influence disinfectant residual stability water qualities refer to temperature ph nutrients natural organic matter nom dissolved oxygen do and the presence of other potentially interacting species such as bromide iodide and corrosion products there are five main operating parameters that have been considered among the literature water age hydraulic condition pipe materials and applied disinfectant residual type and concentration some influencing factors such as temperature turbidity ph and type of dbp precursors have been studied back to 1950 regarding their impacts on chlorine demand feben and taras 1950 taras et al 1950 in addition bacteria in bulk water and biofilms in dwds have been reported to deteriorate water quality by promoting nitrification disinfectant residual decay and dbp production lemus pérez and rodríguez susa 2017 wang et al 2013a zeng and mitch 2016 this is presented graphically in a bayesian network format using netica norsys 2017 fig 3 since a bayesian network may be an appropriate approach for a future multifactorial predictive model 4 1 temperature chlor am ine decay rate is known to increase with elevated temperature monteiro et al 2017 sathasivan et al 2009 this could be influenced by the change in microbial activities as discussed in section 4 10 2 1 furthermore even in the absence of microbes chlor am ine is known to undergo self decay which is a temperature dependent reaction ndiongue et al 2005 sathasivan et al 2009 increasing water temperature also accelerates the formation of dbps including thms haas haloacetonitriles hans chloral hydrate and halopropanones especially brominated thms br thms dichloropropanol and trichloropropanol ye et al 2009 zhang et al 2013a for example a sudden boost in thms and haas formation has been reported when tap water was heated 35 50 c zhang et al 2013a in some cases this increase may be observed up to a critical concentration 30 c after which concentrations decrease possibly due to dbp volatility ye et al 2009 an increase in water temperature from 5 to 25 c may also stimulate the degradation of some dbps such as chloral acetones chloral hydrate dichloroacetonitrile and trichloronitromethane tcnm abusallout et al 2017 koudjonou et al 2008 ma et al 2016 zhang et al 2013a these dbps rapidly decompose into chloroform and other organic halogens after achieving their maximum concentrations abusallout et al 2017 koudjonou et al 2008 ma et al 2016 zhang et al 2013a temperature rise may also cause increased dissolution of trace metals like copper and zinc which may further influence subsequent chemical and microbial changes section 4 4 zlatanovic et al 2017 4 2 water age water age in dwds is complicated as water with various ages is often mixed especially in networks with interconnected pipe loops or multiple sources it can be further influenced by diurnal flow patterns and seasonal demand such that more water is used in dry seasons compared to wet seasons therefore water age is often quoted as an average or a range for a particular system blokker et al 2016 increased water age does not directly influence disinfectant residual stability however it is known to result in reduced disinfectant residuals and elevated dbp formation due to a longer reaction time zhang and andrews 2013a prolonged water age often happens in stagnation and long distance distribution longer reaction time is reported to influence the relative formation of br thms compared to cl thms saidan et al 2016 for example extending reaction time from 0 to 49 h concentrations of br thm particularly chbr3 were observed to increase in low bromide containing water with an accompanying decrease in cl thm concentrations saidan et al 2016 the formation of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma has also been reported to increase with extended hydraulic retention times zhang and andrews 2013a 4 3 piping materials disinfectant decay in dwds has been reported to occur in both bulk phase and on pipe surfaces kiene et al 1998 chemical reactions of disinfectants with pipe materials and with both the biofilm and tubercles formed on pipe walls are referred to disinfectant wall decay which may vary with pipe materials hallam et al 2002 kiene et al 1998 pipe materials also have a significant impact on dbp formation zhang et al 2017a for example greater concentrations of thms were found to form in polyethylene pe pipes compared with ductile iron pipes and lower concentrations were found in stainless steel ss pipes zhang et al 2017a relative ndma formation rates were also observed for various pipe materials in the order of chlorinated polyvinyl chloride pvc fe pb cu under turbulent conditions zhang and andrews 2013a when no orthophosphate or polyphosphate corrosion inhibitors were present the formation of haas increased linearly on iron and lead surfaces but exponentially on copper with dichloroacetic acid dcaa as the dominant haas species zhang and andrews 2012 when orthophosphate was dosed ndma formation accelerated in iron pipes but slowed down in copper pipes zhang and andrews 2013a wall decay rate of chlorine has been shown to be greater for metal pipes compared to plastic pipes especially with long service age al jasser 2007 clark 2011 even among metal pipes decay rates appear to be various depending on the specific type of metal used for example chlorine decay rates were found in a declining order on cast iron steel cement lined ductile iron cement lined cast iron cu pb zhang et al 2017a a more rapid decay of chlorine residual and growth of chlorine resistant bacteria were observed in copper pipes compared to pe reducing chlorination effectiveness lehtola et al 2005 when orthophosphate was present in copper pipes however free chlorine decay rates were found to reduce while chloramine decay rates increased zhang and andrews 2012 2013a new pipes showed higher chlorine decay constants compared to pipes which had been recently used al jasser 2007 thus flushing new systems has been recommended in order to reduce chlorine decay rates al jasser 2007 although flushing may reduce disinfectant decay higher turbidity has been observed in cast iron pipes due to corrosion product detachment compared with plastic pipes douterelo et al 2014 4 4 corrosion products corrosion products are among the major factors influencing disinfectant stability in dwds corrosion products generally increase non dbp producing disinfectant demand rossman et al 2001 however corrosion products have been found to adsorb nom resulting elevated disinfectant demand hassan et al 2006 rossman et al 2001 for example decay rates for chlorine monochloramine and chlorine dioxide were accelerated by the presence of corrosion products such as copper and nickel oxides and iron corrosion products especially in moderately acidic conditions fu et al 2009 hassan et al 2006 liu et al 2013b consequentially these corrosion products accelerated rates of dbp production hu et al 2016a copper and or nickel oxides in chlorinated water have also been reported to enhance the formation of bromate and brominated dbps br dbps hu et al 2016b liu and croue 2016 liu et al 2013a chlorinated water with the presence of bromide ions and cu2o or cu2 were found to favour br dbp formation whereas bromate concentrations increased in the presence of cuo and or nio hu et al 2016b liu and croue 2016 liu et al 2013a this enhancement was observed even with low corrosion product concentrations 2 by weight and especially with high initial dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations liu et al 2013a ndma formation was also found to increase with an increase in dissolved copper which may be due to the complexation of copper with dichloramine catalysing ndma production zhang and andrews 2013b in contrast to the evidence of metals increasing formations of thms and ndma some metals appear to reduce concentrations of some dbps by stimulating their degradation as has been observed for br haas at low ph and high iron dose behbahani and seo 2016 zinc and zero valent iron zvi were reported to promote dehalogenation of haas due to their reducing potential behbahani and seo 2016 wang and zhu 2010 for example br haas were transformed into acetate and both trichloroacetic acid tcaa and dcaa were dehalogenated to monochloroacetic acid mcaa behbahani and seo 2016 wang and zhu 2010 similar reactions were observed when zn ii and iron corrosion products such as green rust and goethite were present arnold et al 2010 fu et al 2009 lee et al 2007 iron corrosion products were also found to accelerate degradation of tcnm trichloroacetonitrile and 1 1 1 trichloropropanone but not chloroform or tcaa arnold et al 2010 chun et al 2005 lee et al 2007 2008 increasing the concentration of goethite also suppressed formation of haas especially dcaa hassan et al 2006 rahman and gagnon 2014 however zvi was found to maximise the formation of iodinated dbps i dbps in chloraminated iodate containing water at ph 8 without the presence of phosphate xia et al 2017 4 5 ph ambient ph was found to influence disinfectant decay rates as well as formation and speciation of dbps inferring that disinfectant stability is highly ph dependant fu et al 2009 kinani et al 2012 zhang et al 2013b chloramine self decay occurs faster at ph 6 than at higher ph fu et al 2009 this effect is more prominent with the presence of cu2 fu et al 2009 a higher chlorine demand has also been observed in acidic water compared to neutral conditions taras et al 1950 the influence of ph on chlorine stability is a consequence of acid base speciation of hypochlorous acid the weaker disinfectant and more stable species ocl predominates at higher ph 7 5 whereas the more reactive hocl is dominant at lower ph 7 5 deborde and von gunten 2008 ambient ph also has an effect on the formation of chloramine species with an optimal range of 7 5 9 0 for monochloramine formation and acidic conditions favouring the formation of dichloramine ph 4 6 and trichloramine 4 4 kinani et al 2012 these species are known to be variably reactive and their formation has an influence on dbp production for example dichloramine formation has been associated with the production of ndma schreiber and mitch 2007 change in ph is known to affect the formation and speciation of dbps roccaro et al 2014 saidan et al 2016 for example an increase in formations of some dbps has been observed with an increase in ph hassan et al 2006 hu et al 2016a 2016b in some reports concentrations of thms especially chbr3 increased whereas haas slightly decreased when ph was increased from 5 5 to 8 5 saidan et al 2016 wang et al 2012 ye et al 2009 when iron corrosion products were present a significant elevation in haas formation was observed with higher ph rahman and gagnon 2014 elevated bromide concentration at ph 7 was reported to produce more br thms relative to cl thms compared with relative concentrations at ph 10 roccaro et al 2014 in contrast the effect of varying br cl ratios on formation of dihalogenated haas was independent of ph roccaro et al 2014 in addition br thms especially bromoform were reported to form more under high ph condition ph 8 saidan et al 2016 thus saidan et al 2016 suggested that maintaining conditions below ph 8 might inhibit formation of br thms more hans and haloketones however were produced under lower ph conditions and their formations were not affected by chlorine dose at higher ph wang et al 2012 in addition to observations regarding dbp formation dbp dehalogenation rates have been found to increase under elevated ph conditions abusallout et al 2017 for example chloral hydrate degraded faster into chloroform at ph 12 compared to ph 7 ma et al 2016 koudjonou et al 2008 showed that the impact of ph on chloral hydrate degradation was linked to temperature more chloral hydrate but slightly less chloroform was formed at 4 c with ph 8 8 compared to 7 6 koudjonou et al 2008 under ph and temperature elevation dehalogenation rates of halogenated dbps have been reported to decrease in the order of i dbps chloraminated dbps br dbps free cl dbps which indicated chloraminated dbps are less stable under these conditions than cl dbps abusallout et al 2017 4 6 hydraulic condition the flow rate of drinking water in a pipe determines its turbulence regime laminar or turbulent and generates corresponding shear stress on pipe surfaces turbulent flows are well known to occur in water mains however laminar flows could be found in dead ends and peripheral zones of dwds where intermittent flow or stagnation might occur romero gomez and choi 2011 it has been reported that disinfectant residuals decay more rapidly with an increase in flow velocity for two reasons jamwal and kumar 2016 zhang and andrews 2013a first turbulent flowrates may produce elevated concentrations of copper lead and iron and their oxidised corrosion products in the absence of orthophosphate zhang and andrews 2013a second decay reactions shift from predominantly bulk water to wall decay due to biofilm removal from pipe surfaces and mass flux transfer of disinfectant from bulk to wall surfaces jamwal and kumar 2016 however a further increase in flow rate beyond those required to produce turbulent flow regimes had negligible impacts on wall decay jamwal and kumar 2016 ndma formation was found to increase significantly in copper pipes under laminar conditions and in iron pipes under turbulent conditions zhang and andrews 2013a hydraulic condition of fluid also influences disinfectant effectiveness in conjunction with microbial impacts section 4 10 2 6 4 7 disinfectant residual disinfectant stability is various according to disinfectant type compared to free chlorine residual chloramine is known to have prolonged disinfectant stability in distribution systems as it hydrolyses slowly in aqueous solutions rice and gomez taylor 1986 chloramine was also found to be more persistent than chlorine in the absence of nitrifying conditions however it decays more rapidly once nitrification occurs in distribution systems sathasivan et al 2008 disinfectant type also influences the formation of dominant dbp species joo and mitch 2007 thms and haas are known to be the dominant dbps in chlorinated water in chloraminated water n nitrosamines and hams have been reported to be dominant n dbp species while the formations of aldehydes and halonitroalkanes have been found to increase with high cl n ratios and circumneutral ph joo and mitch 2007 liew et al 2016 dihalogenated hans were found to be the more prevalent n dbps in chlorinated water liew et al 2016 nevertheless dbps predominantly formed by chloramination processes are less chemically stable than those predominantly formed by chlorination abusallout et al 2017 as bacterial regrowth and disinfectant decay occur re chlor am ination has been practised in distribution systems to maintain disinfection effectiveness al zahrani 2016 carrico and singer 2009 momba and makala 2004 re dosing chlor am ine in distribution systems has been found to retard disinfectant decay in bulk water and temporarily mitigate nitrification jamwal and kumar 2016 xia et al 2017 zeng and mitch 2016 re chloramination has also been reported to reduce concentrations of n dbp precursors xia et al 2017 zeng and mitch 2016 however disinfectant dose is among the main factors influencing dbp formation saidan et al 2016 an extra dose of disinfectant has been reported to result in an elevation of halogenated dbps jamwal and kumar 2016 xia et al 2017 zeng and mitch 2016 varying chlorine dose did not affect thms and haas formations significantly at ph 5 5 but positively correlated to thm formation at ph 7 5 wang et al 2012 4 8 bromide iodide ions high initial bromide and iodide concentrations were found to accelerate monochloramine decay as they increased the inorganic disinfectant demand liu et al 2012 the presence of br or i in chlorinated water could shift cl dbps to increasingly toxic br dbps or i dbps xia et al 2017 for example the addition of bromide raised the formation and yield of total haas br thms and brominated haloacetamides br hams liew et al 2016 wang et al 2012 the higher reactivity of hobr which formed from br oxidisation by hocl is known to be the cause of this species shift langsa et al 2017 saidan et al 2016 however when cl br ratio was within a high range 60 mol mol the formation of total thms decreased slightly with an increase in bromide concentration saidan et al 2016 uyak and toroz 2007 4 9 other water matrix components other water matrix components such as dichloramine concentration alkalinity hardness nom and do have been also found to influence dbp formation for example ndma formation was found to increase with an increase in dichloramine concentration alkalinity and hardness but reduced with increasing nom concentrations zhang and andrews 2013b nom concentration as measured by total organic carbon toc and uv254 has been reported to have a significant positive correlation with thms formation but not so much with haas ye et al 2009 the formation of n dbps has also been found to positively correlate with concentrations of doc and ammonia liew et al 2016 the addition of phosphate from 0 to 1 5 mg l 1 decreased haas formation by more than 14 rahman and gagnon 2014 nevertheless disinfection efficiency could be affected by organic matter and turbidity zhang et al 2013b do concentration was also found to affect dbp degradation kinetics lee et al 2007 2008 for example increasing do concentration from 4 to 8 mg l 1 in the presence of zvi was reported to impede 1 1 1 trichloropropanone degradation by 50 lee et al 2007 although tcnm degradation was maintained with a high rate constant 0 15 min 1 in 0 8 mg o l 1 it was hindered at higher do concentrations when corrosion products were present lee et al 2007 2008 however since do in dwds is normally high 85 saturation it is unlikely to be a significant variable on dbp degradation 4 10 microbial impacts microbial activity is known to be among influencing factors of disinfectant residual stability which may impact disinfectant decay and dbp formation and degradation like disinfectant residual stability microbial changes in bulk water and biofilms can be also affected by water qualities and operating conditions fig 3 nitrification is a prominent example of the interaction of disinfectants and microorganisms 4 10 1 microbial impacts on disinfectant stability as mentioned previously chloramine decay associated with microbial activity occurs before the onset of nitrification and it is further accelerated by nitrification sathasivan et al 2008 microorganisms present in bulk water or in biofilms attached to pipe surfaces have been found to expedite chloramine decay adhikari et al 2012 oxidisable organic carbon produced by biofilms via metabolism of less reactive organics have been reported to accelerate disinfectant decomposition chandy and angles 2001 recent studies have found that rapid chloramine decay could also be a result of its co metabolism by ammonia oxidising bacteria aob and catalytic reaction by smp secreted by microorganisms krishna and sathasivan 2010 krishna et al 2012 maestre et al 2013 smp comprise proteins amines polysaccharides and carbohydrates namkung and rittmann 1986 as smp in wastewater and drinking water may have similar characteristics the knowledge of wastewater smp such as their influencing factors summarised by barker and stuckey 1999 may be applicable to smp in dwds extracellular polymeric substances eps excreted by microbes were also found to hinder the chloramination effectiveness on biofilms xue et al 2014 for example exopolysaccharides polysaccharide eps boosted biofilm cell viability while protein eps reacted with chloramine weakening its penetration of biofilm xue et al 2014 microbes identified under minor nitrification conditions were reported to stimulate chloramine decay as significantly as those under severe nitrification conditions herath et al 2015 therefore microbial control at early stages has been recommended to minimise further deterioration nitrifying biofilms and breakdown of bacterial cells could release doc in the form of proteins polysaccharides and nucleic acids which have been reported as important dbp precursors especially for the formation of hans wang et al 2013a zeng and mitch 2016 for example the formation of n nitrosamines and halogenated dbps in non nitrifying water was elevated after nitrifying biofilms were added zeng and mitch 2016 the yield and speciation of dbps can also be affected by the chemical composition of bacterial secretions protein based secretions having higher organic nitrogen content amino acids have been reported to form more dbps than polysaccharide based secretions wang et al 2012 2013b dbp yield however was not affected by the structures of polysaccharides wang et al 2013b for example more chloroform and haas were produced in the presence of the bacterial strain p putida which secrete protein based eps compared to p aeruginosa which secrete polysaccharide based eps wang et al 2012 similar trends were observed for n dbps with abundant hans wang et al 2012 2013b eps released from high chlorine biofilms in the form of arginine and valine were found to decrease the formation of br haas di trichloropropanone and some n dbps dibromoacetonitrile bromochloroacetonitrile lemus pérez and rodríguez susa 2017 the formation of these dbps along with chloroform and chloropicrin however was increased in low chlorine biofilm with corresponding eps lemus pérez and rodríguez susa 2017 biofilm bacteria have been reported to promote haas biodegradation with degradation rates in the order of monobromo monochloro bromochloro dichloro dibromo trichloroacetic acid bayless and andrews 2008 mcrae et al 2004 zhang et al 2009 however biodegradability of dcaa was found to be greater than monohaloacetic acids for certain bacterial isolates such as afipia felis and herminiimonas fonticola gm2 zhang et al 2009 all organisms involved in haa degradation were found to be members of the phylum proteobacteria zhang et al 2009 haa biodegradation was also reported to correlate strongly with heterotrophic bacteria with low chlorine residuals 0 3 mg l 1 but not high 0 7 mg l 1 tung and xie 2009 nevertheless water temperature was found to have a major impact on haa degradation which is at least partly due to the temperature influences on microbial activities section 4 10 2 1 pluchon et al 2013 4 10 2 factors that influence microbial activities as shown in fig 3 microbial activity is also affected by multi factors like disinfectant residual stability nutrient has been found to most influence biofilm growth followed by hydraulic condition and piping materials simoes et al 2006 disinfectant residual is also well known to be a major factor affecting bacterial activities krishna et al 2013 liu et al 2017c 4 10 2 1 temperature elevating temperature increases biofilm growth especially in the presence of bom ndiongue et al 2005 silhan et al 2006 tsvetanova and dimitrov 2012 zlatanovic et al 2017 this is often observed from seasonal temperature variations for example total and intact cell counts in distribution systems were 5 times greater in summer than in winter prest et al 2016 and biofilm activity fell 50 when the temperature dropped from 17 c to 7 c hallam et al 2001 temperature also affects bacterial density of biofilms such that biofilm heterotrophic plate count hpc was reported to fluctuate positively with temperature variation in plastic pipes tsvetanova and dimitrov 2012 for example an increase in temperature stimulated biofilm growth on polymeric materials such as cross linked polyethylene pex and pe pipes rather than metal pipes silhan et al 2006 thus disinfectant stability has often been found to decrease and consequentially produce more dbps in warmer temperature due not only to its faster chemical reaction kinetics but also to higher demands from the growth of bacteria and biofilms 4 10 2 2 water age prolonged water age encourages microbial growth lautenschlager et al 2010 tsvetanova and dimitrov 2012 supplying water intermittently even just overnight stagnation has found to accelerate bacterial growth in dwds and thus increases the risk of microbial contamination ayoub and malaeb 2006 kumpel and nelson 2013 zlatanovic et al 2017 accelerated bacterial growth would consequentially result in a rapid disinfectant decay and dbp formation as previously discussed in contrast manuel et al 2007 observed less biofilm growth in stagnant water compared to systems under continuous flow conditions this may be due to the same factors that have led to reports of rapid drops in coliform populations under a no flow condition i e dead end where low or no disinfectant residual was detected with established biofilm mcmath et al 1999 while the precise mechanisms are not clear it may be related to depletion of carbon or nutrients required for microbial growth 4 10 2 3 piping materials microbial activity density and diversity could be affected by the types of pipe materials used in distribution systems table 1 hallam et al 2001 momba and makala 2004 silhan et al 2006 tsvetanova and dimitrov 2012 yu et al 2010 for example iron pipes were found to enhance biofilm growth and density especially under oligotrophic conditions norton and lechevallier 2000 pipe materials also change the composition and disinfection resistance of biofilm bacteria norton and lechevallier 2000 the concentrations of bacteria such as mycobacterium avium were lower with free chlorine compared to chloramine on copper pipe surfaces while the opposite was observed on iron pipe surfaces due to the presence of corrosion products norton et al 2004 copper pipes were reported to inhibit biofilm development compared to pe pipes but no significant difference was observed in bacterial populations after biofilms matured lehtola et al 2004 the roughness of pipe surfaces determines bacterial adhesiveness affecting the biofilm formation as nutrients accumulated on rough pipe surfaces favour microbial growth and increase disinfectant demand chattopadhyay 2016 norton and lechevallier 2000 percival et al 1998b simoes et al 2010 for example initial developing biofilm tended to grow on ss grade 304 more so than grade 316 as ss 316 had smoother microscopic surfaces and contained molybdenum percival et al 1998a 1998b stronger bacterial adhesiveness which implies higher shear stress resistance was also observed on ductile cast iron pipe wall compared with grey cast iron and ss pipes due to its relative roughness liu et al 2017b this may be the reason that greater bacterial diversity and richness were observed after flushing plastic pipes compared with cast iron pipes douterelo et al 2014 for slower settling loose deposits there were higher affinities of total heterotrophic bacteria which contained more eps in discoloured water pocas et al 2015 despite the variable biofilm adherence observed for various pipe material types under some conditions pipe materials may have much less significance to biofilm growth under turbulent conditions manuel et al 2007 in some systems microbial activity in plastic pipes was found to be more a function of bulk water properties such as temperature and nutrient concentrations while in cast iron pipes corrosion products played an important role on bacterial composition douterelo et al 2016 experimental studies show that biofilm formations on pipe walls were not influenced by pipe age or bulk water bacteria which are of different taxa to biofilm bacteria kwon et al 2013 tsai et al 2004 there is a consensual agreement that metal surfaces accumulate more bacteria growth than plastic among metals more bacteria were found adhered to cast iron surfaces than copper and ss regarding plastics fewer bacteria were found on pvc and pe however it is unclear which type of plastic supports the lease microbial growth due to differences of water quality and incubation conditions in the experiments listed in table 1 a normalized comparison of microbial activity and density according to pipe material cannot be achieved 4 10 2 4 corrosion products corrosion products have been found to increase pipe roughness as well as extend adhesion surfaces for nutrients accumulation which favours biofilm growth norton and lechevallier 2000 this may further increase disinfectant demand and affect dbp formation as discussed in section 4 4 some species of bacteria such as agrobacterium sp were reported to promote biocorrosion of copper dutkiewicz and fallowfield 1998 overnight stagnation also promoted leaching of copper and zinc from pipes zlatanovic et al 2017 4 10 2 5 nom nutrients varying nom and available nutrients including ammonia nitrogen and soluble phosphorus influences disinfectant stability directly and indirectly by affecting the growth of suspended and biofilm embedded cells more so than other environmental factors liu et al 2017c the availabilities of nom such as assimilable organic carbon aoc and microbially available phosphorus map in drinking water have been found to correlate positively with the growth and density of biofilms and bulk water organisms but affect diversity negatively camper et al 2003 chu and lu 2004 fang et al 2009 keinanen et al 2002 lehtola et al 2002 rubulis and juhna 2007 tsai et al 2004 zhang et al 2017b in contrast enhancement of biofilm formation has also been observed under nutrient starvation conditions elhariry et al 2012 4 10 2 5 1 nom the effect of nom on microbial change has been observed especially in the absence of disinfectant residuals which caused a longer time for biofilms to reach bio stabilisation gagnon et al 2000 ndiongue et al 2005 ollos et al 2003 when bom was added or aoc level was low cell growth was found to be faster in biofilms than in bulk water gagnon et al 2000 tsai et al 2004 in an apparent contradictory observation the growth rate of heterotrophic biofilm bacteria and the yield of biomass decreased with an increase in carbon concentration ellis et al 1999 4 10 2 5 2 nutrients phosphorus is often applied to distribution systems in the form of phosphate as a corrosion inhibitor as mentioned in section 4 3 phosphorus has been reported to enhance disinfection efficiency when humic substances and iron oxide containing corrosion products were present butterfield et al 2002a fang et al 2009 2010 for example p reduced exopolysaccharide production in biofilms so that a less disinfectant resistant especially monochloramine structure was formed fang et al 2009 2010 in one case the addition of ammonium nitrate or phosphate was found to stimulate microbial growth in urban distribution systems but not obviously in suburban areas chu et al 2005 effects of p on microbial growth may depend on which nutrients may be growth limiting in the particular water supply fang et al 2009 for example p has been found to be the primary limiting nutrient among c n and fe for both yield and growth rate of microorganisms in intake water which may have similar characters to those in potable water supply systems haas et al 1988 sathasivan and ohgaki 1999 confirmed that p was the limiting inorganic nutrient for bacterial regrowth in dwds however no significant impact on bacterial regrowth or biofilm formation was observed when orthophosphate was dosed increasing map or phosphorus concentration was lower than 1 μg l 1 batte et al 2003 gouider et al 2009 rubulis and juhna 2007 although the interaction between p and bom had no impacts on hpc positive effects were observed on biofilm mass and physiological function of biofilm forming bacteria from a low to high level of p park and hu 2010 despite the evidence for the role of nutrients in some cases some studies have shown that the addition of n p and s did not promote bacterial growth in either bulk water or pipe walls as organic carbon did frias et al 2001 park and hu 2010 it might be because carbon substrate 66 was the main nutrient consumed by biofilms on plastic pipes followed by n 33 and only small quantities of p and s 1 biedron et al 2017 overall biofilm bacteria growth often with the increase in nutrient concentrations deteriorates disinfectant stability as previously discussed 4 10 2 6 hydraulic condition hydrodynamics plays a significant role in biofilm growth and biocorrosion in pipes as shear forces generated by the flow detaches biofilm bacteria tsai 2005 compared to laminar conditions a higher number of total and cultivable bacteria in biofilms was found and biofilm reached steady state faster under turbulent conditions when nil or low chlorine residual was present guan et al 2009 lehtola et al 2006 simoes et al 2006 2012 low shear stress was reported to remove a large amount of biofilm and deposits from the outer layer of biofilms while elevated shear stress could not impact the basal layer which was more cohesive and dense liu et al 2017b when chlorine was absent changing flow rate had no impact on biofilm development whereas the diversity of bacteria increased with biofilm aging guan et al 2009 with higher chlorine residual however high shear stress stimulated biofilm detachment and enhanced disinfection effectiveness by promoting chlorine penetration into biofilms tsai 2006 bacterial accumulation on pipe surfaces was reported to be initially stimulated by high wall shear rates then reach a steady state after a long exposure time paris et al 2007 high flowrate hinders cell growth in biofilms and bulk water liu et al 2017c for example the highest biofilm hpc was detected at 1 5 m s 1 in the range of 0 2 m s 1 liu et al 2017c while biofilm growth was reduced the most within flow velocities ranging 3 4 m s 1 cloete et al 2003 in a contrasting study although the maximum quantity of biofilm bacteria reduced bacteria growth rate did not decelerate at high flow velocity tsai 2005 by identifying the bacterial composition in biofilms douterelo et al 2013 showed that bacterial community structure was not affected by the hydraulic condition during initial biofilm development however fish et al 2017 recently found that hydraulic patterns affected biofilm physical structures and their eps characteristics with various response to shear stress change compared to slightly varied flow biofilms highly varied flow biofilms have been found to produce more eps and develop greater biomass volumes which have given them more compact structures to resist to pipe flushing douterelo et al 2013 fish et al 2017 although pipe flushing was found to promote biocorrosion on copper pipes due to the detachment of biofilms and sediments from the sudden increase in flow rate regular repeat flushes may improve biofilm stability because it reduces bacterial diversity by selecting great shear strength favouring bacteria douterelo et al 2016 lehtola et al 2006 pizarro and vargas 2016 4 10 2 7 disinfectant residuals types and concentration of disinfectant residuals have been reported to affect bacterial growth speciation and population that influence disinfection efficiency in distribution systems butterfield et al 2002b codony et al 2005 gagnon et al 2006 liu et al 2015b for example biofilms in organic carbon limited water continued to develop when chloramine was present but ceased with free chlorine chandy and angles 2001 gagnon et al 2006 concluded that chlorine dioxide had the highest efficiency on bacterial inactivation followed by free chlorine then chloramine however chlorine dioxide residual decomposes very quickly under neutral or basic conditions hence it is less popular compared to chlor am ination as a secondary disinfectant haas 2010 when free chlorine residual was present cell growth in both biofilm and bulk water was minimised with reduced biomass of biofilms while the specific growth rate of biofilm bacteria increased butterfield et al 2002b liu et al 2017c tsai 2006 high disinfectant residual could also suppress biofilm hpc significantly even when bacteria regrew liu et al 2015a ollos et al 2003 with a decrease in chloramine residuals nitrification metabolites increased in both concentration and diversity krishna et al 2013 the complex diversity and composition of biofilms increased the difficulties for chlorine penetrating into these more disinfectant resistant biofilms miller et al 2015 for example naegleria fowleri associated with a biofilm is more resistant to chlorine than when it exists alone in drinking water pipes miller et al 2015 however low chlorine residual 1 0 mg l 1 may encourage the initiation of microbial attachment and microbial growth especially in high aoc content water liu et al 2015a 2015b continuous and discontinuous chlorination also affects microbial production codony et al 2005 once biofilms are established for example bacteria grown under discontinuous chlorination conditions could not be fully eliminated even when re chlorination was introduced codony et al 2005 mathieu et al 2009 however no significant impact was observed on microbial regrowth between chorine dosage of 0 2 and 1 0 mg l 1 sharafimasooleh et al 2016 applying free chlorine could reduce bacterial adhesion but was not so effective for reducing aflatoxin chattopadhyay 2016 different structures of biofilm were observed between chlorinated and non chlorinated biofilms cultured in carbohydrate while similar biofilm structure was found in amino acids in carbon limited water butterfield et al 2002b proteins were found to be chlorine consumers in low chlorine biofilms while humic substance aggregators in high chlorine biofilm lemus pérez and rodríguez susa 2017 eps in biofilms grown in low chlorine environments contained more amino acids including alanine threonine proline and isoleucine which could be parts of humic substances and soluble proteins whereas more aromatic proteins were detected in high chlorine biofilm eps lemus pérez and rodríguez susa 2017 when a biofilm was initially exposed to free chlorine or monochloramine biomass was consumed resulting in decreased thickness and increased stiffness shen et al 2016 after a long term exposure 3 months however the same biofilm adapted to the disinfectant and became more rigid and resistant to detachment with an increase in its thickness and stiffness shen et al 2016 more protein biomass than polysaccharide was found in those biofilms shen et al 2016 which has been reported to decay chloramine rapidly sathasivan et al 2008 4 10 2 8 ph microorganisms have optimal conditions for growth varying ph to suboptimal growth conditions may reduce bacterial growth in distribution systems for example aob growth is favoured around ph 7 than at higher ph conditions oldenburg et al 2002 when ph was increased to 8 5 or above nitrifying bacteria growth was found to be controlled skadsen 2002 adjusting ph in distribution systems also influences other factors such as pipe corrosion section 4 5 and disinfectant stability which may produce combined influences to microbial activity for example the influence of ph on bacterial growth described above has been reported to be diminished in the presence of iron corrosion products and humic substance butterfield et al 2002a 4 10 3 nitrification nitrification is a prominent example of simultaneous changes between disinfectants and microorganisms in which chlor am ine decays and ammonia converts to nitrite and then nitrate by microbial interactions the decay of chloramine releases ammonia promoting nitrification which further decreases disinfection effectiveness pressman et al 2012 nitrite concentration was found to correspond quantitatively with aob presence which is linked to the degree of nitrification pintar and slawson 2003 smp excreted by microbes in severely nitrifying water was reported to stimulate chloramine decay and dbp formation which was recently found to be protein based herath et al 2015 2018 liu et al 2014 inactivating these protein based smp required additional free chlorine or the addition of silver bal krishna and sathasivan 2012 krishna et al 2014 thus krishna et al 2013 suggested controlling chloramine decay before nitrification occurs would be more effective temperature ph nutrients water age and disinfectant residual have been found to have high impacts on nitrification occurrence since they were reported to influence both chemical section 4 and microbial changes section 4 10 2 a summary of how these factors influence occurrence of nitrification is shown in fig 4 krishna et al 2014 nhmrc and nrmmc 2011 pintar and slawson 2003 rahman et al 2011 sarker and sathasivan 2011 sarker et al 2013 sathasivan et al 2008 skadsen 2002 yang et al 2007 zhang and edwards 2010 zhang et al 2013b zhang et al 2010 the population and activities of nitrifiers which strongly links to the extent of nitrification in distribution systems were reported to depend on pipe materials and nutrient concentrations zhang and edwards 2010 the consumption rates of chloramine and do and the rates of hpc proliferation and free ammonia production were found to decrease in the following pipe materials galvanised steel unlined cast iron hybrid pvc lined cast iron unlined cast iron and galvanised steel liu et al 2005 a more rapid disinfectant decay and far higher thm production have been observed in re chloraminated water from supply reservoirs compared to water freshly originating from a water treatment plant fisher et al 2009 simard et al 2011 this may be due to the higher microbial population especially nitrifiers found in reservoirs krishna and sathasivan 2010 observed that losses of chloramine nitrite and nh3 n in re chloraminated severely nitrified water 0 38 mg cl2 l 1 0 2 mg n l 1 were 10 times more rapid than those in mildly nitrified water 1 9 mg cl2 l 1 0 007 mg n l 1 therefore selecting a proper dosage and location for re chlor am ination is important to minimise dbp formation al zahrani 2016 application of free chlorine should be sufficient yet not exceeded for nitrification prevention in storage tanks in distribution systems zeng and mitch 2016 re chlorination is recommended at points near storage facilities where long water age is expected carrico and singer 2009 in a chloraminated system applying re chloramination just after nitrification or at near zero chloramine residuals is suggested to deaccelerate chloramine decay krishna et al 2016 5 conclusion the influencing parameters of disinfectant stability have been qualitatively investigated in this review these factors are not completely independent and may lead to positive feedback loops such that microbial growth leads to a rapid decay of disinfectant residual further promoting microbial growth the types and dosages of disinfectants would be the most important factors affecting disinfectant stability disinfectant stability can be reduced by higher temperature and more microbial activities with abundant nutrients although the effects of nutrient and nom have been well investigated for heterotrophic bacteria few studies were available for assessing this approach for controlling nitrifiers in drinking water pipe material also plays a major role in disinfectant stability as well as biofilm growth by affecting microbial activity density and diversity corrosion products increase the demand of disinfectant causing reduced disinfectant concentrations and increased dbp formation therefore it is necessary to consider what type of pipe materials to use and how it might affect final water quality when designing a water distribution system various dbp species have different responses to changes in operational factors the presence of bromide and iodide ions can further impact the speciation of dbps understanding how chemical and microbial changes relate to disinfectant residuals in distribution systems is important to facilitate safe management of drinking water quality for the protection of public health however this understanding has been hindered by most individual studies focusing either on the role of chemical changes or microbial changes in isolation therefore future study is proposed to investigate correlations of influencing factors and microbial changes to disinfectant residual stability in drinking water distribution systems acknowledgements this work was funded by

18999,developing a forward osmosis fo membrane with superior ammonia selectivity and robust antifouling performance is important for treating domestic wastewater dw but challenging due to the similar polarities and hydraulic radii of nh4 and water molecules herein we investigated the feasibility of using polyamidoamine pamam dendrimer to simultaneously enhance the ammonia rejection rate and antifouling capacity of the thin film composite tfc fo membrane pamam dendrimer with abundant easily protonated terminal amine groups was grafted on tfc fo membrane surface via covalent bonds which inspired the tfc fo membrane surface with appreciable zeta potential isoelectric point ph 5 5 and outstanding hydrophilicity water contact angle 39 83 0 57 benefiting from the electrostatic repulsion between the protonated amine layer and nh4 n as well as the concentration induced diffusion resistance the introduction of pamam dendrimer endowed the grafted membrane with a superior nh4 n rejection rate of 98 23 and a significantly reduced the reverse solute flux when using nh4cl solutions as feed solution meanwhile the perfect balance between the electrostatic repulsion to positively charged micromoleculer ions metal ions and nh4 n and the electrostatic attraction to negatively charged macromolecular organic foulants together with the hydrophilic nature of amine groups facilitated the enhancement of the grafted membranes in antifouling capacity and hence the nh4 n selectivity rejection rate of 91 81 during the concentration of raw dw the overall approach of this work opens up a frontier for preparation of ammonia selective and antifouling tfc fo membrane graphical abstract image 1 keywords forward osmosis ammonia selectivity antifouling capacity polyamidoamine dendrimer domestic wastewater concentration 1 introduction forward osmosis fo membrane technology which is driven by an osmotic gradient instead of hydraulic pressure to spontaneously transport water through a membrane has attracted widespread attention in the fields of food processing seawater desalination and wastewater treatment fan et al 2018 kim et al 2018 luo et al 2017a qin et al 2018 rastogi 2016 recent studies proposed fo as an ecological pretreatment process which can simultaneously extract water from wastewater for water reclamation and retain the organics and nutrients in the concentrate for subsequent resources recovery agrawal et al 2018 chekli et al 2016 jun et al 2017 limited by the absence of economically regenerable draw solution fo is usually performed as a pretreatment for reverse osmosis ro to directly confront wastewater and thereby provides the downstream ro with diluted and high quality draw solution to accomplish water reclamation lu et al 2018 luo et al 2016 which significantly reduces the fouling propensity of ro and thus yields much higher overall energy efficiency than the conventional ro process kook et al 2018 notably fo based system shows great potential for addressing the issues of water scarcity and resource shortage by recovering the embedded water energy and nutrient resources from domestic wastewater dw in the form of anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor gu et al 2015 luo et al 2017b qiu et al 2015 wang et al 2017 zirehpour et al 2017 generally fo membranes exhibit excellent rejection capacity for most organics and phosphate po4 3 p owing to the size sieving effect lau et al 2015 however the inferior selectivity of fo membranes for ammonia nitrogen nh4 n tremendously restrict their practical application in dw treatment rejection rate of approximately 60 ansari et al 2017 hou et al 2017 the extremely similar properties between the nh4 and water molecules such as their polarity and hydraulic radius prevent fo membranes from easily discriminating the two molecules arena et al 2014b when treating ammonia containing wastewater with fo hybrid systems continuous transmembrane diffusion of nh4 would contaminate the draw solution and adversely affect the produced water quality of the coupled draw solution re concentration system since low pressure ro and nanofiltration membranes also do not exhibit outstanding nh4 rejection chekli et al 2016 d haese et al 2013 luo et al 2016 zhao et al 2012 furthermore the loss of nh4 n from the concentrate is detrimental to the subsequent recovery of nutrients from ammonia containing wastewater especially dw guadie et al 2014 ronteltap et al 2010 therefore an ammonia selective fo membrane is desirable for osmotic membrane based applications however to the best of our knowledge studies on the preparation or modification of fo membranes with improved nh4 n selectivity are rare in current literature in an osmotic membrane process the transmembrane diffusion of nh4 is driven by its concentration gradient across a membrane arena et al 2014b theoretically the selectivity of a fo membrane for nh4 n can be enhanced by repelling nh4 from the membrane surface which reduces the osmotic driving force for nh4 diffusion into the draw solution lu et al 2014 therefore based on the positively charged nature of nh4 a fo membrane covered with positive charges should have improved selectivity for nh4 due to electrostatic repulsion besides the diffusion resistance of nh4 toward the membrane surface can theoretically be increased by grafting an easily protonatable amine layer on the membrane surface because the surface fixed protonated amine group r nh3 improves the nh4 concentration on the membrane surface to some extent in addition the highly hydrophilic property of the exposed polar amine groups will improve the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface which is conducive to alleviating membrane fouling li et al 2017 liu et al 2017 therefore an easily protonatable amine layer might endow the fo membrane surface with positive charges fixed ammonia and a superior hydrophilicity thus enhancing the nh4 selectivity and antifouling capacity of fo membrane polyamidoamine pamam dendrimer with a radially symmetrical and hyperbranched structure possesses much higher amine group densities on its globular and tree like surface than other macromolecules bahadir and sezginturk 2016 li et al 2017 the number of terminal amine groups in the pamam dendrimer exponentially increases with the generation 2n 2 n is the dendrimer generation mansourpanah and jafari 2015 pamam dendrimer has fulfilled applications in areas such as drug delivery kesharwani et al 2014 nanoparticle synthesis zhao et al 2013 and catalysis wang and astruc 2013 the abundant amine groups on the pamam dendrimer surface are perfect active sites for chemical attachment to the surface of thin film composite tfc membrane via the formation of amide bonds with the unreacted acyl chloride groups on the polyamide pa layer zhu et al 2015 besides compared with aromatic amide dendrimer the aliphatic pamam dendrimer exhibits a higher pka value allowing the terminal amines to be easily protonated and creating more charges on the membrane surface de jubera et al 2012 li et al 2017 saenz de jubera et al 2013 these material and structure properties make the pamam dendrimer a perfect candidate for modification of fo membrane to achieve both superior nh4 selectivity and robust antifouling capacity in this work we investigated the feasibility of different generations g0 3 of pamam dendrimers to improve the nh4 n selectivity and antifouling capacity of fo membrane by a surface grafting method the performances of the tfc fo membranes before and after grafting with pamam dendrimers were investigated in terms of their osmotic permeability selectivity for nh4 n at various concentrations and the concentration efficiency of nh4 n from dw the membrane surface morphology surface charge and membrane fouling during dw concentration were also characterized the results in this study demonstrate the pamam dendrimer has great potential for developing fo membranes with superior ammonia selectivity and robust antifouling capacities this work may provide insights for the further development of membranes with enhanced nh4 n rejection properties 2 materials and methods

supplementary information si n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp 99 m phenylenediamine mpd 99 5 trimesoyl chloride tmc 98 and n hexane 99 were all ordered from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa polyethylene glycol peg mn 600 sodium chloride nacl 99 5 and other conventional reagents of analytical purity were purchased from aladdin shanghai china all chemicals were used as received without further purification sulfonated polyethersulfone spes with a sulfonation degree of 1 was provided by yanjin technology co ltd tianjin china and was dried at 80 c for 2 days before use ultrapure water 18 25 mω cm was used for all experiments 2 2 fabrication of the tfc fo membranes the pamam dendrimer grafted tfc fo membranes were prepared in three steps i e phase separation interfacial polymerization and grafting first the spes support layer was fabricated via a non solvent induced phase separation method the spes 14 wt and peg 10 wt were dissolved in nmp and the dope solution was stirred by a magnetic stirrer at 80 c for 24 h the prepared casting solution was then degassed at 25 c for at least 24 h afterwards the casting solution was cast onto clean glass plates using an automatic casting machine with a knife height of 100 μm the casted film was immediately and smoothly immersed into a 25 c ultrapure water coagulant bath the resultant spes substrates were kept in the ultrapure water bath for 3 h to remove the residual solvent then rinsed thoroughly and stored in ultrapure water for future use next the pa active layer was fabricated on the top surface of the spes substrate by interfacial polymerization the substrate was first immersed in a 2 wt aqueous mpd solution 40 ml for 2 min after removal of excess water droplets the upper surface of the saturated substrate was brought into contact with 0 1 wt tmc in n hexane 40 ml for 1 min after the excess solution was poured out the resultant membrane was rinsed with fresh n hexane solution and then dried in air for 0 5 min finally a 1 wt aqueous solution 40 ml with different generations of pamam dendrimers was poured onto the nascent pa layer for 15 min to accomplish the chemical grafting by forming amide bond between the unreacted acyl chloride groups on the pa layer and amine groups from pamam dendrimer besides the pristine tfc fo membrane was prepared by replacing the aqueous solution with ultrapure water then the prepared membranes were thoroughly washed and stored in ultrapure water at 4 c for further characterizations in this study the pristine tfc fo membrane and pamam dendrimer grafted tfc fo membranes with generations 0 1 2 and 3 were abbreviated fo p fo g0 fo g1 fo g2 and fo g3 respectively 2 3 osmotic performance evaluation of the tfc fo membranes the intrinsic pure water permeability a and salt permeability coefficient b of the tfc fo membranes were determined using a cross flow ro system and the experimental procedures were detailedly described in si fo experiments were conducted on a lab scale cross flow fo experimental setup as shown in fig s2 the experimental procedures were illustrated in si all the membranes were tested under fo mode with the active layer facing the feed solution to evaluate the water flux and reverse salt flux of the tfc fo membranes a 1 mol l nacl aqueous solution and ultrapure water with an initial volumes of 1 l were used as draw and feed solutions respectively the concentration of the nacl draw solution was maintained using a conductivity controller equipped with a 5 mol l nacl solution each test was conducted until the water reduction in the feed solution reached 50 during the fo operation after the pure water test the feed solution was changed to the nh4cl solutions with a gradient concentration of nh4 n 50 100 200 and 500 mg l to evaluate the nh4 n selectivity of the tfc fo membranes each test was complete when the water reduction in the feed solution reached 50 the feed solution was then replaced with raw dw to evaluate the concentration efficiency the raw dw was obtained from the septic tank effluent in the adjacent residential area and the characteristic of the wastewater is illustrated in table s1 in order to ensure the stable composition of each influent one batch of dw was precipitated and the supernatant was stored in the refrigerating chamber for using during the concentration test the water reduction in the feed water was set at 50 the water flux j w and the reverse salt flux j s pure water test only were then calculated and these calculations are described in the si at least 3 replicates were performed for each membrane type to obtain a data set with less than a 5 standard deviation 2 4 analytical methods water samples were collected from the feed and draw solutions before and after the concentration tests of nh4cl solutions and dw after the concentration of dw half fouled membrane was cut and soaked in a 15 ml of 0 01 mol l sodium hydroxide solution under sonication for 30 min to extract the foulants off membrane surface the extracts were then neutralized with 2 mol l hydrochloric acid and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane for further characterization the nh4 n in all samples and the total nitrogen tn and po4 3 p in dw samples were measured according to the standard methods clesceri et al 2012 total organic carbon toc in the dw samples and foulant extracts were analyzed by a toc analyzer toc 5000a shimadzu japan inorganic ions in the foulant extracts were analyzed by an inductively coupled plasma icp optima 5300 cv perkin elmer inc the components of foulant extracts were characterized by a 3d excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy fp 6500 jasco japan besides the molecular weight mw distributions of organic foulant in the extracts were determined using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system with an ultraviolet detector which was based on the method of chen et al 2017 and descripted in si 2 5 characterization of tfc fo membranes all the membrane samples were dried in a vacuum drying oven at 30 c for 24 h prior to the surface characterizations field emission scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss sigma 500 germany was used to visually analyze the membrane surface morphologies of different tfc fo membranes before and after membrane fouling all membrane samples were coated with gold using a precision etching coating apparatus gatan 682 usa before the sem observation the surface roughness of all the tfc fo membranes was analyzed by atomic force microscopy afm bruker dimension fastscan usa under tapping mode at room temperature the root mean square roughness rms was calculated from the height profile of each images in the range of 2 μm 2 μm attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir thermo fisher scientific nicolet is50 usa was performed to identify the major functional groups of the fouling layer on tfc fo membranes additionally the chemical compositions of the pristine and pamam dendrimer grafted tfc fo membranes were systematically analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo fisher scientific escalab 250xi usa the static contact angles of the tfc fo membranes were measured with a contact angle goniometer dataphysics oca germany using sessile drop method at 25 c a 2 μl droplet of ultrapure water was dropped on the tfc fo membrane surface and the contact angles were measured after 10 s at least 5 measurements were repeated on different locations of a dried membrane the membrane surface zeta potential was measured by a surpass streaming potential analyzer eka anton paar gmbh austria automatic titration was used to measure the ζ potential and isoelectric point of tfc fo membranes at various ph values the surface zeta potential was calculated from the measured streaming potential according to the helmholtz smoluchowski equation childress and elimelech 1996 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface characterization of the tfc fo membranes the surface chemical structures of the tfc fo membranes were extensively characterized by xps the xps data fig 1 a showed that the grafted membranes possessed higher n contents than the pristine membrane which confirmed the successful grafting of the pamam dendrimer on the pa layer because the pamam dendrimers have a much higher n content than the pa layer table s2 in addition the ratio of the grafted pamam dendrimer on the pa layer was calculated by comparing the discrepancy between the n c values table s1 of the tfc fo membrane surface and the corresponding pamam dendrimer the amine proportion on the grafted membrane surface could then be estimated as shown in table s3 the proportion of amine groups on pa layer surfaces increased 2 50 for fo g0 2 70 for fo g1 and then decreased 2 93 for fo g3 as the pamam dendrimer generation increased and a maximum proportion of 3 43 was achieved in fo g2 the discrepancy among the proportion of amine groups on the tfc fo membranes grafted with different generations of the pamam dendrimer can be attributed to the amine group numbers and molecular volumes of the pamam dendrimers the number of terminal amine groups of the pamam dendrimer doubles as the generation moving from one to the next table s2 and fig s1 the membrane surfaces grafted with a higher generation of the pamam dendrimer should theoretically possess higher amine proportions however during the grafting process the unreacted acyl chloride groups on the nascent pa layer surface would not only form amide bonds with the terminal amine groups of the pamam dendrimer but also be highly susceptible to hydrolysis into carboxyl groups and eventually became amine inactive besides the molecular volume measured by dynamic laser scattering and shown in fig s3 of the higher generation pamam dendrimers especially g3 significantly enhanced as the generation increases bahadir and sezginturk 2016 tomalia 2005 the rapid growth in the molecular volume results in a greater diffusion resistance of high generation pamam dendrimers in aqueous solution which consequently becomes less competitive in bonding with acyl chloride groups therefore more terminal amine groups and a moderate molecular volume contributed to the highest grafting coverage and amine proportion on the fo g2 surface the zeta potential curves of the tfc fo membranes were obtained as a function of the ph fig 1b fo p was negatively charged over the whole ph range 3 10 due to the presence of abundant deprotonated carboxyl groups coo on the pa layer surface after grafting the pamam dendrimer the zeta potential values of the grafted membranes were significantly enhanced which indicated the amine groups of the pamam dendrimer could effectively counteract the negative charges of the carboxyl groups on the pa layer as a result the grafted membranes exhibited typical amphiprotic surfaces and the isoelectric point ph was found fo g2 possessed a higher potential value and isoelectric point ph 5 5 than the other grafted membranes ph 4 3 4 8 and 5 1 for fo g0 fo g1 and fo g3 respectively over the entire ph range in addition the introduction of amine groups significantly improved the membrane surface wettability after grafting the pamam dendrimer the contact angles fig 1c of the grafted membranes 46 95 0 39 43 87 0 73 39 83 0 57 and 43 58 0 46 for fo g0 fo g1 fo g2 and fo g3 respectively decreased compared with that of the fo p 51 32 0 89 generally a higher proportion of amine groups facilitated a lower contact angle due to the hydrophilic property of the exposed polar amine groups xu et al 2015 besides sem and afm were utilized to characterize the surface morphologies of the tfc fo membranes as shown in fig 2 the sem images showed that all the tfc fo membranes had a typical ridge and valley morphology the protrusions on the membrane surfaces gradually became shorter and thicker as the pamam dendrimer generation increased this result indicated the total volume of pamam dendrimer that grafted both on the panels and the protrusions of pa layers increased with the pamam dendrimer generations in terms of roughness the pamam dendrimer grafted on the surface of the protrusions would contribute to an increase in surface roughness while that grafted on the panel would reduce the overall roughness as revealed by the afm images fig 2 the pamam dendrimer grafted membranes the rms values of the fo g0 fo g1 fo g2 and fo g3 were 30 8 0 8 28 7 0 5 27 8 0 3 and 26 5 0 3 nm respectively possessed a higher surface roughness than the fo p 25 7 0 7 nm indicating that the grafting of pamam dendrimer on the surface of the protrusion exceeded that on the panel 3 2 osmotic performances of the tfc fo membranes prior to the osmotic evaluation the transport properties of each membrane were tested using a cross flow ro system and calculated in table s4 the fo p possessed the higher permeability and the lower nacl rejection than the grafted membranes this indicated that the diffusion resistance of water through the grafted membranes increased after the grafting of pamam dendrimers the fo performances of the tfc fo membranes were shown in fig 3 a the water flux of the fo p exceeded that of the grafted membranes while its reverse nacl flux was slightly inferior to the grafted membranes the tiny differences in both the water flux and reverse solute flux for all the tfc fo membranes indicated the channel structure of the pa active layer barely changed after grafting the pamam dendrimer surprisingly even though the fo p possessed a lower rejection rate to nacl under pressurized condition table s4 it exhibited lower reverse passage of nacl during fo test the selectivity of each membrane for nacl fig 3a was evaluated by comparing the specific salt flux j s j w which is an intrinsic value applied to measure the draw solute loss per unit of water passage phillip et al 2010 fo p still had a lower j s j w value than that of the grafted membranes indicating the membrane selectivity for nacl under fo system decreased after amine groups were introduced on the pa layer this phenomenon could hypothetically be attributed to the donnan exclusion and dielectric effects since the surface charge exerts a significant influence on membrane separation processe arena et al 2014a mi et al 2015 as illustrated in fig 3b during an osmotic transportation process with nacl as the draw solute cl had more difficulty transferring through the pa active layer since the hydrated ionic radius of cl is larger than that of na hu et al 2017 kiriukhin and collins 2002 after the pamam dendrimer was grafted on the pa layer the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged cl and the positively charged protonated amine groups nh3 facilitated the diffusion of cl through the pa layer enlargement in fig 3b however the relatively weak attractive interaction worked only for those cl in the pa channels near the surface in this case the reverse diffusion of cl into the feed solution was slightly promoted meanwhile na would equivalently transfer with cl to maintain the electroneutrality of the draw solution mi et al 2015 xu et al 2017 therefore the selectivity of the pamam dendrimer grafted membranes for nacl slightly decreased 3 3 nh4 n selectivity of the tfc fo membranes the selectivities of the pristine and pamam dendrimer grafted tfc fo membranes for nh4cl solution at different concentrations 50 100 200 and 500 mg l nh4 n were evaluated to eliminate the variations of the membrane surface potential when using nh4cl solutions with different concentrations all solutions were adjusted to the same ph value same to the ph of dw in general as shown in fig 4 a fo p showed a poor rejection ability for nh4 n at both low 70 36 and 75 2 at 50 and 100 mg l respectively and high 83 99 and 88 64 at 200 and 500 mg l respectively concentrations while the grafted membranes exhibited remarkable enhancements in selectivity for nh4 n rejection rates of more than 93 for all concentrations as previously mentioned fo membranes typically have inferior retention for nh4 n because of the very similar polarity and radius of water molecule and nh4 n after grafting the pamam dendrimer on the membrane surface even though the grafted membrane surfaces were still negatively charged the surface fixed protonated amines nh3 were prone to show strong electrostatic repulsion toward nh4 and create diffusion resistance to nh4 by increasing the concentration of fixed nh4 on the membrane surface fig 4b in this case most nh4 was excluded from the pa active layer and the driving force for nh4 n to diffuse through the membrane active layer was significantly reduced in addition the negligible changes in the water flux fig 4a among the tfc fo membranes further indicated that the improved nh4 n selectivity of the grafted membrane was not attributed to a structural transformation of the pa active layer but the presence of protonated amine groups on the membrane surface the concentrations of na in all the concentrated nh4cl solutions were also measured table s5 to evaluate the reverse solute flux of each tfc fo membrane when concentrating nh4cl solution interestingly the concentrations of na in the concentrate of fo p which exhibited a lower j s j w value than the grafted membranes with ultrapure water as feed solution exceeded those concentrates of the grafted membranes as illustrated in fig 4c for a membrane with a low nh4 n selectivity nh4 n can easily diffuse from the feed solution into the draw solution while its paired anion cl tends to stay in the feed solution under this circumstance the reverse diffusion of na from the draw solution into the feed solution is accelerated like cation exchange to maintain the electroneutrality of the feed solution lu et al 2014 mi et al 2015 in conclusion introducing the pamam dendrimer can significantly enhance the selectivity of tfc fo membranes for nh4 n and effectively alleviate the reverse diffusion of nacl when concentrating ammonia containing water 3 4 dw concentration performance and membrane fouling raw dw was applied as feed solution to evaluate the resource retention capacity and membrane fouling of the pristine and pamam dendrimer grafted tfc fo membranes the rejection rates of toc po4 3 p tn and nh4 n from dw were measured and the results were shown in fig 5 a all the tfc fo membranes exhibited nearly complete retention for toc and po4 3 p while the rejection rates of tn and nh4 n varied greatly with the tfc fo membranes the nh4 n rejection rate of the pristine membrane was less than 60 while the grafted membranes exhibited significant enhancements in the nh4 n rejection capacity all the rejection rates exceeded 83 and fo g2 had a remarkable rejection rate of 91 81 benefiting from the enhanced retentions for nh4 n by the grafted membranes the rejection rates of the grafted membranes to tn were also significantly increased the normalized water flux of each tfc fo membrane during dw concentration was also calculated as a function of the accumulative permeate volume and plotted in fig 5b generally the normalized water flux of all membranes decreased during the concentration process indicating the membrane surface suffered from fouling since the osmotic pressure of the draw solution was remained constant specifically the normalized water flux of fo p decreased rapidly in the initial concentration process while the grafted membranes especially fo g2 exhibited a relative stable normalized water flux during the entire concentration process suggesting fo p was very susceptible to membrane fouling and the presence of hydrophilic amines significantly alleviated membrane fouling besides the surficial and cross sectional sem images of the fouled membranes were obtained to visualize the fouling of each membrane fig 5c g all the membrane surfaces were contaminated and covered with a fouling layer the cross sectional structure of the fouling layers manifested the variations in the severity of membrane fouling as expected fo p possessed the thickest fouling layer and fo g2 has the thinnest one for the grafted membranes the severity of membrane fouling were consistent with the distribution of the amine proportions on the membrane surfaces namely a higher amine proportion on the membrane surface contributed to a milder membrane fouling to further validate the effect of the surface fixed amine groups on membrane fouling the properties of the fouling layers on the membrane surfaces were systematically analyzed the ft ir spectra of the fouled tfc fo membranes fig 6 a revealed that the organic components of the fouling layer were mainly consisted of the humic acids broad absorptions from 3700 to 3000 cm 1 proteins peaks at 1639 and 1541 cm 1 and polysaccharides peaks at 1018 cm 1 lu et al 2013 sun et al 2016 tang et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 which were illustrated in si in detail the molecular weight of the organic foulants in the fouling layers were measured by hplc uv fig 6b and the results suggested that fo p and fo g0 possessed larger proportions of foulants with higher molecular weight 2173 da peak 1 while the foulants with lower molecular weight 255 da peak 2 17 da peak 3 distributed similarly among the tfc fo membranes besides the 3d eem fig 6d h showed that the contents of proteins peak a sun et al 2016 and humic acids peak b and c wu et al 2016 in the fouling layers were consistent with the severity of membrane fouling namely fo p possessed the highest contents of proteins and humic acids while fo g2 had the lowest ones therefore it can be inferred that the macromolecular organic substances such as proteins polysaccharides and humic acids were prone to be absorbed on the amine insufficient membrane surfaces resulting in severe membrane fouling as proposed by mi and elimelech the intermolecular bridging between foulants exacerbated by multivalent metal ions ca2 mg2 and fe3 etc was the primary cause of severe membrane fouling mi and elimelech 2008 as shown in fig 6c the relative contents of metal ions in the fouling layers varied significantly from that in the influent and the multivalent metal ions were absorbed in the fouling layers with priority consistently membrane suffered from severe fouling i e fo p has significantly higher levels of multivalent metal ions in the fouling layer than that with mild fouling i e fo g2 this indicated the surface fixed protonated amine groups could also effectively repel the multivalent metal ions by electrostatic repulsion during the concentration process thus alleviating the intermolecular bridging between foulants on membrane surface wang et al 2016 although the macromolecular organics in dw were negatively charged its electrostatic attraction with the protonated amine groups was not sufficient for it to be absorb on the grafted membrane surfaces because the grafted membranes with relatively low amine densities were still negatively charged under experimental conditions fig 1b ph 6 9 overall the perfect balance between the electrostatic repulsion to positively charged micromoleculer ions metal ions and nh4 n and the electrostatic attraction to negatively charged macromolecular organic foulants as well as the hydrophilic nature of amine groups facilitated the enhancement of the grafted membranes especially the fo g2 in nh4 n selectivity and antifouling capacity 3 5 effect of membrane fouling on nh4 n selectivity similar to the concentration of nh4cl solutions the nh4 n rejection rates of dw were closely related to the proportions of amine groups on the membrane surface fig 5a however as shown in fig 7 a the rejection rates of nh4 n in dw 44 6 mg l nh4 n table s1 by the same membrane were obviously lower than that in nh4cl solution with 50 mg l nh4 n the decreased nh4 n rejection rates of dw implied that the transmembrane diffusion of nh4 n increased with the formation of fouling layers on membrane surfaces it should be noted that even the fouling layer provided an additional resistance on membrane surface xie et al 2013 the fouling layer equivalently exerted resistance to the diffusion of water and nh4 n towards membrane surface as mentioned above the transmembrane diffusion of nh4 n was driven by the concentration difference of nh4 n across the membrane thus the decreased nh4 n rejection rate of dw manifested that the presence of membrane fouling facilitated the enrichment of nh4 n on the pa layer surface the nh4 n rejection rates based on the feed r f and draw r d solutions the calculation equations were listed in si were also calculated and the results showed that the r d exceeded the r f for all the tfc fo membranes fig 7b theoretically r d should equal r f according to the material balance of nh4 n if all the nh4 n was dissolved in the solution and the microbial metabolism was negligible due to the short concentration time during the concentration of dw therefore the higher value of r d than r f implied some nh4 n was absorbed on the membrane surface nevertheless the differences in nh4 n rejection rate δr as shown in fig 7 a b suggested that the membrane surface with more amine groups i e fo g2 could effectively alleviate the reduction in nh4 n rejection rate deteriorated by membrane fouling besides the concentrations of nh4 n in the fouling layers were also measured and shown in fig 7c since the total amount of nh4 n in the fouling layers were closely related to the severity of membrane fouling the nh4 n toc was introduced to roughly estimate the concentration of nh4 n in the fouling layers consistently the fo p possessed the highest concentration of nh4 n in the fouling layer and the fo g2 exhibited the lowest one demonstrating the transmembrane diffusion of nh4 n was closely related to the severity of fouling layer the effect of membrane fouling on nh4 n rejection capacity of tfc fo membranes was schematically illustrated in fig 7d the formation of fouling layer on membrane surface would inevitably bring about the cake enhanced concentration polarization of nh4 n and facilitate the enrichment of nh4 n on membrane surfaces contributing to the increasing passage of nh4 n through the membrane she et al 2012 meanwhile the grafted membranes would suffer a reduced resistance to nh4 n upon the coverage of foulants on the surface of the grafted pamam dendrimers nevertheless benefiting from the sufficient amount of amine groups on the grafted membrane surface i e fo g2 the membrane fouling was alleviated and the fouling layer was less compact due to the reduced intermolecular bridging between foulants by multivalent metal ions consequently less nh4 n was trapped in the sparse foulant layer on fo g2 and a higher nh4 n rejection rate was maintained 4 conclusions the study verified for the first time that the grafting of pamam dendrimer on membrane surface could simultaneously enhance the nh4 n selectivity and antifouling capacity of the grafted membrane during the concentration of dw by grafting the pamam dendrimer on a pristine membrane the grafted tfc fo membranes possessed moderately enhanced near neutral surface potential and outstanding hydrophilicity the selectivity of the grafted membranes towards nh4 n were significantly enhanced more than 93 rejection rates for nh4 n due to the presence of diffusion resistance and electrostatic repulsion exerted from the surface fixed nh3 to the external nh4 n besides during the concentration of dw the grafted membranes exhibited enhanced antifouling capacity partly for the improved surface hydrophilicity which inhibited the enrichment of foulants on membrane surface and partly for the appreciable surface potential which alleviated the intermolecular bridging between foulants on membrane surface by the multivalent metal ions in addition the formation of fouling layer on membrane surface facilitated the transmembrane diffusion of nh4 n by the cake enhanced polarization effect generally the performance of nh4 n rejection and antifouling capacity of fo membranes was improved by the higher amine proportion on membrane surface i e fo g2 the grafting of pamam dendrimer on membrane surface opens up a frontier for preparation of simultaneously ammonia selective and antifouling

18999,developing a forward osmosis fo membrane with superior ammonia selectivity and robust antifouling performance is important for treating domestic wastewater dw but challenging due to the similar polarities and hydraulic radii of nh4 and water molecules herein we investigated the feasibility of using polyamidoamine pamam dendrimer to simultaneously enhance the ammonia rejection rate and antifouling capacity of the thin film composite tfc fo membrane pamam dendrimer with abundant easily protonated terminal amine groups was grafted on tfc fo membrane surface via covalent bonds which inspired the tfc fo membrane surface with appreciable zeta potential isoelectric point ph 5 5 and outstanding hydrophilicity water contact angle 39 83 0 57 benefiting from the electrostatic repulsion between the protonated amine layer and nh4 n as well as the concentration induced diffusion resistance the introduction of pamam dendrimer endowed the grafted membrane with a superior nh4 n rejection rate of 98 23 and a significantly reduced the reverse solute flux when using nh4cl solutions as feed solution meanwhile the perfect balance between the electrostatic repulsion to positively charged micromoleculer ions metal ions and nh4 n and the electrostatic attraction to negatively charged macromolecular organic foulants together with the hydrophilic nature of amine groups facilitated the enhancement of the grafted membranes in antifouling capacity and hence the nh4 n selectivity rejection rate of 91 81 during the concentration of raw dw the overall approach of this work opens up a frontier for preparation of ammonia selective and antifouling tfc fo membrane graphical abstract image 1 keywords forward osmosis ammonia selectivity antifouling capacity polyamidoamine dendrimer domestic wastewater concentration 1 introduction forward osmosis fo membrane technology which is driven by an osmotic gradient instead of hydraulic pressure to spontaneously transport water through a membrane has attracted widespread attention in the fields of food processing seawater desalination and wastewater treatment fan et al 2018 kim et al 2018 luo et al 2017a qin et al 2018 rastogi 2016 recent studies proposed fo as an ecological pretreatment process which can simultaneously extract water from wastewater for water reclamation and retain the organics and nutrients in the concentrate for subsequent resources recovery agrawal et al 2018 chekli et al 2016 jun et al 2017 limited by the absence of economically regenerable draw solution fo is usually performed as a pretreatment for reverse osmosis ro to directly confront wastewater and thereby provides the downstream ro with diluted and high quality draw solution to accomplish water reclamation lu et al 2018 luo et al 2016 which significantly reduces the fouling propensity of ro and thus yields much higher overall energy efficiency than the conventional ro process kook et al 2018 notably fo based system shows great potential for addressing the issues of water scarcity and resource shortage by recovering the embedded water energy and nutrient resources from domestic wastewater dw in the form of anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor gu et al 2015 luo et al 2017b qiu et al 2015 wang et al 2017 zirehpour et al 2017 generally fo membranes exhibit excellent rejection capacity for most organics and phosphate po4 3 p owing to the size sieving effect lau et al 2015 however the inferior selectivity of fo membranes for ammonia nitrogen nh4 n tremendously restrict their practical application in dw treatment rejection rate of approximately 60 ansari et al 2017 hou et al 2017 the extremely similar properties between the nh4 and water molecules such as their polarity and hydraulic radius prevent fo membranes from easily discriminating the two molecules arena et al 2014b when treating ammonia containing wastewater with fo hybrid systems continuous transmembrane diffusion of nh4 would contaminate the draw solution and adversely affect the produced water quality of the coupled draw solution re concentration system since low pressure ro and nanofiltration membranes also do not exhibit outstanding nh4 rejection chekli et al 2016 d haese et al 2013 luo et al 2016 zhao et al 2012 furthermore the loss of nh4 n from the concentrate is detrimental to the subsequent recovery of nutrients from ammonia containing wastewater especially dw guadie et al 2014 ronteltap et al 2010 therefore an ammonia selective fo membrane is desirable for osmotic membrane based applications however to the best of our knowledge studies on the preparation or modification of fo membranes with improved nh4 n selectivity are rare in current literature in an osmotic membrane process the transmembrane diffusion of nh4 is driven by its concentration gradient across a membrane arena et al 2014b theoretically the selectivity of a fo membrane for nh4 n can be enhanced by repelling nh4 from the membrane surface which reduces the osmotic driving force for nh4 diffusion into the draw solution lu et al 2014 therefore based on the positively charged nature of nh4 a fo membrane covered with positive charges should have improved selectivity for nh4 due to electrostatic repulsion besides the diffusion resistance of nh4 toward the membrane surface can theoretically be increased by grafting an easily protonatable amine layer on the membrane surface because the surface fixed protonated amine group r nh3 improves the nh4 concentration on the membrane surface to some extent in addition the highly hydrophilic property of the exposed polar amine groups will improve the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface which is conducive to alleviating membrane fouling li et al 2017 liu et al 2017 therefore an easily protonatable amine layer might endow the fo membrane surface with positive charges fixed ammonia and a superior hydrophilicity thus enhancing the nh4 selectivity and antifouling capacity of fo membrane polyamidoamine pamam dendrimer with a radially symmetrical and hyperbranched structure possesses much higher amine group densities on its globular and tree like surface than other macromolecules bahadir and sezginturk 2016 li et al 2017 the number of terminal amine groups in the pamam dendrimer exponentially increases with the generation 2n 2 n is the dendrimer generation mansourpanah and jafari 2015 pamam dendrimer has fulfilled applications in areas such as drug delivery kesharwani et al 2014 nanoparticle synthesis zhao et al 2013 and catalysis wang and astruc 2013 the abundant amine groups on the pamam dendrimer surface are perfect active sites for chemical attachment to the surface of thin film composite tfc membrane via the formation of amide bonds with the unreacted acyl chloride groups on the polyamide pa layer zhu et al 2015 besides compared with aromatic amide dendrimer the aliphatic pamam dendrimer exhibits a higher pka value allowing the terminal amines to be easily protonated and creating more charges on the membrane surface de jubera et al 2012 li et al 2017 saenz de jubera et al 2013 these material and structure properties make the pamam dendrimer a perfect candidate for modification of fo membrane to achieve both superior nh4 selectivity and robust antifouling capacity in this work we investigated the feasibility of different generations g0 3 of pamam dendrimers to improve the nh4 n selectivity and antifouling capacity of fo membrane by a surface grafting method the performances of the tfc fo membranes before and after grafting with pamam dendrimers were investigated in terms of their osmotic permeability selectivity for nh4 n at various concentrations and the concentration efficiency of nh4 n from dw the membrane surface morphology surface charge and membrane fouling during dw concentration were also characterized the results in this study demonstrate the pamam dendrimer has great potential for developing fo membranes with superior ammonia selectivity and robust antifouling capacities this work may provide insights for the further development of membranes with enhanced nh4 n rejection properties 2 materials and methods

supplementary information si n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp 99 m phenylenediamine mpd 99 5 trimesoyl chloride tmc 98 and n hexane 99 were all ordered from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa polyethylene glycol peg mn 600 sodium chloride nacl 99 5 and other conventional reagents of analytical purity were purchased from aladdin shanghai china all chemicals were used as received without further purification sulfonated polyethersulfone spes with a sulfonation degree of 1 was provided by yanjin technology co ltd tianjin china and was dried at 80 c for 2 days before use ultrapure water 18 25 mω cm was used for all experiments 2 2 fabrication of the tfc fo membranes the pamam dendrimer grafted tfc fo membranes were prepared in three steps i e phase separation interfacial polymerization and grafting first the spes support layer was fabricated via a non solvent induced phase separation method the spes 14 wt and peg 10 wt were dissolved in nmp and the dope solution was stirred by a magnetic stirrer at 80 c for 24 h the prepared casting solution was then degassed at 25 c for at least 24 h afterwards the casting solution was cast onto clean glass plates using an automatic casting machine with a knife height of 100 μm the casted film was immediately and smoothly immersed into a 25 c ultrapure water coagulant bath the resultant spes substrates were kept in the ultrapure water bath for 3 h to remove the residual solvent then rinsed thoroughly and stored in ultrapure water for future use next the pa active layer was fabricated on the top surface of the spes substrate by interfacial polymerization the substrate was first immersed in a 2 wt aqueous mpd solution 40 ml for 2 min after removal of excess water droplets the upper surface of the saturated substrate was brought into contact with 0 1 wt tmc in n hexane 40 ml for 1 min after the excess solution was poured out the resultant membrane was rinsed with fresh n hexane solution and then dried in air for 0 5 min finally a 1 wt aqueous solution 40 ml with different generations of pamam dendrimers was poured onto the nascent pa layer for 15 min to accomplish the chemical grafting by forming amide bond between the unreacted acyl chloride groups on the pa layer and amine groups from pamam dendrimer besides the pristine tfc fo membrane was prepared by replacing the aqueous solution with ultrapure water then the prepared membranes were thoroughly washed and stored in ultrapure water at 4 c for further characterizations in this study the pristine tfc fo membrane and pamam dendrimer grafted tfc fo membranes with generations 0 1 2 and 3 were abbreviated fo p fo g0 fo g1 fo g2 and fo g3 respectively 2 3 osmotic performance evaluation of the tfc fo membranes the intrinsic pure water permeability a and salt permeability coefficient b of the tfc fo membranes were determined using a cross flow ro system and the experimental procedures were detailedly described in si fo experiments were conducted on a lab scale cross flow fo experimental setup as shown in fig s2 the experimental procedures were illustrated in si all the membranes were tested under fo mode with the active layer facing the feed solution to evaluate the water flux and reverse salt flux of the tfc fo membranes a 1 mol l nacl aqueous solution and ultrapure water with an initial volumes of 1 l were used as draw and feed solutions respectively the concentration of the nacl draw solution was maintained using a conductivity controller equipped with a 5 mol l nacl solution each test was conducted until the water reduction in the feed solution reached 50 during the fo operation after the pure water test the feed solution was changed to the nh4cl solutions with a gradient concentration of nh4 n 50 100 200 and 500 mg l to evaluate the nh4 n selectivity of the tfc fo membranes each test was complete when the water reduction in the feed solution reached 50 the feed solution was then replaced with raw dw to evaluate the concentration efficiency the raw dw was obtained from the septic tank effluent in the adjacent residential area and the characteristic of the wastewater is illustrated in table s1 in order to ensure the stable composition of each influent one batch of dw was precipitated and the supernatant was stored in the refrigerating chamber for using during the concentration test the water reduction in the feed water was set at 50 the water flux j w and the reverse salt flux j s pure water test only were then calculated and these calculations are described in the si at least 3 replicates were performed for each membrane type to obtain a data set with less than a 5 standard deviation 2 4 analytical methods water samples were collected from the feed and draw solutions before and after the concentration tests of nh4cl solutions and dw after the concentration of dw half fouled membrane was cut and soaked in a 15 ml of 0 01 mol l sodium hydroxide solution under sonication for 30 min to extract the foulants off membrane surface the extracts were then neutralized with 2 mol l hydrochloric acid and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane for further characterization the nh4 n in all samples and the total nitrogen tn and po4 3 p in dw samples were measured according to the standard methods clesceri et al 2012 total organic carbon toc in the dw samples and foulant extracts were analyzed by a toc analyzer toc 5000a shimadzu japan inorganic ions in the foulant extracts were analyzed by an inductively coupled plasma icp optima 5300 cv perkin elmer inc the components of foulant extracts were characterized by a 3d excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy fp 6500 jasco japan besides the molecular weight mw distributions of organic foulant in the extracts were determined using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system with an ultraviolet detector which was based on the method of chen et al 2017 and descripted in si 2 5 characterization of tfc fo membranes all the membrane samples were dried in a vacuum drying oven at 30 c for 24 h prior to the surface characterizations field emission scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss sigma 500 germany was used to visually analyze the membrane surface morphologies of different tfc fo membranes before and after membrane fouling all membrane samples were coated with gold using a precision etching coating apparatus gatan 682 usa before the sem observation the surface roughness of all the tfc fo membranes was analyzed by atomic force microscopy afm bruker dimension fastscan usa under tapping mode at room temperature the root mean square roughness rms was calculated from the height profile of each images in the range of 2 μm 2 μm attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir thermo fisher scientific nicolet is50 usa was performed to identify the major functional groups of the fouling layer on tfc fo membranes additionally the chemical compositions of the pristine and pamam dendrimer grafted tfc fo membranes were systematically analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo fisher scientific escalab 250xi usa the static contact angles of the tfc fo membranes were measured with a contact angle goniometer dataphysics oca germany using sessile drop method at 25 c a 2 μl droplet of ultrapure water was dropped on the tfc fo membrane surface and the contact angles were measured after 10 s at least 5 measurements were repeated on different locations of a dried membrane the membrane surface zeta potential was measured by a surpass streaming potential analyzer eka anton paar gmbh austria automatic titration was used to measure the ζ potential and isoelectric point of tfc fo membranes at various ph values the surface zeta potential was calculated from the measured streaming potential according to the helmholtz smoluchowski equation childress and elimelech 1996 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface characterization of the tfc fo membranes the surface chemical structures of the tfc fo membranes were extensively characterized by xps the xps data fig 1 a showed that the grafted membranes possessed higher n contents than the pristine membrane which confirmed the successful grafting of the pamam dendrimer on the pa layer because the pamam dendrimers have a much higher n content than the pa layer table s2 in addition the ratio of the grafted pamam dendrimer on the pa layer was calculated by comparing the discrepancy between the n c values table s1 of the tfc fo membrane surface and the corresponding pamam dendrimer the amine proportion on the grafted membrane surface could then be estimated as shown in table s3 the proportion of amine groups on pa layer surfaces increased 2 50 for fo g0 2 70 for fo g1 and then decreased 2 93 for fo g3 as the pamam dendrimer generation increased and a maximum proportion of 3 43 was achieved in fo g2 the discrepancy among the proportion of amine groups on the tfc fo membranes grafted with different generations of the pamam dendrimer can be attributed to the amine group numbers and molecular volumes of the pamam dendrimers the number of terminal amine groups of the pamam dendrimer doubles as the generation moving from one to the next table s2 and fig s1 the membrane surfaces grafted with a higher generation of the pamam dendrimer should theoretically possess higher amine proportions however during the grafting process the unreacted acyl chloride groups on the nascent pa layer surface would not only form amide bonds with the terminal amine groups of the pamam dendrimer but also be highly susceptible to hydrolysis into carboxyl groups and eventually became amine inactive besides the molecular volume measured by dynamic laser scattering and shown in fig s3 of the higher generation pamam dendrimers especially g3 significantly enhanced as the generation increases bahadir and sezginturk 2016 tomalia 2005 the rapid growth in the molecular volume results in a greater diffusion resistance of high generation pamam dendrimers in aqueous solution which consequently becomes less competitive in bonding with acyl chloride groups therefore more terminal amine groups and a moderate molecular volume contributed to the highest grafting coverage and amine proportion on the fo g2 surface the zeta potential curves of the tfc fo membranes were obtained as a function of the ph fig 1b fo p was negatively charged over the whole ph range 3 10 due to the presence of abundant deprotonated carboxyl groups coo on the pa layer surface after grafting the pamam dendrimer the zeta potential values of the grafted membranes were significantly enhanced which indicated the amine groups of the pamam dendrimer could effectively counteract the negative charges of the carboxyl groups on the pa layer as a result the grafted membranes exhibited typical amphiprotic surfaces and the isoelectric point ph was found fo g2 possessed a higher potential value and isoelectric point ph 5 5 than the other grafted membranes ph 4 3 4 8 and 5 1 for fo g0 fo g1 and fo g3 respectively over the entire ph range in addition the introduction of amine groups significantly improved the membrane surface wettability after grafting the pamam dendrimer the contact angles fig 1c of the grafted membranes 46 95 0 39 43 87 0 73 39 83 0 57 and 43 58 0 46 for fo g0 fo g1 fo g2 and fo g3 respectively decreased compared with that of the fo p 51 32 0 89 generally a higher proportion of amine groups facilitated a lower contact angle due to the hydrophilic property of the exposed polar amine groups xu et al 2015 besides sem and afm were utilized to characterize the surface morphologies of the tfc fo membranes as shown in fig 2 the sem images showed that all the tfc fo membranes had a typical ridge and valley morphology the protrusions on the membrane surfaces gradually became shorter and thicker as the pamam dendrimer generation increased this result indicated the total volume of pamam dendrimer that grafted both on the panels and the protrusions of pa layers increased with the pamam dendrimer generations in terms of roughness the pamam dendrimer grafted on the surface of the protrusions would contribute to an increase in surface roughness while that grafted on the panel would reduce the overall roughness as revealed by the afm images fig 2 the pamam dendrimer grafted membranes the rms values of the fo g0 fo g1 fo g2 and fo g3 were 30 8 0 8 28 7 0 5 27 8 0 3 and 26 5 0 3 nm respectively possessed a higher surface roughness than the fo p 25 7 0 7 nm indicating that the grafting of pamam dendrimer on the surface of the protrusion exceeded that on the panel 3 2 osmotic performances of the tfc fo membranes prior to the osmotic evaluation the transport properties of each membrane were tested using a cross flow ro system and calculated in table s4 the fo p possessed the higher permeability and the lower nacl rejection than the grafted membranes this indicated that the diffusion resistance of water through the grafted membranes increased after the grafting of pamam dendrimers the fo performances of the tfc fo membranes were shown in fig 3 a the water flux of the fo p exceeded that of the grafted membranes while its reverse nacl flux was slightly inferior to the grafted membranes the tiny differences in both the water flux and reverse solute flux for all the tfc fo membranes indicated the channel structure of the pa active layer barely changed after grafting the pamam dendrimer surprisingly even though the fo p possessed a lower rejection rate to nacl under pressurized condition table s4 it exhibited lower reverse passage of nacl during fo test the selectivity of each membrane for nacl fig 3a was evaluated by comparing the specific salt flux j s j w which is an intrinsic value applied to measure the draw solute loss per unit of water passage phillip et al 2010 fo p still had a lower j s j w value than that of the grafted membranes indicating the membrane selectivity for nacl under fo system decreased after amine groups were introduced on the pa layer this phenomenon could hypothetically be attributed to the donnan exclusion and dielectric effects since the surface charge exerts a significant influence on membrane separation processe arena et al 2014a mi et al 2015 as illustrated in fig 3b during an osmotic transportation process with nacl as the draw solute cl had more difficulty transferring through the pa active layer since the hydrated ionic radius of cl is larger than that of na hu et al 2017 kiriukhin and collins 2002 after the pamam dendrimer was grafted on the pa layer the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged cl and the positively charged protonated amine groups nh3 facilitated the diffusion of cl through the pa layer enlargement in fig 3b however the relatively weak attractive interaction worked only for those cl in the pa channels near the surface in this case the reverse diffusion of cl into the feed solution was slightly promoted meanwhile na would equivalently transfer with cl to maintain the electroneutrality of the draw solution mi et al 2015 xu et al 2017 therefore the selectivity of the pamam dendrimer grafted membranes for nacl slightly decreased 3 3 nh4 n selectivity of the tfc fo membranes the selectivities of the pristine and pamam dendrimer grafted tfc fo membranes for nh4cl solution at different concentrations 50 100 200 and 500 mg l nh4 n were evaluated to eliminate the variations of the membrane surface potential when using nh4cl solutions with different concentrations all solutions were adjusted to the same ph value same to the ph of dw in general as shown in fig 4 a fo p showed a poor rejection ability for nh4 n at both low 70 36 and 75 2 at 50 and 100 mg l respectively and high 83 99 and 88 64 at 200 and 500 mg l respectively concentrations while the grafted membranes exhibited remarkable enhancements in selectivity for nh4 n rejection rates of more than 93 for all concentrations as previously mentioned fo membranes typically have inferior retention for nh4 n because of the very similar polarity and radius of water molecule and nh4 n after grafting the pamam dendrimer on the membrane surface even though the grafted membrane surfaces were still negatively charged the surface fixed protonated amines nh3 were prone to show strong electrostatic repulsion toward nh4 and create diffusion resistance to nh4 by increasing the concentration of fixed nh4 on the membrane surface fig 4b in this case most nh4 was excluded from the pa active layer and the driving force for nh4 n to diffuse through the membrane active layer was significantly reduced in addition the negligible changes in the water flux fig 4a among the tfc fo membranes further indicated that the improved nh4 n selectivity of the grafted membrane was not attributed to a structural transformation of the pa active layer but the presence of protonated amine groups on the membrane surface the concentrations of na in all the concentrated nh4cl solutions were also measured table s5 to evaluate the reverse solute flux of each tfc fo membrane when concentrating nh4cl solution interestingly the concentrations of na in the concentrate of fo p which exhibited a lower j s j w value than the grafted membranes with ultrapure water as feed solution exceeded those concentrates of the grafted membranes as illustrated in fig 4c for a membrane with a low nh4 n selectivity nh4 n can easily diffuse from the feed solution into the draw solution while its paired anion cl tends to stay in the feed solution under this circumstance the reverse diffusion of na from the draw solution into the feed solution is accelerated like cation exchange to maintain the electroneutrality of the feed solution lu et al 2014 mi et al 2015 in conclusion introducing the pamam dendrimer can significantly enhance the selectivity of tfc fo membranes for nh4 n and effectively alleviate the reverse diffusion of nacl when concentrating ammonia containing water 3 4 dw concentration performance and membrane fouling raw dw was applied as feed solution to evaluate the resource retention capacity and membrane fouling of the pristine and pamam dendrimer grafted tfc fo membranes the rejection rates of toc po4 3 p tn and nh4 n from dw were measured and the results were shown in fig 5 a all the tfc fo membranes exhibited nearly complete retention for toc and po4 3 p while the rejection rates of tn and nh4 n varied greatly with the tfc fo membranes the nh4 n rejection rate of the pristine membrane was less than 60 while the grafted membranes exhibited significant enhancements in the nh4 n rejection capacity all the rejection rates exceeded 83 and fo g2 had a remarkable rejection rate of 91 81 benefiting from the enhanced retentions for nh4 n by the grafted membranes the rejection rates of the grafted membranes to tn were also significantly increased the normalized water flux of each tfc fo membrane during dw concentration was also calculated as a function of the accumulative permeate volume and plotted in fig 5b generally the normalized water flux of all membranes decreased during the concentration process indicating the membrane surface suffered from fouling since the osmotic pressure of the draw solution was remained constant specifically the normalized water flux of fo p decreased rapidly in the initial concentration process while the grafted membranes especially fo g2 exhibited a relative stable normalized water flux during the entire concentration process suggesting fo p was very susceptible to membrane fouling and the presence of hydrophilic amines significantly alleviated membrane fouling besides the surficial and cross sectional sem images of the fouled membranes were obtained to visualize the fouling of each membrane fig 5c g all the membrane surfaces were contaminated and covered with a fouling layer the cross sectional structure of the fouling layers manifested the variations in the severity of membrane fouling as expected fo p possessed the thickest fouling layer and fo g2 has the thinnest one for the grafted membranes the severity of membrane fouling were consistent with the distribution of the amine proportions on the membrane surfaces namely a higher amine proportion on the membrane surface contributed to a milder membrane fouling to further validate the effect of the surface fixed amine groups on membrane fouling the properties of the fouling layers on the membrane surfaces were systematically analyzed the ft ir spectra of the fouled tfc fo membranes fig 6 a revealed that the organic components of the fouling layer were mainly consisted of the humic acids broad absorptions from 3700 to 3000 cm 1 proteins peaks at 1639 and 1541 cm 1 and polysaccharides peaks at 1018 cm 1 lu et al 2013 sun et al 2016 tang et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 which were illustrated in si in detail the molecular weight of the organic foulants in the fouling layers were measured by hplc uv fig 6b and the results suggested that fo p and fo g0 possessed larger proportions of foulants with higher molecular weight 2173 da peak 1 while the foulants with lower molecular weight 255 da peak 2 17 da peak 3 distributed similarly among the tfc fo membranes besides the 3d eem fig 6d h showed that the contents of proteins peak a sun et al 2016 and humic acids peak b and c wu et al 2016 in the fouling layers were consistent with the severity of membrane fouling namely fo p possessed the highest contents of proteins and humic acids while fo g2 had the lowest ones therefore it can be inferred that the macromolecular organic substances such as proteins polysaccharides and humic acids were prone to be absorbed on the amine insufficient membrane surfaces resulting in severe membrane fouling as proposed by mi and elimelech the intermolecular bridging between foulants exacerbated by multivalent metal ions ca2 mg2 and fe3 etc was the primary cause of severe membrane fouling mi and elimelech 2008 as shown in fig 6c the relative contents of metal ions in the fouling layers varied significantly from that in the influent and the multivalent metal ions were absorbed in the fouling layers with priority consistently membrane suffered from severe fouling i e fo p has significantly higher levels of multivalent metal ions in the fouling layer than that with mild fouling i e fo g2 this indicated the surface fixed protonated amine groups could also effectively repel the multivalent metal ions by electrostatic repulsion during the concentration process thus alleviating the intermolecular bridging between foulants on membrane surface wang et al 2016 although the macromolecular organics in dw were negatively charged its electrostatic attraction with the protonated amine groups was not sufficient for it to be absorb on the grafted membrane surfaces because the grafted membranes with relatively low amine densities were still negatively charged under experimental conditions fig 1b ph 6 9 overall the perfect balance between the electrostatic repulsion to positively charged micromoleculer ions metal ions and nh4 n and the electrostatic attraction to negatively charged macromolecular organic foulants as well as the hydrophilic nature of amine groups facilitated the enhancement of the grafted membranes especially the fo g2 in nh4 n selectivity and antifouling capacity 3 5 effect of membrane fouling on nh4 n selectivity similar to the concentration of nh4cl solutions the nh4 n rejection rates of dw were closely related to the proportions of amine groups on the membrane surface fig 5a however as shown in fig 7 a the rejection rates of nh4 n in dw 44 6 mg l nh4 n table s1 by the same membrane were obviously lower than that in nh4cl solution with 50 mg l nh4 n the decreased nh4 n rejection rates of dw implied that the transmembrane diffusion of nh4 n increased with the formation of fouling layers on membrane surfaces it should be noted that even the fouling layer provided an additional resistance on membrane surface xie et al 2013 the fouling layer equivalently exerted resistance to the diffusion of water and nh4 n towards membrane surface as mentioned above the transmembrane diffusion of nh4 n was driven by the concentration difference of nh4 n across the membrane thus the decreased nh4 n rejection rate of dw manifested that the presence of membrane fouling facilitated the enrichment of nh4 n on the pa layer surface the nh4 n rejection rates based on the feed r f and draw r d solutions the calculation equations were listed in si were also calculated and the results showed that the r d exceeded the r f for all the tfc fo membranes fig 7b theoretically r d should equal r f according to the material balance of nh4 n if all the nh4 n was dissolved in the solution and the microbial metabolism was negligible due to the short concentration time during the concentration of dw therefore the higher value of r d than r f implied some nh4 n was absorbed on the membrane surface nevertheless the differences in nh4 n rejection rate δr as shown in fig 7 a b suggested that the membrane surface with more amine groups i e fo g2 could effectively alleviate the reduction in nh4 n rejection rate deteriorated by membrane fouling besides the concentrations of nh4 n in the fouling layers were also measured and shown in fig 7c since the total amount of nh4 n in the fouling layers were closely related to the severity of membrane fouling the nh4 n toc was introduced to roughly estimate the concentration of nh4 n in the fouling layers consistently the fo p possessed the highest concentration of nh4 n in the fouling layer and the fo g2 exhibited the lowest one demonstrating the transmembrane diffusion of nh4 n was closely related to the severity of fouling layer the effect of membrane fouling on nh4 n rejection capacity of tfc fo membranes was schematically illustrated in fig 7d the formation of fouling layer on membrane surface would inevitably bring about the cake enhanced concentration polarization of nh4 n and facilitate the enrichment of nh4 n on membrane surfaces contributing to the increasing passage of nh4 n through the membrane she et al 2012 meanwhile the grafted membranes would suffer a reduced resistance to nh4 n upon the coverage of foulants on the surface of the grafted pamam dendrimers nevertheless benefiting from the sufficient amount of amine groups on the grafted membrane surface i e fo g2 the membrane fouling was alleviated and the fouling layer was less compact due to the reduced intermolecular bridging between foulants by multivalent metal ions consequently less nh4 n was trapped in the sparse foulant layer on fo g2 and a higher nh4 n rejection rate was maintained 4 conclusions the study verified for the first time that the grafting of pamam dendrimer on membrane surface could simultaneously enhance the nh4 n selectivity and antifouling capacity of the grafted membrane during the concentration of dw by grafting the pamam dendrimer on a pristine membrane the grafted tfc fo membranes possessed moderately enhanced near neutral surface potential and outstanding hydrophilicity the selectivity of the grafted membranes towards nh4 n were significantly enhanced more than 93 rejection rates for nh4 n due to the presence of diffusion resistance and electrostatic repulsion exerted from the surface fixed nh3 to the external nh4 n besides during the concentration of dw the grafted membranes exhibited enhanced antifouling capacity partly for the improved surface hydrophilicity which inhibited the enrichment of foulants on membrane surface and partly for the appreciable surface potential which alleviated the intermolecular bridging between foulants on membrane surface by the multivalent metal ions in addition the formation of fouling layer on membrane surface facilitated the transmembrane diffusion of nh4 n by the cake enhanced polarization effect generally the performance of nh4 n rejection and antifouling capacity of fo membranes was improved by the higher amine proportion on membrane surface i e fo g2 the grafting of pamam dendrimer on membrane surface opens up a frontier for preparation of simultaneously ammonia selective and antifouling
