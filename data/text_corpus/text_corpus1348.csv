6740,the budyko framework used for water balance studies is an effective tool that estimates the actual evapotranspiration balancing between energy and water availabilities in this study we investigate eight budyko framework equations as well as the gr1a and gr2m models on the nile tributary blue nile catchment on the annual time scale all investigated models and equations show poor results moreover the resulting errors on the monthly scale show a clear pattern of seasonality and autocorrelation to overcome such deficiencies we propose a time series sarima model to fit the error term of the best performing budyko equation building on the time series capabilities we extend the budyko framework to allow the incorporation of values of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration from previous months the selected performance criteria are the nash sutcliffe and kling gupta efficiencies as well as the coefficient of determination and bias the novel hybrid sarimax budyko model exhibits high performance not only on the blue nile but also on other five major rivers worldwide the proposed model outperforms the previously published budyko equations as well as the gr1m and gr2a as benchmark models in almost all performance criteria and especially on the annual time scale keywords water balance budyko framework time series analysis sarimax gr2m nile river 1 introduction one of the fundamental objectives of hydrology is estimating the water balance at the catchment scale the water balance concept provides a framework that aims to increase our knowledge of the catchment characteristics wang and zhou 2016 within the water balance framework efforts have long focused on defining a relationship between the precipitation p as the supply source of the system on one hand and the actual evapotranspiration et and runoff r on the other hand as the outputs demand of the system as described in eq 1 1 p e t r δ s where δs is the change in catchment water storage that may take positive or negative values du et al 2016 the change in water storage at the basin scale can be neglected over long term timescales such as annual or longer wu et al 2017 in the same line many researches were undertaken to estimate the actual evapotranspiration following the budyko framework budyko 1948 arora 2002 the budyko framework bf is an effective tool for assessing linkages and feedbacks on water between climate forcing and land surface characteristics xu et al 2013 by estimating the actual evapotranspiration et as a function of the aridity index ϕ the aridity index ϕ is defined as the ratio between the potential evapotranspiration pet and the precipitation p the potential evapotranspiration pet appeared for the first time by thornthwaite 1948 who defined pet as the amount of water which would transpire and evaporate if it were available lhommel 1997 the potential evapotranspiration pet is not only the upper limit of actual evapotranspiration but also the basis to evaluate it gao et al 2006 the budyko framework is characterized by two special features the first is its simplicity and the second is its long history of development over a century of hydrological research greve et al 2016 within the first generation of developments in the budyko framework four equations were proposed by schreiber 1904 ol dekop 1911 budyko 1948 turc 1954 and pike 1964 refer to the first four equations in table 1 these four equations are empirical equations without calibration parameters and are functions of ϕ to estimate the long term water balance at the catchment scale despite the long history of these four equations they have two weaknesses the first is that they don t take into consideration the catchment characteristics and climate dependent variables such as climatic region vegetation forest cover soil properties or topography choudhury 1999 du et al 2016 fu 1981 mezentsev 1955 yang et al 2007 2008 zhang et al 2001 the second weakness is that this framework can be applied only on a long term annual or longer timescale steady state conditions du et al 2016 it should also be noted that this hypothesis concerns mainly natural runoff values without anthropogenic inter basin flux or at least naturalized runoff values i e where effects of reservoirs have been eliminated and water abstractions have been added to overcome these weaknesses researchers developed the second generation of budyko equations to overcome the first weak point researchers suggested adding one calibration parameter choudhury 1999 fu 1981 mezentsev 1955 yang et al 2007 2008 zhang et al 2001 refer to the 5th to 7th equations in table 1 this adjustable parameter reflects the catchment characteristics and can be calibrated using observed data choudhury 1999 with regard to the second weak point zhang et al 2008 investigated the use of one of the budyko equations over variable time scales annual monthly and daily timescales in australia they concluded that the annual model is the only one which performed well and they recognized that in order to apply the equation on a shorter timescale one needs more complex models recently du et al 2016 introduced an equation improving fu 1981 equation with two adjustable parameters ω and λ to overcome the two weak points as ω reflects the catchment characteristics and λ extends the steady state condition so that the equation can be used on a monthly time scale refer to the last equation in table 1 the unsteady state condition can in fact be due to unclosed catchment to a catchment with intense human activities and irrigation to significant water storage changes or to using sub annual timescales monthly weekly or even daily du et al 2016 in this study the monthly gr2m model mouelhi et al 2006a and the annual gr1a model mouelhi et al 2006b are also used as benchmark models to simulate the runoff gr2m has two calibrated parameters the first parameter x1 represents the maximum soil moisture storage the second parameter x5 can be interpreted to represent the water exchange term with outside neighbor s basins huard and mailhot 2008 or the catchment area properties mouelhi et al 2006a the model also requires the initial values of the soil moisture accounting storage s and routing storage level r however huard and mailhot 2008 showed that the effects of assuming the initial values for r and s with zero values decrease rapidly and they can be neglected after a few months the model structure process is defined in fig 1 the gr1a model was developed at cemagref at the end of 1980 s perrin et al 2010 as a robust long term average runoff mouelhi et al 2006b introduced a new version of the model with a single calibrated parameter x eq 2 2 q k p k 1 1 1 0 7 p k 0 3 p k 1 x e k 2 0 5 where qk is the simulated runoff of year k pk and pk 1 are the observed precipitation values for year k and k 1 respectively and ek is the potential evapotranspiration for year k mouelhi et al 2006b the objectives of this study could be summarized in three points 1 to simulate the runoff of the blue nile tributary of the nile river using the bf first and second generations and to investigate whether the resulting accuracy is good enough 2 if not to improve the accuracy by extending the bf with a time series analysis approach and 3 to compare the improved hybrid budyko time series model with gr1a and gr2m as benchmark models on five other major rivers worldwide in addition to the blue nile river in fact the second objective is the main contribution of this research 2 theory and method 2 1 time series modeling time series models are specially developed for serially correlated records to predict forecast or simulate events most hydrological time series models using frequency time scales annual quarterly monthly must be stationary adeloye and montaseri 2002 moreover one of the main assumptions used for simulation or forecasting is that the time series must follow a normal distribution adhikari and agrawal 2013 box and jenkins 1970 developed one of the most commonly used time series analysis frameworks for analysis and simulating known as the arima autoregressive integrated moving average models arima models can be extended to take into consideration one or more exogenous time series as well as a seasonal component to become the sarimax model p d q p d q s along with exogenous variables as hereafter defined liu et al 1997 3 p b φ p b s 1 b d 1 b s d y t c x t β θ q b θ q b s ε t where yt is the value of the dependent time series at time t ɛt refers to the residual at time t b is the backshift operator byt yt 1 the p q and d values are the order of non seasonal autoregressive moving averages and differencing respectively the p q and d are the order of seasonal autoregressive moving averages and differencing parameters respectively and θ are the autoregressive and moving averages coefficients respectively φ and θ are the seasonal autoregressive and moving averages coefficients respectively β refers to the exogenous independent xt time series parameters and s is the seasonal period length box and jenkins 1970 also introduced a powerful approach to build a sarima p d q p d q s model orders using the autocorrelation function acf and the partial autocorrelation function pacf this model building technique can be summarized in the following three stages liu et al 1992 stage 1 model identification in this stage the time series should be analyzed from a statistical point of view checking stationary and autocorrelation to build the model s stationary series have three basic criteria that must be satisfied mean variance and covariance should be constant with time else a differencing operator is needed then any autocorrelation must be accounted for introducing ar and or ma terms stage 2 estimation in this stage the model s parameters are estimated based on the available data the most suitable model could be selected based on bayesian criterion for example akaike 1974 introduced the akaike information criterion aic which is a function of the log likelihood and a penalty term related to the used number of model parameters to compare between models so that the model with the lowest aic is the best model stage 3 diagnostic checking the estimated model must be examined to check if it is adequate to simulate the time series the model s residuals must be uncorrelated and must follow a white noise to accept the model the acf and pacf plots are used to check the autocorrelation between the residuals the ljung box q statistics test is also used to check the independence of the residuals and whether they follow a white noise ljung and box 1978 if the selected model is not adequate and fails any of the tests the three stages must be repeated to build another model the model should also be validated on a dataset different than the one used for parameter estimation klemeš 1986 recommended to split the available data into two sets the calibration process is applied twice based on the first 70 of the available data as set one then on the last 70 as set two the validation is undertaken using the remaining 30 for the two above mentioned split samplings if the performance criteria described in the following sub section are still acceptable in the validation stage the model is deemed robust 2 2 performance criteria efficiency criteria to compare between the simulated and the observed runoffs many performance criteria could be used to test the performance of any model criteria include the coefficient of determination r2 krause and boyle 2005 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index nash and sutcliffe 1970 the mean absolute percent error mape the bias the root mean squared error rmse legates and mccabe 1999 and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 table 2 comparing the above mentioned criteria formulas one can notice that the nse rmse r2 and mape criteria are somehow correlated consequently there is no significant added value in reporting all of the above mentioned criteria and we will focus on four selected criteria in this research nse kge r2 and bias keeping nse and r2 although correlated as nse gives higher weight to high values hydrological events are usually suffering from high seasonality on the monthly time scale such as in the precipitation and runoff series which can lead to over rated nse values for models capable only of capturing the seasonal behavior of the series gupta et al 2009 hence the performance criteria are calculated not only on the original seasonal series but also on the deseasonalized series the deseasonalized series is obtained by subtracting the mean monthly observed values only 12 values from the observed and simulated series one of the main drawbacks of checking the deseasonalized series is that the kge criterion cannot be calculated because the β parameter in the denominator depends on the mean of the observed series which becomes zero after subtracting the mean monthly values 3 study area and data sources 3 1 study area the methodology is applied on six major rivers worldwide in addition to the spread of the catchments on five different continents the selection considered investigating various climatic conditions from semi arid to sub humid and humid basins arora 2002 the blue nile and atbara rivers are considered the main source of the nile river africa yacob 2002 murray river is australia s largest river basin from an area stand point thompson et al 2018 the mekong is the most humid basin in this study and is considered the longest river in southeast asia zhou et al 2009 the paraná river located in south america is the tenth largest river is water discharge around the world agostinho et al 1995 finally in europe the danube river is a sub humid basin all river characteristics and locations are summarized in fig 2 and table 3 andreassian and perrin 2012 investigated how to apply water balance framework on leaky or gaining catchments and proposed a water balance representation different than the budyko curve plotting the runoff coefficient r p against pet p the developed graph permits identifying each basin behavior the characteristics of the six river basins are plotted on the andreassian and perrin 2012 curve and all basins were in the normal basin zone fig 3 3 2 data sources the required data for the budyko equations the proposed sarimax with budyko gr2m and gr1a models are the monthly precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff data for each basin the monthly runoff data for blue nile and atbara rivers are recorded in sudan by the gauging stations on their mouths at khartoum and atbara cities runoff data were naturalized by the consulting firm deltares through an eastern nile technical regional office entro regional office project to be used for the nile basin model using ribasim river basin planning and management software developed by delft hydraulics deltares krogt 2008 the naturalization consists mainly of re adding the amount of water evaporated from dams and abstracted for irrigation and other uses the monthly runoff data for mekong paraná and danube rivers are obtained from the global river discharge database rivdis v1 1 global river discharge database 2018 this database is considered an important source of information on approximately 1000 stations worldwide vörösmarty et al 1998 in the case of murray river the monthly runoff data are obtained from australia water database 2018 the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data for all river basins were extracted from global gridded database sources the monthly precipitation data from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc 2018 and the monthly potential evapotranspiration data from the climatic research unit cru 2018 the annual runoff precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are obtained by summing up monthly data the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc is operated in support of the world meteorological organization wmo and its objective is to provide high quality global precipitation database over land schamm et al 2014 for the period from 1901 to 2013 on the basis of in situ measurements ziese et al 2013 the variation in precipitation according to space time directions requires high density of data in this research the monthly 0 5 gridded precipitation database version 7 was used based on quality controlled data from 67 200 stations worldwide gpcc 2018 the number of stations inside the catchment boundaries are 7 4 156 38 348 and 40 for blue nile atbara murray mekong danube and paraná respectively the climatic research unit cru is widely recognized as one of the world s leading institutions concerned with the study of natural and anthropogenic climate changes one of the main aims of this unit is to provide a time series of the past climate history database for the period from 1901 to 2015 cru 2018 monthly time series datasets are calculated on high resolution 0 5 0 5 grids which are based on an archive of monthly mean temperatures provided by more than 4000 weather stations distributed around the world jones and harris 2008 fig 2 shows the location of the cru stations inside and around the studied rivers the cru database version 3 23 provides the potential evapotranspiration and covers all land areas excluding antarctica at 0 5 resolution 4 results and discussion the results in this study are presented through three main steps the first step is to evaluate the performance identify the weaknesses of the bf equations gr1a and gr2m models on the blue nile on the annual and monthly time scales the second step which is the main contribution of this research presents the developing of the sarimax budyko models with full details on the blue nile river the last step of this study is to evaluate the proposed hybrid sarimax budyko model compared to the selected benchmark models on five other worldwide catchments 4 1 annual and monthly time step water balance of the blue nile river the eight budyko framework bf equations table 1 and the gr1a model eq 2 are applied on the blue nile catchment as an example to estimate the annual water balance the first generation of bf have no calibration parameters from the results of the comparison table 4 and fig 4 one can notice that the first generation of bf equations gives poor fit for the blue nile basin due to the lack of adjustable parameters with a maximum nse of 0 0 for the second generation of bf equations and the gr1a model parameters are calibrated on the period from 1901 to 1969 based on maximizing the nse the period from 1970 to 2002 is used to validate the results the nse of the validation period increases significantly to 0 38 for du et al 2016 equation although the gr1a model with nse values equaling to 0 19 gives better performance than six equations of the budyko framework its results are lower than or similar to the remaining two equations du et al 2016 and zhang et al 2001 respectively still all obtained annual scale results are not satisfactory to improve on the previously obtained unsatisfactory performance criteria du et al 2016 equation and the gr2m model are applied on the monthly timescale calibration and validation periods are the same as above fig 5 a and b shows the results of applying du et al 2016 equation and the gr2m model on the monthly time scale the calibrated parameters are ω 1 78 and λ 0 79 for du et al 2016 equation and x1 1343 and x5 0 77 for gr2m model the validation period gives nse values equal to 0 53 and 0 88 and kge values equal to 0 77 and 0 81 for du et al 2016 equation and the gr2m model respectively the annual results can be obtained by summing up the monthly values the annual results on the validation period give nse values equal to 0 48 and 0 18 and kge values of 0 52 and 0 67 for du et al 2016 equation and the gr2m model respectively the validation results of the deseasonalized series display a significant drop with nse values equal to 3 08 and 0 01 r2 values equal to 0 31 and 0 34 and bias values equal to 0 41 and 1 70 for du et al 2016 equation and the gr2m model respectively we also explore a simple averages model formed by the average runoff values at each month repeated across all years the averages monthly model results for the validation portion of data show nse r2 and kge that equal to 0 88 0 89 and 0 89 respectively producing higher performance criteria than those of du et al 2016 and the gr2m model however the validation period annual results show nse r2 and kge equal to 0 15 0 and 0 41 respectively this highlights the importance of investigating the performance criteria of any model on both annual and monthly scales or at least on the deseasonalized series for which the averages model has obviously a monthly nse of 0 fig 5 c and d shows the error values and the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions of the monthly errors of du et al 2016 equation and gr2m model for 20 lags it is observed that the error term does not follow a white noise from the results of the monthly models one can notice that finer time scale monthly is fitting the observed values better than the annual model the annual nse increased from 0 38 for the annual model to 0 48 for the monthly model for the same du et al 2016 equation although the gr2m model shows high performance on the monthly timescale the annual simulation is relatively poor i e the inter annual variability important for long memory persistent rivers is not captured the acf and pacf suggest a clear seasonality and at least one lag autocorrelation the errors of the gr2m model give a less pronounced seasonality for the monthly model physical understanding of large basins may suggest that the simulated monthly runoff might depend not only on the concurrent values of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration but also on these variables at the previous months as well 4 2 sarimax models for the blue nile basin 4 2 1 building the sarimax models two sarimax models are developed the first model incorporates the precipitation and the potential evapotranspiration time series as exogenous variables and the second model incorporates the precipitation and the actual evapotranspiration calculated based on bf as per du et al 2016 equation as exogenous variables this later model is what we term the hybrid sarimax budyko model the first step is to define a variable re that represents the runoff error and which will be modeled by a sarima without any use of budyko framework re is calculated as follows 4 re r u n o f f p t β 1 p t 1 β 2 pet t β 3 pet t 1 β 4 c where re is the runoff error that will be modeled by a sarima without budyko framework pt pt 1 are the precipitation of current and previous months respectively pett pett 1 are the potential evapotranspiration of current and previous months respectively β 1 2 3 4 are the coefficients of the four exogenous variables the last constant c is used to make the mean of the series equal to zero for the second model the same formula eq 4 is used to define the runoff error reb b for budyko that will be modeled by a sarima however using the actual evapotranspiration et calculated based on bf du et al 2016 equation instead of pet following the box and jenkins identification technique the re series were found not following a normal distribution to normalize the re series kernel distribution is fitted to the series calculating the cumulative probability of exceedance cpi for each data points rei then the inverse normal cumulative distribution function is calculated for cpi s giving a normal transformation of rei hereafter denoted reni after applying the sarima model on the normalized series the simulated series can be back transformed from the normal to the kernel distribution the same is repeated for the reb series most of hydrological series are subject to seasonal cycles requiring the introduction of seasonal differencing one of the main tests to check the stationarity is the unit root augmented dickey fuller adf dickey and fuller 1979 which has three cases intercept only trend and intercept and no trend or intercept the adf test is applied on the seasonal differenced series and the results show that the series is stationary for the three cases various models table 5 are tested to select the best model that minimizes the aic the selected configuration for both re and reb models are sarima 1 0 0 0 1 1 12 which provides the least aic s for the blue nile basin it is worth noting that the aic for the second model with budyko framework is less than the first without budyko framework klemeš 1986 introduced a simple split sampling approach for calibration and validation processes the available data are divided into two sets the calibration process is applied on two periods 1901 1970 set 1 and 1933 2002 set 2 for each set while the validation periods are 1971 2002 set 1 and 1901 1932 set 2 respectively the calibrated parameters are shown in table 6 the acf pacf and ljung box test q statistics are used to undertake diagnostic checks of the models residuals for 20 lags the test results show no significant autocorrelation between the model residuals and almost all of the acf and pacf values are within the white noise limits all probability values of the test q statistics were acceptable to the 5 significance level with no rejection of the null hypothesis that the models residuals are following a white noise fig 6 and table 7 show improved results when applying the two sarimax models on the monthly and annual time scales fig 6 a shows the period from 1990 to 2002 as a sample to permit a better zoom on the peaks and droughs however the performance criteria shown in table 7 are calculated for the entire validation portion the monthly nse are 0 91 and 0 94 for the two sarimax models set 1 without and with budyko respectively moreover the annual nse are 0 82 and 0 83 for the two sarimax models set 1 with and without budyko respectively from the comparison between the two models one can notice that the graph of sarimax without budyko pet model shows more abrupt spikes while the sarimax with budyko model is more robust and smooth the sarimax without budyko pet model has some small negative values in the recession portion of the hydrologic year remediation could be undertaken for these negative values however since the main contribution of this research is the hybrid sarimax with budyko model which does not suffer from this problem the remediation efforts were not further pursued the monthly validation results of the deseasonalized series of the sarimax with budyko model also drop however they are still much better than the corresponding deseasonalized series results of applying du et al 2016 and gr2m model in fact the sarimax with budyko performance criteria are 0 48 0 54 0 02 for nse r2 and bias respectively fig 7 compares the sarimax with budyko model to the gr1a and gr2m models as benchmark models and with du et al 2016 equation on the blue nile river from the comparison one can notice that the gr1a model gives extremely poor results in simulating the rainfall runoff transformation the gr2m model shows high performance on the monthly time scale as previously noted but on the annual time scale gives poor results especially for the nse the sarimax with budyko model improves both bias and correlation especially on the annual time scale it should be noted that to allow a fair comparison between the hybrid sarimax budyko model with 6 free parameters with the gr2m model with only 2 parameters we attempted to model the structure of the gr2m errors which show a seasonal behavior using also a sarima approach however the error term only suffers from seasonality i e the deseasonalized errors have no correlation structure this implies that a sarima model is not suitable for the gr2m errors only an averages type model is suitable however it adds 12 parameters average of error terms for the 12 months but improves the nse or the kge by only 1 to 2 this might be attributed to the transfer of storage refer to fig 1 from one monthly time step to the other leaving no autocorrelation left in the model error hence the results of the gr2m were kept as is 4 2 2 sensitivity analysis it is necessary to check the model stability with time this stability could be achieved for a model if it has parameters with fairly low variability regardless of the time period used in the calibration zivot and wang 2007 the monthly runoff time series is split into calibration portions of 50 years with a sliding window moving ten years in each step i e the first model is calibrated on 1901 1950 the second on 1911 1960 and so on the parameters of the resulting six models for the blue nile river are summarized in a box plot fig 8 the models show relatively constant parameter values for precipitation and evapotranspiration during the current month the share of the previous month has a relatively wider range but the increase in β 2 precipitation parameter is offset by an increase in β 4 evaporation parameter the sarimax model parameters show almost a constant value for sma 12 parameter and also a narrow range for ar 1 high positive correlations are found between the precipitation and evapotranspiration for the current month and between them for the previous month as well this is expected as the model minimizes the error on the runoff which is essentially calculated from eq 1 and its reciprocal runoff p et neglecting the change of storage one would expect high p to be associated with high et and hence the high positive correlations between their corresponding β coefficients 4 3 application of sarimax model on other five major rivers worldwide the third objective of this study is to apply the new model on the previously selected rivers fig 2 the same methodology is applied and the selected sarima model for errors for all studied rivers was found to be 1 0 0 0 1 1 12 similar to what provided the best fit for the blue nile basin the gr2m model is used as a benchmark model the calibration was applied using the first 70 of available data for each river the calibrated periods for atbara murray mekong danube and paraná rivers are 1901 1970 1962 1998 1924 1968 1901 1962 and 1920 1961 respectively the remaining 30 of the available data mentioned in table 3 are used for validation purposes the calibration periods were also tested for the last 70 of the data with similar results the results are summarized in figs 9 and 10 the sarimax with budyko model gives high nse and kge with very small bias values on both annual and monthly time scales the monthly nse values range from 0 52 for danube river to 0 85 for mekong river and the annual nse values range from 0 60 for mekong river to 0 91 for atbara river in the case of gr2m model the results show that all monthly nse values are more than 0 55 except for murray river with nse value that equals to 0 28 however the annual results show poor performance with nse values ranging from 1 34 for murray river to 0 77 for danube river however the kge values show high annual performance criteria for gr2m model since the kge is not particularly sensitive to bias for example the annual scatter plot fig 10 for atbara river shows under estimation for gr2m model with a negative nse value of 0 53 and a bias value of 15 6 mm but with kge value is relatively high and equals to 0 50 5 conclusions this study focusses on water balance equations models on the annual and monthly time scales first the gr1a model along with eight budyko framework equations were investigated the results confirmed that the du et al 2016 equation which is the only equation that could be applied on steady and unsteady conditions gave the best performance criteria to simulate runoff with nse values of 0 53 and 0 48 on monthly and annual scales blue nile basin monthly model the gr2m model was also applied on the monthly time scale with better performance than the previously mentioned models equations however du et al 2016 equation residuals suffer from seasonality and autocorrelation which should be corrected and the physical understanding of large basins may suggest taking into consideration concurrent and previous month values of precipitation and evapotranspiration this paper thus developed a new sarimax budyko hybrid model for water balance studies to remedy for such shortcomings the development was first detailed using the blue nile river data two sarimax models are investigated with and without budyko framework the sarimax model without budyko framework pet shows some weaknesses which could be summarized in the occurrence of some small negative runoff values as well as abrupt changes in the runoff graph the sarimax with budyko model does not show such deficiencies and performs better than previously mentioned models equations to generalize the finding this hybrid sarimax with budyko model was tested on six rivers worldwide and was compared to the eight budyko equations and to the same benchmark gr1a and gr2m models the selected performance criteria are the nash sutcliffe and kling gupta efficiencies as well as the coefficient of determination and bias the main conclusions of this comparison could be summarized as follows 1 in the general the hybrid sarimax with budyko model outperforms the tested benchmark models and is even better than the gr2m model in all performance criteria on the monthly time scale with a stable and high performance in all tested rivers on the annual time scale the hybrid sarimax with budyko model is significantly better than the benchmark model with high nse kge and much lower bias values 2 the gr1a model was found to perform worse than the bf equations furthermore the monthly gr2m model can successfully simulate the monthly time scale with nse from 0 57 to 0 90 for five of the six studied basins with better performance than the original bf equations 3 the averages model is also investigated on the blue nile river with high performance criteria on the monthly time scale nse 0 88 but with extremely poor annual fit nse 0 15 it is thus important to test any developed model on both time scales to be qualified as a good simulating model 4 the gr2m model tested on the annual time scale showed poor simulation with three negative nse values among the studied six rivers the developed sarimax with budyko model succeeded in simulating the monthly time scale nse ranges from 0 52 to 0 94 as well as the annual time scales nse ranges from 0 60 to 0 91 with very small bias values declaration of interest statement no potential conflict of interest is reported by the authors acknowledgements the authors are indebted to the associate editor and the reviewers of the manuscript for providing insightful comments and directions for additional work special thanks should be given to dr khaled hamed cairo university for his valuable support without all this supportive work this paper would not have been in its current form 
6740,the budyko framework used for water balance studies is an effective tool that estimates the actual evapotranspiration balancing between energy and water availabilities in this study we investigate eight budyko framework equations as well as the gr1a and gr2m models on the nile tributary blue nile catchment on the annual time scale all investigated models and equations show poor results moreover the resulting errors on the monthly scale show a clear pattern of seasonality and autocorrelation to overcome such deficiencies we propose a time series sarima model to fit the error

of the catchment characteristics wang and zhou 2016 within the water balance framework efforts have long focused on defining a relationship between the precipitation p as the supply source of the system on one hand and the actual evapotranspiration et and runoff r on the other hand as the outputs demand of the system as described in eq 1 1 p e t r δ s where δs is the change in catchment water storage that may take positive or negative values du et al 2016 the change in water storage at the basin scale can be neglected over long term timescales such as annual or longer wu et al 2017 in the same line many researches were undertaken to estimate the actual evapotranspiration following the budyko framework budyko 1948 arora 2002 the budyko framework bf is an effective tool for assessing linkages and feedbacks on water between climate forcing and land surface characteristics xu et al 2013 by estimating the actual evapotranspiration et as a function of the aridity index ϕ the aridity index ϕ is defined as the ratio between the potential evapotranspiration pet and the precipitation p the potential evapotranspiration pet appeared for the first time by thornthwaite 1948 who defined pet as the amount of water which would transpire and evaporate if it were available lhommel 1997 the potential evapotranspiration pet is not only the upper limit of actual evapotranspiration but also the basis to evaluate it gao et al 2006 the budyko framework is characterized by two special features the first is its simplicity and the second is its long history of development over a century of hydrological research greve et al 2016 within the first generation of developments in the budyko framework four equations were proposed by schreiber 1904 ol dekop 1911 budyko 1948 turc 1954 and pike 1964 refer to the first four equations in table 1 these four equations are empirical equations without calibration parameters and are functions of ϕ to estimate the long term water balance at the catchment scale despite the long history of these four equations they have two weaknesses the first is that they don t take into consideration the catchment characteristics and climate dependent variables such as climatic region vegetation forest cover soil properties or topography choudhury 1999 du et al 2016 fu 1981 mezentsev 1955 yang et al 2007 2008 zhang et al 2001 the second weakness is that this framework can be applied only on a long term annual or longer timescale steady state conditions du et al 2016 it should also be noted that this hypothesis concerns mainly natural runoff values without anthropogenic inter basin flux or at least naturalized runoff values i e where effects of reservoirs have been eliminated and water abstractions have been added to overcome these weaknesses researchers developed the second generation of budyko equations to overcome the first weak point researchers suggested adding one calibration parameter choudhury 1999 fu 1981 mezentsev 1955 yang et al 2007 2008 zhang et al 2001 refer to the 5th to 7th equations in table 1 this adjustable parameter reflects the catchment characteristics and can be calibrated using observed data choudhury 1999 with regard to the second weak point zhang et al 2008 investigated the use of one of the budyko equations over variable time scales annual monthly and daily timescales in australia they concluded that the annual model is the only one which performed well and they recognized that in order to apply the equation on a shorter timescale one needs more complex models recently du et al 2016 introduced an equation improving fu 1981 equation with two adjustable parameters ω and λ to overcome the two weak points as ω reflects the catchment characteristics and λ extends the steady state condition so that the equation can be used on a monthly time scale refer to the last equation in table 1 the unsteady state condition can in fact be due to unclosed catchment to a catchment with intense human activities and irrigation to significant water storage changes or to using sub annual timescales monthly weekly or even daily du et al 2016 in this study the monthly gr2m model mouelhi et al 2006a and the annual gr1a model mouelhi et al 2006b are also used as benchmark models to simulate the runoff gr2m has two calibrated parameters the first parameter x1 represents the maximum soil moisture storage the second parameter x5 can be interpreted to represent the water exchange term with outside neighbor s basins huard and mailhot 2008 or the catchment area properties mouelhi et al 2006a the model also requires the initial values of the soil moisture accounting storage s and routing storage level r however huard and mailhot 2008 showed that the effects of assuming the initial values for r and s with zero values decrease rapidly and they can be neglected after a few months the model structure process is defined in fig 1 the gr1a model was developed at cemagref at the end of 1980 s perrin et al 2010 as a robust long term average runoff mouelhi et al 2006b introduced a new version of the model with a single calibrated parameter x eq 2 2 q k p k 1 1 1 0 7 p k 0 3 p k 1 x e k 2 0 5 where qk is the simulated runoff of year k pk and pk 1 are the observed precipitation values for year k and k 1 respectively and ek is the potential evapotranspiration for year k mouelhi et al 2006b the objectives of this study could be summarized in three points 1 to simulate the runoff of the blue nile tributary of the nile river using the bf first and second generations and to investigate whether the resulting accuracy is good enough 2 if not to improve the accuracy by extending the bf with a time series analysis approach and 3 to compare the improved hybrid budyko time series model with gr1a and gr2m as benchmark models on five other major rivers worldwide in addition to the blue nile river in fact the second objective is the main contribution of this research 2 theory and method 2 1 time series modeling time series models are specially developed for serially correlated records to predict forecast or simulate events most hydrological time series models using frequency time scales annual quarterly monthly must be stationary adeloye and montaseri 2002 moreover one of the main assumptions used for simulation or forecasting is that the time series must follow a normal distribution adhikari and agrawal 2013 box and jenkins 1970 developed one of the most commonly used time series analysis frameworks for analysis and simulating known as the arima autoregressive integrated moving average models arima models can be extended to take into consideration one or more exogenous time series as well as a seasonal component to become the sarimax model p d q p d q s along with exogenous variables as hereafter defined liu et al 1997 3 p b φ p b s 1 b d 1 b s d y t c x t β θ q b θ q b s ε t where yt is the value of the dependent time series at time t ɛt refers to the residual at time t b is the backshift operator byt yt 1 the p q and d values are the order of non seasonal autoregressive moving averages and differencing respectively the p q and d are the order of seasonal autoregressive moving averages and differencing parameters respectively and θ are the autoregressive and moving averages coefficients respectively φ and θ are the seasonal autoregressive and moving averages coefficients respectively β refers to the exogenous independent xt time series parameters and s is the seasonal period length box and jenkins 1970 also introduced a powerful approach to build a sarima p d q p d q s model orders using the autocorrelation function acf and the partial autocorrelation function pacf this model building technique can be summarized in the following three stages liu et al 1992 stage 1 model identification in this stage the time series should be analyzed from a statistical point of view checking stationary and autocorrelation to build the model s stationary series have three basic criteria that must be satisfied mean variance and covariance should be constant with time else a differencing operator is needed then any autocorrelation must be accounted for introducing ar and or ma terms stage 2 estimation in this stage the model s parameters are estimated based on the available data the most suitable model could be selected based on bayesian criterion for example akaike 1974 introduced the akaike information criterion aic which is a function of the log likelihood and a penalty term related to the used number of model parameters to compare between models so that the model with the lowest aic is the best model stage 3 diagnostic checking the estimated model must be examined to check if it is adequate to simulate the time series the model s residuals must be uncorrelated and must follow a white noise to accept the model the acf and pacf plots are used to check the autocorrelation between the residuals the ljung box q statistics test is also used to check the independence of the residuals and whether they follow a white noise ljung and box 1978 if the selected model is not adequate and fails any of the tests the three stages must be repeated to build another model the model should also be validated on a dataset different than the one used for parameter estimation klemeš 1986 recommended to split the available data into two sets the calibration process is applied twice based on the first 70 of the available data as set one then on the last 70 as set two the validation is undertaken using the remaining 30 for the two above mentioned split samplings if the performance criteria described in the following sub section are still acceptable in the validation stage the model is deemed robust 2 2 performance criteria efficiency criteria to compare between the simulated and the observed runoffs many performance criteria could be used to test the performance of any model criteria include the coefficient of determination r2 krause and boyle 2005 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index nash and sutcliffe 1970 the mean absolute percent error mape the bias the root mean squared error rmse legates and mccabe 1999 and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 table 2 comparing the above mentioned criteria formulas one can notice that the nse rmse r2 and mape criteria are somehow correlated consequently there is no significant added value in reporting all of the above mentioned criteria and we will focus on four selected criteria in this research nse kge r2 and bias keeping nse and r2 although correlated as nse gives higher weight to high values hydrological events are usually suffering from high seasonality on the monthly time scale such as in the precipitation and runoff series which can lead to over rated nse values for models capable only of capturing the seasonal behavior of the series gupta et al 2009 hence the performance criteria are calculated not only on the original seasonal series but also on the deseasonalized series the deseasonalized series is obtained by subtracting the mean monthly observed values only 12 values from the observed and simulated series one of the main drawbacks of checking the deseasonalized series is that the kge criterion cannot be calculated because the β parameter in the denominator depends on the mean of the observed series which becomes zero after subtracting the mean monthly values 3 study area and data sources 3 1 study area the methodology is applied on six major rivers worldwide in addition to the spread of the catchments on five different continents the selection considered investigating various climatic conditions from semi arid to sub humid and humid basins arora 2002 the blue nile and atbara rivers are considered the main source of the nile river africa yacob 2002 murray river is australia s largest river basin from an area stand point thompson et al 2018 the mekong is the most humid basin in this study and is considered the longest river in southeast asia zhou et al 2009 the paraná river located in south america is the tenth largest river is water discharge around the world agostinho et al 1995 finally in europe the danube river is a sub humid basin all river characteristics and locations are summarized in fig 2 and table 3 andreassian and perrin 2012 investigated how to apply water balance framework on leaky or gaining catchments and proposed a water balance representation different than the budyko curve plotting the runoff coefficient r p against pet p the developed graph permits identifying each basin behavior the characteristics of the six river basins are plotted on the andreassian and perrin 2012 curve and all basins were in the normal basin zone fig 3 3 2 data sources the required data for the budyko equations the proposed sarimax with budyko gr2m and gr1a models are the monthly precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff data for each basin the monthly runoff data for blue nile and atbara rivers are recorded in sudan by the gauging stations on their mouths at khartoum and atbara cities runoff data were naturalized by the consulting firm deltares through an eastern nile technical regional office entro regional office project to be used for the nile basin model using ribasim river basin planning and management software developed by delft hydraulics deltares krogt 2008 the naturalization consists mainly of re adding the amount of water evaporated from dams and abstracted for irrigation and other uses the monthly runoff data for mekong paraná and danube rivers are obtained from the global river discharge database rivdis v1 1 global river discharge database 2018 this database is considered an important source of information on approximately 1000 stations worldwide vörösmarty et al 1998 in the case of murray river the monthly runoff data are obtained from australia water database 2018 the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data for all river basins were extracted from global gridded database sources the monthly precipitation data from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc 2018 and the monthly potential evapotranspiration data from the climatic research unit cru 2018 the annual runoff precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are obtained by summing up monthly data the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc is operated in support of the world meteorological organization wmo and its objective is to provide high quality global precipitation database over land schamm et al 2014 for the period from 1901 to 2013 on the basis of in situ measurements ziese et al 2013 the variation in precipitation according to space time directions requires high density of data in this research the monthly 0 5 gridded precipitation database version 7 was used based on quality controlled data from 67 200 stations worldwide gpcc 2018 the number of stations inside the catchment boundaries are 7 4 156 38 348 and 40 for blue nile atbara murray mekong danube and paraná respectively the climatic research unit cru is widely recognized as one of the world s leading institutions concerned with the study of natural and anthropogenic climate changes one of the main aims of this unit is to provide a time series of the past climate history database for the period from 1901 to 2015 cru 2018 monthly time series datasets are calculated on high resolution 0 5 0 5 grids which are based on an archive of monthly mean temperatures provided by more than 4000 weather stations distributed around the world jones and harris 2008 fig 2 shows the location of the cru stations inside and around the studied rivers the cru database version 3 23 provides the potential evapotranspiration and covers all land areas excluding antarctica at 0 5 resolution 4 results and discussion the results in this study are presented through three main steps the first step is to evaluate the performance identify the weaknesses of the bf equations gr1a and gr2m models on the blue nile on the annual and monthly time scales the second step which is the main contribution of this research presents the developing of the sarimax budyko models with full details on the blue nile river the last step of this study is to evaluate the proposed hybrid sarimax budyko model compared to the selected benchmark models on five other worldwide catchments 4 1 annual and monthly time step water balance of the blue nile river the eight budyko framework bf equations table 1 and the gr1a model eq 2 are applied on the blue nile catchment as an example to estimate the annual water balance the first generation of bf have no calibration parameters from the results of the comparison table 4 and fig 4 one can notice that the first generation of bf equations gives poor fit for the blue nile basin due to the lack of adjustable parameters with a maximum nse of 0 0 for the second generation of bf equations and the gr1a model parameters are calibrated on the period from 1901 to 1969 based on maximizing the nse the period from 1970 to 2002 is used to validate the results the nse of the validation period increases significantly to 0 38 for du et al 2016 equation although the gr1a model with nse values equaling to 0 19 gives better performance than six equations of the budyko framework its results are lower than or similar to the remaining two equations du et al 2016 and zhang et al 2001 respectively still all obtained annual scale results are not satisfactory to improve on the previously obtained unsatisfactory performance criteria du et al 2016 equation and the gr2m model are applied on the monthly timescale calibration and validation periods are the same as above fig 5 a and b shows the results of applying du et al 2016 equation and the gr2m model on the monthly time scale the calibrated parameters are ω 1 78 and λ 0 79 for du et al 2016 equation and x1 1343 and x5 0 77 for gr2m model the validation period gives nse values equal to 0 53 and 0 88 and kge values equal to 0 77 and 0 81 for du et al 2016 equation and the gr2m model respectively the annual results can be obtained by summing up the monthly values the annual results on the validation period give nse values equal to 0 48 and 0 18 and kge values of 0 52 and 0 67 for du et al 2016 equation and the gr2m model respectively the validation results of the deseasonalized series display a significant drop with nse values equal to 3 08 and 0 01 r2 values equal to 0 31 and 0 34 and bias values equal to 0 41 and 1 70 for du et al 2016 equation and the gr2m model respectively we also explore a simple averages model formed by the average runoff values at each month repeated across all years the averages monthly model results for the validation portion of data show nse r2 and kge that equal to 0 88 0 89 and 0 89 respectively producing higher performance criteria than those of du et al 2016 and the gr2m model however the validation period annual results show nse r2 and kge equal to 0 15 0 and 0 41 respectively this highlights the importance of investigating the performance criteria of any model on both annual and monthly scales or at least on the deseasonalized series for which the averages model has obviously a monthly nse of 0 fig 5 c and d shows the error values and the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions of the monthly errors of du et al 2016 equation and gr2m model for 20 lags it is observed that the error term does not follow a white noise from the results of the monthly models one can notice that finer time scale monthly is fitting the observed values better than the annual model the annual nse increased from 0 38 for the annual model to 0 48 for the monthly model for the same du et al 2016 equation although the gr2m model shows high performance on the monthly timescale the annual simulation is relatively poor i e the inter annual variability important for long memory persistent rivers is not captured the acf and pacf suggest a clear seasonality and at least one lag autocorrelation the errors of the gr2m model give a less pronounced seasonality for the monthly model physical understanding of large basins may suggest that the simulated monthly runoff might depend not only on the concurrent values of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration but also on these variables at the previous months as well 4 2 sarimax models for the blue nile basin 4 2 1 building the sarimax models two sarimax models are developed the first model incorporates the precipitation and the potential evapotranspiration time series as exogenous variables and the second model incorporates the precipitation and the actual evapotranspiration calculated based on bf as per du et al 2016 equation as exogenous variables this later model is what we term the hybrid sarimax budyko model the first step is to define a variable re that represents the runoff error and which will be modeled by a sarima without any use of budyko framework re is calculated as follows 4 re r u n o f f p t β 1 p t 1 β 2 pet t β 3 pet t 1 β 4 c where re is the runoff error that will be modeled by a sarima without budyko framework pt pt 1 are the precipitation of current and previous months respectively pett pett 1 are the potential evapotranspiration of current and previous months respectively β 1 2 3 4 are the coefficients of the four exogenous variables the last constant c is used to make the mean of the series equal to zero for the second model the same formula eq 4 is used to define the runoff error reb b for budyko that will be modeled by a sarima however using the actual evapotranspiration et calculated based on bf du et al 2016 equation instead of pet following the box and jenkins identification technique the re series were found not following a normal distribution to normalize the re series kernel distribution is fitted to the series calculating the cumulative probability of exceedance cpi for each data points rei then the inverse normal cumulative distribution function is calculated for cpi s giving a normal transformation of rei hereafter denoted reni after applying the sarima model on the normalized series the simulated series can be back transformed from the normal to the kernel distribution the same is repeated for the reb series most of hydrological series are subject to seasonal cycles requiring the introduction of seasonal differencing one of the main tests to check the stationarity is the unit root augmented dickey fuller adf dickey and fuller 1979 which has three cases intercept only trend and intercept and no trend or intercept the adf test is applied on the seasonal differenced series and the results show that the series is stationary for the three cases various models table 5 are tested to select the best model that minimizes the aic the selected configuration for both re and reb models are sarima 1 0 0 0 1 1 12 which provides the least aic s for the blue nile basin it is worth noting that the aic for the second model with budyko framework is less than the first without budyko framework klemeš 1986 introduced a simple split sampling approach for calibration and validation processes the available data are divided into two sets the calibration process is applied on two periods 1901 1970 set 1 and 1933 2002 set 2 for each set while the validation periods are 1971 2002 set 1 and 1901 1932 set 2 respectively the calibrated parameters are shown in table 6 the acf pacf and ljung box test q statistics are used to undertake diagnostic checks of the models residuals for 20 lags the test results show no significant autocorrelation between the model residuals and almost all of the acf and pacf values are within the white noise limits all probability values of the test q statistics were acceptable to the 5 significance level with no rejection of the null hypothesis that the models residuals are following a white noise fig 6 and table 7 show improved results when applying the two sarimax models on the monthly and annual time scales fig 6 a shows the period from 1990 to 2002 as a sample to permit a better zoom on the peaks and droughs however the performance criteria shown in table 7 are calculated for the entire validation portion the monthly nse are 0 91 and 0 94 for the two sarimax models set 1 without and with budyko respectively moreover the annual nse are 0 82 and 0 83 for the two sarimax models set 1 with and without budyko respectively from the comparison between the two models one can notice that the graph of sarimax without budyko pet model shows more abrupt spikes while the sarimax with budyko model is more robust and smooth the sarimax without budyko pet model has some small negative values in the recession portion of the hydrologic year remediation could be undertaken for these negative values however since the main contribution of this research is the hybrid sarimax with budyko model which does not suffer from this problem the remediation efforts were not further pursued the monthly validation results of the deseasonalized series of the sarimax with budyko model also drop however they are still much better than the corresponding deseasonalized series results of applying du et al 2016 and gr2m model in fact the sarimax with budyko performance criteria are 0 48 0 54 0 02 for nse r2 and bias respectively fig 7 compares the sarimax with budyko model to the gr1a and gr2m models as benchmark models and with du et al 2016 equation on the blue nile river from the comparison one can notice that the gr1a model gives extremely poor results in simulating the rainfall runoff transformation the gr2m model shows high performance on the monthly time scale as previously noted but on the annual time scale gives poor results especially for the nse the sarimax with budyko model improves both bias and correlation especially on the annual time scale it should be noted that to allow a fair comparison between the hybrid sarimax budyko model with 6 free parameters with the gr2m model with only 2 parameters we attempted to model the structure of the gr2m errors which show a seasonal behavior using also a sarima approach however the error term only suffers from seasonality i e the deseasonalized errors have no correlation structure this implies that a sarima model is not suitable for the gr2m errors only an averages type model is suitable however it adds 12 parameters average of error terms for the 12 months but improves the nse or the kge by only 1 to 2 this might be attributed to the transfer of storage refer to fig 1 from one monthly time step to the other leaving no autocorrelation left in the model error hence the results of the gr2m were kept as is 4 2 2 sensitivity analysis it is necessary to check the model stability with time this stability could be achieved for a model if it has parameters with fairly low variability regardless of the time period used in the calibration zivot and wang 2007 the monthly runoff time series is split into calibration portions of 50 years with a sliding window moving ten years in each step i e the first model is calibrated on 1901 1950 the second on 1911 1960 and so on the parameters of the resulting six models for the blue nile river are summarized in a box plot fig 8 the models show relatively constant parameter values for precipitation and evapotranspiration during the current month the share of the previous month has a relatively wider range but the increase in β 2 precipitation parameter is offset by an increase in β 4 evaporation parameter the sarimax model parameters show almost a constant value for sma 12 parameter and also a narrow range for ar 1 high positive correlations are found between the precipitation and evapotranspiration for the current month and between them for the previous month as well this is expected as the model minimizes the error on the runoff which is essentially calculated from eq 1 and its reciprocal runoff p et neglecting the change of storage one would expect high p to be associated with high et and hence the high positive correlations between their corresponding β coefficients 4 3 application of sarimax model on other five major rivers worldwide the third objective of this study is to apply the new model on the previously selected rivers fig 2 the same methodology is applied and the selected sarima model for errors for all studied rivers was found to be 1 0 0 0 1 1 12 similar to what provided the best fit for the blue nile basin the gr2m model is used as a benchmark model the calibration was applied using the first 70 of available data for each river the calibrated periods for atbara murray mekong danube and paraná rivers are 1901 1970 1962 1998 1924 1968 1901 1962 and 1920 1961 respectively the remaining 30 of the available data mentioned in table 3 are used for validation purposes the calibration periods were also tested for the last 70 of the data with similar results the results are summarized in figs 9 and 10 the sarimax with budyko model gives high nse and kge with very small bias values on both annual and monthly time scales the monthly nse values range from 0 52 for danube river to 0 85 for mekong river and the annual nse values range from 0 60 for mekong river to 0 91 for atbara river in the case of gr2m model the results show that all monthly nse values are more than 0 55 except for murray river with nse value that equals to 0 28 however the annual results show poor performance with nse values ranging from 1 34 for murray river to 0 77 for danube river however the kge values show high annual performance criteria for gr2m model since the kge is not particularly sensitive to bias for example the annual scatter plot fig 10 for atbara river shows under estimation for gr2m model with a negative nse value of 0 53 and a bias value of 15 6 mm but with kge value is relatively high and equals to 0 50 5 conclusions this study focusses on water balance equations models on the annual and monthly time scales first the gr1a model along with eight budyko framework equations were investigated the results confirmed that the du et al 2016 equation which is the only equation that could be applied on steady and unsteady conditions gave the best performance criteria to simulate runoff with nse values of 0 53 and 0 48 on monthly and annual scales blue nile basin monthly model the gr2m model was also applied on the monthly time scale with better performance than the previously mentioned models equations however du et al 2016 equation residuals suffer from seasonality and autocorrelation which should be corrected and the physical understanding of large basins may suggest taking into consideration concurrent and previous month values of precipitation and evapotranspiration this paper thus developed a new sarimax budyko hybrid model for water balance studies to remedy for such shortcomings the development was first detailed using the blue nile river data two sarimax models are investigated with and without budyko framework the sarimax model without budyko framework pet shows some weaknesses which could be summarized in the occurrence of some small negative runoff values as well as abrupt changes in the runoff graph the sarimax with budyko model does not show such deficiencies and performs better than previously mentioned models equations to generalize the finding this hybrid sarimax with budyko model was tested on six rivers worldwide and was compared to the eight budyko equations and to the same benchmark gr1a and gr2m models the selected performance criteria are the nash sutcliffe and kling gupta efficiencies as well as the coefficient of determination and bias the main conclusions of this comparison could be summarized as follows 1 in the general the hybrid sarimax with budyko model outperforms the tested benchmark models and is even better than the gr2m model in all performance criteria on the monthly time scale with a stable and high performance in all tested rivers on the annual time scale the hybrid sarimax with budyko model is significantly better than the benchmark model with high nse kge and much lower bias values 2 the gr1a model was found to perform worse than the bf equations furthermore the monthly gr2m model can successfully simulate the monthly time scale with nse from 0 57 to 0 90 for five of the six studied basins with better performance than the original bf equations 3 the averages model is also investigated on the blue nile river with high performance criteria on the monthly time scale nse 0 88 but with extremely poor annual fit nse 0 15 it is thus important to test any developed model on both time scales to be qualified as a good simulating model 4 the gr2m model tested on the annual time scale showed poor simulation with three negative nse values among the studied six rivers the developed sarimax with budyko model succeeded in simulating the monthly time scale nse ranges from 0 52 to 0 94 as well as the annual time scales nse ranges from 0 60 to 0 91 with very small bias values declaration of interest statement no potential conflict of interest is reported by the authors acknowledgements the authors are indebted to the associate editor and the reviewers of the manuscript for providing insightful comments and directions for additional work special thanks should be given to dr khaled hamed cairo university for his valuable

6741,domestic sewage is a key source of surface water pollution in rural areas of developing countries especially in china where a large amount of highly concentrated nutrients is directly discharged into the receiving waters therefore in this study a set of ecological ditch systems was designed to remove nutrients from rural domestic sewage in the hilly area of the central sichuan basin china the results show that the total nitrogen tn removal efficiencies range from 14 87 to 84 24 with an average of 47 97 and the total phosphorus tp removal efficiencies range from 13 93 to 86 22 with an average of 49 79 the highest daily tn and tp removal rates are 13 06 and 1 30 g m 2 d 1 respectively and the average removal rates are 3 19 g m 2 d 1 for tn and 0 28 g m 2 d 1 for tp our results indicate that the ecological ditch system to treat rural domestic sewage with high nutrient concentrations can be used in the study area or areas with similar topography furthermore we found that the nutrient removal efficiencies exhibit considerable seasonal variations and are sensitive to the hydraulic flow rates the nutrient removal capacity of the ecological ditch system is therefore somewhat limited based on our findings the use of winter hardy wetland plants and increase of the size of the filter unit are recommended to make the ecological ditch system more efficient and maintain high nutrient removal rates year round furthermore we suggest that regular mowing of plants and the removal of accumulated sediment are necessary to manage the ecological ditch system keywords ecological ditch domestic sewage wastewater treatment nitrogen phosphorus 1 introduction eutrophication of rivers or lakes due to excess nitrogen and phosphorus has become a major environmental concern in recent years wang et al 2016 domestic sewage is considered to be a major pollution source in rural areas of developing countries zhang et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 tran et al 2015 lutterbeck et al 2017 in such areas with a less developed infrastructure for wastewater treatment in which wastewater is not treated domestic sewage containing high levels of substances such as nitrogen phosphorus and pathogens is often directly discharged from open drainage ditches to nearby water bodies zou et al 2012 moeder et al 2017 this has caused the eutrophication of the surrounding surface water in developing countries especially in china wang et al 2017 kumwimba et al 2018 therefore the identification of suitable domestic sewage treatment approaches in these rural areas especially nitrogen and phosphorus removal has become an urgent issue qiu 2011 wang et al 2016 song et al 2018 many ecological engineering approaches have been developed to treat rural domestic sewage worldwide such as constructed wetlands cws retention ponds and subsurface filtration technologies elliott et al 2007 tixier et al 2011 anderson et al 2015 many studies have confirmed that pollutants in domestic sewage such as chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen phosphorus heavy metals and pathogens could be effectively removed by cws vymazal 2007 tang et al 2013 kadlec et al 2009 vymazal 2007 reviewed the nutrient removal mechanisms of various types of cws similarly retention ponds and subsurface filtration technology have also been confirmed to be effective methods to remove nutrients in rural areas winston et al 2013 anderson et al 2015 however the effectiveness of nutrient removal via these approaches is highly variable and depends on a range of factors such as the temperature discharge wetland plants and pollutants concentrations vymazal 2007 headley and tanner 2012 winston et al 2013 lucke et al 2015 in addition the pollutants accumulated in sediments filter materials and decaying wetland plants could be released and re enter receiving waters which may lead to the release of the retained nutrients thus becoming a source of nutrients of the water column semadeni davies 2006 hill et al 2012 jia et al 2015 kumwimba et al 2018 furthermore although all these approaches have significant advantages over typical wastewater treatment plants in terms of the nutrient removal and economic costs the land requirements for these approaches may be the most limiting factor to their application especially in hilly areas wu et al 2015 therefore it is challenge that how to reduce the land requirement for domestic sewage treatment via ecological engineering approaches in rural areas especially in hilly areas of developing countries vegetated ditches have become an increasingly popular approach to reducing the transport of nutrients derived from agricultural areas their popularity can be attributed to the smaller land requirements high nutrient removal rate and low construction and maintenance operation costs liu et al 2015 chen et al 2015 many studies have demonstrated that vegetated ditches can effectively remove nutrients leached from agricultural soils caused by fertilizer application matthew et al 2006 kröger et al 2007 smith et al 2010 moore et al 2011 tang et al 2013 vymazal et al 2018 kumwimba et al 2018 reviewed the design mechanism management strategies and future directions of the removal of non point source pollutants from agricultural runoff by vegetated drainage ditches the treatment measures for the removal of nitrogen from agricultural runoff in vegetated ditches depend on the self purifying mechanisms of natural water bodies such as aeration ammonia oxidation plant uptake sedimentation adsorption volatilization nitrification and denitrification tang et al 2013 vymazal et al 2018 the treatment measures for the removal of phosphorus from agricultural runoff in vegetated ditches depend on the plant uptake sedimentation and adsorption vymazal et al 2018 moreover maintenance practices are essential to sustain stable nutrient removal rates of vegetation ditches faust et al 2018 reviewed the effects of different agricultural ditch management practices on nutrients and sediment losses downstream in recent years vegetated ditches have also been successfully used to treat rural domestic sewage wastewaters kumwimba et al 2017a b bundschuh et al 2016 however there are still shortcomings when fully applying them to treat rural domestic sewage on one hand most plants in vegetated ditches do not easily survive for a long time under high cod and very low dissolved oxygen do concentrations saggaï et al 2017 on the other hand the nutrient removal capacity of vegetated ditches is limited due to high nutrient concentrations complex wastewater compositions and unstable flow rates kumwimba et al 2018 hydrologic variables should be considered as critical parameters for the management and to achieve a sustainable treatment performance kumwimba et al 2018 several studies have also demonstrated that the removal efficiencies of nutrients are related to the hydrologic variables li et al 2016 soana et al 2017 castaldelli et al 2018 however it is very difficult to improve the nutrient removal capacity via vegetated ditches under highly variable hydraulic loading rates hlr therefore reducing the toxicity of the wastewater for plants and increasing the nutrient removal capacity of vegetated ditches under highly variable hlr are becoming major future challenges for the sustainable long term operation of vegetated ditches that are used to treat rural domestic sewage in this study we designed and constructed an ecological ditch system consisting of a retention pond aeration filter basin and vegetated ditches to treat domestic sewage in a small township in the hilly area of the central sichuan basin china the objectives of this study were to i evaluate the performance of the ecological ditch system in treating domestic sewage from a rural township and ii analyze the nutrient removal capacity of the ecological ditch system under different environmental conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in a rural township in the sichuan province china 31 16 n 105 27 e the study site is located on top of a hill at an altitude ranging from 500 to 600 m in the central sichuan basin southwest china fig 1 the region experiences a moderate subtropical monsoon climate with an annual mean temperature of 17 3 c and annual mean precipitation of 826 mm most precipitation occurs from april to october zhu et al 2009 this township is a typical township in the region with an area of 1 26 ha and a stable population of approximately 500 inhabitants per square kilometer approximately 500 migrants enter this township for trading every two days the township was constructed on both sides of the main road that runs through it the hillside itself has a slope of 15 and the township is divided into a residential area 0 77 ha school 0 11 ha and road 0 38 ha luo et al 2012 approximately 30 150 m3 d 1 of sewage is produced daily approximately 0 86 4 31 kg n d 1 and 0 05 0 23 kg p d 1 is produced daily two covered concrete ditches one on either side of the road were constructed in this township both of which are used for rainfall and sewage drainage prior to this study this wastewater merged into one of the ditches and the storm runoff and sewage had not been separated into different systems additionally there is no sewage treatment facility or qualified slaughterhouse in this township all combined untreated sewage and runoff directly entered the drainage ditch and subsequently flowed into receiving water such as rivers 2 2 ecological ditch system design two ditches were designed and constructed adjacent to the domestic sewage collecting ditches one is an ecological ditch system designed to improve the water quality of domestic sewage generated by the township and the other is designed as a flood drain to separate the flood water sandstone was used to prevent damage to the ecological ditch system due to storm runoff as a rule domestic sewage was discharged into the ecological ditch system while the flood water was separated from sewage via a diversion dam and directed into the flood drain ditch the ecological ditch system is 308 0 m in length and has a maximum bottom width of 1 5 m minimum bottom width of 0 8 m and average depth of 0 6 m it was designed to maximize the utilization of natural processes and ecosystem functions of the drainage ditch the ditch is divided into four successive units a settlement unit u1 aeration unit u2 filtration unit u3 and vegetated ditches unit u4 fig 2 first the settlement unit u1 consists of several parts along the ecological ditch system and has a total length of 110 0 m one part was created for sediment settlement and solid waste disposal and has a length width and depth of 3 0 2 0 m and 1 m respectively fig 2 the second part was created to serve as biofilter pond it is filled with dry rice straw to increase the organic carbon concentration and has a length width and depth of 1 5 1 5 and 1 0 m respectively the third part is a concrete ditch in which hydrocotyle chinensis dunn craib and myriophyllum elatinoides gaudich were planted there was some sediment on the ditch bottom when hydrocotyle chinensis dunn craib and myriophyllum elatinoidesgaudich was planted the concrete ditch is 20 0 m long and 1 5 m wide and has a water level of 30 0 cm and a water width of 1 5 m a preprocessing pond was constructed before the falling water in the aeration unit the size pond is 2 0 2 0 and 1 0 m in length width and depth respectively a steep 70 slope with a height of 27 0 m and a vertical pebble bed on the top was used to aerate the falling water acorus tatarinowii was planted on the surface of the pebble bed to strengthen the aeration efficiency acorus tatarinowii has developed reticular roots reticular structure increases the exchange between water and air by increasing the surface area of water thus increasing the aeration efficiency next we constructed a filter basin that was 3 0 3 0 and 1 5 m in length width and depth to collect the falling aerated water the basin contains layers of filtration materials including sand gravel and carclazyte fig 2 each layer is approximately 10 0 cm thick a layer of bricks with a thickness of 6 0 cm was placed on top of the filter layers to prevent the system from clogging due to suspended sediment fig 2 a plastic mesh with an aperture of 1 0 mm was placed under the bricks finally we constructed 150 0 m long vegetated ditches with widths ranging from 1 0 to 1 5 m a series of weirs was used as water control structure to maintain a water level of 10 0 cm and water width of 1 0 m over the sediment the weirs were set apart at intervals of at least 30 0 m soil was used as substrate in the vegetated ditches before and after the weirs pebbles with a length of 1 0 m and a depth of 0 1 m were paved to weaken the soil erosion the purpose of these weirs was to delay the hydraulic retention time hrt the dominant wetland plants used were thalia dealbata t dealbata iris pseudacorus l i pseudacorus l canna indica c indica phyllostachys heteroclada oliver p heteroclada oliver acorus tatarinowii a tatarinowii rumex patientia r patientia and calla palustris l c palustris l we planted t dealbata p heteroclada oliver and i pseudacorus l in the first wetland surface flow ditch c indica and c palustris l in the second a tatarinowii in the third and t dealbata and r patientia in the fourth fig 2 2 3 ecological ditch system maintenance the ditch maintenance began with the start of the operation of the ecological ditch system we removed suspended solid waste such as plastic bags and litter from the settlement unit each day the accumulated sediment was removed from the sediment tank and filtration unit every three months we renewed the materials in the filtration unit in the spring of every year different wetland plants require different maintenance methods for example we did not mow a tatarinowii because it is a perennial herb that grows throughout the year its height does not exceed 0 3 m in contrast we mowed c indica p heteroclada oliver and c palustris l every six months because of their large biomass the c indica was first mowed in march of each year while p heteroclada oliver and c palustris l were mowed first in may after mowing we promptly removed the plant litter to prevent the occurrence of secondary pollutants furthermore we promptly removed excess accumulated sediment from the vegetation ditches via dredging to prevent shortening of the hrt we also removed the accumulated sediment from the settlement and filtration units via dredging to avoid clogging the sediments dredged from the ecological ditch system were collected centrally and then exposed to the sun for three months to remove pathogens finally they were returned to the woodland soil moreover the control of plant diseases and pests is also very important 2 4 sampling and analysis five sampling points were set up along the course of the sewage water flow across the ecological ditch system table 1 the first to fifth sampling points were at the ecological ditch inlet edi settlement outlet seo falling water outlet fwo filtration system outlet fso and wetland ditch outlet wdo respectively surface water samples were collected from the six sampling points in the ecological ditch system twice monthly from january to december 2016 using 5 sulfuric acid washed plastic bottles 500 m l that were pre rinsed with deionized water three water sample replicates were simultaneously collected at each sampling point and stored in clean polyethylene bottles in an ice packed chamber 4 c before analysis we monitored the water discharge at the inlet of the ecological ditch using a rectangular weir the water levels in the weir were recorded using an auto water level probe odyssey new zealand at 10 min intervals finally we calculated the hydraulic flow rates using the velocity and cross sectional area we immediately filtered all water samples 0 45 µm in the laboratory filtrates were automatically pumped into a aa3 autoanalyzer bran luebbe gmbh norderstedt germany using flow injection analysis technology to determine the nitrate no3 n ammonium nh4 n and dissolved phosphorus po4 p concentrations zhu et al 2009 we determined the tn and tp concentrations of the unfiltered samples using ultraviolet uv visible vis spectrophotometry with alkaline potassium persulfate digestion and mo sb colorimetry with potassium persulfate digestion respectively xie and wang 1998 the total dissolved nitrogen tdn and total dissolved phosphorus tdp concentrations of the filtered samples were determined using uv vis spectrophotometry with alkaline potassium persulfate digestion on the filtered sample and mo sb colorimetry with potassium persulfate digestion xie and wang 1998 we calculated the particulate nitrogen pn concentrations using the tn and tdn difference and followed the same method for particulate phosphorus pp concentrations we measured certain physicochemical parameters of the ditchwater in situ such as the ph temperature t and dissolved oxygen do content using a portable multi parameter water quality analyzer hach sension united states of america we determined the organic matter chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations of the unfiltered samples using uv vis spectrophotometric and potassium dichromate digestion xie and wang 1998 the rainfall was measured using a rain gauge r13 vaisala finland above ground dry biomass of harvested plant was measured via oven drying method at 70 c xie and wang 1998 2 5 data analysis we calculated the nutrient removal efficiency using two common wetland system approaches kadlec and knight 1996 liu et al 2015 first we calculated the concentration removal efficiency e using eq 1 where c in and c out are the inflow and outflow concentrations of the nutrients mg l 1 in ditchwater respectively 1 e c in c out c in 100 we calculated the area adjusted contaminant removal rate g m 2 d 1 using eq 2 2 r a q a c in c out where a is the wetland area m2 c in is the inlet concentration mg l 1 c out is the outlet concentration mg l 1 q is the flow rate m3 and r a is the area adjusted contaminant removal rate g m 2 d 1 statistical analyses were conducted using the spss 19 software package spss chicago the variance and mean separations were analyzed using the general linear model procedure of spss 19 the lsd procedure and contrasts with a probability level of 0 05 were used to identify significant differences between the treatment means the standard deviations were calculated using excel 2010 3 results 3 1 wastewater characterization of domestic sewage the physicochemical characteristics of domestic sewage are presented in table 2 the hydraulic load values range from 31 to 562 m3 d 1 with an average of 118 m3 d 1 the ph values range from 6 7 to 9 1 with an average of 7 6 the do values range from 1 16 to 4 42 mg l 1 with an average of 2 88 mg l 1 and the cod values range from 71 29 to 640 00 mg l 1 with an average of 151 54 mg l 1 these results suggest that the physicochemical characteristics of domestic sewage are highly variable nitrogen and phosphorous forms and concentrations of domestic sewage samples were measured and listed in table 2 the average concentrations of tn pn no3 n and nh4 n in domestic sewage are 29 97 5 87 1 48 and 21 99 mg l 1 respectively the main nitrogen species in domestic sewage is nh4 n the average concentrations of tp pp and po4 p in the ecological ditch inflow are 1 93 0 79 and 1 01 mg l 1 respectively table 2 the main phosphorous species in domestic sewage is po4 p 3 2 nutrient removal efficiency of the ecological ditch system table 3 shows the removal efficiencies and rates of nutrients of the ecological ditch system over the monitoring period we observed high n and p removal efficiencies in the ecological ditch system the average cod tn pn nh4 n no3 n tp pp and po4 p removal efficiencies are 77 05 47 97 76 20 44 63 43 23 49 79 66 49 and 58 85 respectively furthermore the average cod tn pn nh4 n no3 n tp pp and po4 p removal rates are 43 32 3 19 1 46 2 50 0 24 0 28 0 22 and 0 18 g m 2 d 1 respectively the average do concentrations at different sampling points are shown in fig 4 the average do concentration at the system s inlet is 2 88 mg l the average concentration at the outlet of the sediment unit is 1 20 mg l higher after the falling water the average do concentration at the outlet of the aeration unit increases by 3 29 mg l this suggests that the falling water could effectively increase the do concentration before the domestic sewage wastewater enters the wetlands 3 3 nutrient removal in different pilot units the average removal efficiencies and rates of domestic sewage of each pilot unit are shown in table 4 the cod removal efficiencies of the four units range from 18 21 to 50 60 the nitrogen removal efficiencies range from 7 97 to 30 82 for tn and from 9 03 to 19 59 for nh4 n the average phosphorus removal efficiencies for tp and po4 p range from 6 13 to 33 53 and 7 87 to 39 00 respectively significant differences were observed between the pilot units the highest removal efficiencies are achieved by unit u4 except for pn for which the highest removal efficiency was observed in unit u1 fig 2 the removal rates achieved by different pilot units also significantly differ the highest rates are observed in unit u3 we conclude that unit u4 is the major contributor to the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from domestic sewage via the ecological ditch furthermore the nutrient removal efficiencies from domestic sewage via the ecological ditch could be greatly increased by increasing the size of unit u3 3 4 seasonal variation of the nutrient removal efficiency table 5 shows the seasonal variation of the nutrient removal efficiencies between the different seasons the highest tn and nh4 n removal efficiencies were observed in autumn while the highest pn and no3 n removal efficiencies were observed in summer table 5 in contrast the highest tp and pp removal efficiencies were observed in spring while the highest po4 p removal efficiency was observed in summer furthermore the lowest removal efficiencies of nitrogen and phosphorus were both observed in winter significant differences were detected for the four seasons p 0 05 the tn removal efficiencies in spring summer and winter are 17 78 29 49 and 55 51 lower than that measured in autumn respectively additionally the tp removal efficiencies in summer autumn and winter are 12 54 22 61 and 75 90 lower than that measured in spring respectively therefore it can be concluded that the nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies from domestic sewage via an ecological ditch could be influenced by a change in the season additionally improving the nutrient removal efficiencies in winter could be vital for the application of ecological ditches 3 5 removal efficiencies under different hydraulic loads the nutrient removal efficiencies under different hydraulic loads from may to december are shown in fig 5 the highest tn and nh4 n removal efficiencies are observed under the lowest hydraulic load hl1 while the lowest removal efficiencies are observed under the highest hydraulic load hl5 significant differences were observed between the removal efficiencies of tn and nh4 n and the hydraulic loads pearson correlation coefficients of 0 89 and 0 76 respectively p 0 05 were obtained in contrast to nitrogen significant differences were not determined between the other four hydraulic loads although the lowest removal efficiency of tp was observed under hl5 furthermore significant differences were observed between the five hydraulic loads lower po4 p removal efficiencies were observed under high hydraulic loads p 0 05 therefore it can be concluded that the nitrogen removal efficiencies of an ecological ditch depend on the hydraulic loads the nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies are generally lower under high hydraulic load conditions however the phosphorus removal efficiency is not affected by the hydraulic load when the hydraulic load is below 100 m3 d 1 4 discussion 4 1 factors impacting the treatment performance of the ecological ditch system in summary the domestic sewage in this township is a kind of high nutrient and oxygen demanding pollutants which originates restaurant wastewater residential sewage and household wastewater it is representative in the upper stream of the yangtze river in china 80 of tn concentrations and 50 of tp concentrations in the domestic sewage are higher than the requirements for discharge from urban waste water treatment plants by the government of china gb 18918 2002 tn 15 mg l 1 tp 1 mg l 1 while 80 of tn concentrations and 35 of tp concentrations in the domestic sewage are higher than the requirements for discharge from urban waste water treatment plants by the european commission european commission 1991 tn 15 mg l 1 tp 2 mg l 1 therefore it must be treated before it could be discharge into received water the average tn and tp removal efficiencies of the ecological ditch system obtained in this study are similar to those of other systems used for the treatment of wastewater which were reported by other studies for example yin et al 2008 reported removal efficiencies of 48 for tn and 61 for tp in vegetated ditches in the hilly area of southwest china zhang et al 2016 observed removal efficiencies of 51 for tn for vegetated ditches in the hilly area of central china this suggests that the ecological ditch system effectively treats domestic sewage wastewater with high cod tn and tp concentrations however the nutrient removal efficiencies of the ecological ditch system exhibit a significant seasonal variation ranging from 14 84 to 84 24 for tn and 13 93 86 22 for tp the lowest nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies were observed during winter chen et al 2015 also reported that the removal efficiencies are higher during warmer months than during cooler months and that they are highly sensitive to temperature in this study we observed the highest tn and nh4 n removal efficiencies in the autumn this can be explained by two factors temperature and hydraulic flow rate wang et al 2012 postila et al 2015 nitrogen was mostly removed via denitrification in vegetated ditches soana et al 2018 the peak of the denitrification in the vegetated ditch was observed in autumn at a temperature of 16 c de klein 2008 which is similar to the temperature in autumn in this study however denitrification in the vegetated ditch is not only usually temperature dependant but also other factors may affect the process i e nitrate and organic carbon availability vegetation growth stage affecting on the other hand the hydraulic flow rates in summer were also higher than those in autumn due to higher precipitation fig 3 the high flow rates reduce the wastewater hrt in the ecological ditch leading to low n removal efficiency rates in summer therefore the higher tn and nh4 n removal efficiencies can be attributed to the higher denitrification rate and hrt in autumn in contrast to nitrogen we observed the highest tp removal efficiencies in spring because we renewed the filtration materials in spring hydrologic variables such as the hlr and hrt are critical parameters for the sustainable operation of vegetated drainage ditches kumwimba et al 2018 li et al 2016 reported that the n removal increases because the plants and weirs in vegetated ditches slow down the water flow and extend the hrt soana et al 2017 observed high removal efficiencies of nutrients when the discharge was the lowest and the hrt was the highest in vegetated ditches castaldelli et al 2018 found that the removal of no3 via denitrification in vegetated sediments was strongly influenced by the flow conditions these authors concluded that the removal efficiencies of nutrients were affected by hydrologic variables in this study the nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies are generally lower under high hydraulic loads fig 5 however in contrast to the removal efficiency based on the concentration the highest removal loads of tn and tp are observed under the highest hydraulic loads fig 6 this suggests that the hydraulic load plays a much greater role in the nutrient removal load than the removal efficiency based on the concentration under high hydraulic loads although the effect of the seasonal change and hlr on the nutrient removal is discussed in this study the pollutant removal efficiency via an ecological ditch system could depend on several other factors such as weirs wetland plants substrate materials maintenance and pollutant concentrations meyer et al 2013 lucke et al 2015 kumwimba et al 2018 nitrogen transformation processes in the sediment such as denitrification could be responsible for the removal of n from the water kumwimba et al 2018 the p release under anoxic conditions is attributed to the sediment release of those nutrients to the water collins et al 2016 substrate materials in the sediment such as clay and organic matter play a huge role in trapping p from the water column during the winter season liu et al 2015 wetland plants play an important role in the nutrient removal of ecological wetland ditches because they do not only uptake nutrients but also directly alter the concentrations of nutrients do ph and organic carbon in the ditchwater through uptake and release carpenter 1986 weisner 1994 körner 1999 soana et al 2017 moreover lower inflow concentrations lead to higher phosphorus removal efficiencies over time based on the sorption capacity of the material tondera 2017 however these factors are not isolated they are connected by complex biogeochemical processes that occur in ditches future studies must focus on the combined effects of these factors on the nutrient concentrations in ditches located in the hilly area of the central sichuan basin efforts should be made to increase the nutrient removal efficiency through the application of ecological ditches in this area the application of ecological ditches for domestic sewage treatment might be limited because other factors affect the removal process such as the population economic activity soil composition and structure kumwimba et al 2018 based on this study the ecological ditch system cannot be used for the domestic effluent treatment if the population in the town is above 2000 people in addition the system cannot be used if there are industrial effluents in the township 4 2 optimization and management of the ecological ditch system the ecological ditch system is a special and more complex vegetated ditch ecosystem with multiple treatment units that uses more diverse natural and engineered processes than conventional vegetated ditches for agricultural drainage treatment the ecological ditch system also differs from cws such as reed beds or other engineered wetlands compared with cws the vegetated ditches in the system are intentionally filled with soil and sediment instead of gravel or other substrates the ecological ditch system could be considered as a type of enforced vegetated ditch to avoid the toxicity of wastewater for plants and improve the nutrient removal capacity under highly variable hlr in this study the treatment technologies used to enhance the self purification capacity of the vegetated ditches include sedimentation u1 aeration u2 and a filter basin u3 each unit uses specific treatment processes and has different treatment functions although we observed high n and p removal efficiencies in the ecological ditch system inevitable problems still need to be addressed such as lower nutrient removal efficiencies in winter and fluctuating nutrient removal efficiencies caused by highly varying hydraulic flow rates therefore the design must be optimized to improve the efficiency of the ecological ditch system improving the nutrient removal efficiency rates in winter is the most difficult challenge in optimizing the ecological ditch system we suggest that using cold hardy wetland plants in ecological ditches is critical to achieve high nutrient removal efficiency rates during winter additionally the nutrient removal efficiency can be increased if the domestic sewage is pretreated using physical and or chemical processes during winter tondera 2017 another challenge of the ecological ditch system is the development of a method to consistently handle the varying hydraulic flow rate which makes the use of an ecological ditch system with natural treatment methods unfavorable for treating domestic sewage one of the most economical and ecological solution might involve vertical flow cws fonder et al 2013 tao et al 2014 van de moortel et al 2009 compared surface and vertical flow wetlands for combined sewage treatment and found that vertical flow wetlands have lower effluent concentrations umble et al 2000 found that deep vertical flow wetland enhances the removal of nitrogen and allows phosphate adsorption vertical flow cws were the key treatment element of the ecological ditch system in this study and higher nutrient removal rates were achieved than in vegetated ditch wetlands u4 this suggests that the nutrient removal efficiency can be improved by increasing the scale of u3 however single stage cws cannot achieve high nitrogen removal rates because they cannot simultaneously provide aerobic and anaerobic conditions vymazal 2007 therefore vegetated ditches should be combined to utilize the specific advantages of individual cws the long term operation of vegetated ditches still faces much risk of failure due to poor maintenance kumwimba et al 2018 the ecological ditch system is no exception for example clogging caused by sediment accumulation is a key issue that impedes the operation of ecological ditch systems based on several studies ditch sediments from agricultural fields can be used to control the export of phosphorus in headwater catchments and serve as sorbents for water with high levels of p zhu et al 2012 however excess sediments will affect the performance of the filtration section furthermore the bed of the ecological wetland ditch rises due to the excessive accumulation of sediment in wetland ditches which could lead to a decline in the hrt and damage adjacent farmland therefore it is necessary to regularly remove excess sediment that has accumulated in the ecological ditch system in this study the accumulated sediment in the system was regularly managed for three months including dredging and renewing these measures ensure the sustainable operation of the ecological ditch system based on many studies harvesting of above ground biomass is an effective practice to improve the water quality of eutrophic ecosystems by removing nutrients assimilated and stored in plant tissue ruiz et al 2010 wang et al 2014 if the plants are not regularly harvested dissolved nutrient is taken up by the plants but remains in the system tondera 2017 in different with these studies soana et al 2018 found that vegetation harvesting would only result in little n removal but would negatively affect the denitrification in the vegetated ditches throughout the growing season therefore they recommended a more conservative management of vegetation including the postponement of mowing to the end of winter just before the start of the new growing season kumwimba et al 2017 a b found that the amounts of nitrogen and phosphorous uptake by the plant body were affected significantly by biomass for example c indica has the very larger total biomass 4176 48 g than other plants the mean n and p uptake in the whole plant body of c indica was 1 10 g m 2 d 1 and 0 11 g m 2 d 1 respectively kumwimba et al 2017a b in this study the average tn and tp removal rates of the system are 3 19 g m 2 d 1 and 0 28 g m 2 d 1 respectively so it could be concluded that the uptake of plants with high biomass such as c indica t dealbata and p heteroclada oliver could result in large nutrient removal in the ecological ditch system therefore regular mowing of the c indica and p heteroclada oliver is recommended for the management of ecological ditch system to prevent the release of nutrients from the decomposed plant into the ditch water moreover excessive plant growth is not conducive during flood events and could accelerate the sediment accumulation in ecological wetland ditches in this study 5 conclusions this study explores an effective technology to prevent the nutrient pollutant loads of domestic sewage from entering the receiving water in hilly areas we constructed an ecological ditch system to remove the nutrients from domestic sewage with high nutrient concentrations the results indicate that the ecological ditch removes significant amounts of n and p from domestic sewage the average tn removal efficiency and rate are 47 97 and 3 19 g m 2 d 1 respectively similarly the average tp removal efficiency and rate are 49 79 and 0 28 g m 2 d 1 respectively the nutrient removal efficiency exhibits a significant seasonal variation and is sensitive to the temperature and hydraulic load the nutrient removal efficiencies in spring and autumn are higher than those of other months due to the warm temperatures and low flow rates our results indicate that using ecological ditches to treat water containing high concentrations of nutrients from domestic sewage could be applied locally and in areas of similar topography however the nutrient removal capacity is limited to maintain high nutrient removal rates in the future the dynamic management of this system is required based on our results the screening of cold hardy wetland plants increase of filtration scale regular mowing and sediment management are recommended for the use of ecological ditch system acknowledgements this study was jointly supported by the key lab of mountain surface process and ecological regulation and the national key research plan of china no 2017yfd0800105 and the hundred talents program of the chinese academy of sciences 
6741,domestic sewage is a key source of surface water pollution in rural areas of developing countries especially in china where a large amount of highly concentrated nutrients is directly discharged into the receiving waters therefore in this study a set of ecological ditch systems was designed to remove nutrients from rural domestic sewage in the hilly area of the central sichuan basin china the results show that the total nitrogen tn removal efficiencies range from 14 87 to 84 24 with an average of 47 97 and the total phosphorus tp removal efficiencies range from 13 93 to 86 22 with an average of 49 79 the highest daily tn and tp removal rates are 13 06 and 1 30 g m 2 d 1 respectively and the average removal rates are 3 19 g m 2 d 1 for tn and 0 28 g m 2 d 1 for tp our results indicate that the ecological ditch system to treat rural domestic sewage with high nutrient concentrations can be used in the study area or areas with similar topography furthermore we found that the nutrient removal efficiencies exhibit considerable seasonal variations and are sensitive to the hydraulic flow rates the nutrient removal capacity of the ecological ditch system is therefore somewhat limited based on our findings the use of winter hardy wetland plants and increase of the size of the filter unit are recommended to make the ecological ditch system more efficient and maintain high nutrient removal rates year round furthermore we suggest that regular mowing of plants and the removal of accumulated sediment are necessary to manage the ecological ditch system keywords ecological ditch domestic sewage wastewater treatment nitrogen phosphorus 1 introduction eutrophication of rivers or lakes due to excess nitrogen and phosphorus has become a major environmental concern in recent years wang et al 2016 domestic sewage is considered to be a major pollution source in rural areas of developing countries zhang et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 tran et al 2015 lutterbeck et al 2017 in such areas with a less developed infrastructure for wastewater treatment in which wastewater is not treated domestic sewage containing high levels of substances such as nitrogen phosphorus and pathogens is often directly discharged from open drainage ditches to nearby water bodies zou et al 2012 moeder et al 2017 this has caused the eutrophication of the surrounding surface water in developing countries especially in china wang et al 2017 kumwimba et al 2018 therefore the identification of suitable domestic sewage treatment approaches in these rural areas especially nitrogen and phosphorus removal has become an urgent issue qiu 2011 wang et al 2016 song et al 2018 many ecological engineering approaches have been developed to treat rural domestic sewage worldwide such as constructed wetlands cws retention ponds and subsurface filtration technologies elliott et al 2007 tixier et al 2011 anderson et al 2015 many studies have confirmed that pollutants in domestic sewage such as chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen phosphorus heavy metals and pathogens could be effectively removed by cws vymazal 2007 tang et al 2013 kadlec et al 2009 vymazal 2007 reviewed the nutrient removal mechanisms of various types of cws similarly retention ponds and subsurface filtration technology have also been confirmed to be effective methods to remove nutrients in rural areas winston et al 2013 anderson et al 2015 however the effectiveness of nutrient removal via these approaches is highly variable and depends on a range of factors such as the temperature discharge wetland plants and pollutants concentrations vymazal 2007 headley and tanner 2012 winston et al 2013 lucke et al 2015 in addition the pollutants accumulated in sediments filter materials and decaying wetland plants could be released and re enter receiving waters which may lead to the release of the retained nutrients thus becoming a source of nutrients of the water column semadeni davies 2006 hill et al 2012 jia et al 2015 kumwimba et al 2018 furthermore although all these approaches have significant advantages over typical wastewater treatment plants in terms of the nutrient removal and economic costs the land requirements for these approaches may be the most limiting factor to their application especially in hilly areas wu et al 2015 therefore it is challenge that how to reduce the land requirement for domestic sewage treatment via ecological engineering approaches in rural areas especially in hilly areas of developing countries vegetated ditches have become an increasingly popular approach to reducing the transport of nutrients derived from agricultural areas their popularity can be attributed to the smaller land requirements high nutrient removal rate and low construction and maintenance operation costs liu et al 2015 chen et al 2015 many studies have demonstrated that vegetated ditches can effectively remove nutrients leached from agricultural soils caused by fertilizer application matthew et al 2006 kröger et al 2007 smith et al 2010 moore et al 2011 tang et al 2013 vymazal et al 2018 kumwimba et al 2018 reviewed the design mechanism management strategies and future directions of the removal of non point source pollutants from agricultural runoff by vegetated drainage ditches the treatment measures for the removal of nitrogen from agricultural runoff in vegetated ditches depend on the self purifying mechanisms of natural water bodies such as aeration ammonia oxidation plant uptake sedimentation adsorption volatilization nitrification and denitrification tang et al 2013 vymazal et al 2018 the treatment measures for the removal of phosphorus from agricultural runoff in vegetated ditches depend on the plant uptake sedimentation and adsorption vymazal et al 2018 moreover maintenance practices are essential to sustain stable nutrient removal rates of vegetation ditches faust et al 2018 reviewed the effects of different agricultural ditch management practices on nutrients and sediment losses downstream in recent years vegetated ditches have also been successfully used to treat rural domestic sewage wastewaters kumwimba et al 2017a b bundschuh et al 2016 however there are still shortcomings when fully applying them to treat rural domestic sewage on one hand most plants in vegetated ditches do not easily survive for a long time under high cod and very low dissolved oxygen do concentrations saggaï et al 2017 on the other hand the nutrient removal capacity of vegetated ditches is limited due to high nutrient concentrations complex wastewater compositions and unstable flow rates kumwimba et al 2018 hydrologic variables should be considered as critical parameters for the management and to achieve a sustainable treatment performance kumwimba et al 2018 several studies have also demonstrated that the removal efficiencies of nutrients are related to the hydrologic variables li et al 2016 soana et al 2017 castaldelli et al 2018 however it is very difficult to improve the nutrient removal capacity via vegetated ditches under highly variable hydraulic loading rates hlr therefore reducing the toxicity of the wastewater for plants and increasing the nutrient removal capacity of vegetated ditches under highly variable hlr are becoming major future challenges for the sustainable long term operation of vegetated ditches that are used to treat rural domestic sewage in this study we designed and constructed an ecological ditch system consisting of a retention pond aeration filter basin and vegetated ditches to treat domestic sewage in a small township in the hilly area of the central sichuan basin china the objectives of this study were to i evaluate the performance of the ecological ditch system in treating domestic sewage from a rural township and ii analyze the nutrient removal capacity of the ecological ditch system under different environmental conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in a rural township in the sichuan province china 31 16 n 105 27 e the study site is located on top of a hill at an altitude ranging from 500 to 600 m in the central sichuan basin southwest china fig 1 the region experiences a moderate subtropical monsoon climate with an annual mean temperature of 17 3 c and annual mean precipitation of 826 mm most precipitation occurs from april to october zhu et al 2009 this township is a typical township in the region with an area of 1 26 ha and a stable population of approximately 500 inhabitants per square kilometer approximately 500 migrants enter this township for trading every two days the township was constructed on both sides of the main road that runs through it the hillside itself has a slope of 15 and the township is divided into a residential area 0 77 ha school 0 11 ha and road 0 38 ha luo et al 2012 approximately 30 150 m3 d 1 of sewage is produced daily approximately 0 86 4 31 kg n d 1 and 0 05 0 23 kg p d 1 is produced daily two covered concrete ditches one on either side of the road were constructed in this township both of which are used for rainfall and sewage drainage prior to this study this wastewater merged into one of the ditches and the storm runoff and sewage had not been separated into different systems additionally there is no sewage treatment facility or qualified slaughterhouse in this township all combined untreated sewage and runoff directly entered the drainage ditch and subsequently flowed into receiving water such as rivers 2 2 ecological ditch system design two ditches were designed and constructed adjacent to the domestic sewage collecting ditches one is an ecological ditch system designed to improve the water quality of domestic sewage generated by the township and the other is designed as a flood drain to separate the flood water sandstone was used to prevent damage to the ecological ditch system due to storm runoff as a rule domestic sewage was discharged into the ecological ditch system while the flood water was separated from sewage via a diversion dam and directed into the flood drain ditch the ecological ditch system is 308 0 m in length and has a maximum bottom width of 1 5 m minimum bottom width of 0 8 m and average depth of 0 6 m it was designed to maximize the utilization of natural processes and ecosystem functions of the drainage ditch the ditch is divided into four successive units a settlement unit u1 aeration unit u2 filtration unit u3 and vegetated ditches unit u4 fig 2 first the settlement unit u1 consists of several parts along the ecological ditch system and has a total length of 110 0 m one part was created for sediment settlement and solid waste disposal and has a length width and depth of 3 0 2 0 m and 1 m respectively fig 2 the second part was created to serve as biofilter pond it is filled with dry rice straw to increase the organic carbon concentration and has a length width and depth of 1 5 1 5 and 1 0 m respectively the third part is a concrete ditch in which hydrocotyle chinensis dunn craib and myriophyllum elatinoides gaudich were planted there was some sediment on the ditch bottom when hydrocotyle chinensis dunn craib and myriophyllum elatinoidesgaudich was planted the concrete ditch is 20 0 m long and 1 5 m wide and has a water level of 30 0 cm and a water width of 1 5 m a preprocessing pond was constructed before the falling water in the aeration unit the size pond is 2 0 2 0 and 1 0 m in length width and depth respectively a steep 70 slope with a height of 27 0 m and a vertical pebble bed on the top was used to aerate the falling water acorus tatarinowii was planted on the surface of the pebble bed to strengthen the aeration efficiency acorus tatarinowii has developed reticular roots reticular structure increases the exchange between water and air by increasing the surface area of water thus increasing the aeration efficiency next we constructed a filter basin that was 3 0 3 0 and 1 5 m in length width and depth to collect the falling aerated water the basin contains layers of filtration materials including sand gravel and carclazyte fig 2 each layer is approximately 10 0 cm thick a layer of bricks with a thickness of 6 0 cm was placed on top of the filter layers to prevent the system from clogging due to suspended sediment fig 2 a plastic mesh with an aperture of 1 0 mm was placed under the bricks finally we constructed 150 0 m long vegetated ditches with widths ranging from 1 0 to 1 5 m a series of weirs was used as water control structure to maintain a water level of 10 0 cm and water width of 1 0 m over the sediment the weirs were set apart at intervals of at least 30 0 m soil was used as substrate in the vegetated ditches before and after the weirs pebbles with a length of 1 0 m and a depth of 0 1 m were paved to weaken the soil erosion the purpose of these weirs was to delay the hydraulic retention time hrt the dominant wetland plants used were thalia dealbata t dealbata iris pseudacorus l i pseudacorus l canna indica c indica phyllostachys heteroclada oliver p heteroclada oliver acorus tatarinowii a tatarinowii rumex patientia r patientia and calla palustris l c palustris l we planted t dealbata p heteroclada oliver and i pseudacorus l in the first wetland surface flow ditch c indica and c palustris l in the second a tatarinowii in the third and t dealbata and r patientia in the fourth fig 2 2 3 ecological ditch system maintenance the ditch maintenance began with the start of the operation of the ecological ditch system we removed suspended solid waste such as plastic bags and litter from the settlement unit each day the accumulated sediment was removed from the sediment tank and filtration unit every three months we renewed the materials in the filtration unit in the spring of every year different wetland plants require different maintenance methods for example we did not mow a tatarinowii because it is a perennial herb that grows throughout the year its height does not exceed 0 3 m in contrast we mowed c indica p heteroclada oliver and c palustris l every six months because of their large biomass the c indica was first mowed in march of each year while p heteroclada oliver and c palustris l were mowed first in may after mowing we promptly removed the plant litter to prevent the occurrence of secondary pollutants furthermore we promptly removed excess accumulated sediment from the vegetation ditches via dredging to prevent shortening of the hrt we also removed the accumulated sediment from the settlement and filtration units via dredging to avoid clogging the sediments dredged from the ecological ditch system were collected centrally and then exposed to the sun for three months to remove pathogens finally they were returned to the woodland soil moreover the control of plant diseases and pests is also very important 2 4 sampling and analysis five sampling points were set up along the course of the sewage water flow across the ecological ditch system table 1 the first to fifth sampling points were at the ecological ditch inlet edi settlement outlet seo falling water outlet fwo filtration system outlet fso and wetland ditch outlet wdo respectively surface water samples were collected from the six sampling points in the ecological ditch system twice monthly from january to december 2016 using 5 sulfuric acid washed plastic bottles 500 m l that were pre rinsed with deionized water three water sample replicates were simultaneously collected at each sampling point and stored in clean polyethylene bottles in an ice packed chamber 4 c before analysis we monitored the water discharge at the inlet of the ecological ditch using a rectangular weir the water levels in the weir were recorded using an auto water level probe odyssey new zealand at 10 min intervals finally we calculated the hydraulic flow rates using the velocity and cross sectional area we immediately filtered all water samples 0 45 µm in the laboratory filtrates were automatically pumped into a aa3 autoanalyzer bran luebbe gmbh norderstedt germany using flow injection analysis technology to determine the nitrate no3 n ammonium nh4 n and dissolved phosphorus po4 p concentrations zhu et al 2009 we determined the tn and tp concentrations of the unfiltered samples using ultraviolet uv visible vis spectrophotometry with alkaline potassium persulfate digestion and mo sb colorimetry with potassium persulfate digestion respectively xie and wang 1998 the total dissolved nitrogen tdn and total dissolved phosphorus tdp concentrations of the filtered samples were determined using uv vis spectrophotometry with alkaline potassium persulfate digestion on the filtered sample and mo sb colorimetry with potassium persulfate digestion xie and wang 1998 we calculated the particulate nitrogen pn concentrations using the tn and tdn difference and followed the same method for particulate phosphorus pp concentrations we measured certain physicochemical parameters of the ditchwater in situ such as the ph temperature t and dissolved oxygen do content using a portable multi parameter water quality analyzer hach sension united states of america we determined the organic matter chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations of the unfiltered samples using uv vis spectrophotometric and potassium dichromate digestion xie and wang 1998 the rainfall was measured using a rain gauge r13 vaisala finland above ground dry biomass of harvested plant was measured via oven drying method at 70 c xie and wang 1998 2 5 data analysis we calculated the nutrient removal efficiency using two common wetland system approaches kadlec and knight 1996 liu et al 2015 first we calculated the concentration removal efficiency e using eq 1 where c in and c out are the inflow and outflow concentrations of the nutrients mg l 1 in ditchwater respectively 1 e c in c out c in 100 we calculated the area adjusted contaminant removal rate g m 2 d 1 using eq 2 2 r a q a c in c out where a is the wetland area m2 c in is the inlet concentration mg l 1 c out is the outlet concentration mg l 1 q is the flow rate m3 and r a is the area adjusted contaminant removal rate g m 2 d 1 statistical analyses were conducted using the spss 19 software package spss chicago the variance and mean separations were analyzed using the general linear model procedure of spss 19 the lsd procedure and contrasts with a probability level of 0 05 were used to identify significant differences between the treatment means the standard deviations were calculated using excel 2010 3 results 3 1 wastewater characterization of domestic sewage the physicochemical characteristics of domestic sewage are presented in table 2 the hydraulic load values range from 31 to 562 m3 d 1 with an average of 118 m3 d 1 the ph values range from 6 7 to 9 1 with an average of 7 6 the do values range from 1 16 to 4 42 mg l 1 with an average of 2 88 mg l 1 and the cod values range from 71 29 to 640 00 mg l 1 with an average of 151 54 mg l 1 these results suggest that the physicochemical characteristics of domestic sewage are highly variable nitrogen and phosphorous forms and concentrations of domestic sewage samples were measured and listed in table 2 the average concentrations of tn pn no3 n and nh4 n in domestic sewage are 29 97 5 87 1 48 and 21 99 mg l 1 respectively the main nitrogen species in domestic sewage is nh4 n the average concentrations of tp pp and po4 p in the ecological ditch inflow are 1 93 0 79 and 1 01 mg l 1 respectively table 2 the main phosphorous species in domestic sewage is po4 p 3 2 nutrient removal efficiency of the ecological ditch system table 3 shows the removal efficiencies and rates of nutrients of the ecological ditch system over the monitoring period we observed high n and p removal efficiencies in the ecological ditch system the average cod tn pn nh4 n no3 n tp pp and po4 p removal efficiencies are 77 05 47 97 76 20 44 63 43 23 49 79 66 49 and 58 85 respectively furthermore the average cod tn pn nh4 n no3 n tp pp and po4 p removal rates are 43 32 3 19 1 46 2 50 0 24 0 28 0 22 and 0 18 g m 2 d 1 respectively the average do concentrations at different sampling points are shown in fig 4 the average do concentration at the system s inlet is 2 88 mg l the average concentration at the outlet of the sediment unit is 1 20 mg l higher after the falling water the average do concentration at the outlet of the aeration unit increases by 3 29 mg l this suggests that the falling water could effectively increase the do concentration before the domestic sewage wastewater enters the wetlands 3 3 nutrient removal in different pilot units the average removal efficiencies and rates of domestic sewage of each pilot unit are shown in table 4 the cod removal efficiencies of the four units range from 18 21 to 50 60 the nitrogen removal efficiencies range from 7 97 to 30 82 for tn and from 9 03 to 19 59 for nh4 n the average phosphorus removal efficiencies for tp and po4 p range from 6 13 to 33 53 and 7 87 to 39 00 respectively significant differences were observed between the pilot units the highest removal efficiencies are achieved by unit u4 except for pn for which the highest removal efficiency was observed in unit u1 fig 2 the removal rates achieved by different pilot units also significantly differ the highest rates are observed in unit u3 we conclude that unit u4 is the major contributor to the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from domestic sewage via the ecological ditch furthermore the nutrient removal efficiencies from domestic sewage via the ecological ditch could be greatly increased by increasing the size of unit u3 3 4 seasonal variation of the nutrient removal efficiency table 5 shows the seasonal variation of the nutrient removal efficiencies between the different seasons the highest tn and nh4 n removal efficiencies were observed in autumn while the highest pn and no3 n removal efficiencies were observed in summer table 5 in contrast the highest tp and pp removal efficiencies were observed in spring while the highest po4 p removal efficiency was observed in summer furthermore the lowest removal efficiencies of nitrogen and phosphorus were both observed in winter significant differences were detected for the four seasons p 0 05 the tn removal efficiencies in spring summer and winter are 17 78 29 49 and 55 51 lower than that measured in autumn respectively additionally the tp removal efficiencies in summer autumn and winter are 12 54 22 61 and 75 90 lower than that measured in spring respectively therefore it can be concluded that the nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies from domestic sewage via an ecological ditch could be influenced by a change in the season additionally improving the nutrient removal efficiencies in winter could be vital for the application of ecological ditches 3 5 removal efficiencies under different hydraulic loads the nutrient removal efficiencies under different hydraulic loads from may to december are shown in fig 5 the highest tn and nh4 n removal efficiencies are observed under the lowest hydraulic load hl1 while the lowest removal efficiencies are observed under the highest hydraulic load hl5 significant differences were observed between the removal efficiencies of tn and nh4 n and the hydraulic loads pearson correlation coefficients of 0 89 and 0 76 respectively p 0 05 were obtained in contrast to nitrogen significant differences were not determined between the other four hydraulic loads although the lowest removal efficiency of tp was observed under hl5 furthermore significant differences were observed between the five hydraulic loads lower po4 p removal efficiencies were observed under high hydraulic loads p 0 05 therefore it can be concluded that the nitrogen removal efficiencies of an ecological ditch depend on the hydraulic loads the nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies are generally lower under high hydraulic load conditions however the phosphorus removal efficiency is not affected by the hydraulic load when the hydraulic load is below 100 m3 d 1 4 discussion 4 1 factors impacting the treatment performance of the ecological ditch system in summary the domestic sewage in this township is a kind of high nutrient and oxygen demanding pollutants which originates restaurant wastewater residential sewage and household wastewater it is representative in the upper stream of the yangtze river in china 80 of tn concentrations and 50 of tp concentrations in the domestic sewage are higher than the requirements for discharge from urban waste water treatment plants by the government of china gb 18918 2002 tn 15 mg l 1 tp 1 mg l 1 while 80 of tn concentrations and 35 of tp concentrations in the domestic sewage are higher than the requirements for discharge from urban waste water treatment plants by the european commission european commission 1991 tn 15 mg l 1 tp 2 mg l 1 therefore it must be treated before it could be discharge into received water the average tn and tp removal efficiencies of the ecological ditch system obtained in this study are similar to those of other systems used for the treatment of wastewater which were reported by other studies for example yin et al 2008 reported removal efficiencies of 48 for tn and 61 for tp in vegetated ditches in the hilly area of southwest china zhang et al 2016 observed removal efficiencies of 51 for tn for vegetated ditches in the hilly area of central china this suggests that the ecological ditch system effectively treats domestic sewage wastewater with high cod tn and tp concentrations however the nutrient removal efficiencies of the ecological ditch system exhibit a significant seasonal variation ranging from 14 84 to 84 24 for tn and 13 93 86 22 for tp the lowest nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies were observed during winter chen et al 2015 also reported that the removal efficiencies are higher during warmer months than during cooler months and that they are highly sensitive to temperature in this study we observed the highest tn and nh4 n removal efficiencies in the autumn this can be explained by two factors temperature and hydraulic flow rate wang et al 2012 postila et al 2015 nitrogen was mostly removed via denitrification in vegetated ditches soana et al 2018 the peak of the denitrification in the vegetated ditch was observed in autumn at a temperature of 16 c de klein 2008 which is similar to the temperature in autumn in this study however denitrification in the vegetated ditch is not only usually temperature dependant but also other factors may affect the process i e nitrate and organic carbon availability vegetation growth stage affecting on the other hand the hydraulic flow rates in summer were also higher than those in autumn due to higher precipitation fig 3 the high flow rates reduce the wastewater hrt in the ecological ditch leading to low n removal efficiency rates in summer therefore the higher tn and nh4 n removal efficiencies can be attributed to the higher denitrification rate and hrt in autumn in contrast to nitrogen we observed the highest tp removal efficiencies in spring because we renewed the filtration materials in spring hydrologic variables such as the hlr and hrt are critical parameters for the sustainable operation of vegetated drainage ditches kumwimba et al 2018 li et al 2016 reported that the n removal increases because the plants and weirs in vegetated ditches slow down the water flow and extend the hrt soana et al 2017 observed high removal efficiencies of nutrients when the discharge was the lowest and the hrt was the highest in vegetated ditches castaldelli et al 2018 found that the removal of no3 via denitrification in vegetated sediments was strongly influenced by the flow conditions these authors concluded that the removal efficiencies of nutrients were affected by hydrologic variables in this study the nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies are generally lower under high hydraulic loads fig 5 however in contrast to the removal efficiency based on the concentration the highest removal loads of tn and tp are observed under the highest hydraulic loads fig 6 this suggests that the hydraulic load plays a much greater role in the nutrient removal load than the removal efficiency based on the concentration under high hydraulic loads although the effect of the seasonal change and hlr on the nutrient removal is discussed in this study the pollutant removal efficiency via an ecological ditch system could depend on several other factors such as weirs wetland plants substrate materials maintenance and pollutant concentrations meyer et al 2013 lucke et al 2015 kumwimba et al 2018 nitrogen transformation processes in the sediment such as denitrification could be responsible for the removal of n from the water kumwimba et al 2018 the p release under anoxic conditions is attributed to the sediment release of those nutrients to the water collins et al 2016 substrate materials in the sediment such as clay and organic matter play a huge role in trapping p from the water column during the winter season liu et al 2015 wetland plants play an important role in the nutrient removal of ecological wetland ditches because they do not only uptake nutrients but also directly alter the concentrations of nutrients do ph and organic carbon in the ditchwater through uptake and release carpenter 1986 weisner 1994 körner 1999 soana et al 2017 moreover lower inflow concentrations lead to higher phosphorus removal efficiencies over time based on the sorption capacity of the material tondera 2017 however these factors are not isolated they are connected by complex biogeochemical processes that occur in ditches future studies must focus on the combined effects of these factors on the nutrient concentrations in ditches located in the hilly area of the central sichuan basin efforts should be made to increase the nutrient removal efficiency through the application of ecological ditches in this area the application of ecological ditches for domestic sewage treatment might be limited because other factors affect the removal process such as the population economic activity soil composition and structure kumwimba et al 2018 based on this study the ecological ditch system cannot be used for the domestic effluent treatment if the population in the town is above 2000 people in addition the system cannot be used if there are industrial effluents in the township 4 2 optimization and management of the ecological ditch system the ecological ditch system is a special and more complex vegetated ditch ecosystem with multiple treatment units that uses more diverse natural and engineered processes than conventional vegetated ditches for agricultural drainage treatment the ecological ditch system also differs from cws such as reed beds or other engineered wetlands compared with cws the vegetated ditches in the system are intentionally filled with soil and sediment instead of gravel or other substrates the ecological ditch system could be considered as a type of enforced vegetated ditch to avoid the toxicity of wastewater for plants and improve the nutrient removal capacity under highly variable hlr in this study the treatment technologies used to enhance the self purification capacity of the vegetated ditches include sedimentation u1 aeration u2 and a filter basin u3 each unit uses specific treatment processes and has different treatment functions although we observed high n and p removal efficiencies in the ecological ditch system inevitable problems still need to be addressed such as lower nutrient removal efficiencies in winter and fluctuating nutrient removal efficiencies caused by highly varying hydraulic flow rates therefore the design must be optimized to improve the efficiency of the ecological ditch system improving the nutrient removal efficiency rates in winter is the most difficult challenge in optimizing the ecological ditch system we suggest that using cold hardy wetland plants in ecological ditches is critical to achieve high nutrient removal efficiency rates during winter additionally the nutrient removal efficiency can be increased if the domestic sewage is pretreated using physical and or chemical processes during winter tondera 2017 another challenge of the ecological ditch system is the development of a method to consistently handle the varying hydraulic flow rate which makes the use of an ecological ditch system with natural treatment methods unfavorable for treating domestic sewage one of the most economical and ecological solution might involve vertical flow cws fonder et al 2013 tao et al 2014 van de moortel et al 2009 compared surface and vertical flow wetlands for combined sewage treatment and found that vertical flow wetlands have lower effluent concentrations umble et al 2000 found that deep vertical flow wetland enhances the removal of nitrogen and allows phosphate adsorption vertical flow cws were the key treatment element of the ecological ditch system in this study and higher nutrient removal rates were achieved than in vegetated ditch wetlands u4 this suggests that the nutrient removal efficiency can be improved by increasing the scale of u3 however single stage cws cannot achieve high nitrogen removal rates because they cannot simultaneously provide aerobic and anaerobic conditions vymazal 2007 therefore vegetated ditches should be combined to utilize the specific advantages of individual cws the long term operation of vegetated ditches still faces much risk of failure due to poor maintenance kumwimba et al 2018 the ecological ditch system is no exception for example clogging caused by sediment accumulation is a key issue that impedes the operation of ecological ditch systems based on several studies ditch sediments from agricultural fields can be used to control the export of phosphorus in headwater catchments and serve as sorbents for water with high levels of p zhu et al 2012 however excess sediments will affect the performance of the filtration section furthermore the bed of the ecological wetland ditch rises due to the excessive accumulation of sediment in wetland ditches which could lead to a decline in the hrt and damage adjacent farmland therefore it is necessary to regularly remove excess sediment that has accumulated in the ecological ditch system in this study the accumulated sediment in the system was regularly managed for three months including dredging and renewing these measures ensure the sustainable operation of the ecological ditch system based on many studies harvesting of above ground biomass is an effective practice to improve the water quality of eutrophic ecosystems by removing nutrients assimilated and stored in plant tissue ruiz et al 2010 wang et al 2014 if the plants are not regularly harvested dissolved nutrient is taken up by the plants but remains in the system tondera 2017 in different with these studies soana et al 2018 found that vegetation harvesting would only result in little n removal but would negatively affect the denitrification in the vegetated ditches throughout the growing season therefore they recommended a more conservative management of vegetation including the postponement of mowing to the end of winter just before the start of the new growing season kumwimba et al 2017 a b found that the amounts of nitrogen and phosphorous uptake by the plant body were affected significantly by biomass for example c indica has the very larger total biomass 4176 48 g than other plants the mean n and p uptake in the whole plant body of c indica was 1 10 g m 2 d 1 and 0 11 g m 2 d 1 respectively kumwimba et al 2017a b in this study the average tn and tp removal rates of the system are 3 19 g m 2 d 1 and 0 28 g m 2 d 1 respectively so it could be concluded that the uptake of plants with high biomass such as c indica t dealbata and p heteroclada oliver could result in large nutrient removal in the ecological ditch system therefore regular mowing of the c indica and p heteroclada oliver is recommended for the management of ecological ditch system to prevent the release of nutrients from the decomposed plant into the ditch water moreover excessive plant growth is not conducive during flood events and could accelerate the sediment accumulation in ecological wetland ditches in this study 5 conclusions this study explores an effective technology to prevent the nutrient pollutant loads of domestic sewage from entering the receiving water in hilly areas we constructed an ecological ditch system to remove the nutrients from domestic sewage with high nutrient concentrations the results indicate that the ecological ditch removes significant amounts of n and p from domestic sewage the average tn removal efficiency and rate are 47 97 and 3 19 g m 2 d 1 respectively similarly the average tp removal efficiency and rate are 49 79 and 0 28 g m 2 d 1 respectively the nutrient removal efficiency exhibits a significant seasonal variation and is sensitive to the temperature and hydraulic load the nutrient removal efficiencies in spring and autumn are higher than those of other months due to the warm temperatures and low flow rates our results indicate that using ecological ditches to treat water containing high concentrations of nutrients from domestic sewage could be applied locally and in areas of similar topography however the nutrient removal capacity is limited to maintain high nutrient removal rates in the future the dynamic management of this system is required based on our results the screening of cold hardy wetland plants increase of filtration scale regular mowing and sediment management are recommended for the use of ecological ditch system acknowledgements this study was jointly supported by the key lab of mountain surface process and ecological regulation and

system bumgarner et al 2012 chowdhury et al 2004 lafave and sharp 1987 land and veni 2018 sharp 2001 drought and growing demand for water resources in the area has raised questions about how spring discharge and salinity may change in response to these demands between 2000 and 2017 the portion of the chihuahuan desert where the springs occur experienced drought conditions extending over at least 80 of the watershed during 9 of 17 years lower pecos huc 130700 national drought mitigation center et al accessed february 2018 during four of those nine years severe to exceptional drought conditions persisted across 80 of the watershed historically the response to regional drought conditions has been to increase reliance on groundwater for agricultural domestic and industrial needs ewing et al 2008 2012 anaya and jones 2009 this has likely driven declines in spring flow and water quality ashworth et al 1997 sharp et al 2003 texas parks and wildlife department staff 2005 drought in the region is sensitive to teleconnections with remote sea surface temperature patterns particularly those accompanying the pattern of cool sea surface temperatures across the equatorial pacific known as la niña contributing to the severe drought seen during 2011 seager and hoerling 2014 patten et al 2008 forecasts under future climate scenarios indicate a continued drying trend for the region seager et al 2007 seager et al 2013 cook et al 2015 this suggests the potential to limit groundwater supplies through decreased recharge and increased reliance on groundwater resources compounding these challenges to sustainable groundwater development and conservation of groundwater dependent ecosystems in the region is the expansion in drilling of unconventional oil and gas resources in the delaware basin part of the larger permian basin where hydrocarbon extraction utilizing hydraulic fracturing will require large volumes of water apache 2016a b olson and ailworth 2016 scanlon et al 2017 bubenik 2016 the objective of this study is to delineate areas where local recharge may occur and quantify the response time between precipitation events and spring discharge complicating this delineation is that most precipitation in the region results from mesoscale convective precipitation with large spatial variability in intensity and duration over small distances when combined with the karst nature of the spring flow system land and veni 2018 uliana et al 2007 the result is the potential for high spatial and temporal variability in recharge thus there is a need to explore local and regional groundwater flow paths in this complex to better understand the springs and implications for the associated groundwater dependent ecosystems 2 site description the trans pecos region is located in far west texas usa extending east to west from the pecos river to the city of el paso and north to south from the texas new mexico border to the rio grande and is part of the basin and

2016a b olson and ailworth 2016 anthropogenic stresses on groundwater supplies in the region are well documented water levels in portions of the pecos alluvial aquifer declined noticeably between 1940 and 1990 due to intense groundwater extraction lafave and sharp 1987 anaya and jones 2009 pumping of the edwards trinity plateau aquifer in pecos county for irrigation starting in mid 1900s is correlated with the drying of leon and comanche springs near fort stockton tx sharp et al 2003 additionally flow from san solomon spring and phantom lake spring balmorhea system declined from the 1940 s to the 1990 s likely due to a combination of groundwater abstraction for irrigation and regional climatic shifts ashworth et al 1997 texas parks and wildlife department staff 2005 flow at phantom lake spring ceased in 2001 leading to u s bureau of reclamation staff installing a pump in order to maintain aquatic habitats for federally protected species san solomon spring continues to flow it is at a lower elevation than phantom lake spring and was excavated to 25 ft 6 7 m below the ground surface in the 1930 s as a part of a works project by the civilian conservation corps texas parks and wildlife department 2018a b depending on where and how much groundwater abstraction occurs for agricultural energy livestock and domestic uses there is a possibility that spring discharge may decline additionally groundwater dependent species in the region have adapted to relatively consistent temperature and salinity ranges if the inputs of fresh water from local recharge as well as flows from the regional aquifer system decline groundwater flows to springs could be reduced potentially leading to loss of habitats and possibly federally protected species in addition to declines in agricultural productivity loss of recreational and tourist revenue and potentially reduced water supplies for the energy industry 3 previous research 3 1 differentiation of local and regional spring flow topography permeability and aquifer thickness control the formation of local intermediate and regional groundwater flow paths tóth 1970 local and regional components of spring flow can be differentiated by examining physical and geochemical characteristics such as specific conductance temperature turbidity isotopes major ion chemistry and discharge jones et al 2017 lafave and sharp 1987 land and veni 2018 maxey and mifflin 1966 springer et al 2017 generally groundwater discharging from local flow paths is fresher more turbid and has a temperature reflective of the air temperature at recharge while groundwater discharging from regional flow paths often has higher total dissolved solids less turbidity and a temperature reflective of long term climatic averages or slightly elevated due to geothermal influence these differences can be pronounced in dual or triple porosity systems such as karst which tend to display rapid responses to storm events hess and white

estimation identification of convective storms flood prediction streamflow forecasting and groundwater recharge fulton et al 1998 young et al 2000 glenn et al 2001 latif and hantush 2006 williamson et al 2009 healy 2010 seo et al 2010 kitzmiller et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 2017 common meteorological applications operationally include forecasts or post analysis of flash flooding smith et al 2005 and incorporation into hydrological prediction mcenery et al 2005 however there are limitations to approaches using nexrad especially for derived precipitation estimates including beam range related issues for example when the radar beam does not sample sufficient depth of clouds to make accurate estimations at close proximity or when precipitation is distant from the radar and clouds occur below the minimal scan height smith et al 1996 there are also limitations in the empirical calibration used to derive precipitation amounts such that correction using gauge data into synthesized products for quantitative precipitation estimation can produce a superior estimation compared to either the radar or rainfall gauges used independently e g the advanced hydrological precipitation system ahps mcenery et al 2005 or the multi radar multi sensor archive zhang et al 2015 computational improvements have meant that considerable historical records of these precipitation products at high spatial and temporal fidelity have become available providing long term hydroclimate monitoring nexrad applications for groundwater recharge estimation became more commonplace as distributed hydrologic models came to prominence the dataset has a spatial resolution 4 km 4 km that cannot be matched by precipitation gauge density in most catchments young et al 2000 moreno and vieux 2013 studies examining karst systems frequently use nexrad data for high resolution precipitation inputs over discrete and discontinuous recharge zones glenn et al 2001 moreno and vieux 2013 and others and these data have been successfully used in analyzing cross correlation and spatial correlation between precipitation and spring flow response in karst systems budge and sharp 2009 4 methods this study focused on san

anecdotal observations indicate that the springs are fed by a combination of regional and local flow systems uliana and sharp 2001 in order to characterize the local components of groundwater flow the investigation combined in situ monitoring of water quality parameters ph specific conductance turbidity and temperature with ahps corrected aggregate nexrad reflectivity and regional daily precipitation for the period between april 2011 and march 2012 4 1 field deployment an in situ troll 9000 with pressure ph specific conductance temperature and turbidity probes was deployed at the base of san solomon springs pool balmorhea state park texas usa where groundwater discharges through the sand gravel bed the sensor recorded measurements at 15 minute intervals from april 2011 to february 2012 and at 5 minute intervals from february through mid march 2012 the equipment was retrieved and recalibrated on a monthly bi monthly basis throughout its deployment the ph sensor was calibrated using a 2 point calibration curve ph 7 and ph 10 the conductivity sensor was calibrated for fresh to brackish water 1412 µs cm and the turbidity sensor was calibrated with 1 point calibration 10ntu all standards were national institute of standards and technology nist traceable and purchased from the sensor manufacturer 4 2 other datasets national weather service nws cooperative observer program coop records from four stations logging daily precipitation ft davis kent mt locke and balmorhea were obtained from the national centers for environmental information ncei for the period april 2011 and march 2012 noaa national centers for environmental information 2017 these data were used as a first order identification of precipitation events over the region to mitigate potential spatial variations in precipitation estimates that can arise in regions with topographical variations and sparse observation networks ahps derived multi sensor quantitative precipitation estimates seo and breidenbach 2002 mcenery et al 2005 were obtained for the period of interest each day from february 1 2011 to march 31 2012 these data combine multiple sensors to yield more accurate precipitation estimates than estimates produced using a single sensor i e radar only gauge only the resulting output blends both the quality controlled gauge observation network and nexrad radar derived precipitation estimates using the relationship between scattered reflectivity and rainfall to produce a 24 hour analyzed rainfall period between 12utc to 12utc on each day 6 am to 6 am 4x4 km daily analysis over the continental united states noaa 2017 4 3 analysis of meteorological data to ensure all precipitation events were identified goes 13 infrared and visible band satellite data and raw nexrad radar data were assessed for all days between february 2011 and march 2012 daily single polarity nexrad data from midland with potential precipitation from the nws big data project noaa 1991 was scrutinized to identify the period of precipitation the positioning of the region relative to the nearest radar in midland texas produces an elevated base level scan of the radar beam which at 130 miles from the radar site scans the volume 2575 6250 m above ground level over mt locke 2070 masl and higher over surrounding lower terrain this can lead to underestimation of precipitation amounts as averaging across a wide radar beam width can lead to low beam averaged returns in addition to non detection of shallow water bearing clouds below this altitude to offset this limitation satellite data and ahps data were reviewed to identify significant precipitation events that were potentially not detected by radar precipitation was included when it occurred over any one or more of pecos reeves jeff davis culberson presidio and brewster counties in all cases ahps or radar identify an event when significant precipitation occurred the only non agreement between ahps and the gauge data was consistent with trace measurements at the daily precipitation sites this analysis also revealed errors within the mt locke record which had 50 days of precipitation during the period with many trace events several minor events were also recorded that did not match with nearby fort davis the frequency contrasted the three other stations containing between 15 and 35 days of precipitation examining the radar data for each mt locke indicated event identified that the region in question has limited rainfall on many of these dates and the matching satellite data identified that a number of the measurements occurred on days when no cloud was present in light of this of this potentially errant data events detected using mt locke were discarded the cross validation procedure identified that precipitation records from the other three stations were accurate events with trace precipitation but no significant cloud cover over the region were discarded from the set prior to analysis snowfall is also not a relevant factor for the region with little accumulation leading to minimal melt runoff due to uncertainties in the spring discharge dataset for daily aggregations of rainfall mesoscale precipitation events were consolidated into single events if they occurred on consecutive days trace events 0 254 mm or 0 01 in were discarded as these amounts of precipitation most often evaporate from the surface environment outside of the gauge cross correlation analysis was performed between the specific conductance data and dates with ahps accumulated daily precipitation for varying lag leads of up to 100 days prior to streamflow for each 4 km grid over the period july march reflecting the continuous available record analysis for lags of this duration is consistent with theoretically hypothesized recharge periods of 0 5 114 days based on permeability estimates of the edwards trinity plateau aquifer bumgarner et al 2012 correlations and lags were only retained when associated with p values of 0 01 4 4 analysis of spring data the logging equipment experienced power supply interruptions and memory malfunctions which resulted in partial losses of water quality data during the period of record once between 5 28 2011 and 6 8 2011 11 days and again between 6 25 2011 and 8 27 2011 62 days five storm events occurred leading up to or during the data gaps however three of these had minimal accumulation which would not have resulted in spring response only two major events were missed june 1 7 2011 and july 11 15 2011 fig 2 a and e and the record does capture spring response to another 15 events during the period of record base event differentiations and lag response analysis are based on these data the missing data are displayed as gaps and represent a loss of 18 of the total record april 2011 march 2012 the ph sensor displayed noticeable drift throughout the period of record despite frequent re calibration and the variability of ph readings between calibrations 0 1 0 2 ph units were on the order of sensor accuracy 0 1 ph units therefore the ph data were not used in the analysis to differentiate base conditions from event conditions e g hypothesized response to storms histograms fig s2 of temperature specific conductance and turbidity were created using the long term in situ monitoring data each variable was plotted versus the expected normal probability distribution function fig s2 large deviations from the normal distribution at the tails were interpreted as spring response to inputs by local or intermediate groundwater flowpaths local groundwater flow is often fresher and more turbid with a temperature reflective of the precipitation event that generated the recharge than regional groundwater flow brune and besse 2002 uliana et al 2007 identification of an inflection point p value and change in slope at the tails were used differentiate event conditions from the expected random distribution of measurements observations at or beyond the p value p inflection for variables where event flow results in higher measurements e g turbidity p inflection for variables where event flow results in lower measurements e g specific conductance were identified as event conditions 5 results 5 1 precipitation in the lead up to the period of analysis conditions over the region and more broadly west texas were accompanied by a declared extreme to exceptional drought that began during march 2011 national drought mitigation center et al accessed february 2018 these levels of drought are characterized by extremely low percentiles of streamflow below the 5th percentile modeled soil moisture below the 5th percentile and extremely low standardized precipitation anomalies this pattern persisted throughout the summer months reflecting the most severe period of drought over the region in the monitoring record since maps were first issued in 2000 until large precipitation events in late august and september fig 2 in close vicinity of the davis mountains this precipitation reduced drought conditions to severe to mostly extreme levels for the remainder of the analysis period while the region more broadly was characterized by exceptional drought almost all events generating significant rainfall accumulations identified were associated with non organized or organized and long lived convective storms that initiated over the davis mountains fig 2 assessment of ahps precipitation revealed that precipitation at the observational sites was not the only precipitation to fall over the basin suggesting caution is necessary when considering solely gauge data for assessing connections to regional flow systems maximum frequency of non trace rainfall days over the region was 35 days over the mountains these data consolidated into 21 mesoscale rainfall periods of one or more days of consecutive rainfall during the full period with 20 of these events occurring between june 1 2011 and march 31 2012 fig 2 suggesting a summer dominated rainfall pattern during the drought year with many of these events reflecting protracted periods of as many as ten days the isolated cellular nature of many convective rainfall events is reflected by the limited number of high precipitation grid points and the individual paths of storms where locally intense precipitation extends over a straight line following prevailing winds this leads to a dataset of precipitation events that when aggregated can appear to be somewhat spatially disparate in several cases weak prevailing winds led to slow motion of convective storms resulting in extremely localized high precipitation totals the largest single day rainfall total was 100 125 mm over the mountains and occurred on june 1 2011 although other accumulated multi day events produced equivalent volumes of precipitation over the same region e g fig 2h peak rainfall accumulations over the region are unsurprisingly well correlated with the highest topography and igneous geological features fig 4 with accumulated precipitation over the record of 200 250 mm over the davis mountains to the southwest of the springs 5 2 san solomon spring discharge water levels in san solomon springs pool as determined by barometric corrected pressure from the troll 9000 were maintained at relatively constant levels within 3 ft of capacity throughout the monitoring period with the exception of 5 11 5 17 during this period the pool was partially drained for annual maintenance and cleaning no storm event response was anticipated during this time period so the draining of the pool had no effect on our analysis the 3 foot variation in water level observed during the remainder of the monitoring period occurred on the time scales of weeks and represents a fluctuation of approximately 1 2 million gallons of water san solomon springs discharges approximately 15 million gallons of water per day therefore the slight variations in water level of the pool are assumed to have minimal effect on mixing conditions and water quality monitoring the spring temperature record deviated significantly from a normal probability distribution throughout the range of collected data fig s2 we infer the cause was the low resolution 0 1 c of the thermistor because deviation could not be clearly derived by examining the probability distribution we did not assign temperature an inflection point p value to differentiate base from event conditions there is a clear inflection point in the turbidity data pval 0 9995 however upon closer analysis of the data it appears that all of these measurements were collected on a single day in february 2012 this may be due to maintenance work in the pool algal blooms sensor interference or an event response producing extremely turbid discharge another inflection point is visible at pval 0 9 that may represent event conditions however we elected not to analyze this in favor of selecting the most conservative approach for differentiating base and event conditions as the turbidity record may be affected by external factors e g swimmers scuba divers and pool maintenance a clear inflection point was also identified in the specific conductance record pval 0 0015 differentiating the record using this value yielded 43measurements recorded during 26 days multiple measurements captured the falling and rising limbs of inferred event responses for several n 8 of the observed events during base flow conditions in 2011 2012 i e spring discharge is not influenced by precipitation the mean specific conductance of water discharging from san solomon springs was 3450 μs cm se 0 3 2210 ppm tds this is higher than the values measured in grab samples and synoptic surveys from previous research 3200 μs cm uliana et al 2007 and specific conductance had an apparent increasing trend over the monitoring period we infer that the extended drought conditions occurring between 2010 and 2012 drove the elevated mean value and increasing trend with significantly lower than average precipitation local flow paths provided less recharge to dilute the more saline regional component of groundwater leading to the observed increase in specific conductance over the monitoring period there was a degree of observed sensor drift between re calibration periods however this magnitude of drift was generally small 50 μs cm fig s2 mean turbidity during base conditions was 1 5 fnu se 0 01 the mean temperature of discharging water during base conditions was 24 8 c se 0 01 deviations from mean temperature tended to occur more frequently and last for longer periods than deviations from mean specific conductance or turbidity the cause of this deviation may be a result of sensor resolution or other compounding factors e g thermal conduction in the pool from the analysis of the deviations from normal probability distribution 26 days of event flow were identified in the specific conductance record fig 3 fig s2 other dips in specific conductance are observable in the record however they were not included in the analysis because the aim for the first cut identification was to be conservative with the differentiation between base and event flow dips in specific conductance tend to have associated spikes in turbidity and fluctuations in temperature fig 2 this is consistent with the anticipated system behavior where event flow should provide an influx of fresher more turbid and cooler water uliana and sharp 2001 the largest dip in specific conductance observed in the record was to 2299 µs cm on september 3 2011 18 of the 26 event days recorded minimum specific conductance values of 3100 µs cm event flow response from san solomon springs was rapid during the study period none of the identified responses altered specific conductance values for longer than 2 5 h based on the inflection point probability distribution function identification method with the available data it is unclear whether this is characteristic of event flow at this spring or if an unusual response occurred in 2011 2012 due to drought conditions based on synoptic measurements of discharge the average flow at san solomon spring is approximately 13 000 gal min 0 86 m3 s heitmuller and reece 2003 so the volume of recharge from a local precipitation event would need to be sizable in order to alter the specific conductance of the discharging water for an extended period of time visual analysis of the time series where dates of non trace precipitation events at the three coop stations ft davis kent balmorhea were compared to dates of event flow response dips in specific conductance at the spring yielded a median lag of 43 days fig 3a with a maximum lag of 50 and a minimum lag of 30 days this range does not represent an absolute value for travel time a limited dataset collected in a drought year complicates the calculation of a lead lag correlation based solely on precipitation at weather stations and spring response additionally the specific conductance record indicates a multi modal response which we infer is dependent on scale and timing of precipitation events and antecedent moisture conditions this could significantly alter estimates of travel time for local flow 5 3 correlation of spatial precipitation and spring response cross correlations over the region of interest fig 4d illustrate a significant p 0 01 positive relationship between the daily signal for rainfall magnitude and the aggregated daily spring event flow with values of specific conductance below 3300 µs cm while significant positive correlation occurs across the domain this is likely a result of the widespread convective storms producing heavy rainfall on the same days as those in the hypothesized contributing and recharge zones fig 2 the gridded precipitation data are relatively granular 4 km resolution compared to the local variability in topography and geology however despite this limitation the analysis capture patterns consistent with recharge features a substantial portion of the davis mountains within the same huc 8 watershed as san solomon spring was strongly correlated 0 4 0 6 with event flow fig 4 box i this area overlaps several of the major drainage channels that empty to alluvial fans at the mountain front and onto outcrops of edwards trinity cretaceous bedrock direct precipitation and or runoff onto bedrock outcrops on the basin floor may also create recharge fig 4 box ii though based on this dataset diffuse infiltration through the alluvium does not appear to be a major source of recharge this could be a result of antecedent moisture conditions drought or natural system behavior a longer dataset that captures the range of precipitation and antecedent moisture conditions is necessary to determine whether diffuse recharge plays a major role in local flow also of note is the area with strong correlation 0 3 0 6 between the davis and apache mountains fig 4 box iii where another large outcrop of cretaceous bedrock is present it is located in an adjacent watershed that according to topography should flow north northeast and bypass the springs instead these analyses indicate that flow over this outcrop is a potential source of local recharge to san solomon spring this is consistent with the hypothesized areas through which regional flow moves within the system uliana and sharp 2001 uliana et al 2007 where outcrops to these formations occur it is possible that they can act as conduits of both local and regional flow spatial distribution of moving average lag lead periodicity between mesoscale precipitation events and response flow provided a less noisy record centered on the principle lag relationship and is consistent with the visual analysis derived lag estimates fig 5 period of flow from the strongly correlated regions in boxes i and iii reveals spatially varying values of approximately 30 45 days over both the alluvial fans and edwards trinity bedrock and over the catchment region associated with cretaceous bedrock between the apache and davis mountains fig 4b box iii while positive correlations are identified to the south and southeast of san solomon springs these two systems reflect flow that likely is directed down gradient towards ft stockton and reflect a spatial region where precipitation days were often coincident with precipitation over the catchments described above this type of signal is not unsurprising given the relatively small number of samples contained in the dataset a preliminary analysis of the time series of individual grid box cross correlations to the spring discharge series was indicative of multi modal behavior in both lag and correlation i e one storm event may drive a staggered set of spring responses because of differing travels times for each local flow path this suggests that flowpaths of varying length may contribute to the overall discharge and lead to a range of lags within a given catchment or between different catchments while such features certainly merit future investigation the statistical limitations of the current dataset precludes any such analysis within this study furthermore the nature of the responses seen here may reflect characteristics unique to periods with low antecedent moisture conditions 6 discussion the analysis presented here illustrates that san solomon spring discharge is modulated by local flow derived from mesoscale precipitation events over recharge or contributing zones the local flow system appears to have a regular periodicity of arrival with a lag period of 30 45 days and strong statistically significant p 0 01 correlations to monitored specific conductance rainfall intensity location and antecedent moisture conditions appear to alter lag times back of the envelope estimates of travel time in this system yield an anticipated travel time of 0 5 114 days from the hypothesized recharge zones to san solomon springs using estimates of edwards trinity permeability from bumgarner et al 2012 not including time for infiltration through the unsaturated zone or overlying alluvium this is consistent with the observed correlations and with estimates of travel time and permeability in other similar regional karst systems halihan et al 1999 while the lag analysis does allow us to identify the dominant signal of the relationship between rainfall and subsequent spring discharge there are likely variations that exist due to varying magnitudes of precipitation and the underlying system base state for example the significant drought period that coincided with measurements over the region led to potentially abnormal antecedent moisture conditions which may have an effect on the characteristic lag period of the spring response other relevant factors include seasonality and whether events are intense isolated or protracted however the length and sampling period of the existing dataset make these features difficult to analyze suggesting the need for further observations there has been one event response documented at san solomon spring prior to this research on november 1 1990 a synoptic survey of water quality at the spring captured a sample with a specific conductance value of 1 298 µs cm texas water development board accessed july 2017 this was attributed to storm event influence on spring discharge uliana and sharp 2001 and is substantially larger than any that were observed over the course of this study maximum deviation was to 2300 µs cm fig 4 non trace rainfall was recorded at the ft davis kent and balmorhea weather stations on 9 15 1990 9 22 1990 and again on 10 1 1990 10 3 1990 these were the only non trace events in the 75 days preceding the observed spring response comparing precipitation event timing to spring response provides a lag of 30 47 days which is consistent with the results described in herein a significant advantage in this analysis is the use of ahps precipitation and the meteorological conditions to identify the occurrence of precipitation events rather than gauges in order to identify spatial granularity in rainfall distribution and intensity and co locate these characteristics with geological formations that have the potential to serve as recharge zones for local flow uliana et al 2007 however challenges exist in the relative proximity of nexrad radar sites to systems of interest in capturing rainfall particularly for shallower non convective systems it is also unclear as to whether the 15 minute spring monitoring interval used over most of the course of this study was of sufficient temporal resolution to capture maximum excursions from the mean or associated rising or falling limbs a sampling interval of 5 min captured more of the rising falling response february march 2012 data fig 4 however the drain on the battery life of the equipment was rapid enough 2 weeks that a 5 minute interval is not practical for remote monitoring modifications of the sampling protocol evolving technologies or an external power supply could provide solutions to these challenges and enable collection over a longer period of record and a wider range of hydrologic and meteorological conditions the predominance of precipitation cases driven by summer convective rainfall suggests that a comparatively short period of observations during and following the summer months would allow a better understanding of the influence of these systems on discharge from san solomon springs ideally such sampling would involve both a similar drought or dry period and a more normal or wetter year to investigate the potential implications of antecedent moisture focused sampling for additional parameters such as stable isotopes during storm event response and baseflow conditions springer et al 2017 combined with continuous monitoring of spring discharge and a detailed survey for karst features within the hypothesized recharge zones would help to refine this approach jones et al 2018 obtaining this type of dataset would provide a context to potentially allow for predictability for changes in subsequent streamflow discharge following mesoscale precipitation events more broadly this approach illustrates that careful analysis of rainfall context is needed for monitoring intrusion of other flows into aquifers 7 conclusions san solomon springs is characteristic of aridland springs and groundwater dependent ecosystems in the trans pecos region while most of the spring discharge results from a documented regional flow system they also contain a significant component of local flow system water in this study analysis indicates that the lag time between precipitation event and spring response is 30 45 days with an average of 43 days likely recharge zones for the local flow system includes alluvial fans and outcrops of cretaceous bedrock edwards trinity plateau aquifer furthermore recharge to the local flow system appears to cross watershed surface water divides indicating that strategies applied to protect sensitive habitat will have to span outside of traditionally acknowledged management boundaries currently the limitations of the dataset generated by this study preclude a more generalized prediction of spring response particularly as it relates to non drought periods and changes to precipitation extent and intensity however it does serve as a proof of concept for the application of this method to an extended dataset this suggests the need for additional monitoring of the spring system to better understand recharge zones and flow paths and to inform strategies for habitat and groundwater management environmental implications of these results are also notable as issues of concern for groundwater dependent aquatic and terrestrial species include maintaining spring flows and water quality i e salinity and temperatures which over the period of this study showed the influence of continual drought in terms of increasing salinity threats to the system from groundwater abstraction drought and climate change are ongoing unless properly managed expanding drilling for unconventional oil and gas resources in the delaware basin along with associated groundwater development for hydraulic fracturing water needs has the potential to increase vulnerability of groundwater dependent ecosystems as a result of reduce spring flow and or water quality adversely affect habitats for species of conservation interest and potentially reduce regional groundwater water supplies aridland springs in texas and around the world are facing threats to water supply and water quality from drought increased abstraction and climate change characterization of flow paths recharge and

6742,aridland springs maintain groundwater dependent habitats for aquatic and terrestrial species san solomon spring texas usa is part of a regional karst spring complex in the chihuahuan desert that supports several species of federal and state conservation interest however drought climatic variability and groundwater abstraction threaten discharge and water quality in the surrounding delaware basin expansion in unconventional oil and gas development using hydraulic fracturing may increase demands on aquifers that also provide flows to the springs a critical knowledge gap limiting habitat conservation and sustainable groundwater abstraction is that the flow system is not well understood while the source of most spring discharge is from a pleistocene recharged regional flow system evidence suggests that a modern local flow component provides fresh water influx however the exact sources mechanisms and timing of localized recharge are unknown to address these questions this study combined long term in situ spring water quality monitoring specific conductance turbidity and temperature data with weather station corrected 4 km gridded precipitation data to quantify the lag response at san solomon springs to mesoscale storm events and to delineate potential local recharge zones between april 2011 and march 2012 26 event flow responses were documented with an average lag

distributed precipitation indicated zones of potential local recharge in the mountain block mountain front zones and alluvial channels issuing from the davis mountains some local flow paths appear to

discharge and salinity may change in response to these demands between 2000 and 2017 the portion of the chihuahuan desert where the springs occur experienced drought conditions extending over at least 80 of the watershed during 9 of 17 years lower pecos huc 130700 national drought mitigation center et al accessed february 2018 during four of those nine years severe to exceptional drought conditions persisted across 80 of the watershed historically the response to regional drought conditions has been to increase reliance on groundwater for agricultural domestic and industrial needs ewing et al 2008 2012 anaya and jones 2009 this has likely driven declines in spring flow and water quality ashworth et al 1997 sharp et al 2003 texas parks and wildlife department staff 2005 drought in the region is sensitive to teleconnections with remote sea surface temperature patterns particularly those accompanying the pattern of cool sea surface temperatures across the equatorial pacific known as

et al 2007 seager et al 2013 cook et al 2015 this suggests the potential to limit groundwater supplies through decreased recharge and increased reliance on groundwater resources compounding these challenges to sustainable groundwater development and conservation of groundwater dependent ecosystems in the region is the expansion in drilling of unconventional oil and gas resources in the delaware basin part of the larger permian basin where hydrocarbon extraction utilizing hydraulic fracturing will require large volumes of water apache 2016a b olson and ailworth 2016 scanlon et al 2017 bubenik 2016 the objective of this study is to delineate areas where local recharge may occur and quantify the response time between precipitation events and spring discharge complicating this delineation is that most precipitation in the region results from mesoscale convective precipitation with large spatial variability in intensity and duration over small distances when combined with the karst nature of the spring flow system land and veni 2018 uliana et al 2007 the result is the potential for high spatial and temporal variability in recharge thus there is a need to explore local and regional groundwater flow paths in this complex to better understand the springs and implications for the associated groundwater dependent ecosystems 2 site description the trans pecos region is

correlated with the drying of leon and comanche springs near fort stockton tx sharp et al 2003 additionally flow from san solomon spring and phantom lake spring balmorhea system declined from the 1940

at a lower elevation than phantom lake spring and was excavated to 25 ft 6 7 m below the ground surface in the 1930 s as a part of a works project by the civilian conservation corps texas parks and wildlife department 2018a b depending on where and how much groundwater abstraction occurs for agricultural energy livestock and domestic uses there is a possibility that spring discharge may decline additionally groundwater dependent species in the region have adapted to relatively consistent temperature and salinity ranges if the inputs of fresh water from local recharge as well as flows from the regional aquifer system decline groundwater flows to springs could be reduced potentially leading to loss of habitats and possibly federally protected species in addition to declines in agricultural productivity loss of recreational and tourist revenue and potentially reduced water supplies for the energy industry 3 previous research 3 1 differentiation of local and regional spring flow topography permeability and aquifer thickness control the formation of local intermediate and regional groundwater flow paths tóth 1970 local and regional components of spring flow can be differentiated by examining physical and geochemical characteristics such as specific conductance temperature turbidity isotopes major ion chemistry and discharge jones et al 2017 lafave and sharp 1987 land and veni 2018 maxey and mifflin 1966 springer et al 2017 generally groundwater discharging from local flow paths is fresher more turbid and has a temperature reflective of the air temperature at recharge while groundwater discharging from regional flow paths often has higher total dissolved solids less turbidity and a temperature reflective of long term climatic averages or slightly elevated due to geothermal influence these differences can be pronounced in dual or triple porosity systems such as karst which tend to display rapid responses to storm events hess and white 1988 ryan and meiman 1996 halihan and wicks 1998 desmarais and rojstaczer 2002 winston and criss 2004 this pattern has occurred at san solomon springs with observations of turbid fresh discharge at

2003 uliana and sharp 2001 uliana et al 2007 while the local component is recognized to exist we are aware of no previously published research that has delineated local recharge zones or identified the timing of spring response 3 2 nexrad advanced hydrological precipitation system ahps the nexrad dataset has multiple applications in the field of hydrology and meteorology including precipitation estimation identification of convective storms flood prediction streamflow forecasting and groundwater recharge fulton et al 1998 young et al 2000 glenn et al 2001 latif and hantush 2006 williamson et al 2009 healy 2010 seo et al 2010 kitzmiller et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 2017 common meteorological applications operationally include forecasts or post analysis of flash flooding smith et al 2005 and incorporation into hydrological prediction mcenery et al 2005 however there are limitations to approaches using nexrad especially for derived precipitation estimates including beam range related issues for example when the radar beam does not sample sufficient depth of clouds to make accurate estimations at close proximity or when precipitation is distant from the radar and clouds occur below the minimal scan height smith et al 1996 there are also limitations in the empirical calibration used to derive precipitation amounts such that correction using gauge data into synthesized products for quantitative precipitation estimation can produce a superior estimation compared to either the radar or rainfall gauges used independently e g the advanced hydrological precipitation system ahps mcenery et al 2005 or the multi radar multi sensor archive zhang et al 2015 computational improvements have meant that considerable historical records of these precipitation products at high spatial and temporal fidelity have become available providing long term hydroclimate monitoring nexrad applications for groundwater recharge estimation became more commonplace as distributed hydrologic models came to prominence the dataset has a spatial resolution 4 km 4 km that cannot be matched by precipitation gauge density in most catchments young et al 2000 moreno and vieux 2013 studies examining karst systems frequently use nexrad data for high resolution precipitation inputs over discrete and discontinuous recharge zones glenn et al 2001 moreno and vieux 2013 and others and these data have been successfully used in analyzing cross correlation and spatial correlation between precipitation and spring flow response in karst systems budge and sharp 2009 4 methods this study focused on san

anecdotal observations indicate that the springs are fed by a combination of regional and local flow systems uliana and sharp 2001 in order to characterize the local components of groundwater flow the investigation combined in situ monitoring of water quality parameters ph specific conductance turbidity and temperature with ahps corrected aggregate nexrad reflectivity and regional daily precipitation for the period between april 2011 and march 2012 4 1 field deployment an in situ troll 9000 with pressure ph specific conductance temperature and turbidity probes was deployed at the base of san solomon springs pool balmorhea state park texas usa where groundwater discharges through the sand gravel bed the sensor recorded measurements at 15 minute intervals from april 2011 to february 2012 and at 5 minute intervals from february through mid march 2012 the equipment was retrieved and recalibrated on a monthly bi monthly basis throughout its deployment the ph sensor was calibrated using a 2 point calibration curve ph 7 and ph 10 the conductivity sensor was calibrated for fresh to brackish water 1412 µs cm and the turbidity sensor was calibrated with 1 point calibration 10ntu all standards were national institute of standards and technology nist traceable and purchased from the sensor manufacturer 4 2 other datasets national weather service nws cooperative observer program coop records from four stations logging daily precipitation ft davis kent mt locke and balmorhea were obtained from the national centers for environmental information ncei for the period april 2011 and march 2012 noaa national centers for environmental information 2017 these data were used as a first order identification of precipitation events over the region to mitigate potential spatial variations in precipitation estimates that can arise in regions with topographical variations and sparse observation networks ahps derived multi sensor quantitative precipitation estimates seo and breidenbach 2002 mcenery et al 2005 were obtained for the period of interest each day from february 1 2011 to march 31 2012 these data combine multiple sensors to yield more accurate precipitation estimates than estimates produced using a single sensor i e radar only gauge only the resulting output blends both the quality controlled gauge observation network and nexrad radar derived precipitation estimates using the relationship between scattered reflectivity and rainfall to produce a 24 hour analyzed rainfall period between 12utc to 12utc on each day 6 am to 6 am 4x4 km daily analysis over the continental united states noaa 2017 4 3 analysis of meteorological data to ensure all precipitation events were identified goes 13 infrared and visible band satellite data and raw nexrad radar data were assessed for all days between february 2011 and march 2012 daily single polarity nexrad data from midland with potential precipitation from the nws big data project noaa 1991 was scrutinized to identify the period of precipitation the positioning of the region relative to the nearest radar in midland texas produces an elevated base level scan of the radar beam which at 130 miles from the radar site scans the volume 2575 6250 m above ground level over mt locke 2070 masl and higher over surrounding lower terrain this can lead to underestimation of precipitation amounts as averaging across a wide radar beam width can lead to low beam averaged returns in addition to non detection of shallow water bearing clouds below this altitude to offset this limitation satellite data and ahps data were reviewed to identify significant precipitation events that were potentially not detected by radar precipitation was included when it occurred over any one or more of pecos reeves jeff davis culberson presidio and brewster counties in all cases ahps or radar identify an event when significant precipitation occurred the only non agreement between ahps and the gauge data was consistent with trace measurements at the daily precipitation sites this analysis also revealed errors within the mt locke record which had 50 days of precipitation during the period with many trace events several minor events were also recorded that did not match with nearby fort davis the frequency contrasted the three other stations containing between 15 and 35 days of precipitation examining the radar data for each mt locke indicated event identified that the region in question has limited rainfall on many of these dates and the matching satellite data identified that a number of the measurements occurred on days when no cloud was present in light of this of this potentially errant data events detected using mt locke were discarded the cross validation procedure identified that precipitation records from the other three stations were accurate events with trace precipitation but no significant cloud cover over the region were discarded from the set prior to analysis snowfall is also not a relevant factor for the region with little accumulation leading to minimal melt runoff due to uncertainties in the spring discharge dataset for daily aggregations of rainfall mesoscale precipitation events were consolidated into single events if they occurred on consecutive days trace events 0 254 mm or 0 01 in were discarded as these amounts of precipitation most often evaporate from the surface environment outside of the gauge cross correlation analysis was performed between the specific conductance data and dates with ahps accumulated daily precipitation for varying lag leads of up to 100 days prior to streamflow for each 4 km grid over the period july march reflecting the continuous available record analysis for lags of this duration is consistent with theoretically hypothesized recharge periods of 0 5 114 days based on permeability estimates of the edwards trinity plateau aquifer bumgarner et al 2012 correlations and lags were only retained when associated with p values of 0 01 4 4 analysis of spring data the logging equipment experienced power supply interruptions and memory malfunctions which resulted in partial losses of water quality data during the period of record once between 5 28 2011 and 6 8 2011 11 days and again between 6 25 2011 and 8 27 2011 62 days five storm events occurred leading up to or during the data gaps however three of these had minimal accumulation which would not have resulted in spring response only two major events were missed june 1 7 2011 and july 11 15 2011 fig 2 a and e and the record does capture spring response to another 15 events during the period of record base event differentiations and lag response analysis are based on these data the missing data are displayed as gaps and represent a loss of 18 of the total record april 2011 march 2012 the ph sensor displayed noticeable drift throughout the period of record despite frequent re calibration and the variability of ph readings between calibrations 0 1 0 2 ph units were on the order of sensor accuracy 0 1 ph units therefore the ph data were not used in the analysis to differentiate base conditions from event conditions e g hypothesized response to storms histograms fig s2 of temperature specific conductance and turbidity were created using the long term in situ monitoring data each variable was plotted versus the expected normal probability distribution function fig s2 large deviations from the normal distribution at the tails were interpreted as spring response to inputs by local or intermediate groundwater flowpaths local groundwater flow is often fresher and more turbid with a temperature reflective of the precipitation event that generated the recharge than regional groundwater flow brune and besse 2002 uliana et al 2007 identification of an inflection point p value and change in slope at the tails were used differentiate event conditions from the expected random distribution of measurements observations at or beyond the p value p inflection for variables where event flow results in higher measurements e g turbidity p inflection for variables where event flow results in lower measurements e g specific conductance were identified as event conditions 5 results 5 1 precipitation in the lead up to the period of analysis conditions over the region and more broadly west texas were accompanied by a declared extreme to exceptional drought that began during march 2011 national drought mitigation center et al accessed february 2018 these levels of drought are characterized by extremely low percentiles of streamflow below the 5th percentile modeled soil moisture below the 5th percentile and extremely low standardized precipitation anomalies this pattern persisted throughout the summer months reflecting the most severe period of drought over the region in the monitoring record since maps were first issued in 2000 until large precipitation events in late august and september fig 2 in close vicinity of the davis mountains this precipitation reduced drought conditions to severe to mostly extreme levels for the remainder of the analysis period while the region more broadly was characterized by exceptional drought almost all events generating significant rainfall accumulations identified were associated with non organized or organized and long lived convective storms that initiated over the davis mountains fig 2 assessment of ahps precipitation revealed that precipitation at the observational sites was not the only precipitation to fall over the basin suggesting caution is necessary when considering solely gauge data for assessing connections to regional flow systems maximum frequency of non trace rainfall days over the region was 35 days over the mountains these data consolidated into 21 mesoscale rainfall periods of one or more days of consecutive rainfall during the full period with 20 of these events occurring between june 1 2011 and march 31 2012 fig 2 suggesting a summer dominated rainfall pattern during the drought year with many of these events reflecting protracted periods of as many as ten days the isolated cellular nature of many convective rainfall events is reflected by the limited number of high precipitation grid points and the individual paths of storms where locally intense precipitation extends over a straight line following prevailing winds this leads to a dataset of precipitation events that when aggregated can appear to be somewhat spatially disparate in several cases weak prevailing winds led to slow motion of convective storms resulting in extremely localized high precipitation totals the largest single day rainfall total was 100 125 mm over the mountains and occurred on june 1 2011 although other accumulated multi day events produced equivalent volumes of precipitation over the same region e g fig 2h peak rainfall accumulations over the region are unsurprisingly well correlated with the highest topography and igneous geological features fig 4 with accumulated precipitation over the record of 200 250 mm over the davis mountains to the southwest of the springs 5 2 san solomon spring discharge water levels in san solomon springs pool as determined by barometric corrected pressure from the troll 9000 were maintained at relatively constant levels within 3 ft of capacity throughout the monitoring period with the exception of 5 11 5 17 during this period the pool was partially drained for annual maintenance and cleaning no storm event response was anticipated during this time period so the draining of the pool had no effect on our analysis the 3 foot variation in water level observed during the remainder of the monitoring period occurred on the time scales of weeks and represents a fluctuation of approximately 1 2 million gallons of water san solomon springs discharges approximately 15 million gallons of water per day therefore the slight variations in water level of the pool are assumed to have minimal effect on mixing conditions and water quality monitoring the spring temperature record deviated significantly from a normal probability distribution throughout the range of collected data fig s2 we infer the cause was the low resolution 0 1 c of the thermistor because deviation could not be clearly derived by examining the probability distribution we did not assign temperature an inflection point p value to differentiate base from event conditions there is a clear inflection point in the turbidity data pval 0 9995 however upon closer analysis of the data it appears that all of these measurements were collected on a single day in february 2012 this may be due to maintenance work in the pool algal blooms sensor interference or an event response producing extremely turbid discharge another inflection point is visible at pval 0 9 that may represent event conditions however we elected not to analyze this in favor of selecting the most conservative approach for differentiating base and event conditions as the turbidity record may be affected by external factors e g swimmers scuba divers and pool maintenance a clear inflection point was also identified in the specific conductance record pval 0 0015 differentiating the record using this value yielded 43measurements recorded during 26 days multiple measurements captured the falling and rising limbs of inferred event responses for several n 8 of the observed events during base flow conditions in 2011 2012 i e spring discharge is not influenced by precipitation the mean specific conductance of water discharging from san solomon springs was 3450 μs cm se 0 3 2210 ppm tds this is higher than the values measured in grab samples and synoptic surveys from previous research 3200 μs cm uliana et al 2007 and specific conductance had an apparent increasing trend over the monitoring period we infer that the extended drought conditions occurring between 2010 and 2012 drove the elevated mean value and increasing trend with significantly lower than average precipitation local flow paths provided less recharge to dilute the more saline regional component of groundwater leading to the observed increase in specific conductance over the monitoring period there was a degree of observed sensor drift between re calibration periods however this magnitude of drift was generally small 50 μs cm fig s2 mean turbidity during base conditions was 1 5 fnu se 0 01 the mean temperature of discharging water during base conditions was 24 8 c se 0 01 deviations from mean temperature tended to occur more frequently and last for longer periods than deviations from mean specific conductance or turbidity the cause of this deviation may be a result of sensor resolution or other compounding factors e g thermal conduction in the pool from the analysis of the deviations from normal probability distribution 26 days of event flow were identified in the specific conductance record fig 3 fig s2 other dips in specific conductance are observable in the record however they were not included in the analysis because the aim for the first cut identification was to be conservative with the differentiation between base and event flow dips in specific conductance tend to have associated spikes in turbidity and fluctuations in temperature fig 2 this is consistent with the anticipated system behavior where event flow should provide an influx of fresher more turbid and cooler water uliana and sharp 2001 the largest dip in specific conductance observed in the record was to 2299 µs cm on september 3 2011 18 of the 26 event days recorded minimum specific conductance values of 3100 µs cm event flow response from san solomon springs was rapid during the study period none of the identified responses altered specific conductance values for longer than 2 5 h based on the inflection point probability distribution function identification method with the available data it is unclear whether this is characteristic of event flow at this spring or if an unusual response occurred in 2011 2012 due to drought conditions based on synoptic measurements of discharge the average flow at san solomon spring is approximately 13 000 gal min 0 86 m3 s heitmuller and reece 2003 so the volume of recharge from a local precipitation event would need to be sizable in order to alter the specific conductance of the discharging water for an extended period of time visual analysis of the time series where dates of non trace precipitation events at the three coop stations ft davis kent balmorhea were compared to dates of event flow response dips in specific conductance at the spring yielded a median lag of 43 days fig 3a with a maximum lag of 50 and a minimum lag of 30 days this range does not represent an absolute value for travel time a limited dataset collected in a drought year complicates the calculation of a lead lag correlation based solely on precipitation at weather stations and spring response additionally the specific conductance record indicates a multi modal response which we infer is dependent on scale and timing of precipitation events and antecedent moisture conditions this could significantly alter estimates of travel time for local flow 5 3 correlation of spatial precipitation and spring response cross correlations over the region of interest fig 4d illustrate a significant p 0 01 positive relationship between the daily signal for rainfall magnitude and the aggregated daily spring event flow with values of specific conductance below 3300 µs cm while significant positive correlation occurs across the domain this is likely a result of the widespread convective storms producing heavy rainfall on the same days as those in the hypothesized contributing and recharge zones fig 2 the gridded precipitation data are relatively granular 4 km resolution compared to the local variability in topography and geology however despite this limitation the analysis capture patterns consistent with recharge features a substantial portion of the davis mountains within the same huc 8 watershed as san solomon spring was strongly correlated 0 4 0 6 with event flow fig 4 box i this area overlaps several of the major drainage channels that empty to alluvial fans at the mountain front and onto outcrops of edwards trinity cretaceous bedrock direct precipitation and or runoff onto bedrock outcrops on the basin floor may also create recharge fig 4 box ii though based on this dataset diffuse infiltration through the alluvium does not appear to be a major source of recharge this could be a result of antecedent moisture conditions drought or natural system behavior a longer dataset that captures the range of precipitation and antecedent moisture conditions is necessary to determine whether diffuse recharge plays a major role in local flow also of note is the area with strong correlation 0 3 0 6 between the davis and apache mountains fig 4 box iii where another large outcrop of cretaceous bedrock is present it is located in an adjacent watershed that according to topography should flow north northeast and bypass the springs instead these analyses indicate that flow over this outcrop is a potential source of local recharge to san solomon spring this is consistent with the hypothesized areas through which regional flow moves within the system uliana and sharp 2001 uliana et al 2007 where outcrops to these formations occur it is possible that they can act as conduits of both local and regional flow spatial distribution of moving average lag lead periodicity between mesoscale precipitation events and response flow provided a less noisy record centered on the principle lag relationship and is consistent with the visual analysis derived lag estimates fig 5 period of flow from the strongly correlated regions in boxes i and iii reveals spatially varying values of approximately 30 45 days over both the alluvial fans and edwards trinity bedrock and over the catchment region associated with cretaceous bedrock between the apache and davis mountains fig 4b box iii while positive correlations are identified to the south and southeast of san solomon springs these two systems reflect flow that likely is directed down gradient towards ft stockton and reflect a spatial region where precipitation days were often coincident with precipitation over the catchments described above this type of signal is not unsurprising given the relatively small number of samples contained in the dataset a preliminary analysis of the time series of individual grid box cross correlations to the spring discharge series was indicative of multi modal behavior in both lag and correlation i e one storm event may drive a staggered set of spring responses because of differing travels times for each local flow path this suggests that flowpaths of varying length may contribute to the overall discharge and lead to a range of lags within a given catchment or between different catchments while such features certainly merit future investigation the statistical limitations of the current dataset precludes any such analysis within this study furthermore the nature of the responses seen here may reflect characteristics unique to periods with low antecedent moisture conditions 6 discussion the analysis presented here illustrates that san solomon spring discharge is modulated by local flow derived from mesoscale precipitation events over recharge or contributing zones the local flow system appears to have a regular periodicity of arrival with a lag period of 30 45 days and strong statistically significant p 0 01 correlations to monitored specific conductance rainfall intensity location and antecedent moisture conditions appear to alter lag times back of the envelope estimates of travel time in this system yield an anticipated travel time of 0 5 114 days from the hypothesized recharge zones to san solomon springs using estimates of edwards trinity permeability from bumgarner et al 2012 not including time for infiltration through the unsaturated zone or overlying alluvium this is consistent with the observed correlations and with estimates of travel time and permeability in other similar regional karst systems halihan et al 1999 while the lag analysis does allow us to identify the dominant signal of the relationship between rainfall and subsequent spring discharge there are likely variations that exist due to varying magnitudes of precipitation and the underlying system base state for example the significant drought period that coincided with measurements over the region led to potentially abnormal antecedent moisture conditions which may have an effect on the characteristic lag period of the spring response other relevant factors include seasonality and whether events are intense isolated or protracted however the length and sampling period of the existing dataset make these features difficult to analyze suggesting the need for further observations there has been one event response documented at san solomon spring prior to this research on november 1 1990 a synoptic survey of water quality at the spring captured a sample with a specific conductance value of 1 298 µs cm texas water development board accessed july 2017 this was attributed to storm event influence on spring discharge uliana and sharp 2001 and is substantially larger than any that were observed over the course of this study maximum deviation was to 2300 µs cm fig 4 non trace rainfall was recorded at the ft davis kent and balmorhea weather stations on 9 15 1990 9 22 1990 and again on 10 1 1990 10 3 1990 these were the only non trace events in the 75 days preceding the observed spring response comparing precipitation event timing to spring response provides a lag of 30 47 days which is consistent with the results described in herein a significant advantage in this analysis is the use of ahps precipitation and the meteorological conditions to identify the occurrence of precipitation events rather than gauges in order to identify spatial granularity in rainfall distribution and intensity and co locate these characteristics with geological formations that have the potential to serve as recharge zones for local flow uliana et al 2007 however challenges exist in the relative proximity of nexrad radar sites to systems of interest in capturing rainfall particularly for shallower non convective systems it is also unclear as to whether the 15 minute spring monitoring interval used over most of the course of this study was of sufficient temporal resolution to capture maximum excursions from the mean or associated rising or falling limbs a sampling interval of 5 min captured more of the rising falling response february march 2012 data fig 4 however the drain on the battery life of the equipment was rapid enough 2 weeks that a 5 minute interval is not practical for remote monitoring modifications of the sampling protocol evolving technologies or an external power supply could provide solutions to these challenges and enable collection over a longer period of record and a wider range of hydrologic and meteorological conditions the predominance of precipitation cases driven by summer convective rainfall suggests that a comparatively short period of observations during and following the summer months would allow a better understanding of the influence of these systems on discharge from san solomon springs ideally such sampling would involve both a similar drought or dry period and a more normal or wetter year to investigate the potential implications of antecedent moisture focused sampling for additional parameters such as stable isotopes during storm event response and baseflow conditions springer et al 2017 combined with continuous monitoring of spring discharge and a detailed survey for karst features within the hypothesized recharge zones would help to refine this approach jones et al 2018 obtaining this type of dataset would provide a context to potentially allow for predictability for changes in subsequent streamflow discharge following mesoscale precipitation events more broadly this approach illustrates that careful analysis of rainfall context is needed for monitoring intrusion of other flows into aquifers 7 conclusions san solomon springs is characteristic of aridland springs and groundwater dependent ecosystems in the trans pecos region while most of the spring discharge results from a documented regional flow system they also contain a significant component of local flow system water in this study analysis indicates that the lag time between precipitation event and spring response is 30 45 days with an average of 43 days likely recharge zones for the local flow system includes alluvial fans and outcrops of cretaceous bedrock edwards trinity plateau aquifer furthermore recharge to the local flow system appears to cross watershed surface water divides indicating that strategies applied to protect sensitive habitat will have to span outside of traditionally acknowledged management boundaries currently the limitations of the dataset generated by this study preclude a more generalized prediction of spring response particularly as it relates to non drought periods and changes to precipitation extent and intensity however it does serve as a proof of concept for the application of this method to an extended dataset this suggests the need for additional monitoring of the spring system to better understand recharge zones and flow paths and to inform strategies for habitat and groundwater management environmental implications of these results are also notable as issues of concern for groundwater dependent aquatic and terrestrial species include maintaining spring flows and water quality i e salinity and temperatures which over the period of this study showed the influence of continual drought in terms of increasing salinity threats to the system from groundwater abstraction drought and climate change are ongoing unless properly managed expanding drilling for unconventional oil and gas resources in the delaware basin along with associated groundwater development for hydraulic fracturing water needs has the potential to increase vulnerability of groundwater dependent ecosystems as a result of reduce spring flow and or water quality adversely affect habitats for species of conservation interest and potentially reduce regional groundwater water supplies aridland springs in texas and around the world are facing threats to water supply and water quality from drought increased abstraction and climate change characterization of flow paths recharge and

6743,the relevance of hydrological processes varies in space and time resulting in typical temporal patterns for catchments contrasting catchments moreover differ in their catchment metrics hydrological models claim to be able to reproduce typical temporal patterns of dominant processes using site specific model parameters thus patterns of temporal dynamics in dominant modelled processes and their corresponding dominant parameters are a fingerprint of how a model represents the hydrological behaviour of a catchment and how these process patterns vary between contrasting catchments in this study we demonstrate how catchment metrics modelled processes and parameter dominances can be jointly used to characterise catchments we assess how catchment characteristics are represented in spatio temporal process dynamics in models and how to understand the reasons for hydrological dis similarity among catchments along a landscape gradient for this purpose catchment metrics which characterise contrasting landscapes lowland mid range mountain and alpine catchments are related to dominant processes and parameters which were provided by a temporally resolved sensitivity analysis tedpas and simulations of a hydrological model our study shows that the applied model is able to represent the different processes and their seasonal variability according to the specific hydrological conditions of the study catchments by analysing catchment metrics modelled processes and model parameters jointly we show that the largest differences are identified for the alpine catchment whilst similarities are found among the other catchments following a landscape gradient high flow phases are dominated by different flow components in contrast the model shows groundwater dominance in low flow phases in non alpine catchments while in the alpine catchment low flows in winter are mainly controlled by snow processes the joint analysis of catchment metrics temporal dynamics of dominant processes and parameters can therefore be used to better disentangle similarities and differences among catchments from different landscapes keywords catchment modeling catchment similarity temporal parameter sensitivity analysis dominant hydrological processes spatio temporal process dynamics diagnostic model analysis 1 introduction the relevance of different hydrological processes in controlling the hydrological system varies in space between catchments due to different characteristics in landscape and climate atkinson et al 2002 merz and blöschl 2004 bai et al 2009 jothityangkoon and sivapalan 2009 köplin et al 2012 moreover dominant processes are known to be variable in time due to seasonal variations in driving factors such as precipitation or radiation boyle et al 2000 boyle et al 2001 shamir et al 2005 guse et al 2016a thus also the three catchment functions partitioning storage and release of water are variable in space and time wagener et al 2007 sawicz et al 2011 in models different hydrological processes are represented by storages and fluxes as well as by model parameters implicitly complex hydrological models assume to be able to represent the hydrological behaviour in different catchments by site specific identification of model parameter values and by emphasising or neglecting hydrological processes of major or minor relevance respectively it is still challenging in hydrological modelling how to reproduce the variability of process relevance in space and time i e the spatio temporal dynamics accurately wagener et al 2007 hrachowitz et al 2013 melsen et al 2016b to investigate this it is required to analyse the model capability to reproduce spatio temporal process dynamics and how the controlling processes and parameters vary in contrasting catchments in different landscapes bai et al 2009 carrillo et al 2011 donnelly et al 2016 contrasting catchments can be characterised by differences in specific metrics as typical statistical values such as mean annual precipitation or mean elevation wagener et al 2007 carrillo et al 2011 sawicz et al 2011 ali et al 2012 köplin et al 2012 catchment metrics vary between different types of landscape or climate as well as between seasons and also in different temporal scales a set of catchment metrics can thus lead to typical fingerprints of hydrological behaviour wagener et al 2007 ali et al 2012 berghuijs et al 2014 donnelly et al 2016 spatial process patterns are derived using a large set of catchments van esse et al 2013 gupta et al 2014 köplin et al 2012 markstrom et al 2016 however in detailed diagnostic model analyses modelled process dynamics can be related to catchment characteristics using a small set of representative case studies to demonstrate the methodological approach van werkhoven et al 2009 euser et al 2013 herman et al 2013 massmann et al 2014 melsen et al 2016a for this complex hydrological models need to accurately reproduce the complexity of different process relevances in contrasting catchments diagnostic approaches have been proven suitable to identify the causes for hydrological similarity carrillo et al 2011 hrachowitz et al 2013 in several diagnostic model analyses the modelled impact of spatial and temporal variations in dominant processes on the hydrological behaviour is highlighted reusser et al 2009 herman et al 2013 herman et al 2013 guse et al 2014 pfannerstill et al 2015 guse et al 2016b a dominant process is here defined as the most relevant process in a model for a certain time period the relevance of a certain process varies both in time and between different catchments resulting in differences in the relevance of the corresponding model components markstrom et al 2016 as considered in flexible model structures clark et al 2008 fenicia et al 2011 euser et al 2013 coxon et al 2014 a hydrologically consistent model needs to be able to simulate differences in dominant processes and to reproduce them in temporal parameter patterns in coincidence with the observed processes in the catchment pfannerstill et al 2015 donnelly et al 2016 to reproduce both spatial and temporal dynamics processes and their relevance need to be represented accurately in model structure and model parameters wagener et al 2003 a variation in the process relevance in time will inevitably result in a change in parameter sensitivity van werkhoven et al 2008 herman et al 2013 pfannerstill et al 2015 guse et al 2016a parameter sensitivity analysis is increasingly used to improve our understanding of how process dynamics behave in models in the temporal dynamics of parameter sensitivity tedpas reusser et al 2011 the sensitivity of model parameters is analysed for each time step in this way also the dominant processes in the model are derived for each day and based on this temporal changes in dominant processes are precisely pointed out reusser et al 2011 guse et al 2014 the resulting temporal patterns of dominant model parameters depend both on the model structure itself and on the hydrological characteristics of the catchment euser et al 2013 massmann et al 2014 fovet et al 2015 pfannerstill et al 2015 guse et al 2016b several studies have shown that the relevance of model parameters and their sensitivity on modelled output changes in space and time and results in a typical fingerprint of how a model represents catchment processes reusser et al 2011 guse et al 2014 markstrom et al 2016 while tedpas was already successfully applied in different catchments reusser et al 2011 guse et al 2016b an analysis of how different catchment characteristics affect temporal patterns of dominant processes and parameters is still missing in this study it is investigated how spatio temporal dynamics in processes and model parameters are related to typical catchment characteristics and in which aspects contrasting catchments behave similar thus this study aims to analyse two points first we analyse how catchment metrics as typical characteristics of catchments are related to spatio temporal variability of dominant processes and parameters based on this we investigate whether a hydrological model that aims to be globally applicable is able to emphasise the dominant processes and their corresponding parameters in contrasting catchments second we investigate how spatial variability in catchment metrics modelled processes and dominant parameters contribute to understand the dis similarity between catchments thus catchment similarity is assessed based on data and model results i e in modelled processes as well as by looking at variations in parameter dominances in space and time we intend to analyse how the understanding of process behaviour in models benefits from using parameter dominances for analysing catchment similarity we hypothesise that by comparing all three types of information for contrasting catchments similarities and differences between catchments and more specifically between the controlling processes can be derived these two points result in the following main research questions can a universally applicable hydrological model represent the characteristics of contrasting catchments by typical dominant processes and parameter dynamics how do catchment metrics modelled processes and dominant parameters contribute to explain similarities and differences between contrasting catchments 2 materials and methods the methodical approach is described in fig 1 it is based on three pillars data based catchment metrics modelled processes and dominant model parameters we hypothesise that by comparing all three types of information for contrasting catchments i it can be analysed how differences in catchment metrics are reproduced in temporal variations of both dominant processes and dominant model parameters and ii similarities and differences between the catchments can be derived 2 1 study catchments and catchment metrics the study catchments can be classified along an elevation gradient from alpine catchments with high elevations via mid range mountains to lowland catchments to consider these catchment types four catchments were selected for this study that are spatially distributed in germany and cover different types of landscapes fig 2 the treene catchment is a typical lowland catchment which is situated in the north of germany catchment outlet treia 481 km2 the kinzig catchment belongs to the mid range mountains catchment outlet hanau 925 km2 the kinzig flows into the river main in central germany the upper saale catchment at the gauge blankenstein 1019 km2 is located in southeastern germany and used as an example for a mid range mountain catchment the ammer is in southern germany and is a typical alpine catchment and flows into the ammer lake the gauge station peissenberg catchment size 299 km2 is used for the model analysis we characterised our study areas by catchment metrics table 1 with respect to five categories topography land use temperature precipitation and discharge for the dynamic variables precipitation temperature and discharge monthly values and the seasonality index are shown for the period from 2000 to 2010 a higher seasonality index indicates a higher variability within the year for further details see coopersmith et al 2012 coopersmith et al 2014 guse et al 2016a the elevation increases from treene via kinzig and saale to the ammer catchment in contrast the slope is slightly larger in the kinzig compared to the saale catchment the mean slope of 1 3 assigns the treene catchment to the lowlands the ammer has the highest elevation gradient of the four study catchments and largest slope class see 75 quantile in table 1 which is much larger than in the other catchments the treene catchment is largely dominated by agricultural land in contrast the three other catchments are dominated by both agriculture and forest the mean annual temperature ranges between 7 9 c saale and 10 1 c kinzig the largest seasonality in temperature was observed in the saale catchment 2 2 soil and water assessment tool swat a hydrological model was used to provide temporal patterns of different hydrological processes and of parameter sensitivities the eco hydrological model swat soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 was used in the modified version swat3s with three aquifers including two active ones pfannerstill et al 2014a named the swat model in the following the swat model calculates the major hydrological processes model outputs are provided in a daily resolution for each subbasin as the finest spatially located unit these subbasins are further spatially subdivided into hydrological response units hrus based on same information in land use soil and slope class the swat model distinguishes between a land and a water phase at the land phase the three typical catchment functions partitioning storage and release of water are considered precipitation is partitioned into snow and rain storage changes are calculated for different soil layers and the three aquifers water is released via evapotranspiration and different runoff components actual evapotranspiration is calculated based on potential evapotranspiration and water availability on the current day in addition to surface runoff subsurface runoff components are included within the soil lateral flow and artificial tile flow due to drainage activities are distinguished groundwater flow is released from the two active aquifers fast and slow groundwater flow all runoff components are summed up at each subbasin to calculate water yield in the water phase runoff is routed from one subbasin to the next a modelling period from 1997 to 2010 was used in all catchments including a warm up period of three years twelve model parameters were selected in this study table 2 and described briefly below to capture all relevant processes we selected those model parameters that are expected to be of relevance in at least one of the catchments for a more detailed description of the model parameters we refer to neitsch et al 2011 parameter ranges were selected based on experiences in other swat studies e g guse et al 2014 pfannerstill et al 2014b 2015 guse et al 2016a b three snow parameters were included the snowfall temperature sftmp defines the temperature when snow falls whilst snow melting is controlled by the snowmelt temperature smtmp the third snow parameter snocovmx expresses the lowest amount of snow which lead to a full snow cover the curve number method cn2 scs 1972 is included in the swat model to regulate the amount of infiltrating water and thus the occurrence of surface runoff flow time of surface runoff lateral flow and tile flow to the river is regulated by surlag lattime and gdrain respectively the available soil water capacity sol awc can be differentiated for each soil layer in the different soil types the soil evaporation factor esco is used to parameterise a nonlinear function for contribution of soil water from different soil depths to evaporation fast and slow aquifers are differentiated in the swat3s model version three groundwater parameters were used retention time in recharging the first aquifer is controlled by the groundwater retention parameter gw delayfsh available water in the aquifers is partitioned into the two aquifers by the aquifer fraction coefficient rchrgssh subsequently the baseflow retention factor alpha bfssh regulates the timing of groundwater flow from the slow aquifer to the main river the swat models for the treene and saale catchments were used as described in guse et al 2016b for the kinzig catchment we used a 25 m resolution dem hvbg 2001 the atkis vector land use map bkg 2013 and soil properties from a 1 200 000 soil map bgr 1999 as well as 13 rain gauges two temperature and wind four humidity and one solar radiation stations see kakouei et al 2018 for details the kinzig reservoir was implemented in the model based on dam and reservoir properties and release rules in the ammer and kinzig catchments where elevation ranges exceed 500 m we included elevation bands to differentiate precipitation and temperature in all subbasins in elevation distances of 50 m for the ammer catchment global datasets on topography srtm dem jarvis et al 2008 nasa jpl 2013 and soil hwsd 2009 as well as the atkis vector map bkg 2013 were used moreover we implemented 13 rain gauges and five temperature gauges see kiesel et al 2019 2 3 spatio temporal dynamics in processes and model parameters in this study the fast fourier amplitude sensitivity test was used cukier et al 1973 saltelli et al 2006 with the r package fast reusser 2015 fast provides the parameter settings for the 579 model simulations which are required to derive sensitivities for twelve model parameters all model parameters are modified simultaneously for each catchment identical parameter combinations were tested in model simulations covering the whole parameter space these model simulations were used to derive spatio temporal variations in both modelled processes and model parameters the model simulations were at first used to derive daily time series of different modelled hydrological components which were extracted for each of the 579 model simulations hydrological component is a more general notation including hydrological processes state variables and other hydrological variables as hydrological components we have selected precipitation snowfall actual evapotranspiration water yield runoff ratio surface runoff lateral flow and subsurface flow water yield is the amount of water flowing from the land phase into the river daily model results for the selected hydrological components were monthly averaged for the entire modeling period for each model simulation a monthly resolution was selected as appropriate temporal scale to detect typical fingerprints of catchment behaviour their variability was detected based on variations in parameter values within the model simulations concerning model parameters the temporal dynamics of parameter sensitivity tedpas reusser et al 2011 calculate parameter sensitivities in daily resolution temporal variations in parameter dominance were increasingly investigated in recent years sieber and uhlenbrook 2005 cloke et al 2008 guse et al 2014 haas et al 2015 pfannerstill et al 2015 to extract the maximum information about parameter impact on hydrological behaviour of a model tedpas uses directly model results and can thus be applied to all outputs which are provided by the model in a daily resolution guse et al 2016b parameter sensitivity is expressed here as partial variance which is defined as ratio of first order variance of a parameter divided by the total variance for this day guse et al 2016b suggested a monthly aggregation of the daily sensitivity to obtain easily interpretable patterns of typical parameter dynamics in this study daily time series of discharge were used to estimate parameter sensitivities the dominant parameters to discharge were detected for each day and based on this typical patterns of parameter dominances were characterised for more detailed information about tedpas we refer to reusser et al 2011 as well as to the initial tedpas study with the swat model in guse et al 2014 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal variability in measured precipitation and discharge the four catchments were compared in terms of mean and variability standard deviation of two major hydrological variables i e measured time series of precipitation and runoff in a monthly resolution fig 3 mean annual precipitation in the ammer catchment 1310 mm a table 1 is much larger than in the three other catchments precipitation amount is significantly higher in summer in the ammer catchment with a value about three times as large as in winter see also table 1 illustrating the highest variability in precipitation among the four catchments in contrast precipitation patterns are similar for the treene saale and kinzig catchments with low seasonal variations and a slightly higher precipitation in summer in all catchments precipitation variability is highest in summer and increases with increasing precipitation overall seasonal precipitation patterns are similar for mean and variability in all catchments runoff patterns are similar in treene kinzig and saale with high values in winter and low values in summer at the beginning of spring these three catchments are characterised by a strong decline in runoff ending up in a dry phase in autumn the runoff time series of the treene catchment is smoothest as indicated by the lowest standard deviation runoff variability for saale and kinzig is in particular higher in the winter period this indicates a high retention in lowlands and a faster hydrological response in mid range mountain catchments the ammer catchment is characterised by different runoff patterns compared to the other catchments the highest runoff occurs from spring to summer and fluctuations throughout the year are lower compared to the other catchments the lowest monthly average discharge occurs in january thus in winter runoff is lower than in the three other catchments the correlation between monthly precipitation and runoff is highest for the ammer catchment with 0 71 for mean and 0 89 for standard deviation high precipitation and high runoff coincide except in spring the hydrological system is thus characterised by a fast runoff response to precipitation events fig 3 whereas low precipitation in winter and storage in snow lead to minimum runoff values in spring precipitation is relatively low compared to runoff and snowmelt evokes an increase in water yield without additional high amounts of precipitation the largest values in standard deviation were detected for both precipitation and runoff values in the ammer catchment standard deviation increases in particular in high flow periods here peaks in mean and variability in runoff coincide in their seasonal occurrence high runoff variability in the ammer catchment in august indicates a high contribution of surface runoff in contrast for the three other catchments the correlations are negative for both mean and standard deviation with a value up to 0 53 in the correlation between the standard deviation of monthly precipitation and runoff in the saale catchment the largest variability in precipitation is detected in the saale catchment in summer whilst runoff variability has its maximum in winter thus variability in precipitation is related to the occurrence of intense summer events whereas runoff variability is controlled by the interplay between snow and rain driven runoff processes the negative correlation occurs due to a stronger retention in the catchment leading to a higher contribution of subsurface flow as well as to higher losses due to evapotranspiration 3 2 modelled hydrological components before presenting modelled patterns of temporal process dominance model performance in the four catchments for the entire modelling period 2000 2010 is briefly summarised these model performance values represent the median values of the model simulations within the sensitivity analysis it was hereby not our goal to show the best results of a calibrated model the information on performance criteria is added to provide a rough idea of how the model is performing and to demonstrate that the model can be used for our purpose median values of kge are 0 73 treene 0 72 kinzig 0 61 saale and 0 38 ammer and of pbias 10 7 treene 20 8 kinzig 2 5 saale and 9 3 ammer even though that kge values are not satisfactory for each model run we assume that the general catchment behavior is represented realistically for each of the catchments as shown in fig 4 the average behaviour of different modelled hydrological components throughout the year is illustrated in fig 4 above to analyse how catchment characteristics are reproduced by the model snowfall is most relevant both in magnitude and duration in the ammer catchment at the beginning of the year snowfall amounts in the saale catchment are higher than in kinzig and treene catchments in contrast at the end of the year snowfall is similar in saale and kinzig catchments actual evapotranspiration shows a typical seasonal pattern driven by radiation its impact on seasonal runoff pattern is of relevance in summer and autumn and is highest in the ammer catchment however the seasonal patterns for evapotranspiration are not controlling discharge patterns due to the large temporal variations in precipitation and snowmelt the three other catchments treene saale kinzig are characterised by high precipitation in summer but the highest discharge in winter the high influence of actual evapotranspiration leads to these seasonal discharge patterns due to highest values of both precipitation and evapotranspiration in summer no coincidence is observed between temporal patterns in precipitation and runoff this is also shown in similar monthly patterns of runoff ratios in all catchments with the highest values in spring the runoff regime median values for total water yield in fig 4 of the ammer catchment shows two distinct peaks driven by snowmelt march and rainfall august respectively snow accumulation strongly buffers the hydrological response the runoff regime of the other catchments is characterised by only one less distinct peak in march this is mainly caused by the seasonal cycle of evapotranspiration and to a smaller extent also by snowmelt regarding runoff components surface runoff in particular in early spring and late summer and lateral flow in spring and summer are the major contributing runoff components in the ammer catchment in the kinzig catchment lateral flow is dominant throughout the entire year with low variability while surface runoff and subsurface flow are important in winter similarly to the kinzig catchment lateral flow is relevant in the saale catchment however in the saale the relevance of subsurface flow is higher while surface runoff is of lower relevance in contrast the hydrological system in the treene lowland catchment is controlled by subsurface flow in particular in winter while the two other runoff components are of lower relevance all catchments show a typical hierarchical pattern of process occurrence yilmaz et al 2008 pfannerstill et al 2015 in high flow phases different runoff components from surface or fast reacting subsurface up to groundwater in the treene catchment dominate while groundwater is dominating in the non alpine catchments in phases of low flows a higher variability occurs due to higher contribution of fast reacting runoff components such as it is shown when comparing winter discharge patterns between the four catchments 3 3 impact of parameter settings on modelled hydrological components the variance in monthly values of the hydrological components throughout the year indicates how different parameter settings influence the relevance of these hydrological components fig 4 below high variance indicates high relevance of parameter settings which means that they highly modify the contribution of this hydrological component in general one would expect that the pattern of variances follows the pattern of medians as it is true for snowfall for all catchments the impact of swat model parameter settings matches with the contribution of snowfall however there are quite a few exceptions for some hydrological components and catchments where high variances do not coincide with high medians variability in surface runoff is remarkably high in the ammer catchment the highest variance is detected in august and the highest median in march thus the impact of parameter settings is higher in summer whilst probably changes in snow parameters have a lower impact on the modelled amount of surface runoff variance in lateral flow is high in the saale catchment and low in the kinzig catchment in contrast median values are higher in the kinzig than in the saale catchment two distinct peaks of subsurface flow occurred in may and november in the treene catchment while the median curve has only one prolonged peak in winter in consequence variances for total water yield are remarkably different across the ensemble of catchments fig 4 below this implies more complex parameter sensitivity patterns for each catchment as expected by just looking at the average runoff regimes where only the ammer is markedly different in the ammer catchment the highest variability in water yield is detected in summer while it is relatively low in spring indicating that processes in summer e g evapotranspiration rain driven surface runoff are more impacted by parameter settings than processes in winter e g snowmelt in the treene catchment monthly patterns for median and variance do not match since the highest variability is observed in may and november while water yield has its highest values in winter thus the temporal variability of groundwater and water yield is very similar in the treene catchment showing that the groundwater parameter settings largely influence water yield in contrast in the saale catchment median and variance of monthly patterns are similar the variance in runoff ratio is high in april in the treene and saale catchments which is also the month with the highest runoff ratio while it is constant throughout the year in the two other catchments thus also the runoff ratio is strongly impacted by parameter settings in spring overall variance in modelled hydrological components and thus the impact of parameter settings is lowest in the kinzig catchment 3 4 monthly patterns of parameter sensitivity daily sensitivity results are aggregrated to mean monthly values of partial sensitivities for each model parameter fig 5 this allows an easier interpretation of the typical hydrological behaviour for each catchment as suggested by guse et al 2016b regarding the three snow parameters sftmp smtmp snocovmx sensitivity values and the number of months with a high sensitivity are increasing with the landscape gradient in the ammer catchment snowfall temperature sftmp is sensitive for a long period from early autumn up to late spring snowmelt temperature smtmp in contrast is not relevant before winter times the highest amount of snow in the ammer catchment results both in the highest sensitivity values for snow parameters and in the largest duration of snow relevance november to may there are differences both in snowmelt and in the intensity and duration of the dominance of snow parameters while the sensitivity values are higher in the kinzig compared to the saale catchment the duration of snow relevance is longer one month in the saale catchment fig 5 the curve number cn2 as representative for surface runoff in the swat model is only sensitive in summer in the ammer catchment whilst it is only of minor relevance in the other catchments the highest relevance of lateral flow in kinzig and ammer is reproduced in the dominance of lateral flow lag time lattime throughout the year while lattime is relevant throughout the whole year in the kinzig it is only dominant in the ammer from may to november due to the high relevance of snow processes in winter as evaporation parameter esco is mainly relevant in the second half of the year except for the saale catchment where esco is of low relevance throughout the year the groundwater retention time gw delayfsh is the major groundwater parameter in the non alpine catchments in particular in the treene catchment and is sensitive for the whole year the aquifer partitioning rchrgssh regulates the water distribution into the two aquifers and is sensitive in all catchments rchrgssh is relevant throughout the entire year due to high amount of water in both aquifers its lowest sensitivity values are detected in autumn in times of low discharge in the two mid range mountain catchments rchrgssh is in particular relevant for regulating water support in dry periods thus its highest sensitivity is observed in summer before the dry phase in autumn in the alpine ammer catchment groundwater flow is of minor importance rchrgssh has a low sensitivity in summer and is more relevant in winter times while the non alpine catchments are characterised by low flows in summer the ammer has the lowest phase in winter where water is retained as snow the baseflow recession of the second aquifer alpha bfssh is sensitive in summer and at the beginning of autumn in the non alpine catchments for these catchments a typical sequence of groundwater parameter sensitivity can be derived at first gw delayfsh is relevant at the beginning of the summer followed by a high sensitivity of rchrgssh subsequently in autumn in the dry season alpha bfssh as the model parameter from the deepest zone becomes sensitive 3 5 monthly patterns of dominant hydrological components in fig 6 the model parameter dominances are aggregated to explain the dominant hydrological components all parameters of a certain hydrological component are summed up and compared with the mean monthly discharge values in general the process dominance patterns show three markedly different phases for the non alpine catchments while for the ammer catchment only two phases can be detected for the treene catchment dominant patterns of hydrological components are typical for pluvial runoff regimes of lowlands with a high contribution of groundwater and low relevance of fast runoff and snow fig 6 a dominance of groundwater was detected throughout the year with maximum relevance from april to june highest relevance of groundwater parameters occur in the transition between spring and summer when they dominate over snow and evapotranspiration parameters in contrast the high impact of evapotranspiration in late summer reduces the relevance of groundwater parameters this pattern is also related to water availability in times of high water availability in spring when soils are close to saturation the settings of soil and evapotranspiration parameters do not largely influence actual evapotranspiration however in summer when soil water content is lower model parameters are more important to regulate the amount of available water for evapotranspiration the runoff maximum in winter is driven by groundwater with contribution of snow but not from fast runoff components the low relevance of fast reacting components could also be derived from low variability in runoff fig 3 the kinzig catchment shows a pluvio nivale regime with a rather small influence of snowmelt fig 6 snow parameters are relevant from december to march from april to july groundwater parameters dominate whilst from august to november a dominance of fast reacting and soil components is detected fast reacting components have the same level of high relevance throughout the year in autumn soil parameters become relevant to regulate evapotranspiration and soil water storage in the saale catchment the dominance patterns also show the typical hydrological behaviour for pluvio nivale regimes of mid range mountain catchments there is a strong influence of the snow component in the first four months of the year fast runoff components are slightly relevant during the year with low variability soil processes including evapotranspiration are in particular relevant in autumn october the groundwater component has the highest sensitivities in dry phases in summer from late summer to winter no component is highly dominant this shows the balanced situation between different dominant hydrological components finally in the ammer catchment with a nivale regime a clear break between the dominance by snow and surface runoff can be observed between may and june thus only two different dominant phases are detected high runoff values occur from march to september with a comparably low impact of evapotranspiration there is a direct transition to fast reacting runoff components due to high slopes with dominance from june to october whilst there is no important phase of groundwater recharge as indicated in the low sensitivity of groundwater snow processes are relevant from november to may with a discharge peak in april evoked by snowmelt at the end of the winter 4 discussion in this study we presented three ways of deriving hydrological dis similarity between catchments we detected how catchment characteristics are reflected in spatio temporal dynamics of modelled processes and parameter sensitivities in contrast to studies using a large set of catchments to classify them in a few groups köplin et al 2012 we directly focused our analysis on four catchments to study the hydrological characteristics of typical landscapes in germany carrillo et al 2011 have emphasised that signature based catchment characterisation is a first approach to explain hydrologic behaviour the comparison of catchment metrics among the four catchments disentangles similarities and differences between the catchments differences are prominent in the landscape structure resulting in a typical gradient from north to south while the catchment structure is different for the non alpine catchments lowland vs mid range mountains the differences in the forcing by precipitation is small this also results in small differences in the monthly discharge regime thus the impact of precipitation on the total discharge regime is stronger than the impact of landscape structure thus first insights for differences in the contribution of runoff components between the four catchments are already detected in catchment metrics but to explain the overall hydrologic behaviour more detailed diagnostic analyses are needed our study has demonstrated how different processes are reproduced in model applications for the four catchments modelled processes provide additional information which cannot be directly derived from measured time series of precipitation and discharge and resulting catchment metrics it is shown that using monthly patterns of different modelled runoff components improves the understanding of hydrological behaviour and the explanation of similarities and differences between catchments in the ammer catchment seasonal dynamics in radiation impact discharge dynamics here snowmelt is the governing hydrological process in the winter half year in the alpine catchment due to low temperatures since surface processes are a driver for discharge i e surface runoff and snowmelt the strongest link between precipitation and discharge occurs in the ammer catchment seasonal process patterns in the treene kinzig and saale catchments are mainly driven by evapotranspiration in summer and by precipitation in winter these results coincide with former studies demonstrating that high flows occur in phases of high precipitation and low demand for evapotranspiration whilst low flow phases are related to a high demand for evapotranspiration patil and stieglitz 2011 guse et al 2016a a low relationship between daily precipitation and discharge is detected for the three non alpine catchments since they are controlled by subsurface flows lateral or groundwater flow however the relationship between precipitation and discharge in the treene lowland catchment with a strong dominance of groundwater flow is not lower compared to the two mid range mountain catchments kinzig and saale which are also controlled by lateral flow thus based on our study we can state that the direct link between daily precipitation and discharge is low if subsurface processes dominate irrespective of the type of subsurface flow as emphasised by wagener et al 2007 the interpretation of subsurface flow is more complicated due to less available data more information than precipitation and total discharge is helpful to explain subsurface processes a core point of this study was to show how the analysis of temporal variations in dominant model parameters contributes to explain similarities and differences between catchments carrillo et al 2011 showed by constructing linear regressions that only a few model parameters are connected to typical characteristics of several catchments in the usa in our study we intensified the diagnostic analysis from the methodological point of view as also shown by donnelly et al 2016 an analysis of different aspects of hydrologic behaviour in the model demonstrates whether the set of model parameters can reflect differences between contrasting catchments while donnelly et al 2016 focused on flow signatures our study used daily time series of modelled hydrological components and parameter sensitivity to investigate the relationship of model parameters and catchment characteristics a couple of new insights were derived from these temporal sensitivity patterns an example for a model structure characteristic is the soil evaporation parameter esco which controls the contribution of soil water from deeper zones to the evaporation process the more water evaporates from soil the less is stored in the soil and thus the less is available in dry phases thus esco is important in particular in the dry periods in autumn its temporal patterns of parameter sensitivity indicate the occurrence of dry conditions as a characteristic of the model structure the temporal parameter sensitivity analysis in the four catchments shows that the relevance of model parameters varies between the catchments although a similar behaviour in time is detected for snow and groundwater parameters the relevance of those model parameters is different between the catchments this is for example shown in the comparison of snow processes between the two mid range mountain catchments saale kinzig in the saale catchment the duration of high relevance of snow parameters is longer than in the kinzig catchment while sensitivity values are higher in the kinzig than in the saale catchment different parameter settings as realised within the sensitivity analysis have a low impact on surface and lateral flows since main factors controlling fast runoff such as slope land use and precipitation were not varied throughout the analysis thus the relevance of these fast occurring processes is not highly impacted by parameter settings while subsurface processes are strongly controlled by parameter settings subsequently the criteria from the three groups i e catchment metrics modelled processes and dominant parameters are jointly considered fig 7 each single criterion is presented as relative relevance in one catchment to derive typical catchment characteristics a relative relevance is the value for one catchment expressed as the percentage of the sum of all catchments the different criteria are weighted in font size according to their relevance in comparison with the other catchments the three tiered analysis shows that major differences between the ammer and the three non alpine catchments are emphasised in the catchment metrics as an alpine catchment the ammer is strongly impacted by topographical factors such as elevation and slope and by surface processes such as snow and surface runoff as well as the corresponding model parameters catchment metrics are mainly related to processes occurring at the land surface thus the differentiation in terms of hydrological characteristics are more difficult between the three other catchments since they are mainly controlled by subsurface processes the treene catchment can be characterised by the large share of agricultural areas as well as by the dominance of groundwater and tile flow the relevance of these subsurface processes becomes apparent by analysing the modelled processes hydrologic characterisation is even more complex for the two mid range mountain catchments kinzig saale compared to ammer or treene catchments kinzig and saale catchments are not characterised by the strong dominance of some criteria a differentiation between both catchments is possible due to the distinct monthly patterns of dominant parameters the larger the relevance of subsurface processes and the more similar the catchments are in their metrics the more beneficial is the proposed three tiered approach for a clear characterisation of contrasting catchments this gained knowledge can furthermore enable a more efficient and targeted model calibration the presented model results of this study are derived with a rather complex hydrological model to appropriately represent the hydrological system with a high demand of computational resources in future studies it might be worth checking if a model with a lower complexity and simpler process depiction is still able to depict the system sufficiently see wagener et al 2003 5 conclusion and outlook in this study catchment metrics modelled processes and dominant parameters are jointly analysed in four catchments our study clearly shows that typical characteristics of the four study catchments are reflected in the relevance of hydrological processes and model parameters temporal dynamics in modelled proceses and parameters coincide with the regime types of the catchments and are a typical fingerprint of catchment characteristics thus catchment characteristics process dominance temporal patterns of model parameters and catchment regime type are closely linked it is shown how a hydrological model represents different processes in contrasting catchments the joint analysis of catchment metrics modelled processes and parameter dominances enabled a clear identification of major differences and similarities between the catchments and contributed to explain causes of catchment similarity this approach was applied to contrasting catchments using only one model in further studies it would be interesting to apply this methodological approach with different hydrological models to derive similarities and differences in temporal patterns of modelled processes and dominant parameters in the same catchments conflict of interest none

6743,the relevance of hydrological processes varies in space and time resulting in typical temporal patterns for catchments contrasting catchments moreover differ in their catchment metrics hydrological models claim to be able to reproduce typical temporal patterns of dominant processes using site specific model parameters thus patterns of temporal dynamics in dominant modelled processes and their corresponding dominant parameters are a fingerprint of how a model represents the hydrological behaviour of a catchment and how these process patterns vary between contrasting catchments in this study we demonstrate how catchment metrics modelled processes and parameter dominances can be jointly used to characterise catchments we assess how catchment characteristics are represented in spatio temporal process dynamics in models and how to understand the reasons for hydrological dis similarity among catchments along a landscape gradient for this purpose catchment metrics which characterise contrasting landscapes lowland mid range mountain and alpine catchments are related to dominant processes and parameters which were provided by a temporally resolved sensitivity analysis tedpas and simulations of a hydrological model our study shows that the applied model is able to represent the different processes and their seasonal variability according to the specific hydrological conditions of the study catchments by analysing catchment metrics modelled processes and model parameters jointly we show that the largest differences are identified for the alpine catchment whilst similarities are found among the other catchments following a landscape gradient high flow phases are dominated by different flow components in contrast the model shows groundwater dominance in low flow phases in non alpine catchments while in the alpine catchment low flows in winter are mainly controlled by snow processes the joint analysis of catchment metrics temporal dynamics of dominant processes and parameters can therefore be used to better disentangle similarities and differences among catchments from different landscapes keywords catchment modeling catchment similarity temporal parameter sensitivity analysis dominant hydrological processes spatio temporal process dynamics diagnostic model analysis 1 introduction the relevance of different hydrological processes in controlling the hydrological system varies in space between catchments due to different characteristics in landscape and climate atkinson et al 2002 merz and blöschl 2004 bai et al 2009 jothityangkoon and sivapalan 2009 köplin et al 2012 moreover dominant processes are known to be variable in time due to seasonal variations in driving factors such as precipitation or radiation boyle et al 2000 boyle et al 2001 shamir et al 2005 guse et al 2016a thus also the three catchment functions partitioning storage and release of water are variable in space and time wagener et al 2007 sawicz et al 2011 in models different hydrological processes are represented by storages and fluxes as well as by model parameters implicitly complex hydrological models assume to be able to represent the hydrological behaviour in different catchments by site specific identification of model parameter values and by emphasising or neglecting hydrological processes of major or minor relevance respectively it is still challenging in hydrological modelling how to reproduce the variability of process relevance in space and time i e the spatio temporal dynamics accurately wagener et al 2007 hrachowitz et al 2013 melsen et al 2016b to investigate this it is required to analyse the model capability to reproduce spatio temporal process dynamics and how the controlling processes and parameters vary in contrasting catchments in different landscapes bai et al 2009 carrillo et al 2011 donnelly et al 2016 contrasting catchments can be characterised by differences in specific metrics as typical statistical values such as mean annual precipitation or mean elevation wagener et al 2007 carrillo et al 2011 sawicz et al 2011 ali et al 2012 köplin et al 2012 catchment metrics vary between different types of landscape or climate as well as between seasons and also in different temporal scales a set of catchment metrics can thus lead to typical fingerprints of hydrological behaviour wagener et al 2007 ali et al 2012 berghuijs et al 2014 donnelly et al 2016 spatial process patterns are derived using a large set of catchments van esse et al 2013 gupta et al 2014 köplin et al 2012 markstrom et al 2016 however in detailed diagnostic model analyses modelled process dynamics can be related to catchment characteristics using a small set of representative case studies to demonstrate the methodological approach van werkhoven et al 2009 euser et al 2013 herman et al 2013 massmann et al 2014 melsen et al 2016a for this complex hydrological models need to accurately reproduce the complexity of different process relevances in contrasting catchments diagnostic approaches have been proven suitable to identify the causes for hydrological similarity carrillo et al 2011 hrachowitz et al 2013 in several diagnostic model analyses the modelled impact of spatial and temporal variations in dominant processes on the hydrological behaviour is highlighted reusser et al 2009 herman et al 2013 herman et al 2013 guse et al 2014 pfannerstill et al 2015 guse et al 2016b a dominant process is here defined as the most relevant process in a model for a certain time period the relevance of a certain process varies both in time and between different catchments resulting in differences in the relevance of the corresponding model components markstrom et al 2016 as considered in flexible model structures clark et al 2008 fenicia et al 2011 euser et al 2013 coxon et al 2014 a hydrologically consistent model needs to be able to simulate differences in dominant processes and to reproduce them in temporal parameter patterns in coincidence with the observed processes in the catchment pfannerstill et al 2015 donnelly et al 2016 to reproduce both spatial and temporal dynamics processes and their relevance need to be represented accurately in model structure and model parameters wagener et al 2003 a variation in the process relevance in time will inevitably result in a change in parameter sensitivity van werkhoven et al 2008 herman et al 2013 pfannerstill et al 2015 guse et al 2016a parameter sensitivity analysis is increasingly used to improve our understanding of how process dynamics behave in models in the temporal dynamics of parameter sensitivity tedpas reusser et al 2011 the sensitivity of model parameters is analysed for each time step in this way also the dominant processes in the model are derived for each day and based on this temporal changes in dominant processes are precisely pointed out reusser et al 2011 guse et al 2014 the resulting temporal patterns of dominant model parameters depend both on the model structure itself and on the hydrological characteristics of the catchment euser et al 2013 massmann et al 2014 fovet et al 2015 pfannerstill et al 2015 guse et al 2016b several studies have shown that the relevance of model parameters and their sensitivity on modelled output changes in space and time and results in a typical fingerprint of how a model represents catchment processes reusser et al 2011 guse et al 2014 markstrom et al 2016 while tedpas was already successfully applied in different catchments reusser et al 2011 guse et al 2016b an analysis of how different catchment characteristics affect temporal patterns of dominant processes and parameters is still missing in this study it is investigated how spatio temporal dynamics in processes and model parameters are related to typical catchment characteristics and in which aspects contrasting catchments behave similar thus this study aims to analyse two points first we analyse how catchment metrics as typical characteristics of catchments are related to spatio temporal variability of dominant processes and parameters based on this we investigate whether a hydrological model that aims to be globally applicable is able to emphasise the dominant processes and their corresponding parameters in contrasting catchments second we investigate how spatial variability in catchment metrics modelled processes and dominant parameters contribute to understand the dis similarity between catchments thus catchment similarity is assessed based on data and model results i e in modelled processes as well as by looking at variations in parameter dominances in space and time we intend to analyse how the understanding of process behaviour in models benefits from using parameter dominances for analysing catchment similarity we hypothesise that by comparing all three types of information for contrasting catchments similarities and differences between catchments and more specifically between the controlling processes can be derived these two points result in the following main research questions can a universally applicable hydrological model represent the characteristics of contrasting catchments by typical dominant processes and parameter dynamics how do catchment metrics modelled processes and dominant parameters contribute to explain similarities and differences between contrasting catchments 2 materials and methods the methodical approach is described in fig 1 it is based on three pillars data based catchment metrics modelled processes and dominant model parameters we hypothesise that by comparing all three types of information for contrasting catchments i it can be analysed how differences in catchment metrics are reproduced in temporal variations of both dominant processes and dominant model parameters and ii similarities and differences between the catchments can be derived 2 1 study catchments and catchment metrics the study catchments can be classified along an elevation gradient from alpine catchments with high elevations via mid range mountains to lowland catchments to consider these catchment types four catchments were selected for this study that are spatially distributed in germany and cover different types of landscapes fig 2 the treene catchment is a typical lowland catchment which is situated in the north of germany catchment outlet treia 481 km2 the kinzig catchment belongs to the mid range mountains catchment outlet hanau 925 km2 the kinzig flows into the river main in central germany the upper saale catchment at the gauge blankenstein 1019 km2 is located in southeastern germany and used as an example for a mid range mountain catchment the ammer is in southern germany and is a typical alpine catchment and flows into the ammer lake the gauge station peissenberg catchment size 299 km2 is used for the model analysis we characterised our study areas by catchment metrics table 1 with respect to five categories topography land use temperature precipitation and discharge for the dynamic variables precipitation temperature and discharge monthly values and the seasonality index are shown for the period from 2000 to 2010 a higher seasonality index indicates a higher variability within the year for further details see coopersmith et al 2012 coopersmith et al 2014 guse et al 2016a the elevation increases from treene via kinzig and saale to the ammer catchment in contrast the slope is slightly larger in the kinzig compared to the saale catchment the mean slope of 1 3 assigns the treene catchment to the lowlands the ammer has the highest elevation gradient of the four study catchments and largest slope class see 75 quantile in table 1 which is much larger than in the other catchments the treene catchment is largely dominated by agricultural land in contrast the three other catchments are dominated by both agriculture and forest the mean annual temperature ranges between 7 9 c saale and 10 1 c kinzig the largest seasonality in temperature was observed in the saale catchment 2 2 soil and water assessment tool swat a hydrological model was used to provide temporal patterns of different hydrological processes and of parameter sensitivities the eco hydrological model swat soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 was used in the modified version swat3s with three aquifers including two active ones pfannerstill et al 2014a named the swat model in the following the swat model calculates the major hydrological processes model outputs are provided in a daily resolution for each subbasin as the finest spatially located unit these subbasins are further spatially subdivided into hydrological response units hrus based on same information in land use soil and slope class the swat model distinguishes between a land and a water phase at the land phase the three typical catchment functions partitioning storage and release of water are considered precipitation is partitioned into snow and rain storage changes are calculated for different soil layers and the three aquifers water is released via evapotranspiration and different runoff components actual evapotranspiration is calculated based on potential evapotranspiration and water availability on the current day in addition to surface runoff subsurface runoff components are included within the soil lateral flow and artificial tile flow due to drainage activities are distinguished groundwater flow is released from the two active aquifers fast and slow groundwater flow all runoff components are summed up at each subbasin to calculate water yield in the water phase runoff is routed from one subbasin to the next a modelling period from 1997 to 2010 was used in all catchments including a warm up period of three years twelve model parameters were selected in this study table 2 and described briefly below to capture all relevant processes we selected those model parameters that are expected to be of relevance in at least one of the catchments for a more detailed description of the model parameters we refer to neitsch et al 2011 parameter ranges were selected based on experiences in other swat studies e g guse et al 2014 pfannerstill et al 2014b 2015 guse et al 2016a b three snow parameters were included the snowfall temperature sftmp defines the temperature when snow falls whilst snow melting is controlled by the snowmelt temperature smtmp the third snow parameter snocovmx expresses the lowest amount of snow which lead to a full snow cover the curve number method cn2 scs 1972 is included in the swat model to regulate the amount of infiltrating water and thus the occurrence of surface runoff flow time of surface runoff lateral flow and tile flow to the river is regulated by surlag lattime and gdrain respectively the available soil water capacity sol awc can be differentiated for each soil layer in the different soil types the soil evaporation factor esco is used to parameterise a nonlinear function for contribution of soil water from different soil depths to evaporation fast and slow aquifers are differentiated in the swat3s model version three groundwater parameters were used retention time in recharging the first aquifer is controlled by the groundwater retention parameter gw delayfsh available water in the aquifers is partitioned into the two aquifers by the aquifer fraction coefficient rchrgssh subsequently the baseflow retention factor alpha bfssh regulates the timing of groundwater flow from the slow aquifer to the main river the swat models for the treene and saale catchments were used as described in guse et al 2016b for the kinzig catchment we used a 25 m resolution dem hvbg 2001 the atkis vector land use map bkg 2013 and soil properties from a 1 200 000 soil map bgr 1999 as well as 13 rain gauges two temperature and wind four humidity and one solar radiation stations see kakouei et al 2018 for details the kinzig reservoir was implemented in the model based on dam and reservoir properties and release rules in the ammer and kinzig catchments where elevation ranges exceed 500 m we included elevation bands to differentiate precipitation and temperature in all subbasins in elevation distances of 50 m for the ammer catchment global datasets on topography srtm dem jarvis et al 2008 nasa jpl 2013 and soil hwsd 2009 as well as the atkis vector map bkg 2013 were used moreover we implemented 13 rain gauges and five temperature gauges see kiesel et al 2019 2 3 spatio temporal dynamics in processes and model parameters in this study the fast fourier amplitude sensitivity test was used cukier et al 1973 saltelli et al 2006 with the r package fast reusser 2015 fast provides the parameter settings for the 579 model simulations which are required to derive sensitivities for twelve model parameters all model parameters are modified simultaneously for each catchment identical parameter combinations were tested in model simulations covering the whole parameter space these model simulations were used to derive spatio temporal variations in both modelled processes and model parameters the model simulations were at first used to derive daily time series of different modelled hydrological components which were extracted for each of the 579 model simulations hydrological component is a more general notation including hydrological processes state variables and other hydrological variables as hydrological components we have selected precipitation snowfall actual evapotranspiration water yield runoff ratio surface runoff lateral flow and subsurface flow water yield is the amount of water flowing from the land phase into the river daily model results for the selected hydrological components were monthly averaged for the entire modeling period for each model simulation a monthly resolution was selected as appropriate temporal scale to detect typical fingerprints of catchment behaviour their variability was detected based on variations in parameter values within the model simulations concerning model parameters the temporal dynamics of parameter sensitivity tedpas reusser et al 2011 calculate parameter sensitivities in daily resolution temporal variations in parameter dominance were increasingly investigated in recent years sieber and uhlenbrook 2005 cloke et al 2008 guse et al 2014 haas et al 2015 pfannerstill et al 2015 to extract the maximum information about parameter impact on hydrological behaviour of a model tedpas uses directly model results and can thus be applied to all outputs which are provided by the model in a daily resolution guse et al 2016b parameter sensitivity is expressed here as partial variance which is defined as ratio of first order variance of a parameter divided by the total variance for this day guse et al 2016b suggested a monthly aggregation of the daily sensitivity to obtain easily interpretable patterns of typical parameter dynamics in this study daily time series of discharge were used to estimate parameter sensitivities the dominant parameters to discharge were detected for each day and based on this typical patterns of parameter dominances were characterised for more detailed information about tedpas we refer to reusser et al 2011 as well as to the initial tedpas study with the swat model in guse et al 2014 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal variability in measured precipitation and discharge the four catchments were compared in terms of mean and variability standard deviation of two major hydrological variables i e measured time series of precipitation and runoff in a monthly resolution fig 3 mean annual precipitation in the ammer catchment 1310 mm a table 1 is much larger than in the three other catchments precipitation amount is significantly higher in summer in the ammer catchment with a value about three times as large as in winter see also table 1 illustrating the highest variability in precipitation among the four catchments in contrast precipitation patterns are similar for the treene saale and kinzig catchments with low seasonal variations and a slightly higher precipitation in summer in all catchments precipitation variability is highest in summer and increases with increasing precipitation overall seasonal precipitation patterns are similar for mean and variability in all catchments runoff patterns are similar in treene kinzig and saale with high values in winter and low values in summer at the beginning of spring these three catchments are characterised by a strong decline in runoff ending up in a dry phase in autumn the runoff time series of the treene catchment is smoothest as indicated by the lowest standard deviation runoff variability for saale and kinzig is in particular higher in the winter period this indicates a high retention in lowlands and a faster hydrological response in mid range mountain catchments the ammer catchment is characterised by different runoff patterns compared to the other catchments the highest runoff occurs from spring to summer and fluctuations throughout the year are lower compared to the other catchments the lowest monthly average discharge occurs in january thus in winter runoff is lower than in the three other catchments the correlation between monthly precipitation and runoff is highest for the ammer catchment with 0 71 for mean and 0 89 for standard deviation high precipitation and high runoff coincide except in spring the hydrological system is thus characterised by a fast runoff response to precipitation events fig 3 whereas low precipitation in winter and storage in snow lead to minimum runoff values in spring precipitation is relatively low compared to runoff and snowmelt evokes an increase in water yield without additional high amounts of precipitation the largest values in standard deviation were detected for both precipitation and runoff values in the ammer catchment standard deviation increases in particular in high flow periods here peaks in mean and variability in runoff coincide in their seasonal occurrence high runoff variability in the ammer catchment in august indicates a high contribution of surface runoff in contrast for the three other catchments the correlations are negative for both mean and standard deviation with a value up to 0 53 in the correlation between the standard deviation of monthly precipitation and runoff in the saale catchment the largest variability in precipitation is detected in the saale catchment in summer whilst runoff variability has its maximum in winter thus variability in precipitation is related to the occurrence of intense summer events whereas runoff variability is controlled by the interplay between snow and rain driven runoff processes the negative correlation occurs due to a stronger retention in the catchment leading to a higher contribution of subsurface flow as well as to higher losses due to evapotranspiration 3 2 modelled hydrological components before presenting modelled patterns of temporal process dominance model performance in the four catchments for the entire modelling period 2000 2010 is briefly summarised these model performance values represent the median values of the model simulations within the sensitivity analysis it was hereby not our goal to show the best results of a calibrated model the information on performance criteria is added to provide a rough idea of how the model is performing and to demonstrate that the model can be used for our purpose median values of kge are 0 73 treene 0 72 kinzig 0 61 saale and 0 38 ammer and of pbias 10 7 treene 20 8 kinzig 2 5 saale and 9 3 ammer even though that kge values are not satisfactory for each model run we assume that the general catchment behavior is represented realistically for each of the catchments as shown in fig 4 the average behaviour of different modelled hydrological components throughout the year is illustrated in fig 4 above to analyse how catchment characteristics are reproduced by the model snowfall is most relevant both in magnitude and duration in the ammer catchment at the beginning of the year snowfall amounts in the saale catchment are higher than in kinzig and treene catchments in contrast at the end of the year snowfall is similar in saale and kinzig catchments actual evapotranspiration shows a typical seasonal pattern driven by radiation its impact on seasonal runoff pattern is of relevance in summer and autumn and is highest in the ammer catchment however the seasonal patterns for evapotranspiration are not controlling discharge patterns due to the large temporal variations in precipitation and snowmelt the three other catchments treene saale kinzig are characterised by high precipitation in summer but the highest discharge in winter the high influence of actual evapotranspiration leads to these seasonal discharge patterns due to highest values of both precipitation and evapotranspiration in summer no coincidence is observed between temporal patterns in precipitation and runoff this is also shown in similar monthly patterns of runoff ratios in all catchments with the highest values in spring the runoff regime median values for total water yield in fig 4 of the ammer catchment shows two distinct peaks driven by snowmelt march and rainfall august respectively snow accumulation strongly buffers the hydrological response the runoff regime of the other catchments is characterised by only one less distinct peak in march this is mainly caused by the seasonal cycle of evapotranspiration and to a smaller extent also by snowmelt regarding runoff components surface runoff in particular in early spring and late summer and lateral flow in spring and summer are the major contributing runoff components in the ammer catchment in the kinzig catchment lateral flow is dominant throughout the entire year with low variability while surface runoff and subsurface flow are important in winter similarly to the kinzig catchment lateral flow is relevant in the saale catchment however in the saale the relevance of subsurface flow is higher while surface runoff is of lower relevance in contrast the hydrological system in the treene lowland catchment is controlled by subsurface flow in particular in winter while the two other runoff components are of lower relevance all catchments show a typical hierarchical pattern of process occurrence yilmaz et al 2008 pfannerstill et al 2015 in high flow phases different runoff components from surface or fast reacting subsurface up to groundwater in the treene catchment dominate while groundwater is dominating in the non alpine catchments in phases of low flows a higher variability occurs due to higher contribution of fast reacting runoff components such as it is shown when comparing winter discharge patterns between the four catchments 3 3 impact of parameter settings on modelled hydrological components the variance in monthly values of the hydrological components throughout the year indicates how different parameter settings influence the relevance of these hydrological components fig 4 below high variance indicates high relevance of parameter settings which means that they highly modify the contribution of this hydrological component in general one would expect that the pattern of variances follows the pattern of medians as it is true for snowfall for all catchments the impact of swat model parameter settings matches with the contribution of snowfall however there are quite a few exceptions for some hydrological components and catchments where high variances do not coincide with high medians variability in surface runoff is remarkably high in the ammer catchment the highest variance is detected in august and the highest median in march thus the impact of parameter settings is higher in summer whilst probably changes in snow parameters have a lower impact on the modelled amount of surface runoff variance in lateral flow is high in the saale catchment and low in the kinzig catchment in contrast median values are higher in the kinzig than in the saale catchment two distinct peaks of subsurface flow occurred in may and november in the treene catchment while the median curve has only one prolonged peak in winter in consequence variances for total water yield are remarkably different across the ensemble of catchments fig 4 below this implies more complex parameter sensitivity patterns for each catchment as expected by just looking at the average runoff regimes where only the ammer is markedly different in the ammer catchment the highest variability in water yield is detected in summer while it is relatively low in spring indicating that processes in summer e g evapotranspiration rain driven surface runoff are more impacted by parameter settings than processes in winter e g snowmelt in the treene catchment monthly patterns for median and variance do not match since the highest variability is observed in may and november while water yield has its highest values in winter thus the temporal variability of groundwater and water yield is very similar in the treene catchment showing that the groundwater parameter settings largely influence water yield in contrast in the saale catchment median and variance of monthly patterns are similar the variance in runoff ratio is high in april in the treene and saale catchments which is also the month with the highest runoff ratio while it is constant throughout the year in the two other catchments thus also the runoff ratio is strongly impacted by parameter settings in spring overall variance in modelled hydrological components and thus the impact of parameter settings is lowest in the kinzig catchment 3 4 monthly patterns of parameter sensitivity daily sensitivity results are aggregrated to mean monthly values of partial sensitivities for each model parameter fig 5 this allows an easier interpretation of the typical hydrological behaviour for each catchment as suggested by guse et al 2016b regarding the three snow parameters sftmp smtmp snocovmx sensitivity values and the number of months with a high sensitivity are increasing with the landscape gradient in the ammer catchment snowfall temperature sftmp is sensitive for a long period from early autumn up to late spring snowmelt temperature smtmp in contrast is not relevant before winter times the highest amount of snow in the ammer catchment results both in the highest sensitivity values for snow parameters and in the largest duration of snow relevance november to may there are differences both in snowmelt and in the intensity and duration of the dominance of snow parameters while the sensitivity values are higher in the kinzig compared to the saale catchment the duration of snow relevance is longer one month in the saale catchment fig 5 the curve number cn2 as representative for surface runoff in the swat model is only sensitive in summer in the ammer catchment whilst it is only of minor relevance in the other catchments the highest relevance of lateral flow in kinzig and ammer is reproduced in the dominance of lateral flow lag time lattime throughout the year while lattime is relevant throughout the whole year in the kinzig it is only dominant in the ammer from may to november due to the high relevance of snow processes in winter as evaporation parameter esco is mainly relevant in the second half of the year except for the saale catchment where esco is of low relevance throughout the year the groundwater retention time gw delayfsh is the major groundwater parameter in the non alpine catchments in particular in the treene catchment and is sensitive for the whole year the aquifer partitioning rchrgssh regulates the water distribution into the two aquifers and is sensitive in all catchments rchrgssh is relevant throughout the entire year due to high amount of water in both aquifers its lowest sensitivity values are detected in autumn in times of low discharge in the two mid range mountain catchments rchrgssh is in particular relevant for regulating water support in dry periods thus its highest sensitivity is observed in summer before the dry phase in autumn in the alpine ammer catchment groundwater flow is of minor importance rchrgssh has a low sensitivity in summer and is more relevant in winter times while the non alpine catchments are characterised by low flows in summer the ammer has the lowest phase in winter where water is retained as snow the baseflow recession of the second aquifer alpha bfssh is sensitive in summer and at the beginning of autumn in the non alpine catchments for these catchments a typical sequence of groundwater parameter sensitivity can be derived at first gw delayfsh is relevant at the beginning of the summer followed by a high sensitivity of rchrgssh subsequently in autumn in the dry season alpha bfssh as the model parameter from the deepest zone becomes sensitive 3 5 monthly patterns of dominant hydrological components in fig 6 the model parameter dominances are aggregated to explain the dominant hydrological components all parameters of a certain hydrological component are summed up and compared with the mean monthly discharge values in general the process dominance patterns show three markedly different phases for the non alpine catchments while for the ammer catchment only two phases can be detected for the treene catchment dominant patterns of hydrological components are typical for pluvial runoff regimes of lowlands with a high contribution of groundwater and low relevance of fast runoff and snow fig 6 a dominance of groundwater was detected throughout the year with maximum relevance from april to june highest relevance of groundwater parameters occur in the transition between spring and summer when they dominate over snow and evapotranspiration parameters in contrast the high impact of evapotranspiration in late summer reduces the relevance of groundwater parameters this pattern is also related to water availability in times of high water availability in spring when soils are close to saturation the settings of soil and evapotranspiration parameters do not largely influence actual evapotranspiration however in summer when soil water content is lower model parameters are more important to regulate the amount of available water for evapotranspiration the runoff maximum in winter is driven by groundwater with contribution of snow but not from fast runoff components the low relevance of fast reacting components could also be derived from low variability in runoff fig 3 the kinzig catchment shows a pluvio nivale regime with a rather small influence of snowmelt fig 6 snow parameters are relevant from december to march from april to july groundwater parameters dominate whilst from august to november a dominance of fast reacting and soil components is detected fast reacting components have the same level of high relevance throughout the year in autumn soil parameters become relevant to regulate evapotranspiration and soil water storage in the saale catchment the dominance patterns also show the typical hydrological behaviour for pluvio nivale regimes of mid range mountain catchments there is a strong influence of the snow component in the first four months of the year fast runoff components are slightly relevant during the year with low variability soil processes including evapotranspiration are in particular relevant in autumn october the groundwater component has the highest sensitivities in dry phases in summer from late summer to winter no component is highly dominant this shows the balanced situation between different dominant hydrological components finally in the ammer catchment with a nivale regime a clear break between the dominance by snow and surface runoff can be observed between may and june thus only two different dominant phases are detected high runoff values occur from march to september with a comparably low impact of evapotranspiration there is a direct transition to fast reacting runoff components due to high slopes with dominance from june to october whilst there is no important phase of groundwater recharge as indicated in the low sensitivity of groundwater snow processes are relevant from november to may with a discharge peak in april evoked by snowmelt at the end of the winter 4 discussion in this study we presented three ways of deriving hydrological dis similarity between catchments we detected how catchment characteristics are reflected in spatio temporal dynamics of modelled processes and parameter sensitivities in contrast to studies using a large set of catchments to classify them in a few groups köplin et al 2012 we directly focused our analysis on four catchments to study the hydrological characteristics of typical landscapes in germany carrillo et al 2011 have emphasised that signature based catchment characterisation is a first approach to explain hydrologic behaviour the comparison of catchment metrics among the four catchments disentangles similarities and differences between the catchments differences are prominent in the landscape structure resulting in a typical gradient from north to south while the catchment structure is different for the non alpine catchments lowland vs mid range mountains the differences in the forcing by precipitation is small this also results in small differences in the monthly discharge regime thus the impact of precipitation on the total discharge regime is stronger than the impact of landscape structure thus first insights for differences in the contribution of runoff components between the four catchments are already detected in catchment metrics but to explain the overall hydrologic behaviour more detailed diagnostic analyses are needed our study has demonstrated how different processes are reproduced in model applications for the four catchments modelled processes provide additional information which cannot be directly derived from measured time series of precipitation and discharge and resulting catchment metrics it is shown that using monthly patterns of different modelled runoff components improves the understanding of hydrological behaviour and the explanation of similarities and differences between catchments in the ammer catchment seasonal dynamics in radiation impact discharge dynamics here snowmelt is the governing hydrological process in the winter half year in the alpine catchment due to low temperatures since surface processes are a driver for discharge i e surface runoff and snowmelt the strongest link between precipitation and discharge occurs in the ammer catchment seasonal process patterns in the treene kinzig and saale catchments are mainly driven by evapotranspiration in summer and by precipitation in winter these results coincide with former studies demonstrating that high flows occur in phases of high precipitation and low demand for evapotranspiration whilst low flow phases are related to a high demand for evapotranspiration patil and stieglitz 2011 guse et al 2016a a low relationship between daily precipitation and discharge is detected for the three non alpine catchments since they are controlled by subsurface flows lateral or groundwater flow however the relationship between precipitation and discharge in the treene lowland catchment with a strong dominance of groundwater flow is not lower compared to the two mid range mountain catchments kinzig and saale which are also controlled by lateral flow thus based on our study we can state that the direct link between daily precipitation and discharge is low if subsurface processes dominate irrespective of the type of subsurface flow as emphasised by wagener et al 2007 the interpretation of subsurface flow is more complicated due to less available data more information than precipitation and total discharge is helpful to explain subsurface processes a core point of this study was to show how the analysis of temporal variations in dominant model parameters contributes to explain similarities and differences between catchments carrillo et al 2011 showed by constructing linear regressions that only a few model parameters are connected to typical characteristics of several catchments in the usa in our study we intensified the diagnostic analysis from the methodological point of view as also shown by donnelly et al 2016 an analysis of different aspects of hydrologic behaviour in the model demonstrates whether the set of model parameters can reflect differences between contrasting catchments while donnelly et al 2016 focused on flow signatures our study used daily time series of modelled hydrological components and parameter sensitivity to investigate the relationship of model parameters and catchment characteristics a couple of new insights were derived from these temporal sensitivity patterns an example for a model structure characteristic is the soil evaporation parameter esco which controls the contribution of soil water from deeper zones to the evaporation process the more water evaporates from soil the less is stored in the soil and thus the less is available in dry phases thus esco is important in particular in the dry periods in autumn its temporal patterns of parameter sensitivity indicate the occurrence of dry conditions as a characteristic of the model structure the temporal parameter sensitivity analysis in the four catchments shows that the relevance of model parameters varies between the catchments although a similar behaviour in time is detected for snow and groundwater parameters the relevance of those model parameters is different between the catchments this is for example shown in the comparison of snow processes between the two mid range mountain catchments saale kinzig in the saale catchment the duration of high relevance of snow parameters is longer than in the kinzig catchment while sensitivity values are higher in the kinzig than in the saale catchment different parameter settings as realised within the sensitivity analysis have a low impact on surface and lateral flows since main factors controlling fast runoff such as slope land use and precipitation were not varied throughout the analysis thus the relevance of these fast occurring processes is not highly impacted by parameter settings while subsurface processes are strongly controlled by parameter settings subsequently the criteria from the three groups i e catchment metrics modelled processes and dominant parameters are jointly considered fig 7 each single criterion is presented as relative relevance in one catchment to derive typical catchment characteristics a relative relevance is the value for one catchment expressed as the percentage of the sum of all catchments the different criteria are weighted in font size according to their relevance in comparison with the other catchments the three tiered analysis shows that major differences between the ammer and the three non alpine catchments are emphasised in the catchment metrics as an alpine catchment the ammer is strongly impacted by topographical factors such as elevation and slope and by surface processes such as snow and surface runoff as well as the corresponding model parameters catchment metrics are mainly related to processes occurring at the land surface thus the differentiation in terms of hydrological characteristics are more difficult between the three other catchments since they are mainly controlled by subsurface processes the treene catchment can be characterised by the large share of agricultural areas as well as by the dominance of groundwater and tile flow the relevance of these subsurface processes becomes apparent by analysing the modelled processes hydrologic characterisation is even more complex for the two mid range mountain catchments kinzig saale compared to ammer or treene catchments kinzig and saale catchments are not characterised by the strong dominance of some criteria a differentiation between both catchments is possible due to the distinct monthly patterns of dominant parameters the larger the relevance of subsurface processes and the more similar the catchments are in their metrics the more beneficial is the proposed three tiered approach for a clear characterisation of contrasting catchments this gained knowledge can furthermore enable a more efficient and targeted model calibration the presented model results of this study are derived with a rather complex hydrological model to appropriately represent the hydrological system with a high demand of computational resources in future studies it might be worth checking if a model with a lower complexity and simpler process depiction is still able to depict the system sufficiently see wagener et al 2003 5 conclusion and outlook in this study catchment metrics modelled processes and dominant parameters are jointly analysed in four catchments our study clearly shows that typical characteristics of the four study catchments are reflected in the relevance of hydrological processes and model parameters temporal dynamics in modelled proceses and parameters coincide with the regime types of the catchments and are a typical fingerprint of catchment characteristics thus catchment characteristics process dominance temporal patterns of model parameters and catchment regime type are closely linked it is shown how a hydrological model represents different processes in contrasting catchments the joint analysis of catchment metrics modelled processes and parameter dominances enabled a clear identification of major differences and similarities between the catchments and contributed to explain causes of catchment similarity this approach was applied to contrasting catchments using only one model in further studies it would be interesting to apply this methodological approach with different hydrological models to derive similarities and differences in temporal patterns of modelled processes and dominant parameters in the same catchments conflict of interest none

6744,accurate estimation of soil hydraulic parameters is essential for modeling of water flow and solute transport in unsaturated soil ensemble based methods have been proposed to provide the optimal monitoring data collection strategy to improve hydraulic parameter estimation to guarantee the performance however these methods usually require relatively large ensemble sizes leading to high computational cost to this end we develop an efficient sequential probabilistic collocation based optimal design spcod method which integrates the adaptive anova analysis of variance based probabilistic collocation based kalman filter with the sequential optimal design at the forecast step the probabilistic collocation method is used to construct a reduced order surrogate for system model with the adaptive anova based polynomial chaos expansion pce at the design step an information metric in the pce form is derived to evaluate candidate monitoring strategies the one with the maximum expected information metric value is chosen as the optimal at the analysis step the pce coefficients are sequentially updated by a square root kalman filter with the real time measurements obtained from the optimal monitoring strategy two synthetic numerical cases involving water flow and solute transport in the vadose zone are employed to illustrate the performance of the proposed method the results show that 1 compared with conventional fixed monitoring strategies the optimal monitoring strategy designed by spcod provides more accurate parameter estimation and state prediction 2 compared with our previously developed sequential ensemble based optimal design method man et al 2016b the new approach provides a more robust and accurate optimal monitoring design with nearly the same computational cost 1 introduction to make reliable predictions of water flow and solute transport in unsaturated soil it is essential to accurately characterize the soil hydraulic conductivity and water retention parameters nowadays it is a common practice to estimate these soil hydraulic parameters from observed hydraulic state variables e g negative pressure head water content soil temperature and solute concentration for examples nowak and cirpka 2006 presented a geostatistical method for hydraulic conductivity and dispersivities inference from hydraulic heads and tracer data li and ren 2011 and shi et al 2015 employed the ensemble kalman filter enkf to estimate unsaturated soil hydraulic parameters by assimilating pressure head measurements klepikova et al 2016 implemented a pilot point method to invert temperature data for characterizing the hydraulic conductivity field xu and gómez hernández 2016 used the normal score enkf for characterization of non gaussian conductivities and porosities by assimilating hydraulic heads solute concentrations and water temperatures regarding recent progresses of the inverse modeling in hydrologic studies one may refer to zhou et al 2014 and vereecken et al 2016 for details for subsurface problems however monitoring campaigns are usually expensive to conduct as the sampling and chemical analysis are generally cost intensive and time demanding it is intuitively understandable that the accuracy of parameter estimation can be improved by assimilating informative measurements constrained by the limited budget and time it is therefore wise to assess the data worth of measurements before they are actually collected this necessitates the optimal monitoring design i e to determine when and where to take measurements to maximize the data worth dai et al 2016 lu et al 2018 neuman et al 2012 wang et al 2018 the approaches for monitoring design can be generally divided into two classes batch design and sequential design the former involves all the monitoring designs concurrently while the latter involves feedbacks from previous results and conducts monitoring design sequentially some researches relevant to batch design have been reported herrera and pinder 2005 conducted the space time optimization of groundwater quality monitoring networks using kalman filter kollat et al 2011 combined enkf with multi objective evolutionary optimization to improve long term groundwater monitoring zhang et al 2015 proposed an efficient bayesian monitoring design method for contaminant source identification nowak and guthke 2016 used a preposterior analysis to optimize the model discrimination in contaminant transport on the aspect of sequential design prakash and datta 2015 integrated a simulated annealing optimization algorithm with the sequential monitoring network design for accurate source characterization gharamti et al 2015 proposed a greedy observational design approach to improve the prediction accuracy of hydrologic contaminant state via enkf geiges et al 2015 conducted a comparison of batch and sequential designs for some nonlinear parameter estimation problems and showed that the sequential design was more beneficial than the batch design in our previous work man et al 2016b a sequential ensemble based optimal design seod method which integrates enkf with the sequential optimal design was developed for unsaturated hydraulic parameter estimation its applicability has also been demonstrated in estimating physical and geochemical parameters of reactive transport models lan et al 2018 in seod a relatively large ensemble size is necessary to guarantee the convergence of optimal design and the accuracy of parameter estimation as a result it is often computationally expensive to run seod especially for those cpu intensive hydrologic models in the past decade polynomial chaos expansion pce which allows high order approximation of random variables has gained popularity in efficient uncertainty quantification ghanem and spanos 2003 linde et al 2017 a pce based kalman filter for reservoir characterization was developed in saad and ghanem 2009 where the system states of interest were represented by a set of orthogonal pce basis functions and the galerkin scheme was employed to calculate the pce coefficients this method is intrusive in that extra efforts are required to solve the derived galerkin equation alternatively the probabilistic collocation method pcm tatang et al 1997 is an efficient non intrusive approach which can be used for determining the pce coefficients zeng et al 2011 2010 developed a pcm based kalman filter pckf for history matching as an alternative to enkf to further improve the performance li et al 2014 and man et al 2016a integrated adaptive anova analysis of variance decomposition with pckf for high dimensional nonlinear problems more recently an efficient anova based transformed pcm was developed for the batch optimal monitoring design in the vadose zone man et al 2017 inspired by the recent progresses in monitoring design and uncertainty quantification this study develops a computationally efficient method i e sequential probabilistic collocation based optimal design spcod to improve the accuracy of parameter estimation in this method the adaptive anova based pckf is used as a data assimilation tool and the monitoring strategy with the maximum expected data worth is to provide the measurements in each data assimilation loop the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 formulates the procedures of spcod algorithm for monitoring design the efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated by two synthetic numerical cases in section 3 finally we draw some conclusions in section 4 2 methods the core idea of the sequential optimal design is to select the most informative measurements by maximizing the expected data worth indicated by an information metric before each analysis step which is also called preposterior analysis leube et al 2012 in our previously developed seod method the information metric is approximated using ensemble realizations to guarantee the convergence of optimal design a relatively large ensemble size is usually required leading to a considerable computational cost while in this work a computationally more efficient sequential optimal design method i e sequential probabilistic collocation based optimal design spcod is developed the key in spcod is to formulate the preposterior analysis in the pce form at design steps once the actual measurements are obtained from the designed monitoring strategy the pce coefficients are updated at the analysis step this method consisting of an iterative forecast design and analysis data assimilation loop is summarized as follows i forecast step at each forecast step of spcod the uncertain model parameters m and state variables s are approximated by a set of orthogonal hermite pce basis functions ψ j ξ zeng et al 2011 1 m ξ j 0 q c j m ψ j ξ 2 s ξ j 0 q c j s ψ j ξ where ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ m is a vector consisting of m independent standard gaussian random variables c j m j 0 1 2 q are the pce coefficients for model parameters which are preset according to the prior statistics of m c j s j 0 1 2 q are the pce coefficients for state variables which are to be determined by pcm li and zhang 2007 li et al 2009 with a given polynomial degree the number of pce basis functions grows exponentially as the random dimensionality m increases resulting in a prohibitively large computational cost for determining the pce coefficients i e c j s j 0 1 2 q especially for high dimensional problems to address this issue in spcod we apply the functional anova decomposition li et al 2001 to the state variables with the functional anova decomposition each state variable s can be expressed as 3 s ξ f ξ f 0 j 1 m f j ξ j 1 j k m m f jk ξ j ξ k f 1 2 m ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ m where the function f 1 2 w with w argument variables ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ w is called w th order anova component in many practical problems the coupling effects among multiple input variables are usually small or even negligible thus it is rational to approximate the state variable s with the summation of several low order anova components as evidenced in li et al 2002 the anova components up to the second order are usually sufficient to provide a satisfactory description of f ξ in this study we keep all the 1st order anova components and then adaptively select the 2nd order anova components according to the variance namely using the adaptive anova decomposition interested readers can refer to ma and zabaras 2010 and yang et al 2012 for details with the truncated anova components we construct the pce representation for the state variable by expanding each component into pce since the random variables are gaussian distributed the hermite polynomials xiu and karniadakis 2003 are used for example the first three one dimensional pce basis functions are ψ 0 ξ 1 ψ 1 ξ ξ and ψ 2 ξ ξ 2 1 2 on this basis the 1st order anova components can be expanded as follows 4 f 1 ξ 1 j 0 2 c j ψ j ξ 1 c 0 c 1 ξ 1 c 2 ξ 1 2 1 2 for a component function f 1 2 ξ 1 ξ 2 we formulate its pce basis functions from the tensor product of the one dimensional basis i e 5 f 1 2 ξ 1 ξ 2 j 0 2 k 0 2 c jk ψ j ξ 1 ψ k ξ 2 c 00 c 01 ξ 2 c 02 ξ 2 2 1 2 c 10 ξ 1 c 11 ξ 1 ξ 2 c 12 ξ 1 ξ 2 2 1 2 c 20 ξ 1 2 1 2 c 21 ξ 2 ξ 1 2 1 2 c 22 ξ 1 2 1 ξ 2 2 1 2 then pcm is employed to determine the pce coefficients in pcm with different sets of collocation points we evaluate the component f 1 2 w ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ w and make it equal to the corresponding polynomials for a one dimensional pce with the highest polynomial degree of k the collocation points are positioned at the roots of the k 1 th polynomial specifically for a one dimensional second order hermite pce the collocation points are the roots of the third order hermite polynomial ξ 3 3 ξ 6 i e 3 0 and 3 while for a multidimensional pce the collocation points are formulated from the tensor product of the one dimensional collocation points after expanding the retained anova components into pce we formulate the final pce representations of state variables by summing up all the pce terms which is much less costly than directly expanding the state variables with pce suppose that the number of retained 2nd order anova components is n then the total required number of collocation points is only 1 2 m 4 n n m m 1 2 ii optimal design at this step we conduct the preposterior analysis in the form of pce with the pce representations in eq 1 the prior mean b and covariance b of model parameters can be easily calculated from the pce coefficients i e 6 b c 0 m 7 b

where ε are the gaussian measurement errors with zeros means and covariance matrix r note that at this preposterior analysis step d are the possible measurements since the actual monitoring campaign has not been implemented with the pce representations of the states s in eq 2 the possible measurement realizations can be generated as follows 9 d i d ξ i ε i h j 0 q c j s ψ j ξ i ε i i 1 2 n e j 0

generated by sampling eq 9 without solving the original model a large ne can be used to guarantee the accurate evaluation of the expected information metric with virtually no computational cost since only the mean and covariance parts are involved in the analysis step of kalman filter the information metrics based on the first order and second order statistics can be used in our previous work man et al 2016b three information metrics i e relative entropy re shannon entropy difference sd and degrees of freedom for signal dfs have been systematically investigated re measures both the mean and covariance parts while sd and dfs only measure the covariance part the numerical simulation results showed that they performed similarly in the optimal design therefore only sd is used to measure the information content of the given monitoring strategy h in this study sd is defined as the decrease in uncertainty from the prior covariance to the posterior covariance with the gaussian assumption it can be written as xu 2007 xu et al 2009 17 sd ln det ba 1 2 where det denotes the determinant note that in the kalman filter theory there exists a relation between the prior and posterior covariances i e a i kh b then the information content of the current measurement d i can be calculated as 18 s d d i ln det i kh 2 where k can be calculated using eq 12 it is easily known from eq 18 that the sd value is independent to the possible measurement realization d i in other words the sd values are the same for different possible measurement realizations thus the integration on the measurement ensemble can be omitted finally the information content of a given monitoring strategy can be obtained in the following analytical form 19 s d h ln det i kh 2 then a global optimization algorithm i e

design is implemented for the next step i e go back to step ⅰ the flowchart of this method is shown in fig 1 it should be noted that the collocation outputs at next time step are obtained by running the simulator from initial time with the updated parameter collocation realizations this scheme is entitled restart and avoids the inconsistency between the updated model parameters and outputs in strongly nonlinear problems moreover in this way only the pce representations of model outputs at candidate monitoring locations are calculated more discussion about this algorithm can refer to man et al 2016a 3 case study in this work two case studies of solute transport in the vadose zone are conducted to illustrate the validity of the proposed method here it is assumed that real time series of solute concentration cannot be obtained and one has to deal with chemical sampling which is cost intensive and time demanding then the spcod method is used to maximize the information gain from concentration measurements the governing equation of two dimensional unsaturated flow is expressed by the richards equation 23 θ t x k h h x z k h h z k h where θ is the soil water content l3l 3 at time t t h is the corresponding soil water pressure head l x and z are the horizontal and vertical spatial coordinates l respectively k h is the hydraulic conductivity function that varies with h which can be characterized by the van genuchten mualem vgm model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 24 k h k s s e 0 5 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 m 1 1 n 25 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α h n 1 1 n h 0 1 h 0 where ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 se is the effective saturation θs and θr are the saturated and residual water content l3l 3 respectively α l 1 and n are the shape parameters related to the soil pore size distribution the governing equation of two dimensional solute transport can be expressed by the advection dispersion equation bear 1972 26 c t z d xz c x q z c z where c is the solute concentration ml 3 and dxz is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor l2t 1 given by 27 d xz d x q δ xz d z d x q x q z q d d δ xz where q is the darcy velocity lt 1 δxz is the kronecker delta function dx and dz are the transverse and longitudinal dispersion coefficients l respectively dd is the molecular diffusion coefficient l2t 1 the sketch of the study domain 100 cm wide 200 cm deep is illustrated in fig 2 this domain is discretized into 21 41 861 nodes of which the 21 marked nodes represent the candidate locations for solute concentration monitoring initially the pressure head is 200 cm at the top and linearly changed to 0 at the bottom representing a hydrostatic condition a line source x 15 35 cm z 0 cm with concentration of 5 mg cm 3 is continuously released at a flow rate of 5 cm d 1 the top and two lateral sides are impervious boundaries except for several top boundary nodes representing the line source at the bottom of the soil profile a free drainage condition is imposed for water flow while a cauchy mixed boundary condition is invoked for solute transport 3 1 case 1 the estimation of homogeneous k field in the first case the soil profile is assumed to be homogeneous and the soil is loamy sand the transverse and longitudinal dispersion coefficients are assumed known as dx 10 cm dz 50 cm the simulated infiltration time is 8 days and the solute concentration at one monitoring location is measured every 1 day three hydraulic parameters ks α n are assumed unknown and to be estimated by assimilating the solute concentration measurements the prior distributions of ks and n for loamy sand are given by carsel and parrish 1988 using the multivariate normal johnson transformation approach i e 28 u ln v a b v where v denotes the hydraulic parameter before transformation within the range a b u denotes the transformed variable with gaussian distribution the prior statistics used for distribution approximation and the correlations among transformed variables are presented in tables 1 and 2 carsel and parrish 1988 note that the factored covariance matrix l t shown in table 2 is obtained by the lu decomposition i e 29 c u ll t where u is a vector consisting of transformed variables cu is the prescribed covariance matrix among transformed variables l is a lower triangular matrix and the superscript t denotes transpose the realizations of transformed variables can be generated as follows 30 u u l ξ where u is a vector comprised of the mean values of transformed variables ξ is a random vector consisting of standard multivariate gaussian variables it should be noted that the first step in spcod is to parameterize the random inputs with uncorrelated independent standard gaussian random variables in this case some of the random hydraulic parameters to be estimated are correlated non gaussian random variables thus they are firstly transformed to correlated gaussian random variables i e eq 28 then the lu decomposition is used to represent these transformed variables with uncorrelated standard gaussian variables i e eq 30 based on which the hermite pce can be implemented thus the pce form of transformed parameters can be expressed as 31 u m ξ c 0 m j 1 m c j m ψ j ξ where c 0 m u c j m l j ψ j ξ ξ j j 1 2 m note that the inverse transformation can be expressed with the following formulation 32 v b exp u a 1 exp u with the given prior statistics one set of hydraulic parameter realization is randomly generated and chosen as the true reference values then measurements of solute concentration are obtained by running the simulator with these true parameters the measurement errors are assumed to be independently gaussian distributed with mean zero and standard deviation of 0 01 mg cm 3 the optimal monitoring location at each assimilation step during the implementation of spcod is plotted in fig 3 it can be seen that the optimal monitoring location varies with the assimilation step and is mainly distributed around the solute front this indicates that the monitoring location around the front can provide the most informative measurements it is also noted that since the information of measurements are sequentially assimilated the optimal monitoring locations are strongly influenced by the specific group of reference parameters in fig 4 the estimated soil water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity function are calculated by sampling from the final pce representations of model parameters a good match between the estimated and true values is observed for both the water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity function furthermore the predicted solute concentrations along the central line x 50 cm are also calculated and matched to the actual measurements fig 5 it can be seen that the predicted data match with the actual measurements very well to illustrate the validity of the optimal design two conventional fixed monitoring strategies are chosen for comparisons the monitoring location is respectively fixed at o2 x 50 cm z 25 cm or o5 x 50 cm z 50 cm during the whole simulation time to avoid the accidental error caused by choosing only one parameter set 30 sets of parameters are randomly sampled from the prior distributions fig 6 plots the mean estimations of ks α n against respective true values it shows that the estimated results of parameter n are pretty good for all the designs this is because the parameter n is more sensitive to the concentration measurements even the conventional fixed monitoring strategies can provide sufficient information for the accurate estimation of n overall the correlations between the true and estimated parameters are much improved with the optimal design and the estimation error for each parameter is significantly reduced in practical applications however the true parameter values are actually unavailable the most straightforward way is to compare the match between the actual measurements and those predicted with the estimated parameters in this study the root mean square error defined on the model outputs at the candidate monitoring locations rmsed is used 33 rmse d 1 n o i 1 n o d i d i 2 where d and d denote the predicted and true values of solute concentration measurements at all measurement time steps respectively no is the total number of concentration outputs which equals to the product of time steps and number of monitoring locations here no 8 21 fig 7 presents the rmsed values calculated based on the mean estimations of parameters it is seen that although the conventional fixed monitoring locations can provide acceptable estimation accuracy the rmsed values provided by the optimal design are much lower this demonstrates that the estimation can be further improved if a dynamic monitoring strategy is implemented in a word the optimal monitoring strategy provided by spcod leads to more accurate parameter estimation and state prediction compared with the conventional fixed designs 3 2 case 2 the estimation of heterogeneous saturated hydraulic conductivity field in the second case α and n are assumed known α 0 02 cm 1 n 1 4 and the uncertainty stems from the heterogeneity in saturated hydraulic conductivity field ks the random field y ln k s is assumed gaussian distributed with mean μ y 3 0 and the following exponential covariance function 34 c y y x 1 z 1 y x 2 z 2 σ y 2 exp x 1 x 2 λ x 2 z 1 z 2 λ z 2 where σ y 2 0 3 is the variance λ x 40 cm and λ z 50 cm are the correlation lengths in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively the reference y field is randomly generated using the lu decomposition the heterogeneous saturated hydraulic conductivity field is discretized into the same number of 21 41 nodes leading to 861 unknown saturated hydraulic conductivities the large number of unknown conductivity parameters makes spcod computationally infeasible to address this issue one popular approach is to employ the karhunen loève expansion kle zhang and lu 2004 as a dimension reduction tool to parameterize the random field with a limited number of independent gaussian random variables 35 y y j 1 m λ j f j ξ j where λ j and f j are the j th eigenvalue and eigenvector of c y respectively eq 35 is equivalent to the pce form 36 y m ξ c 0 m j 1 m c j m ψ j ξ where c 0 m y c j m λ j f j ψ j ξ ξ j j 1 2 m with kle expansion the first 50 leading terms i e ξ j j 1 2 50 in eq 1 are kept in spcod thus the dimensionality is reduced from 861 to 50 and 86 4 of the total variance of the random field is retained with these truncated kle terms the initial realizations of log saturated hydraulic conductivity fields are randomly generated the whole simulation time lasts for 20 days and concentration measurements are obtained from three monitoring locations every 1 day when implementing spcod the three most informative monitoring locations for concentration measurements are selected from 21 candidate monitoring locations before each assimilation step three conventional monitoring strategies denoted by s1 s2 and s3 in fig 2 both with three fixed monitoring locations are taken for comparisons with a randomly chosen reference field the optimal monitoring locations at each assimilation step are plotted in fig 8 it is again shown that the monitoring locations around the solute front can generally provide the most informative measurements owing to the use of adaptive anova scheme the pce terms used for approximating the model outputs are adaptively selected at each assimilation step thus the computational cost in determining the pce coefficients varies with the assimilation step on the whole the average number of model evaluations per loop is 197 fig 9 plots the true log saturated hydraulic conductivity field and the mean estimations provided by the optimal design and three conventional designs it is shown that the main pattern of the reference field can be more accurately captured by the optimal design compared with the conventional designs by comparing figs 8 and 9a it can be seen that the solute plume propagates faster in the region with higher saturated hydraulic conductivity the variances of log saturated hydraulic conductivity fields provided by these four monitoring designs are plotted in fig 10 it is obvious that with the optimal design the variance of estimated log saturated hydraulic conductivity field is much lower this is because the dynamic optimal design provides the most informative measurements at each assimilation step leading to the larger uncertainty reduction to make quantitative comparisons of different monitoring designs in addition to the root mean square error defined on the model outputs i e rmsed the root mean square error defined on the log saturated hydraulic conductivity i e rmsem is used 37 rmse m 1 n g i 1 n g y i y i 2 where y and y denote the log saturated hydraulic conductivity of mean estimated and reference fields respectively n g 861 is the total number of nodes the performance indicator values calculated by different monitoring designs are compared in fig 11 it can be seen that all the performance indicator values provided by the optimal design are much smaller than those provided by the conventional designs therefore the superiority of spcod in estimating the saturated hydraulic conductivity field is demonstrated in this case study the main differences between spcod and seod rely on the way to quantify the uncertainty and information metric i e sd in this study in seod the uncertainties in model parameters and outputs are represented and propagated by the ensemble members thus sd is also evaluated using the ensemble realizations since seod is essentially a monte carlo based method the sampling errors caused by initializing the ensemble are inevitable which may further result in a non convergent optimal design for comparison purposes we repetitively perform the optimal design 30 times using seod with ensemble size of 197 thus spcod and seod are similar in computational cost it is seen from fig 12 a that the optimal monitoring locations at each assimilation step are not entirely the same for repetitive runs of seod which may lead to ambiguous designs in practical applications in spcod the uncertainties in model parameters and outputs are represented and propagated by the anova based pce then sd can be accurately calculated through eq 19 with the pce coefficients the sampling errors are avoided and the optimal design given by spcod is unique and more reliable shown in fig 12b to evaluate the estimation accuracy the corresponding performance indicator values rmsem and rmsed are calculated the rmse values provided by spcod rmsem 0 28 rmsed 0 0067 are both smaller than those provided by seod rmsem 0 31 rmsed 0 0070 therefore with nearly the same computational cost spcod is superior to seod in terms of estimation accuracy 4 conclusions in this study a computationally efficient sequential probabilistic collocation based optimal design spcod method has been developed to improve the parameter estimation from real time measurements this method seamlessly integrates adaptive anova analysis of variance based probabilistic collocation based kalman filter with the sequential optimal design furthermore an analytical expression of shannon entropy difference sd is derived in the form of polynomial chaos expansion and used to evaluate candidate monitoring strategies at each analysis step the monitoring strategy with the maximum sd value is chosen as the optimal design to provide the measurements the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method has been verified by two case studies of water flow and solute transport in the vadose zone it is shown that the optimal monitoring strategy given by spcod always leads to more accurate parameter estimation and state prediction compared with conventional fixed designs compared with the sequential ensemble based optimal design seod method proposed in our previous work man et al 2016b spcod achieves a more robust and accurate design with nearly the same

6744,accurate estimation of soil hydraulic parameters is essential for modeling of water flow and solute transport in unsaturated soil ensemble based methods have been proposed to provide the optimal monitoring data collection strategy to improve hydraulic parameter estimation to guarantee the performance however these methods usually require relatively large ensemble sizes leading to high computational cost to this end we develop an efficient sequential probabilistic collocation based optimal design spcod method which integrates the adaptive anova analysis of variance based probabilistic collocation based kalman filter with the sequential optimal design at the forecast step the probabilistic collocation method is used to construct a reduced order surrogate for system model with the adaptive anova based polynomial chaos expansion pce at the design step an information metric in the pce form is derived to evaluate candidate monitoring strategies the one with the maximum expected information metric value is chosen as the optimal at the analysis step the pce coefficients are sequentially updated by a square root kalman filter with the real time measurements obtained from the optimal monitoring strategy two synthetic numerical cases involving water flow and solute transport in the vadose zone are employed to illustrate the performance of the proposed method the results show that 1 compared with conventional fixed monitoring strategies the optimal monitoring strategy designed by spcod provides more accurate parameter estimation and state prediction 2 compared with our previously developed sequential ensemble based optimal design method man et al 2016b the new approach provides a more robust and accurate optimal monitoring design with nearly the same computational cost 1 introduction to make reliable predictions of water flow and solute transport in unsaturated soil it is essential to accurately characterize the soil hydraulic conductivity and water retention parameters nowadays it is a common practice to estimate these soil hydraulic parameters from observed hydraulic state variables e g negative pressure head water content soil temperature and solute concentration for examples nowak and cirpka 2006 presented a geostatistical method for hydraulic conductivity and dispersivities inference from hydraulic heads and tracer data li and ren 2011 and shi et al 2015 employed the ensemble kalman filter enkf to estimate unsaturated soil hydraulic parameters by assimilating pressure head measurements klepikova et al 2016 implemented a pilot point method to invert temperature data for characterizing the hydraulic conductivity field xu and gómez hernández 2016 used the normal score enkf for characterization of non gaussian conductivities and porosities by assimilating hydraulic heads solute concentrations and water temperatures regarding recent progresses of the inverse modeling in hydrologic studies one may refer to zhou et al 2014 and vereecken et al 2016 for details for subsurface problems however monitoring campaigns are usually expensive to conduct as the sampling and chemical analysis are generally cost intensive and time demanding it is intuitively understandable that the accuracy of parameter estimation can be improved by assimilating informative measurements constrained by the limited budget and time it is therefore wise to assess the data worth of measurements before they are actually collected this necessitates the optimal monitoring design i e to determine when and where to take measurements to maximize the data worth dai et al 2016 lu et al 2018 neuman et al 2012 wang et al 2018 the approaches for monitoring design can be generally divided into two classes batch design and sequential design the former involves all the monitoring designs concurrently while the latter involves feedbacks from previous results and conducts monitoring design sequentially some researches relevant to batch design have been reported herrera and pinder 2005 conducted the space time optimization of groundwater quality monitoring networks using kalman filter kollat et al 2011 combined enkf with multi objective evolutionary optimization to improve long term groundwater monitoring zhang et al 2015 proposed an efficient bayesian monitoring design method for contaminant source identification nowak and guthke 2016 used a preposterior analysis to optimize the model discrimination in contaminant transport on the aspect of sequential design prakash and datta 2015 integrated a simulated annealing optimization algorithm with the sequential monitoring network design for accurate source characterization gharamti et al 2015 proposed a greedy observational design approach to improve the prediction accuracy of hydrologic contaminant state via enkf geiges et al 2015 conducted a comparison of batch and sequential designs for some nonlinear parameter estimation problems and showed that the sequential design was more beneficial than the batch design in our previous work man et al 2016b a sequential ensemble based optimal design seod method which integrates enkf with the sequential optimal design was developed for unsaturated hydraulic parameter estimation its applicability has also been demonstrated in estimating physical and geochemical parameters of reactive transport models lan et al 2018 in seod a relatively large ensemble size is necessary to guarantee the convergence of optimal design and the accuracy of parameter estimation as a result it is often computationally expensive to run seod especially for those cpu intensive hydrologic models in the past decade polynomial chaos expansion pce which allows high order approximation of random variables has gained popularity in efficient uncertainty quantification ghanem and spanos 2003 linde et al 2017 a pce based kalman filter for reservoir characterization was developed in saad and ghanem 2009 where the system states of interest were represented by a set of orthogonal pce basis functions and the galerkin scheme was employed to calculate the pce coefficients this method is intrusive in that extra efforts are required to solve the derived galerkin equation alternatively the probabilistic collocation method pcm tatang et al 1997 is an efficient non intrusive approach which can be used for determining the pce coefficients zeng et al 2011 2010 developed a pcm based kalman filter pckf for history matching as an alternative to enkf to further improve the performance li et al 2014 and man et al 2016a integrated adaptive anova analysis of variance decomposition with pckf for high dimensional nonlinear problems more recently an efficient anova based transformed pcm was developed for the batch optimal monitoring design in the vadose zone man et al 2017 inspired by the recent progresses in monitoring design and uncertainty quantification this study develops a computationally efficient method i e sequential probabilistic collocation based optimal design spcod to improve the accuracy of parameter estimation in this method the adaptive anova based pckf is used as a data assimilation tool and the monitoring strategy with the maximum expected data worth is to provide the measurements in each data assimilation loop the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 formulates the procedures of spcod algorithm for monitoring design the efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated by two synthetic numerical cases in section 3 finally we draw some conclusions in section 4 2 methods the core idea of the sequential optimal design is to select the most informative measurements by maximizing the expected data worth indicated by an information metric before each analysis step which is also called preposterior analysis leube et al 2012 in our previously developed seod method the information metric is approximated using ensemble realizations to guarantee the convergence of optimal design a relatively large ensemble size is usually required leading to a considerable computational cost while in this work a computationally more efficient sequential optimal design method i e sequential probabilistic collocation based optimal design spcod is developed the key in spcod is to formulate the preposterior analysis in the pce form at design steps once the actual measurements are obtained from the designed monitoring strategy the pce coefficients are updated at the analysis step this method consisting of an iterative forecast design and analysis data assimilation loop is summarized as follows i forecast step at each forecast step of spcod the uncertain model parameters m and state variables s are approximated by a set of orthogonal hermite pce basis functions ψ j ξ zeng et al 2011 1 m ξ j 0 q c j m ψ j ξ 2 s ξ j 0 q c j s ψ j ξ where ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ m is a vector consisting of m independent standard gaussian random variables c j m j 0 1 2 q are the pce coefficients for model parameters which are preset according to the prior statistics of m c j s j 0 1 2 q are the pce coefficients for state variables which are to be determined by pcm li and zhang 2007 li et al 2009 with a given polynomial degree the number of pce basis functions grows exponentially as the random dimensionality m increases resulting in a prohibitively large computational cost for determining the pce coefficients i e c j s j 0 1 2 q especially for high dimensional problems to address this issue in spcod we apply the functional anova decomposition li et al 2001 to the state variables with the functional anova decomposition each state variable s can be expressed as 3 s ξ f ξ f 0 j 1 m f j ξ j 1 j k m m f jk ξ j ξ k f 1 2 m ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ m where the function f 1 2 w with w argument variables ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ w is called w th order anova component in many practical problems the coupling effects among multiple input variables are usually small or even negligible thus it is rational to approximate the state variable s with the summation of several low order anova components as evidenced in li et al 2002 the anova components up to the second order are usually sufficient to provide a satisfactory description of f ξ in this study we keep all the 1st order anova components and then adaptively select the 2nd order anova components according to the variance namely using the adaptive anova decomposition interested readers can refer to ma and zabaras 2010 and yang et al 2012 for details with the truncated anova components we construct the pce representation for the state variable by expanding each component into pce since the random variables are gaussian distributed the hermite polynomials xiu and karniadakis 2003 are used for example the first three one dimensional pce basis functions are ψ 0 ξ 1 ψ 1 ξ ξ and ψ 2 ξ ξ 2 1 2 on this basis the 1st order anova components can be expanded as follows 4 f 1 ξ 1 j 0 2 c j ψ j ξ 1 c 0 c 1 ξ 1 c 2 ξ 1 2 1 2 for a component function f 1 2 ξ 1 ξ 2 we formulate its pce basis functions from the tensor product of the one dimensional basis i e 5 f 1 2 ξ 1 ξ 2 j 0 2 k 0 2 c jk ψ j ξ 1 ψ k ξ 2 c 00 c 01 ξ 2 c 02 ξ 2 2 1 2 c 10 ξ 1 c 11 ξ 1 ξ 2 c 12 ξ 1 ξ 2 2 1 2 c 20 ξ 1 2 1 2 c 21 ξ 2 ξ 1 2 1 2 c 22 ξ 1 2 1 ξ 2 2 1 2 then pcm is employed to determine the pce coefficients in pcm with different sets of collocation points we evaluate the component f 1 2 w ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ w and make it equal to the corresponding polynomials for a one dimensional pce with the highest polynomial degree of k the collocation points are positioned at the roots of the k 1 th polynomial specifically for a one dimensional second order hermite pce the collocation points are the roots of the third order hermite polynomial ξ 3 3 ξ 6 i e 3 0 and 3 while for a multidimensional pce the collocation points are formulated from the tensor product of the one dimensional collocation points after expanding the retained anova components into pce we formulate the final pce representations of state variables by summing up all the pce terms which is much less costly than directly expanding the state variables with pce suppose that the number of retained 2nd order anova components is n then the total required number of collocation points is only 1 2 m 4 n n m m 1 2 ii optimal design at this step we conduct the preposterior analysis in the form of pce with the pce representations in eq 1 the prior mean b and covariance b of model parameters can be easily calculated from the pce coefficients i e 6 b c 0 m 7 b j 1 q c j m c j m t let the measurement operator h be a specific monitoring strategy i e extracting the measurements from the state variables s then the measurements d can be expressed as 8 d hs ε where ε are the gaussian measurement errors with zeros means and covariance matrix r note that at this preposterior analysis step d are the possible measurements since the actual monitoring campaign has not been implemented with the pce representations of the states s in eq 2 the possible measurement realizations can be generated as follows 9 d i d ξ i ε i h j 0 q c j s ψ j ξ i ε i i 1 2 n e j 0 q c j d ψ j ξ i ε i i 1 2 n e where c j d hc j s j 0 1 2 q are the pce coefficients for model predicted measurements with each possible measurement realization d i the mean part c 0 m and high order

standard and modified kalman gains of the ensemble square root kalman filter proposed by whitaker and hamill 2002 12 k c md c dd r 1 13 k c md c dd r 1 t c dd r r 1 where cmd is the prior covariance between model parameters and model predicted measurements cdd is the covariance of model predicted measurements using the orthogonal property of pce basis functions the two covariance matrixes can be calculated as c md j 1 q c j m c j d t c dd j 1 q c j d c j d t zeng et al 2011 note that the updated high order pce coefficients i e c j i m u j 1 2 q are actually independent to the possible measurement realization d i although the posterior distribution is generally non gaussian for nonlinear systems the kalman filter and its variants still perform well as long as the nonlinearity is not strong the posterior mean a i and covariance a i of model parameters can be calculated with the zero order and high order pce coefficients respectively 14 a i c 0 i m u 15 a i j 1 q c j i m u c j i m ut then the information content of the current measurement d i can be calculated i e m d i i 1 2 n e to eliminate the dependence on the ensemble index the information content of the given monitoring strategy h is evaluated by averaging on the entire measurement ensemble i e 16 m h 1 n e i 1 n e m d i eq 16 is generally valid for any information metric it should be noted that since d i are generated by sampling eq 9 without solving the original model a large ne can be used to guarantee the accurate evaluation of the expected information metric with virtually no computational cost since only the mean and covariance parts are involved in the analysis step of kalman filter the information metrics based on the first order and second order statistics can be used in our previous work man et al 2016b three information metrics i e relative entropy re shannon entropy difference sd and degrees of freedom for signal dfs have been systematically investigated re measures both the mean and covariance parts while sd and dfs only measure the covariance part the numerical simulation results showed that they performed similarly in the optimal design therefore only sd is used to measure the information content of the given monitoring strategy h in this study sd is defined as the decrease in uncertainty from the prior covariance to the posterior covariance with the gaussian assumption it can be written as xu 2007 xu et al 2009 17 sd ln det ba 1 2 where det denotes the determinant note that in the kalman filter theory there exists a relation between the prior and posterior covariances i e a i kh b then the information content of the current measurement d i can be calculated as 18 s d d i ln det i kh 2 where k can be calculated using eq 12 it is easily known from eq 18 that the sd value is independent to the possible measurement realization d i in other words the sd values are the same for different possible measurement realizations thus the integration on the measurement ensemble can be omitted finally the information content of a given monitoring strategy can be obtained in the following analytical form 19 s d h ln det i kh 2 then a global optimization algorithm i e

design is implemented for the next step i e go back to step ⅰ the flowchart of this method is shown in fig 1 it should be noted that the collocation outputs at next time step are obtained by running the simulator from initial time with the updated parameter collocation realizations this scheme is entitled restart and avoids the inconsistency between the updated model parameters and outputs in strongly nonlinear problems moreover in this way only the pce representations of model outputs at candidate monitoring locations are calculated more discussion about this algorithm can refer to man et al 2016a 3 case study in this work two case studies of solute transport in the vadose zone are conducted to illustrate the validity of the proposed method here it is assumed that real time series of solute concentration cannot be obtained and one has to deal with chemical sampling which is cost intensive and time demanding then the spcod method is used to maximize the information gain from concentration measurements the governing equation of two dimensional unsaturated flow is expressed by the richards equation 23 θ t x k h h x z k h h z k h where θ is the soil water content l3l 3 at time t t h is the corresponding soil water pressure head l x and z are the horizontal and vertical spatial coordinates l respectively k h is the hydraulic conductivity function that varies with h

and dz are the transverse and longitudinal dispersion coefficients l respectively dd is the molecular diffusion coefficient l2t 1 the sketch of the study domain 100 cm wide 200 cm deep is illustrated in fig 2 this domain is discretized into 21 41 861 nodes of which the 21 marked nodes represent the candidate locations for solute concentration monitoring initially the pressure head is 200 cm at the top and linearly changed to 0 at the bottom representing a hydrostatic condition a line source x 15 35 cm z 0 cm with concentration of 5 mg cm 3 is continuously released at a flow rate of 5 cm d 1 the top and two lateral sides are impervious boundaries except for several top boundary nodes representing the line source at the bottom of the soil profile a free drainage condition is imposed for water flow while a cauchy mixed boundary condition is invoked for solute transport 3 1 case 1 the estimation of homogeneous k field in the first case the soil profile is assumed to be homogeneous and the soil is loamy sand the transverse and longitudinal dispersion coefficients are assumed known as dx 10 cm dz 50 cm the simulated infiltration time is 8 days and the solute concentration at one monitoring location is measured every 1 day three hydraulic parameters ks α n are assumed unknown and to be estimated by assimilating the solute concentration measurements the prior distributions of ks and n for loamy sand are given by carsel and parrish 1988 using the multivariate normal johnson transformation approach i e 28 u ln v a b v where v denotes the hydraulic parameter before transformation within the range a b u denotes the transformed variable with gaussian distribution the prior statistics used for distribution approximation and the correlations among transformed variables are presented in tables 1 and 2 carsel and parrish 1988 note that the factored covariance matrix l t shown in table 2 is obtained by the lu decomposition i e 29 c u ll t where u is a vector consisting of transformed variables cu is the prescribed covariance matrix among transformed variables l is a lower triangular matrix and the superscript t denotes transpose the realizations of transformed variables can be generated as follows 30 u u l ξ where u is a vector comprised of the mean values of transformed variables ξ is a random vector consisting of standard multivariate gaussian variables it should be noted that the first step in spcod is to parameterize the random inputs with uncorrelated independent standard gaussian random variables in this case some of the random hydraulic parameters to be estimated are correlated non gaussian random variables thus they are firstly transformed to correlated gaussian random variables i e eq 28 then the lu decomposition is used to represent these transformed variables with uncorrelated standard gaussian variables i e eq 30 based on which the hermite pce can be implemented thus the pce form of transformed parameters can be expressed as 31 u m ξ c 0 m j 1 m c j m ψ j ξ where c 0 m u c j m l j ψ j ξ ξ j j 1 2 m note that the inverse transformation can be expressed with the following formulation 32 v b exp u a 1 exp u with the given prior statistics one set of hydraulic parameter realization is randomly generated and chosen as the true reference values then measurements of solute concentration are obtained by running the simulator with these true parameters the measurement errors are assumed to be independently gaussian distributed with mean zero and standard deviation of 0 01 mg cm 3 the optimal monitoring location at each assimilation step during the implementation of spcod is plotted in fig 3 it can be seen that the optimal monitoring location varies with the assimilation step and is mainly distributed around the solute front this indicates that the monitoring location around the front can provide the most informative measurements it is also noted that since the information of measurements are sequentially assimilated the optimal monitoring locations are strongly influenced by the specific group of reference parameters in fig 4 the estimated soil water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity function are calculated by sampling from the final pce representations of model parameters a good match between the estimated and true values is observed for both the water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity function furthermore the predicted solute concentrations along the central line x 50 cm are also calculated and matched to the actual measurements fig 5 it can be seen that the predicted data match with the actual measurements very well to illustrate the validity of the optimal design two conventional fixed monitoring strategies are chosen for comparisons the monitoring location is respectively fixed at o2 x 50 cm z 25 cm or o5 x 50 cm z 50 cm during the whole simulation time to avoid the accidental error caused by choosing only one parameter set 30 sets of parameters are randomly sampled from the prior distributions fig 6 plots the mean estimations of ks α n against respective true values it shows that the estimated results of parameter n are pretty good for all the designs this is because the parameter n is more sensitive to the concentration measurements even the conventional fixed monitoring strategies can provide sufficient information for the accurate estimation of n overall the correlations between the true and estimated parameters are much improved with the optimal design and the estimation error for each parameter is significantly reduced in practical applications however the true parameter values are actually unavailable the most straightforward way is to compare the match between the actual measurements and those predicted with the estimated parameters in this study the root mean square error defined on the model outputs at the candidate monitoring locations rmsed is used 33 rmse d 1 n o i 1 n o d i d i 2 where d and d denote the predicted and true values of solute concentration measurements at all measurement time steps respectively no is the total number of concentration outputs which equals to the product of time steps and number of monitoring locations here no 8 21 fig 7 presents the rmsed values calculated based on the mean estimations of parameters it is seen that although the conventional fixed monitoring locations can provide acceptable estimation accuracy the rmsed values provided by the optimal design are much lower this demonstrates that the estimation can be further improved if a dynamic monitoring strategy is implemented in a word the optimal monitoring strategy provided by spcod leads to more accurate parameter estimation and state prediction compared with the conventional fixed designs 3 2 case 2 the estimation of heterogeneous saturated hydraulic conductivity field in the second case α and n are assumed known α 0 02 cm 1 n 1 4 and the uncertainty stems from the heterogeneity in saturated hydraulic conductivity field ks the random field y ln k s is assumed gaussian distributed with mean μ y 3 0 and the following exponential covariance function 34 c y y x 1 z 1 y x 2 z 2 σ y 2 exp x 1 x 2 λ x 2 z 1 z 2 λ z 2 where σ y 2 0 3 is the variance λ x 40 cm and λ z 50 cm are the correlation lengths in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively the reference y field is randomly generated using the lu decomposition the heterogeneous saturated hydraulic conductivity field is discretized into the same number of 21 41 nodes leading to 861 unknown saturated hydraulic conductivities the large number of unknown conductivity parameters makes spcod computationally infeasible to address this issue one popular approach is to employ the karhunen loève expansion kle zhang and lu 2004 as a dimension reduction tool to parameterize the random field with a limited number of independent gaussian random variables 35 y y j 1 m λ j f j ξ j where λ j and f j are the j th eigenvalue and eigenvector of c y respectively eq 35 is equivalent to the pce form 36 y m ξ c 0 m j 1 m c j m ψ j ξ where c 0 m y c j m λ j f j ψ j ξ ξ j j 1 2 m with kle expansion the first 50 leading terms i e ξ j j 1 2 50 in eq 1 are kept in spcod thus the dimensionality is reduced from 861 to 50 and 86 4 of the total variance of the random field is retained with these truncated kle terms the initial realizations of log saturated hydraulic conductivity fields are randomly generated the whole simulation time lasts for 20 days and concentration measurements are obtained from three monitoring locations every 1 day when implementing spcod the three most informative monitoring locations for concentration measurements are selected from 21 candidate monitoring locations before each assimilation step three conventional monitoring strategies denoted by s1 s2 and s3 in fig 2 both with three fixed monitoring locations are taken for comparisons with a randomly chosen reference field the optimal monitoring locations at each assimilation step are plotted in fig 8 it is again shown that the monitoring locations around the solute front can generally provide the most informative measurements owing to the use of adaptive anova scheme the pce terms used for approximating the model outputs are adaptively selected at each assimilation step thus the computational cost in determining the pce coefficients varies with the assimilation step on the whole the average number of model evaluations per loop is 197 fig 9 plots the true log saturated hydraulic conductivity field and the mean estimations provided by the optimal design and three conventional designs it is shown that the main pattern of the reference field can be more accurately captured by the optimal design compared with the conventional designs by comparing figs 8 and 9a it can be seen that the solute plume propagates faster in the region with higher saturated hydraulic conductivity the variances of log saturated hydraulic conductivity fields provided by these four monitoring designs are plotted in fig 10 it is obvious that with the optimal design the variance of estimated log saturated hydraulic conductivity field is much lower this is because the dynamic optimal design provides the most informative measurements at each assimilation step leading to the larger uncertainty reduction to make quantitative comparisons of different monitoring designs in addition to the root mean square error defined on the model outputs i e rmsed the root mean square error defined on the log saturated hydraulic conductivity i e rmsem is used 37 rmse m 1 n g i 1 n g y i y i 2 where y and y denote the log saturated hydraulic conductivity of mean estimated and reference fields respectively n g 861 is the total number of nodes the performance indicator values calculated by different monitoring designs are compared in fig 11 it can be seen that all the performance indicator values provided by the optimal design are much smaller than those provided by the conventional designs therefore the superiority of spcod in estimating the saturated hydraulic conductivity field is demonstrated in this case study the main differences between spcod and seod rely on the way to quantify the uncertainty and information metric i e sd in this study in seod the uncertainties in model parameters and outputs are represented and propagated by the ensemble members thus sd is also evaluated using the ensemble realizations since seod is essentially a monte carlo based method the sampling errors caused by initializing the ensemble are inevitable which may further result in a non convergent optimal design for comparison purposes we repetitively perform the optimal design 30 times using seod with ensemble size of 197 thus spcod and seod are similar in computational cost it is seen from fig 12 a that the optimal monitoring locations at each assimilation step are not entirely the same for repetitive runs of seod which may lead to ambiguous designs in practical applications in spcod the uncertainties in model parameters and outputs are represented and propagated by the anova based pce then sd can be accurately calculated through eq 19 with the pce coefficients the sampling errors are avoided and the optimal design given by spcod is unique and more reliable shown in fig 12b to evaluate the estimation accuracy the corresponding performance indicator values rmsem and rmsed are calculated the rmse values provided by spcod rmsem 0 28 rmsed 0 0067 are both smaller than those provided by seod rmsem 0 31 rmsed 0 0070 therefore with nearly the same computational cost spcod is superior to seod in terms of estimation accuracy 4 conclusions in this study a computationally efficient sequential probabilistic collocation based optimal design spcod method has been developed to improve the parameter estimation from real time measurements this method seamlessly integrates adaptive anova analysis of variance based probabilistic collocation based kalman filter with the sequential optimal design furthermore an analytical expression of shannon entropy difference sd is derived in the form of polynomial chaos expansion and used to evaluate candidate monitoring strategies at each analysis step the monitoring strategy with the maximum sd value is chosen as the optimal design to provide the measurements the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method has been verified by two case studies of water flow and solute transport in the vadose zone it is shown that the optimal monitoring strategy given by spcod always leads to more accurate parameter estimation and state prediction compared with conventional fixed designs compared with the sequential ensemble based optimal design seod method proposed in our previous work man et al 2016b spcod achieves a more robust and accurate design with nearly the same computational cost although the solute transport in the vadose zone is considered in this study the probabilistic collocation based framework can be equally applied in any other hydrologic optimal
