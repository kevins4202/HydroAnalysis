20930,submerged floating tunnel sft is a new type of transportation infrastructure for crossing sea straits in relatively deeper water compared with the traditional fixed tunnel the main challenge in sft design is obtaining the hydrodynamic response parameters with a complex hydrodynamic environment however long span sft length 5 km and spatial difference of the hydrodynamic load along with the tunnel length bring unprecedented challenges in hydrodynamic response investigations the existing analysis theory or method could not fully meet the requirement of the dynamic controlling design of long span sft when considering complex ocean environment this paper systematically collates and reviews the research status and latest achievements concerning the hydrodynamic response investigation method of sft from two aspects mathematical model and physical modeling typical theoretical and or numerical model for determination of hydrodynamic load the tube response under wave current the tether tube vehicle coupled analysis in wave and current and the global fluid structure coupling analysis in the mathematical models are introduced emphasis are given on the basic assumption governing equations environmental conditions and factor consideration the major methods and output of 2d and 3d model tests in the physical modeling are also summarized detailed analysis of the literature shows that numerous mathematical or physical methods have been devised for predicting the hydrodynamic load tube response and tether tube vehicle interaction in wave and or current however the existing mathematical models use a lot of simplified assumptions which are efficient in relatively simple condition but less flexible in treating the actual complicated hydrodynamic environment the present physical model tests have difficult in properly simulating the end constraints actual stiffness and structural elastic deformation of the sft model based on the current research progress it is predicted that the full time domain fluid structure coupling mathematical model with complicated hydrodynamic environment the 3d full hydroelastic model test in large deep water basin and the integration of mathematical and physical models are the main attractive directions for the hydrodynamic response investigation of sft in future keywords submerged floating tunnels hydrodynamic response investigation mathematical model physical modeling 1 introduction submerged floating tunnel hereafter referred as sft is a novel type of tunnel that is suspended under water level which maintains its balance by buoyancy self weight and support system it is another new cross sea passage technology fig 1 after the cross sea bridges and subsea tunnels that is expected to achieve deep strait crossing in the future which is a hot future oriented topic with major challenges in the fields of deep sea resource development and utilization transportation infrastructure etc once after its proposal the concept has received high attention from academia and industrial circles globally becoming a high tech strategic highland competed for by europe america japan south korea china and other countries as of now the following locations for sft construction have been proposed china s qiandao lake mazzolani et al 2007 and jintang strait mazzolani et al 2001 italy s strait of messina mazzolani et al 2009 norway s høgsfjord strait skorpa and østlid 2001 switzerland s lake lugano haugerud et al 2001 america s lake washington felch 2001 japan s funka bay kanle 2010 indonesia s seribu islands endah et al 2011 mexico s baja california faggiano et al 2016 south korea s jeju island seo et al 2015 etc of these countries norway and south korea have formulated real construction plans so far however there has been no completed project of any sft worldwide in 2018 the china association for science and technology listed the key technology of sft as one of china s 60 major future oriented scientific issues and engineering technical challenges with comparative advantages such as flexible site selection high commuting rate no impact on surface navigation little impact on surroundings and saving of construction costs the sft is expected to turn numerous deep coastal straits around the world into thoroughfares once upon maturity of technology it is one of the vital alternatives to resolve the deep and wide water traffic crossing in the future such as the crossing of major coastal straits coastal lands islands and islands islands in general the balance of sft in water is maintained by employing special support systems like tethers and pontoon currently these support systems can be conceptually classified into the tether type pontoon type pile type etc depending on the form of support among which the tether and pontoon type are the most typical since being suspended in water the design and construction of sft are utterly different from those of the common underground tunnels or bridges which are faced with brand new challenges as an interdisciplinary systems engineering project it needs to break through a series of key scientific technical and engineering challenges the main scientific challenges can be generally summarized as follows 1 hydrodynamic characteristics of the sft tube with different cross sectional shape 2 hydroelastic dynamic response mechanism 3d fluid structure coupling of the whole span of the sft structure under complex wave current ocean environment 3 coupling vibration mechanism of the tunnel tube and its support foundation under the combined loads of wave current vehicle 4 structural fatigue damage and its failure mode 5 ultimate bearing capacity of the sft structure system of tube junction support foundation under multiple disaster causing factors 6 high strength and durable constructional composite materials for high pressure and strangely corrosive ocean environment 7 influence mechanism of sft on water ecological environment however the core challenge is how to ensure the stability and safety of structural system in the harsh marine environment which determines the success or failure of the entire project as a result how to predict the hydrodynamic response including the hydrodynamic and or the hydroelastic dynamic response of sft accurately and obtain such technical parameters as the overall and local motion deformation and force of structure in harsh marine environment are the primary scientific and technical issues that are encountered in the design construction and safe operation these constitute the main research tasks at the present stage to clarify the complex hydrodynamic response mechanism of sfts scholars all over the world have carried out extensive useful work establishing a variety of researching systems and methodologies providing scientific basis and guidance for subsequent research nevertheless previous studies mainly focused on the short span sft hereafter sft with length less than or equal to 1 km is regarded as short span sft the ideal environmental conditions the theoretical and numerical analysis the 2d model tests and lacked systematic global 3d model test verification the existing mathematical model use a lot of simplified assumptions without considering the actual complicated hydrodynamic environment and the present physical model tests have difficult in properly simulating the end constraints actual stiffness and structural elastic deformation of the sft model as a result the problem of prediction of real dynamic response of long span sft hereafter sft with larger than 5 km is regarded as long span sft under complex environment cannot be solved which limit the practicability of the study on the whole there is yet a systematic and complete theoretical or technical system design specification or standard for such tunnels with the development of the sft technology the problem of hydrodynamic response caused by the long span tunnel and spatial difference of the hydrodynamic load is becoming striking which leads to the systematic design facing unprecedented challenges the current hydrodynamic analysis theory research method cannot satisfy the requirement of the dynamic controlling design of long span sft in complex ocean environment it is necessary to develop nonlinear hydrodynamic response calculation theory and comprehensive experimental method compared with the fixed tunnel the hydrodynamic response investigation of the sft is quite challenging since its complex environmental load factors which includes not only the common hydrodynamic loads e g waves current but also coupling of the hydrodynamic loads with the traffic moving loads e g trains and or automobiles and or the extreme or sudden loads e g marine seismic explosion tsunami internal wave fire disaster foundation damage leakage sudden cable breakage etc in the past decade a number of reviews regarding the sft have been presented see e g dong et al 2007 xiang et al 2017 jiang and li 2018 and ding et al 2019 previous reviews mainly focused on the structural response or mechanical behaviors of sft and its mooring system under environmental and or traffic loads however limited attention has been paid to the hydrodynamic response investigation method itself the main problems in the existing theory or method have also not been deeply discussed the main purpose of this paper is to systematically collate and summarize the previous and latest research achievements around the hydrodynamic response investigation methods for tethered sft from the perspectives of mathematical model and physical modeling due to the problem complexity and space constraints however it is difficult to account for all these aspects in one paper therefore only the common hydrodynamic loads and traffic moving loads will be taken into account through conducting comparative analysis the problems and deficiencies with extant methods are summed up additionally the development trends are prospected and relevant suggestions are put forward 2 mathematical model investigations regarding the hydrodynamic response research of sft mathematical model theoretical analysis or numerical model is an important method adopted at the present stage over the past decade numerous theoretical or numerical models have been proposed to determine the hydrodynamic response of the sft under complex environmental loads the primary method remains the two steps procedure i z first obtaining the external hydrodynamic load by assuming the underwater structure to be fixed and then calculating the structural response using the known hydrodynamic load this manner can be classified as the one way coupling from the environmental load to the structural response so that the wave current field around sft induced by the structural response cannot be fully considered another way to analyze the sft response is through a global fluid structure coupled analysis where the hydrodynamic response is analyzed as an issue of interaction between fluid and structure in this section we discuss these three aspects hydrodynamic load sft system coupled vibration mainly including the tether tube coupling and the tether tube vehicle coupling tube cable coupling and global fluid structure coupling analysis 2 1 hydrodynamic load and response of tubes 2 1 1 determination of hydrodynamic load currently there are two major methods for determining the hydrodynamic load of sft tubes including morison equation and diffraction theory of which the morison equation is used primarily for the computation of current force the equation was proposed by morison in 1950 assuming that the dimension of a structure is insufficient to affect the hydrodynamic field significantly and that the hydrodynamic load acting on a structure includes the inertial force and the drag force which depends mainly on the velocity and acceleration of water particles in the unstructured hydrodynamic field this method is more suitable for relatively small scale problems as an empirical formula approach the morison equation considers the effects of water viscosity and inertia where the hydrodynamic load can be obtained just by determining two important equation parameters c d and c m denote the drag force coefficient and the inertial force coefficient respectively at present this rather simple method is extensively used in the study of sft in addition to the morison equation another method for wave force computation is the diffraction theory proposed by maccamy and fuchs this method assumes that the fluid is inviscid and incompressible and the fluid motion is irrotational besides the liquid surface satisfies linear free surface boundary conditions the velocity potential generated by wave field and sft is assumed to be divided into the incident potential and the diffraction potential after deriving velocity potential by boundary element method the pressure distribution acting on the tunnel tube surface can be obtained using the bernoulli s equation based on the pressure distribution the force and moment acting on the tunnel can be obtained for instance mai et al 2005 calculated the wave force of sft by employing the boundary element method in frequency domain based on the diffraction theory consequently obtaining the three dimensional hydrodynamic properties of tunnel tube based on the potential flow theory and high order boundary element method jin et al 2019 analyzed the wave force additional mass and radiation damping of sfts with different section shapes in an immobile state similar applications can be found in references wen 2007 tariverdil et al 2011 cao 2011 the above two methods have their respective ranges of adaptation in general the diffraction theory is mostly used when the inertial force is dominant while the morison equation is used when both the inertial and drag forces are non negligible comparison of these two methods by kunisu 2010 for the hydrodynamic computation of sfts found that in normal construction conditions water depth 100 m submerged water depth 30 m tube diameter 23 m both the drag and inertial forces account for significant proportions when larger tube diameters are considered the inertial force would dominate at a k c number of less than 15 moreover the use of both morison equation and diffraction theory was found to yield accurate hydrodynamic calculations fig 2 2 1 2 tube response under wave current environment after the determination of hydrodynamic load the dynamic response of tunnel tube structure is computed numerically this involves the global computation and the detailed tube structure computation targeting the problem of global response computation the main method currently adopted is the finite element model which is based on beam and rod elements that is the tube is regarded as an integral whole without considering the internal force distribution of structure typical dynamic equilibrium equation for the tube response can be expressed as 1 m 2 w t 2 e i 4 w y 4 c w t f where m is sft s mass per unit length of the tube ei is the bending stiffness of the tube w is the vertical displacement y is the coordinate along the length of the tunnel c is the viscous damping coefficient of the structure f is the hydrodynamic force per unit length of the tube t is the time regarding the global tube response computation faggiano et al 2001 discussed the design modeling and response evaluation of a sft solution for the messina strait crossing in italy by simplifying the tunnel tube into spatial beam elements xie et al 2007 simplified the sft tube as a beam model with elastic support and introduced the transfer matrix method for simplified static analysis of sft besides xie 2007 employed two dimensional elastic beam to simulate the sft tube and used elastic hinges to simulate the joints between tube sections thereby analyzing the static and dynamic characteristics of the tunnel structure system in the case of china s qiandao lake prototype long et al 2009 2015 studied the effects of tube parameters on the hydrodynamic response of structure through finite element modeling which considered the effects of nonlinear fluid resistance and nonlinear tether restoring force with a simple supported beam model qin and zhou 2009 and qin 2009 explored the possible chaotic behaviors during the vortex induced vibration of tube sections through carrying out the melnikov function analysis all the above computations of tube hydrodynamic force adopt the morison equation mai et al 2015 established finite element models for sft and support system based on a combination of wave diffraction theory vibrating beam finite element method and beam element cr formulation and calculated the effects of waves and currents on the tunnel tube with a similar approach tian et al 2014 analyzed the dynamic responses of sft under combined internal wave and ocean current effect based on the potential flow theory ge et al 2010 estimated the fluid structure interaction by boundary element method and solved the structure dynamic equation by three dimensional finite element method thereby developing a hydroelastic analysis model of sft furthermore they calculated the tunnel tube deformation and the joint axial force with the china s qiandao lake prototype as an example to investigate the deformation and force distribution of detailed section of sft tube sato et al 2008 simplified the tunnel into a discontinuous elastic foundation beam model and assumed that the tube body was a euler bernouli beam and the tethers were axial springs through mathematical derivation they verified the equivalence between the proposed model and a beam model on elastic supports this methodology has been adopted by numerous subsequent scholars for the computational analysis of tube deformation and force distribution xiang and xue 2002 gan et al 2009 proposed the virtual element theory capable of computing the internal force distribution of structure this theory is suitable for the global internal force analysis of sft space additionally by employing the large eddy simulation luo et al 2012 numerically analyzed the steady state circumferential pressure distribution of sfts with five different section shapes as well as the fluid lift and drag forces 2 2 tether tube vehicle coupled analysis in wave current environment for the tethered sfts the tunnel tube maintains balance in the water by self weight buoyancy and tether tensile force the net buoyancy buoyancy minus self weight generated by the tube is offset by tethers and transmitted to the seabed foundation in extreme sea conditions the bearing capacity of tether system determines the safety of entire sft system directly meanwhile in normal operating condition the wave current action and moving vehicle loads also cause the coupling vibration of tube and tethers which consequently affects the driving comfort and stability hence the coupling analysis between tethers tube vehicles in wave current environment centering on the tether bearing capacity and vibration has attracted the attention of scholars generally the tether tube vehicle coupled analysis of sfts in the wave current environment has gone through several stages from easy to difficult and from single factor coupling to multi factor coupling that is from the autonomous vibration of tethers in the wave current environment to the tube tether coupling in the wave current environment then to the tether tube vehicle coupling in still water condition and finally to the multi factor coupling of tethers tube vehicles in wave current environment at the same time the tether tube coupled analysis has undergone the following several stages 1 from the independent analysis of tethers to the simulation of tube effect on tether parameter vibrations using concentrated mass or spring stiffness and then to the tube tether coupling considering the tube deformation 2 from the negligence of tether sag to the consideration of tether sag and then to the consideration of nonlinear effect caused by tether displacement 3 from the negligence of tether downstream vibration to the consideration of such vibration as well as the forced vibration due to tube motion 4 from the constant tether vortex induced vibration excitation to the random environmental load excitation regarding the studies of tether self oscillation fogazzi and perotti 2000 constructed the ad hoc finite element response model of tethers which considered the axial force and lateral vibration of anchorage variation as well as the 3d vibration and elastoplastic behaviors the 5 dof articulated rod element was used to ensure the computational efficiency and accuracy based on iwan s modified wake oscillator model iwan 1981 ge 2007 established a method for calculating the transverse vortex induced vibration of sft tethers in shear current with which they analyzed the effects of buoyancy to weight ratio bwr of tunnel tube and shear flow characteristics on the vortex induced response of tethers chen et al 2008 and sun et al 2020 investigated the vibration response of tethers under combined actions of fluid vortex induced vibration and parametric vibration through tether tube nonlinear coupled modeling eq 2 where the influence of tunnel tube on tether vibration was considered and the tunnel tube was assumed to be a concentrated mass block fig 3 2 t 0 e e q a ε 2 v y 2 m e 2 v t 2 c v t f d where v is the displacement from the equilibrium position of the cable axis t 0 is the tension of the cable at static equilibrium e eq is the equivalent elastic modulus of tether cable a is the cross sectional area of the cable ε is the dynamic strain of the cable c is the viscous damping coefficient of anchor cable m e is the mass of tether cable of unit length f d is the hydrodynamic force of anchor cable per unit length and other parameters are defined as above according to the hamilton s principle luo and zhou 2014 calculated the lift coefficient and dimensionless modal amplitude by introducing blevins lift model and vengugopal damping model where the effect of additional mass on the dynamic properties of anchor cable was considered furthermore they calculated the vortex induced fatigue damage of anchor cable by employing the cumulative fatigue damage theory and s n fatigue curve based on the virtual excitation and galerkin methods wu et al 2017 and wu and mei 2017 developed a mathematical method for expressing the dynamic response of sft tethers additionally they employed the equivalent linearization technique to solve the nonlinear motion equation of oscillatory system and established a theoretical analysis model for the dynamic response in frequency domain of tunnel anchor cable under random wave force excitation with which they analyze the effects of wave and structural parameters on the vibration response under stationary and non stationary random excitations the majority of above studies assume that the initial tension of tether is considerably greater than its self weight with the variation of tension along the length and the flexural rigidity of tether being negligible the initial tension geometric dimension rigidity and material properties of tether remain unchanged along the length waves and currents are perpendicular to the tube and currents are steady moreover they perceive the self vibration of tether as the main research subject while the effect of the tube on tether vibration is seen as a mass block or the excitation by the tension variation parameter applied to the tether end or the forced excitation by simple harmonic displacement therefore the feature of the tube to have a slender structure is overlooked as a result it is impossible to consider the real coupling process of tether and the slender tube chen et al 2018 derived a system of differential equations of motion for the tether tube coupling system in line with the hamilton s principle where the tube and tethers were assumed to be bernoulli euler beam and standard strings respectively furthermore the coupling vibration effects of the tube and the tether system for sfts were fully considered meanwhile the nonlinear mechanical behavior of the coupling system was analyzed under typical operating conditions and dissimilar parameter settings moreover the parametric vibration and vortex induced vibration of the tube and the tether system was studied for coupled vibration analysis considering the participation of moving vehicle load dong et al 2016 established the motion equation for tethers tube vehicles of the sft by simplifying the vehicles into equally spaced moving loads and the tether action into elastic damping support respectively using the equation they numerically simulated the time domain response for mid span displacement of the tunnel and analyzed effects of tether vertical rigidity and vehicle moving velocity on the tunnel tube displacement xiang et al 2018 studied the systematic coupling effect through tube tether vehicle coupled modeling and considered additional inertial and damping effects of fluids where the vehicles and tube tether were simplified into concentrated moving loads and equally spaced elastic support beams respectively their study found that the tether rigidity had a certain inhibitory effect on the response of moving loads and that the fast moving loads would induce a drastic oscillation of sft structure based on the hamilton s theory d alembert principle as well as assumptions of beam elements and elastic foundation lin et al 2019 developed a theoretical analysis model of the tube vehicle tether coupling by simplifying the vehicles into a single dof elastic mass block without considering the slack of tethers using this model the coupled dynamic response of tube vehicle tether on account of the tether parametric excitation was studied although the above models fully consider the coupling between tethers the tube and vehicles they still fail to consider the environmental excitation effects like waves and currents which can thus be deemed as the tube tether vehicle coupling problem in still water conditions based on the research of lin et al 2019 lin et al 2018 further constructed a four factor coupling model of fluid tube vehicle tether as shown in fig 4 through the modal superposition method by assuming the inclusion of buoyancy inertial force and damping force to the current action with this model they analyzed the effects of parameters like vehicle moving velocity current velocity and the buoyancy to weight ratio on the vertical displacement and bending motion of the tunnel the corresponding kinetic equation of the sft can be obtained by the hamilton principle and is written as 3 m 2 w t 2 c w t e i 4 w x 4 k w f v x t f d x t where w z t denotes the vertical displacement of the tunnel measured from its static equilibrium position m c and ei are the mass damping and flexural rigidity of the sft respectively f v x t is the moving traffic loading f d x t is the fluid loading and k is the equivalent linear stiffness of the elastic foundation by using d alembert s principle the moving loading f v x t and the fluid loading f d x t can be represented as 4 f v x t m v g k v u t w x t δ x v t c v u t w x t t δ x v t m v u t k v u t w x t δ x v t c v u t w x t t δ x v t 0 f d x t 1 2 ρ d c l v 2 cos 2 π ω s t σ 1 2 c d ρ d w x t t w x t t 1 4 c m π d 2 ρ 2 w x t t 2 where u t is the vertical displacement of the vehicle measured from its static equilibrium position m v k v and c v are the mass stiffness and damping of the vehicle respectively δ is dirac s delta function and dot denotes derivation with respect to time ρ is the fluid density d is the tube diameter σ is the preliminary angle and ω s is the frequency of the vortex c l c d and c m are the non dimensional lift force coefficient the drag force coefficient and the added mass coefficient additionally jin and kim 2020 proposed a time domain hydroelastic model for wave tube tether vehicle interaction in the light of the morison equation and simplified kalker linear creep theory by deeming all the tunnel tube and tethers as slender rod as shown in fig 5 the coupling effect of the sft tube system in wave environment was analyzed using the model the equation of motion is written as 5 m r c a ρ a e r n e i r λ r w f d where c a is the added mass coefficients e is young s modulus i is second moment of sectional area λ t eiκ 2 t is effective tension in the rod κ is local curvature a e is a sectional area of displaced volume dot and apostrophe

calculated by morison equation the equation of motion for a train element is expressed as 6 m f f x f c f f c c x f k f f x f f f e where m c and k represent mass damping and stiffness matrices respectively while f is the external force vector and x is the displacement vector which have 5 dofs i e sway heave roll pitch and yaw motions detailed information can be found in jin and kim 2020 currently these two sets of models are comparatively complete mathematical models for the tether tube vehicle coupled analysis in hydrodynamic environments 2 3 global fluid structure coupling analysis of sft in terms of the foregoing mathematical method of hydrodynamic response for the sft the hydrodynamic load calculation and structural response analysis are conducted in two steps in which the hydrodynamic load is determined prior to structural response calculation despite simple practical and computationally less burdensome means of this sort it fails to take into account the dynamic coupling between the entire tunnel structure and the fluid which is bound to affect the accuracy of simulation results to some situation according to häukas and remseth 1997 the hydrodynamic response of the sft should be analyzed as an issue of interaction between fluid and structure accordingly basic equations for controlling the entire coupling domain were developed and the methods for solving frequency and time domains were proposed later on the basis of navier stokes n s equation remseth et al 1999 constructed a finite element model of fluid structure interaction for the frequency domain response analysis aided by the dynamic equilibrium equation as well as the time domain simulation of the random loading process in their model fluid and structure motion were solved by utilizing the incompressible n s equation and the nonlinear elasticity equation respectively moreover the coupling interface between the two regions was defined which was a computational fluid dynamics cfd approach nevertheless the model still simplified the sft tube to a 2 dof beam structure based on the reynolds average n s equation and abaqus commercial software mandara 2016 established a cfd model for the fluid structure interaction of the sft fig 6 and performed a static analysis of the structure aside from obtaining the external current field distribution of the 50 m long sft they also derived the hydrodynamic force borne by pipe sections the internal force of structure as well as their distributions the global fluid structure coupling analysis of the sft allows for more accurate computation of the coupling between fluid and tunnel structure as well as the hydrodynamic response of the structure nevertheless separate partial meshing and modeling computations of the fluid domain and the structure domain as well as the transfer of parameter information between the two domains are required considering that it is computationally burdensome time consuming and highly demanding on computer performance this method is more suitable for the research of small scale short range or 2d sft problems such as the hydrodynamic characteristics of structural sections for the case of super long span sfts some unique problems have to be faced compared with the conventional ship or offshore structures the super long span sft structure systems are extremely complex which includes tube tether pontoon tube joint and the local structures such as outer shell roadbed beam and slab etc furthermore the super long span sft can across several kilometers or even a few dozen kilometers the water depth varies greatly and the spatial distribution of hydrodynamic factors along with the sft such as wave or current is significantly different because of varying submarine topography due to the capabilities and the limitations of current computer the 3d fluid structure coupling analysis which needs to calculate both huge global 3d hydrodynamic response and the complicated structural local internal force consumes excessively high computational costs when compared to common 2d fluid solid interaction problems and is thus currently rarely employed for super long span sft in table 1 the representative mathematical models or theoretical analysis for the hydrodynamic response analysis of sfts at the present stage are summarized 3 physical modeling investigations for the novel structure of sfts physical modeling is an irreplaceable research method compared with numerical simulation or theoretical models the physical modeling researches on hydrodynamic responses of the sft call for a test site of a certain scale however the rather high cost and relatively harsh conditions gives rise to its scarcity in terms of test methods the dynamic responses of tunnel tube segments without end restraints in the still water 2d current and 2d wave environments are the main consideration at present encompassing the tube motion surface pressure intensity structure internal force tube drag force lift force vortex induced vibration viv and tether axial tension besides the directions of currents or waves are assumed to be perpendicular to the length of tube segments regarding test environment the pure water current environment is dominant at present in table 2 the representative research achievements at the present stage are listed 3 1 two dimensional tube segment model tests through a two dimensional segmental test gan 2009 studied the spatial force distribution of the sft subjected to hydrostatic loads in the light of the still water environment and verified the feasibility of virtual laminated elements in the global analysis of the underwater sft utilizing the transient force impact test yang et al 2019 conducted an experimental study on the overall dynamic properties of the sft from which the natural frequency and damping of the tunnel tube were acquired concerning tests in the water current environment yoshihara and mikami 1993 studied the hydrodynamic behaviors of the tunnel tube fixed at both ends based on the two dimensional uniform current test focused on measuring the drag and lift forces and then computed the drag force and the lift coefficient for various types of models by measuring the overall force of the tube in a 2d uniform current condition nishio and incecik 1995 analyzed the correlation between force and oscillation frequency of the current field according to the experimental measurement of sumer and fredsoe 1995 for the vortex shedding phenomenon of a fixed tunnel tube at high reynolds numbers the frequency of lift oscillation was found to equal that of vortex shedding and the frequency of drag force oscillation to equal twice that of vortex shedding the tunnel tube response was experimentally studied under impact drag and lift forces by venkataramana et al 1996 wu 1955 conducted a vortex induced vibration test of the tube under current action with the emphasis on the lock in phenomenon of dynamic response a sectional model test was carried out by chao et al 2016 on the fluid structure coupling vibration of tethers under water currents which focused on the vortex induced tether vibration and compared the effectiveness and adaptability between three types of vibration suppression devices namely three helical lines three control rods and fairings through the structural segment model test considering the current field and elasticity similarity criteria qin and zhou 2009a measured the circumferential and axial strains of tube structure under two dimensional currents as well as the axial force of tension leg tethers furthermore the variation trends of tunnel tube spatial force and tether axial force with the current conditions were studied in the context of the sognefjord strait sft in norway deng et al 2020 conducted a two dimensional vertical self excited oscillation test based on which they studied the viv problem with the parallel twin tube tunnel fig 7 and analyzed the effects of the reduced velocity and tube spacing coefficients spacing to diameter ratios of tubes on the vibration response the lift coefficient and overall torque of the tube see fig 8 the experimental studies related to the effect of waves on sfts are relatively few in comparison with tests in current environment lu et al 2009 conducted a two dimensional wave test to explore the effects of the buoyancy to weight ratio on the dynamic responses of tunnel segments through a regular wave test oh et al 2013 studied the lateral hydrodynamic properties of the single tube sft under wave action and measured the motion of the tube segment and the force of tethers on this basis oh and park 2016 studied the hydrodynamic properties of twin tubes with the background of china s qiongzhou strait channel li and jiang 2018 carried out a two dimensional irregular wave test and measured the pressure distribution of the tube section and the tensile force of tether for the circular section tunnel in similar test conditions jiang and li 2019 experimentally compared the hydrodynamic response traits of tunnel tube segments that were in three section shapes circle oval and octagon through a 2d wide flume test budiman et al 2017 studied the effects of the buoyancy to weight ratio of the sft on the sudden tension of tether under regular waves by taking the panggang karya island island crossing in indonesia as the background the foregoing experimental studies focus on the hydrodynamic features and action mechanisms of sfts which solve the qualitative understanding problem to some degree for the design and construction of such tunnels however more attention should be paid to the quantitative expression of their hydrodynamic responses in an attempt to guide practice to provide a design basis for the actual construction of sfts there has been a gradual shift towards the quantitative expression research of hydrodynamic responses for scholars from various countries based on theoretical derivation and the regular wave model test fig 9 seo et al 2015 derived the semi theoretical and semi empirical formulas for the wave load of the tunnel tube segment eq 7 the critical buoyancy for tether relaxation eq 8 and the equation of motion eq 9 7 f x f z tan φ c m ρ v h 2 ω 2 cosh k z d sinh k d sin k x ω t 8 b 0 s l o c k h 2 k e k z z d cos φ c m ρ g v 9 x t 1 2 c m ρ v h g k l m 2 t m l m ω 2 cosh k z d cosh k d

obtaining the imposed loads hydrodynamic coefficients and motion response characteristics of the two dimensional tunnel tube segment under various hydrodynamic environments and anchorage designs wave height period submerged water depth anchoring angle and buoyancy to weight ratio furthermore the empirical computational formulas for the amount of tunnel tube motion were deducted on the basis of substantial test data 10 d x d 53 5 h d 0 94 t g d 0 66 r 5 55 d s d 1 37 θ 4 00 11 d y d 15 3 h d 1 15 t g d 0 65 r 6 19 d s d 1 61 θ 1 50 12 α 16 4 h d 0 99 t g d 0 68 r 6 01 d s d 1 29 θ 0 58 where d x and d y denote the tube displacement away from the equilibrium position along the wave propagating and vertical directions respectively α denotes the rotation angle of the tube section d s represents the submerged depth of the tunnel tube distance of tube top from water surface r is the buoyancy to weight ratio of the tunnel tube d is the diameter of the tunnel tube the remaining parameters are defined in the same way as above the aforementioned empirical formulas can provide a theoretical reference for the actual selection of design parameters for the sft 3 2 three dimensional global hydroelastic model tests duo to the large span the mechanical responses of sfts including global and local motion deformation are extremely complex under the wave current effect in particular for complicated marine hydrodynamic environments such as multidirectional irregular waves reciprocating currents and shear currents the global motion and deformation characteristics of the tunnel should raise more concern however the aforementioned two dimensional model tests are incapable of simulating complex marine environments and the end constraints of models therefore they are unable to grasp the overall response laws of tunnel structure accurately turning it into a kind of less than ideal or compromised method it is self evident that the most ideal way to obtain the complete hydrodynamic response parameters of the sft should be the three dimensional global model test of interaction between waves currents and structure which is implemented by placing the entire tunnel including the tunnel shores the tube and tethers into a basin however tests of this sort need a large scale deep water wave basin which are exceptionally demanding on the test site equipment and model fabrication and are rather costly as well consequently few research institutes are currently involved in such tests to systematically study the global dynamic response of the long span sft under wave and current effect in 2018 the national engineering laboratory for port hydraulic construction technology of the tianjin research institute for water transport engineering m o t built a novel large scale deep water test basin fig 10 c exclusively for this research aim after independent design and r d with dimensions of length width depth being 65 0 m 37 0 m 2 5 m the basin is equipped with a high power high performance wave and current generating system which has a current generating ability of the 0 5 m s mean velocity on full section and a wave generating ability of 0 5 m wave height at a 2 m water depth thus filling the gap in the deep water high velocity current generation test site in china moreover the laboratory is provided with advanced dynamic response measuring instruments the intelligent equipment control system the dynamic test digital twin system the ultra low latency data synchronous acquisition system and the intelligent data analysis cloud system which offers excellent conditions for the hydrodynamic tests as well as massive data acquisition and analysis for large suspension structures like the sfts based on a backbone hydroelastic modeling technique a global hydrodynamic physical model test of the sft at a geometric scale of 1 50 was firstly conducted under wave current field where the hydrodynamic similarity and global elasticity similarity of structure were both considered in the national engineering laboratory for port hydraulic construction technology of the tianjin research institute for water transport engineering m o t considering that the prototype tunnel has a span of 1 2 km and the model is 25 4 m in length this experiment boasts the global model test of the sft with the longest span worldwide so far fig 10a b and d based on the experiment the three dimensional hydroelastic response characteristics of the sft are analyzed in disparate hydrodynamic conditions and the global hydroelastic response mechanisms of the long span tunnel are revealed preliminarily under waves currents and combined wave current action as to the obtained experimental data it can provide a basis for verification of most existing numerical or theoretical models for analyzing the global hydrodynamic response of sfts 4 main existing problems and future of hydrodynamic response investigation method 4 1 problems with existing mathematical model methods as mentioned above the sft is bound to produce complex structural response under hydrodynamic effect which becomes more intricate with the increasing span of tunnel and the variability of environment the external hydrodynamic force is not only the leading cause of the response but also the key to the design of the sft system despite the consideration of environment and the tunnel tether tube vehicle multi factor coupling most of the previous studies were targeted at short span waters with relatively weak hydrodynamic conditions resulting in the shortage of concern in effects of more extreme and complex hydrodynamics in particular the existing numerical simulation methods or theoretical models mostly adopt theoretical regular waves and constant uniform currents in the selection of environmental conditions moreover the directions of waves and currents are assumed to be perpendicular to the tunnel axis without considering the directionality randomness or nonlinearity of waves as well as the distribution of wave and current along the tunnel axis in reality waves and currents in the sea areas are featured with extreme complexity due to the influences of near shore submarine topography coastline and tidal fluctuation which are characterized by spatial non uniformity irregularity multi directionality strong nonlinearity etc affected by such difference the mathematical models will differ immensely from the actual force and motion states additionally the existing mathematical models make excessive idealized assumptions about the tunnel tube and tethers such as the simplification of the tube into a beam without considering the structural internal forces of the tunnel tube wall internal roadbed as well as beams and columns or the simplification of tethers into massless springs or rods taking no account of the influences of their mass and rigidity the primary mathematical method remains the two steps procedure of calculating the external hydrodynamic load followed by the computation of structural response namely the one way coupling from the environmental load to the structural response all of these will bring about deviations in the simulating results 4 2 problems with existing physical modeling methods owing to a large span and a complicated internal structure the sfts undergo not only the global motion deformation but also the local deformation within the structure by the action of external hydrodynamic forces limited by the test site conditions all sectional model tests are carried out on a certain segment with a two dimensional flume for the existing model test studies lacking systematic three dimensional global model tests there present several problems a non uniformity and directionality of the wave and current field spatial distributions are over looked b neither the restraining action of adjacent structural segments concerning the tunnel nor the end restraints or the actual rigidity can be simulated on account of the flume width limitation c since the tunnel structure is deemed as a rigid body the elastic deformation of structure itself can hardly be taken into accurate consideration even for the backbone hydroelastic test research conducted by the authors of this paper preliminarily it is unable to obtain the force distribution state inside the tunnel structure fully in reality the sft is embedded in the rock at both ends with the restraint at the middle part being rather small which also diminishes as the length increases generally the existing model tests make the two ends fixed or completely free generating the either extremely great or small integral rigidity which is apparently inconsistent with the actual situation as a result they can hardly reflect the real underwater dynamics and force state of the sft structure preciously thereby reducing the effectiveness and practicality of research findings greatly 4 3 problems with using mathematical model or physical modeling method alone apart from the above problems the utilization of mathematical model or physical modeling alone has its respective intrinsic shortcomings existing mathematical model methods for sfts mostly adopt the theoretical waves and currents for describing their effects on structure as to the advantages of this type of method it is not affected by scale effect not limited by the site and experimental equipment and easy to modify which is suitable for the global response computation of structure in general nevertheless substantial simplifying assumptions generally adopted in mathematical models which leads to the failure of consideration to the propagation simulation of large scale complex waves and the precise computation of global and local motion deformation parameters of complex structures simultaneously this is particularly true when dealing with problems like wave breaking water impact and their strong nonlinear interaction with structures comparatively speaking the physical modeling can get access to real physical phenomena more easily which is appropriate for the investigation of complex nonlinear problems however the greatest drawback of such methods lies in the consideration of a limited area due to the limitation by the scope of experimental site equipment performance scale etc inflexibility for conversion and modification enormous expense and large consumption of time and labor large in scale sfts can cross dozens or even hundreds of kilometers of waters along the route the hydrodynamic environmental conditions vary greatly in space and the hydrodynamic responses are complex prior to designing it is of necessity to derive technical parameters of global structure including the motion and force and to clarify the detail and local deformation parameters taking a sft with a 30 km span as an example if only the physical modeling test is adopted where the appropriate minimum geometric scale is assumed to be 1 80 then the dimensions of water tank must be above 380 m 380 m to arrange the entire tunnel model into it obviously this is beyond the size range of existing test tanks in the world so far meanwhile in the case that the mathematical model is exclusively employed in view of the huge computational domain and structural scale considering the propagation simulation of large scale complex waves while simultaneously considering the precise computation of local motion deformation parameters of complex structures with existing technology cannot be realized apparently similar problems have also appeared in the research of the mooring system for the deep water offshore platform which is a common challenge encountered by the international marine engineering community at present 4 4 future of hydrodynamic response investigation method as the products of super long span large scale and deep water development of bridge and tunnel traffic engineering sfts will inevitably encounter marine environments more complex than the conventional bridge the tunnel and marine engineering as well as more complicated hydrodynamic response problems to sum up scholars worldwide have developed a range of simulation measures and methods targeting this problem and have yielded substantial major outcomes however on the whole certain technical defects remain existent in the existing mathematical model or physical modeling methods with the enhancement of computer performance algorithms simulation technologies and experimental conditions research methods will continue to be innovated reviewing the previous works and looking into the future the following several trends are present in the hydrodynamic response research of sfts the in depth research of which should be carried out correspondingly 1 more efficient and accurate mathematical model with the continuous upgrading of computer performance and algorithms an important trend is that the full time domain computational fluid mechanics cfd simulation of large scale 3d fluid structure interaction has become increasingly feasible to remove most of the numerical simplified assumptions hence the current two step computation mode of external hydrodynamic load followed by the structural response used in the past will develop towards the mode of direct 3d fluid structure interaction simulation for complex sft systems for example the total factor coupling between the hydrodynamic environment three dimensional sft tube tether vehicle and seabed foundation allows the interaction between the complex multidirectional waves complex currents and structural system responses to be considered another development direction is to seek coupling of different numerical or theoretical models for example multi face coupling of the wave potential theory for external wave propagation the computational fluid mechanics for computation of local wave current field and the elastic shell theory for computation of structural inner force etc 2 more complete physical modeling with the improved experimental conditions and the development of various modeling technologies direct three dimensional global hydroelastic model tests of sfts should become the mainstream hence the two dimensional flume section model test used in the past is supposed to develop towards the three dimensional multi segment global hydroelastic model test of large scale deep water wind current basins respecting the experimental conditions the development direction is from the single load tests such as still water pure current regular wave or irregular wave to the multidirectional nonlinear irregular wave or the wave current coupling 3 integration of mathematical model and physical modeling considering the key edge of sfts to address the problem of deep water strait crossing in the future they will surely extend to ultra long spans of tens of or even hundreds of kilometers for the ultra long span submerged floating structures there is yet no test basin in the world that can accommodate them for model testing besides mathematical model also has inevitable technical defects hence an integration of mathematical model and physical modeling is a vital solution to the investigation of hydrodynamic responses for sfts since the respective advantages of the two methods are exploited and their shortcomings are averted 4 consideration of multi disastrous factor and multi scale hydrodynamic problems the research on the mechanical mechanism and safety measures of sfts under the coupling of extreme multi disastrous loads e g marine seismic explosions tsunami internal wave fire disaster foundation damage leakage sudden cable breakage etc and hydrodynamic environments as well as multi scale dynamic numerical simulation and experiment under various special loads and disasters is the key to verify the theoretical models and to solve the technical challenges in engineering application 5 conclusion in this study the hydrodynamic response investigation methods of sft are analyzed in detail to prepare an up to date technical review from the mathematical model and the physical modeling aspects the following main conclusions are drawn from this study there are two major methods for determining the hydrodynamic load of sft tubes including morison equation and diffraction theory for normal construction conditions both morison equation and diffraction theory are found to yield accurate hydrodynamic calculations kunisu 2010 detailed analysis of the literature shows that the four factor coupling model of wave tube vehicle tether lin et al 2018 and the time domain hydroelastic model for wave tube tether vehicle interaction jin and kim 2020 are currently comparatively complete numerical models for the tether tube vehicle coupled analysis in hydrodynamic environments for the physical modeling investigations an obvious alternative to obtain the complete hydrodynamic response parameters of the sft is a direct three dimensional global model test including the tunnel shores the tube and tethers which is perhaps less common but on the increase the literature review also clearly show that the existing mathematical models use a lot of simplified assumptions which are efficient in relatively simple condition but less flexible in treating the actual complicated hydrodynamic environment and that the present physical model tests have difficult in properly simulating the end constraints actual stiffness and structural elastic deformation of the sft model therefore it is predicted that the full time domain fluid structure coupling mathematical model with complicated hydrodynamic environment the 3d full hydroelastic model test in large deep water basin and the integration of mathematical and physical models are the main attractive directions for the hydrodynamic response investigation of sft in future additionally the ultimate goal of hydrodynamic response research for sfts is to efficaciously control the motion and force of the structural system in line with the attained response value rather than targeting merely the problem itself so as to achieve safety and stability as countries around the world have put forward plans for the construction of sfts successively future research will be oriented more towards the actual projects for this reason the effective control of tunnel hydrodynamic response will become the focus of technological research and development in a gradual manner

20930,submerged floating tunnel sft is a new type of transportation infrastructure for crossing sea straits in relatively deeper water compared with the traditional fixed tunnel the main challenge in sft design is obtaining the hydrodynamic response parameters with a complex hydrodynamic environment however long span sft length 5 km and spatial difference of the hydrodynamic load along with the tunnel length bring unprecedented challenges in hydrodynamic response investigations the existing analysis theory or method could not fully meet the requirement of the dynamic controlling design of long span sft when considering complex ocean environment this paper systematically collates and reviews the research status and latest achievements concerning the hydrodynamic response investigation method of sft from two aspects mathematical model and physical modeling typical theoretical and or numerical model for determination of hydrodynamic load the tube response under wave current the tether tube vehicle coupled analysis in wave and current and the global fluid structure coupling analysis in the mathematical models are introduced emphasis are given on the basic assumption governing equations environmental conditions and factor consideration the major methods and output of 2d and 3d model tests in the physical modeling are also summarized detailed analysis of the literature shows that numerous mathematical or physical methods have been devised for predicting the hydrodynamic load tube response and tether tube vehicle interaction in wave and or current however the existing mathematical models use a lot of simplified assumptions which are efficient in relatively simple condition but less flexible in treating the actual complicated hydrodynamic environment the present physical model tests have difficult in properly simulating the end constraints actual stiffness and structural elastic deformation of the sft model based on the current research progress it is predicted that the full time domain fluid structure coupling mathematical model with complicated hydrodynamic environment the 3d full hydroelastic model test in large deep water basin and the integration of mathematical and physical models are the main attractive directions for the hydrodynamic response investigation of sft in future keywords submerged floating tunnels hydrodynamic response investigation mathematical model physical modeling 1 introduction submerged floating tunnel hereafter referred as sft is a novel type of tunnel that is suspended under water level which maintains its balance by buoyancy self weight and support system it is another new cross sea passage technology fig 1 after the cross sea bridges and subsea tunnels that is expected to achieve deep strait crossing in the future which is a hot future oriented topic with major challenges in the fields of deep sea resource development and utilization transportation infrastructure etc once after its proposal the concept has received high attention from academia and industrial circles globally becoming a high tech strategic highland competed for by europe america japan south korea china and other countries as of now the following locations for sft construction have been proposed china s qiandao lake mazzolani et al 2007 and jintang strait mazzolani et al 2001 italy s strait of messina mazzolani et al 2009 norway s høgsfjord strait skorpa and østlid 2001 switzerland s lake lugano haugerud et al 2001 america s lake washington felch 2001 japan s funka bay kanle 2010 indonesia s seribu islands endah et al 2011 mexico s baja california faggiano et al 2016 south korea s jeju island seo et al 2015 etc of these countries norway and south korea have formulated real construction plans so far however there has been no completed project of any sft worldwide in 2018 the china association for science and technology listed the key technology of sft as one of china s 60 major future oriented scientific issues and engineering technical challenges with comparative advantages such as flexible site selection high commuting rate no impact on surface navigation little impact on surroundings and saving of construction costs the sft is expected to turn numerous deep coastal straits around the world into thoroughfares once upon maturity of technology it is one of the vital alternatives to resolve the deep and wide water traffic crossing in the future such as the crossing of major coastal straits coastal lands islands and islands islands in general the balance of sft in water is maintained by employing special support systems like tethers and pontoon currently these support systems can be conceptually classified into the tether type pontoon type pile type etc depending on the form of support among which the tether and pontoon type are the most typical since being suspended in water the design and construction of sft are utterly different from those of the common underground tunnels or bridges which are faced with brand new challenges as an interdisciplinary systems engineering project it needs to break through a series of key scientific technical and engineering challenges the main scientific challenges can be generally summarized as follows 1 hydrodynamic characteristics of the sft tube with different cross sectional shape 2 hydroelastic dynamic response mechanism 3d fluid structure coupling of the whole span of the sft structure under complex wave current ocean environment 3 coupling vibration mechanism of the tunnel tube and its support foundation under the combined loads of wave current vehicle 4 structural fatigue damage and its failure mode 5 ultimate bearing capacity of the sft structure system of tube junction support foundation under multiple disaster causing factors 6 high strength and durable constructional composite materials for high pressure and strangely corrosive ocean environment 7 influence mechanism of sft on water ecological environment however the core challenge is how to ensure the stability and safety of structural system in the harsh marine environment which determines the success or failure of the entire project as a result how to predict the hydrodynamic response including the hydrodynamic and or the hydroelastic dynamic response of sft accurately and obtain such technical parameters as the overall and local motion deformation and force of structure in harsh marine environment are the primary scientific and technical issues that are encountered in the design construction and safe operation these constitute the main research tasks at the present stage to clarify the complex hydrodynamic response mechanism of sfts scholars all over the world have carried out extensive useful work establishing a variety of researching systems and methodologies providing scientific basis and guidance for subsequent research nevertheless previous studies mainly focused on the short span sft hereafter sft with length less than or equal to 1 km is regarded as short span sft the ideal environmental conditions the theoretical and numerical analysis the 2d model tests and lacked systematic global 3d model test verification the existing mathematical model use a lot of simplified assumptions without considering the actual complicated hydrodynamic environment and the present physical model tests have difficult in properly simulating the end constraints actual stiffness and structural elastic deformation of the sft model as a result the problem of prediction of real dynamic response of long span sft hereafter sft with larger than 5 km is regarded as long span sft under complex environment cannot be solved which limit the practicability of the study on the whole there is yet a systematic and complete theoretical or technical system design specification or standard for such tunnels with the development of the sft technology the problem of hydrodynamic response caused by the long span tunnel and spatial difference of the hydrodynamic load is becoming striking which leads to the systematic design facing unprecedented challenges the current hydrodynamic analysis theory research method cannot satisfy the requirement of the dynamic controlling design of long span sft in complex ocean environment it is necessary to develop nonlinear hydrodynamic response calculation theory and comprehensive experimental method compared with the fixed tunnel the hydrodynamic response investigation of the sft is quite challenging since its complex environmental load factors which includes not only the common hydrodynamic loads e g waves current but also coupling of the hydrodynamic loads with the traffic moving loads e g trains and or automobiles and or the extreme or sudden loads e g marine seismic explosion tsunami internal wave fire disaster foundation damage leakage sudden cable breakage etc in the past decade a number of reviews regarding the sft have been presented see e g dong et al 2007 xiang et al 2017 jiang and li 2018 and ding et al 2019 previous reviews mainly focused on the structural response or mechanical behaviors of sft and its mooring system under environmental and or traffic loads however limited attention has been paid to the hydrodynamic response investigation method itself the main problems in the existing theory or method have also not been deeply discussed the main purpose of this paper is to systematically collate and summarize the previous and latest research achievements around the hydrodynamic response investigation methods for tethered sft from the perspectives of mathematical model and physical modeling due to the problem complexity and space constraints however it is difficult to account for all these aspects in one paper therefore only the common hydrodynamic loads and traffic moving loads will be taken into account through conducting comparative analysis the problems and deficiencies with extant methods are summed up additionally the development trends are prospected and relevant suggestions are put forward 2 mathematical model investigations regarding the hydrodynamic response research of sft mathematical model theoretical analysis or numerical model is an important method adopted at the present stage over the past decade numerous theoretical or numerical models have been proposed to determine the hydrodynamic response of the sft under complex environmental loads the primary method remains the two steps procedure i z first obtaining the external hydrodynamic load by assuming the underwater structure to be fixed and then calculating the structural response using the known hydrodynamic load this manner can be classified as the one way coupling from the environmental load to the structural response so that the wave current field around sft induced by the structural response cannot be fully considered another way to analyze the sft response is through a global fluid structure coupled analysis where the hydrodynamic response is analyzed as an issue of interaction between fluid and structure in this section we discuss these three aspects hydrodynamic load sft system coupled vibration mainly including the tether tube coupling and the tether tube vehicle coupling tube cable coupling and global fluid structure coupling analysis 2 1 hydrodynamic load and response of tubes 2 1 1 determination of hydrodynamic load currently there are two major methods for determining the hydrodynamic load of sft tubes including morison equation and diffraction theory of which the morison equation is used primarily for the computation of current force the equation was proposed by morison in 1950 assuming that the dimension of a structure is insufficient to affect the hydrodynamic field significantly and that the hydrodynamic load acting on a structure includes the inertial force and the drag force which depends mainly on the velocity and acceleration of water particles in the unstructured hydrodynamic field this method is more suitable for relatively small scale problems as an empirical formula approach the morison equation considers the effects of water viscosity and inertia where the hydrodynamic load can be obtained just by determining two important equation parameters c d and c m denote the drag force coefficient and the inertial force coefficient respectively at present this rather simple method is extensively used in the study of sft in addition to the morison equation another method for wave force computation is the diffraction theory proposed by maccamy and fuchs this method assumes that the fluid is inviscid and incompressible and the fluid motion is irrotational besides the liquid surface satisfies linear free surface boundary conditions the velocity potential generated by wave field and sft is assumed to be divided into the incident potential and the diffraction potential after deriving velocity potential by boundary element method the pressure distribution acting on the tunnel tube surface can be obtained using the bernoulli s equation based on the pressure distribution the force and moment acting on the tunnel can be obtained for instance mai et al 2005 calculated the wave force of sft by employing the boundary element method in frequency domain based on the diffraction theory consequently obtaining the three dimensional hydrodynamic properties of tunnel tube based on the potential flow theory and high order boundary element method jin et al 2019 analyzed the wave force additional mass and radiation damping of sfts with different section shapes in an immobile state similar applications can be found in references wen 2007 tariverdil et al 2011 cao 2011 the above two methods have their respective ranges of adaptation in general the diffraction theory is mostly used when the inertial force is dominant while the morison equation is used when both the inertial and drag forces are non negligible comparison of these two methods by kunisu 2010 for the hydrodynamic computation of sfts found that in normal construction conditions water depth 100 m submerged water depth 30 m tube diameter 23 m both the drag and inertial forces account for significant proportions when larger tube diameters are considered the inertial force would dominate at a k c number of less than 15 moreover the use of both morison equation and diffraction theory was found to yield accurate hydrodynamic calculations fig 2 2 1 2 tube response under wave current environment after the determination of hydrodynamic load the dynamic response of tunnel tube structure is computed numerically this involves the global computation and the detailed tube structure computation targeting the problem of global response computation the main method currently adopted is the finite element model which is based on beam and rod elements that is the tube is regarded as an integral whole without considering the internal force distribution of structure typical dynamic equilibrium equation for the tube response can be expressed as 1 m 2 w t 2 e i 4 w y 4 c w t f where m is sft s mass per unit length of the tube ei is the bending stiffness of the tube w is the vertical displacement y is the coordinate along the length of the tunnel c is the viscous damping coefficient of the structure f is the hydrodynamic force per unit length of the tube t is the time regarding the global tube response computation faggiano et al 2001 discussed the design modeling and response evaluation of a sft solution for the messina strait crossing in italy by simplifying the tunnel tube into spatial beam elements xie et al 2007 simplified the sft tube as a beam model with elastic support and introduced the transfer matrix method for simplified static analysis of sft besides xie 2007 employed two dimensional elastic beam to simulate the sft tube and used elastic hinges to simulate the joints between tube sections thereby analyzing the static and dynamic characteristics of the tunnel structure system in the case of china s qiandao lake prototype long et al 2009 2015 studied the effects of tube parameters on the hydrodynamic response of structure through finite element modeling which considered the effects of nonlinear fluid resistance and nonlinear tether restoring force with a simple supported beam model qin and zhou 2009 and qin 2009 explored the possible chaotic behaviors during the vortex induced vibration of tube sections through carrying out the melnikov function analysis all the above computations of tube hydrodynamic force adopt the morison equation mai et al 2015 established finite element models for sft and support system based on a combination of wave diffraction theory vibrating beam finite element method and beam element cr formulation and calculated the effects of waves and currents on the tunnel tube with a similar approach tian et al 2014 analyzed the dynamic responses of sft under combined internal wave and ocean current effect based on the potential flow theory ge et al 2010 estimated the fluid structure interaction by boundary element method and solved the structure dynamic equation by three dimensional finite element method thereby developing a hydroelastic analysis model of sft furthermore they calculated the tunnel tube deformation and the joint axial force with the china s qiandao lake prototype as an example to investigate the deformation and force distribution of detailed section of sft tube sato et al 2008 simplified the tunnel into a discontinuous elastic foundation beam model and assumed that the tube body was a euler bernouli beam and the tethers were axial springs through mathematical derivation they verified the equivalence between the proposed model and a beam model on elastic supports this methodology has been adopted by numerous subsequent scholars for the computational analysis of tube deformation and force distribution xiang and xue 2002 gan et al 2009 proposed the virtual element theory capable of computing the internal force distribution of structure this theory is suitable for the global internal force analysis of sft space additionally by employing the large eddy simulation luo et al 2012 numerically analyzed the steady state circumferential pressure distribution of sfts with five different section shapes as well as the fluid lift and drag forces 2 2 tether tube vehicle coupled analysis in wave current environment for the tethered sfts the tunnel tube maintains balance in the water by self weight buoyancy and tether tensile force the net buoyancy buoyancy minus self weight generated by the tube is offset by tethers and transmitted to the seabed foundation in extreme sea conditions the bearing capacity of tether system determines the safety of entire sft system directly meanwhile in normal operating condition the wave current action and moving vehicle loads also cause the coupling vibration of tube and tethers which consequently affects the driving comfort and stability hence the coupling analysis between tethers tube vehicles in wave current environment centering on the tether bearing capacity and vibration has attracted the attention of scholars generally the tether tube vehicle coupled analysis of sfts in the wave current environment has gone through several stages from easy to difficult and from single factor coupling to multi factor coupling that is from the autonomous vibration of tethers in the wave current environment to the tube tether coupling in the wave current environment then to the tether tube vehicle coupling in still water condition and finally to the multi factor coupling of tethers tube vehicles in wave current environment at the same time the tether tube coupled analysis has undergone the following several stages 1 from the independent analysis of tethers to the simulation of tube effect on tether parameter vibrations using concentrated mass or spring stiffness and then to the tube tether coupling considering the tube deformation 2 from the negligence of tether sag to the consideration of tether sag and then to the consideration of nonlinear effect caused by tether displacement 3 from the negligence of tether downstream vibration to the consideration of such vibration as well as the forced vibration due to tube motion 4 from the constant tether vortex induced vibration excitation to the random environmental load excitation regarding the studies of tether self oscillation fogazzi and perotti 2000 constructed the ad hoc finite element response model of tethers which considered the axial force and lateral vibration of anchorage variation as well as the 3d vibration and elastoplastic behaviors the 5 dof articulated rod element was used to ensure the computational efficiency and accuracy based on iwan s modified wake oscillator model iwan 1981 ge 2007 established a method for calculating the transverse vortex induced vibration of sft tethers in shear current with which they analyzed the effects of buoyancy to weight ratio bwr of tunnel tube and shear flow characteristics on the vortex induced response of tethers chen et al 2008 and sun et al 2020 investigated the vibration response of tethers under combined actions of fluid vortex induced vibration and parametric vibration through tether tube nonlinear coupled modeling eq 2 where the influence of tunnel tube on tether vibration was considered and the tunnel tube was assumed to be a concentrated mass block fig 3 2 t 0 e e q a ε 2 v y 2 m e 2 v t 2 c v t f d where v is the displacement from the equilibrium position of the cable axis t 0 is the tension of the cable at static equilibrium e eq is the equivalent elastic modulus of tether cable a is the cross sectional area of the cable ε is the dynamic strain of the cable c is the viscous damping coefficient of anchor cable m e is the mass of tether cable of unit length f d is the hydrodynamic force of anchor cable per unit length and other parameters are defined as above according to the hamilton s principle luo and zhou 2014 calculated the lift coefficient and dimensionless modal amplitude by introducing blevins lift model and vengugopal damping model where the effect of additional mass on the dynamic properties of anchor cable was considered furthermore they calculated the vortex induced fatigue damage of anchor cable by employing the cumulative fatigue damage theory and s n fatigue curve based on the virtual excitation and galerkin methods wu et al 2017 and wu and mei 2017 developed a mathematical method for expressing the dynamic response of sft tethers additionally they employed the equivalent linearization technique to solve the nonlinear motion equation of oscillatory system and established a theoretical analysis model for the dynamic response in frequency domain of tunnel anchor cable under random wave force excitation with which they analyze the effects of wave and structural parameters on the vibration response under stationary and non stationary random excitations the majority of above studies assume that the initial tension of tether is considerably greater than its self weight with the variation of tension along the length and the flexural rigidity of tether being negligible the initial tension geometric dimension rigidity and material properties of tether remain unchanged along the length waves and currents are perpendicular to the tube and currents are steady moreover they perceive the self vibration of tether as the main research subject while the effect of the tube on tether vibration is seen as a mass block or the excitation by the tension variation parameter applied to the tether end or the forced excitation by simple harmonic displacement therefore the feature of the tube to have a slender structure is overlooked as a result it is impossible to consider the real coupling process of tether and the slender tube chen et al 2018 derived a system of differential equations of motion for the tether tube coupling system in line with the hamilton s principle where the tube and tethers were assumed to be bernoulli euler beam and standard strings respectively furthermore the coupling vibration effects of the tube and the tether system for sfts were fully considered meanwhile the nonlinear mechanical behavior of the coupling system was analyzed under typical operating conditions and dissimilar parameter settings moreover the parametric vibration and vortex induced vibration of the tube and the tether system was studied for coupled vibration analysis considering the participation of moving vehicle load dong et al 2016 established the motion equation for tethers tube vehicles of the sft by simplifying the vehicles into equally spaced moving loads and the tether action into elastic damping support respectively using the equation they numerically simulated the time domain response for mid span displacement of the tunnel and analyzed effects of tether vertical rigidity and vehicle moving velocity on the tunnel tube displacement xiang et al 2018 studied the systematic coupling effect through tube tether vehicle coupled modeling and considered additional inertial and damping effects of fluids where the vehicles and tube tether were simplified into concentrated moving loads and equally spaced elastic support beams respectively their study found that the tether rigidity had a certain inhibitory effect on the response of moving loads and that the fast moving loads would induce a drastic oscillation of sft structure based on the hamilton s theory d alembert principle as well as assumptions of beam elements and elastic foundation lin et al 2019 developed a theoretical analysis model of the tube vehicle tether coupling by simplifying the vehicles into a single dof elastic mass block without considering the slack of tethers using this model the coupled dynamic response of tube vehicle tether on account of the tether parametric excitation was studied although the above models fully consider the coupling between tethers the tube and vehicles they still fail to consider the environmental excitation effects like waves and currents which can thus be deemed as the tube tether vehicle coupling problem in still water conditions based on the research of lin et al 2019 lin et al 2018 further constructed a four factor coupling model of fluid tube vehicle tether as shown in fig 4 through the modal superposition method by assuming the inclusion of buoyancy inertial force and damping force to the current action with this model they analyzed the effects of parameters like vehicle moving velocity current velocity and the buoyancy to weight ratio on the vertical displacement and bending motion of the tunnel the corresponding kinetic equation of the sft can be obtained by the hamilton principle and is written as 3 m 2 w t 2 c w t e i 4 w x 4 k w f v x t f d x t where w z t denotes the vertical displacement of the tunnel measured from its static equilibrium position m c and ei are the mass damping and flexural rigidity of the sft respectively f v x t is the moving traffic loading f d x t is the fluid loading and k is the equivalent linear stiffness of the elastic foundation by using d alembert s principle the moving loading f v x t and the fluid loading f d x t can be represented as 4 f v x t m v g k v u t w x t δ x v t c v u t w x t t δ x v t m v u t k v u t w x t δ x v t c v u t w x t t δ x v t 0 f d x t 1 2 ρ d c l v 2 cos 2 π ω s t σ 1 2 c d ρ d w x t t w x t t

currently these two sets of models are comparatively complete mathematical models for the tether tube vehicle coupled analysis in hydrodynamic environments 2 3 global fluid structure coupling analysis of sft in terms of the foregoing mathematical method of hydrodynamic response for the sft the hydrodynamic load calculation and structural response analysis are conducted in two steps in which the hydrodynamic load is determined prior to structural response calculation despite simple practical and computationally less burdensome means of this sort it fails to take into account the dynamic coupling between the entire tunnel structure and the fluid which is bound to affect the accuracy of simulation results to some situation according to häukas and remseth 1997 the hydrodynamic response of the sft should be analyzed as an issue of interaction between fluid and structure accordingly basic equations for controlling the entire coupling domain were developed and the methods for solving frequency and time domains were proposed later on the basis of navier stokes n s equation remseth et al 1999 constructed a finite element model of fluid structure interaction for the frequency domain response analysis aided by the dynamic equilibrium equation as well as the time domain simulation of the random loading process in their model fluid and structure motion were solved by utilizing the incompressible n s equation and the nonlinear elasticity equation respectively moreover the coupling interface between the two regions was defined which was a computational fluid dynamics cfd approach nevertheless the model still simplified the sft tube to a 2 dof beam structure based on the reynolds average n s equation and abaqus commercial software mandara 2016 established a cfd model for the fluid structure interaction of the sft fig 6 and performed a static analysis of the structure aside from obtaining the external current field distribution of the 50 m long sft they also derived the hydrodynamic force borne by pipe sections the internal force of structure as well as their distributions the global fluid structure coupling analysis of the sft allows for more accurate computation of the coupling between fluid and tunnel structure as well as the hydrodynamic response of the structure nevertheless separate partial meshing and modeling computations of the fluid domain and the structure domain as well as the transfer of parameter information between the two domains are required considering that it is computationally burdensome time consuming and highly demanding on computer performance this method is more suitable for the research of small scale short range or 2d sft problems such as the hydrodynamic characteristics of structural sections for the case of super long span sfts some unique problems have to be faced compared with the conventional ship or offshore structures the super long span sft structure systems are extremely complex which includes tube tether pontoon tube joint and the local structures such as outer shell roadbed beam and slab etc furthermore the super long span sft can across several kilometers or even a few dozen kilometers the water depth varies greatly and the spatial distribution of hydrodynamic factors along with the sft such as wave or current is significantly different because of varying submarine topography due to the capabilities and the limitations of current computer the 3d fluid structure coupling analysis which needs to calculate both huge global 3d hydrodynamic response and the complicated structural local internal force consumes excessively high computational costs when compared to common 2d fluid solid interaction problems and is thus currently rarely employed for super long span sft in table 1 the representative mathematical models or theoretical analysis for the hydrodynamic response analysis of sfts at the present stage are summarized 3 physical modeling investigations for the novel structure of sfts physical modeling is an irreplaceable research method compared with numerical simulation or theoretical models the physical modeling researches on hydrodynamic responses of the sft call for a test site of a certain scale however the rather high cost and relatively harsh conditions gives rise to its scarcity in terms of test methods the dynamic responses of tunnel tube segments without end restraints in the still water 2d current and 2d wave environments are the main consideration at present encompassing the tube motion surface pressure intensity structure internal force tube drag force lift force vortex induced vibration viv and tether axial tension besides the directions of currents or waves are assumed to be perpendicular to the length of tube segments regarding test environment the pure water current environment is dominant at present in table 2 the representative research achievements at the present stage are listed 3 1 two dimensional tube segment model tests through a two dimensional segmental test gan 2009 studied the spatial force distribution of the sft subjected to hydrostatic loads in the light of the still water environment and verified the feasibility of virtual laminated elements in the global analysis of the underwater sft utilizing the transient force impact test yang et al 2019 conducted an experimental study on the overall dynamic properties of the sft from which the natural frequency and damping of the tunnel tube were acquired concerning tests in the water current environment yoshihara and mikami 1993 studied the hydrodynamic behaviors of the tunnel tube fixed at both ends based on the two dimensional uniform current test focused on measuring the drag and lift forces and then computed the drag force and the lift coefficient for various types of models by measuring the overall force of the tube in a 2d uniform current condition nishio and incecik 1995 analyzed the correlation between force and oscillation frequency of the current field according to the experimental measurement of sumer and fredsoe 1995 for the vortex shedding phenomenon of a fixed tunnel tube at high reynolds numbers the frequency of lift oscillation was found to equal that of vortex shedding and the frequency of drag force oscillation to equal twice that of vortex shedding the tunnel tube response was experimentally studied under impact drag and lift forces by venkataramana et al 1996 wu 1955 conducted a vortex induced vibration test of the tube under current action with the emphasis on the lock in phenomenon of dynamic response a sectional model test was carried out by chao et al 2016 on the fluid structure coupling vibration of tethers under water currents which focused on the vortex induced tether vibration and compared the effectiveness and adaptability between three types of vibration suppression devices namely three helical lines three control rods and fairings through the structural segment model test considering the current field and elasticity similarity criteria qin and zhou 2009a measured the circumferential and axial strains of tube structure under two dimensional currents as well as the axial force of tension leg tethers furthermore the variation trends of tunnel tube spatial force and tether axial force with the current conditions were studied in the context of the sognefjord strait sft in norway deng et al 2020 conducted a two dimensional vertical self excited oscillation test based on which they studied the viv problem with the parallel twin tube tunnel fig 7 and analyzed the effects of the reduced velocity and tube spacing coefficients spacing to diameter ratios of tubes on the vibration response the lift coefficient and overall torque of the tube see fig 8 the experimental studies related to the effect of waves on sfts are relatively few in comparison with tests in current environment lu et al 2009 conducted a two dimensional wave test to explore the effects of the buoyancy to weight ratio on the dynamic responses of tunnel segments through a regular wave test oh et al 2013 studied the lateral hydrodynamic properties of the single tube sft under wave action and measured the motion of the tube segment and the force of tethers on this basis oh and park 2016 studied the hydrodynamic properties of twin tubes with the background of china s qiongzhou strait channel li and jiang 2018 carried out a two dimensional irregular wave test and measured the pressure distribution of the tube section and the tensile force of tether for the circular section tunnel in similar test conditions jiang and li 2019 experimentally compared the hydrodynamic response traits of tunnel tube segments that were in three section shapes circle oval and octagon through a 2d wide flume test budiman et al 2017 studied the effects of the buoyancy to weight ratio of the sft on the sudden tension of tether under regular waves by taking the panggang karya island island crossing in indonesia as the background the foregoing experimental studies focus on the hydrodynamic features and action mechanisms of sfts which solve the qualitative understanding problem to some degree for the design and construction of such tunnels however more attention should be paid to the quantitative expression of their hydrodynamic responses in an attempt to guide practice to provide a design basis for the actual construction of sfts there has been a gradual shift towards the quantitative expression research of hydrodynamic responses for scholars from various countries based on theoretical derivation and the regular wave model test fig 9 seo et al 2015 derived the semi theoretical and semi empirical formulas for the wave load of the tunnel tube segment eq 7 the critical buoyancy for tether relaxation eq 8 and the equation of motion eq 9 7 f x f z tan φ c m ρ v h 2 ω 2 cosh k z d sinh k d sin k x ω t 8 b 0 s l o c k h 2 k e k z z d cos φ c m ρ g v 9 x t 1 2 c m ρ v h g k l m 2 t m l m ω 2 cosh k z d cosh k d

obtaining the imposed loads hydrodynamic coefficients and motion response characteristics of the two dimensional tunnel tube segment under various hydrodynamic environments and anchorage designs wave height period submerged water depth anchoring angle and buoyancy to weight ratio furthermore the empirical computational formulas for the amount of tunnel tube motion were deducted on the basis of substantial test data 10 d x d 53 5 h d 0 94 t g d 0 66 r 5 55 d s d 1 37 θ 4 00 11 d y d 15 3 h d 1 15 t g d 0 65 r 6 19 d s d 1 61 θ 1 50 12 α 16 4 h d 0 99 t g d 0 68 r 6 01 d s d 1 29 θ 0 58 where

represents the submerged depth of the tunnel tube distance of tube top from water surface r is the buoyancy to weight ratio of the tunnel tube d is the diameter of the tunnel tube the remaining parameters are defined in the same way as above the aforementioned empirical formulas can provide a theoretical reference for the actual selection of design parameters for the sft 3 2 three dimensional global hydroelastic model tests duo to the large span the mechanical responses of sfts including global and local motion deformation are extremely complex under the wave current effect in particular for complicated marine hydrodynamic environments such as multidirectional irregular waves reciprocating currents and shear currents the global motion and deformation characteristics of the tunnel should raise more concern however the aforementioned two dimensional model tests are incapable of simulating complex marine environments and the end constraints of models therefore they are unable to grasp the overall response laws of tunnel structure accurately turning it into a kind of less than ideal or compromised method it is self evident that the most ideal way to obtain the complete hydrodynamic response parameters of the sft should be the three dimensional global model test of interaction between waves currents and structure which is implemented by placing the entire tunnel including the tunnel shores the tube and tethers into a basin however tests of this sort need a large scale deep water wave basin which are exceptionally demanding on the test site equipment and model fabrication and are rather costly as well consequently few research institutes are currently involved in such tests to systematically study the global dynamic response of the long span sft under wave and current effect in 2018 the national engineering laboratory for port hydraulic construction technology of the tianjin research institute for water transport engineering m o t built a novel large scale deep water test basin fig 10 c exclusively for this research aim after independent design and r d with dimensions of length width depth being 65 0 m 37 0 m 2 5 m the basin is equipped with a high power high performance wave and current generating system which has a current generating ability of the 0 5 m s mean velocity on full section and a wave generating ability of 0 5 m wave height at a 2 m water depth thus filling the gap in the deep water high velocity current generation test site in china moreover the laboratory is provided with advanced dynamic response measuring instruments the intelligent equipment control system the dynamic test digital twin system the ultra low latency data synchronous acquisition system and the intelligent data analysis cloud system which offers excellent conditions for the hydrodynamic tests as well as massive data acquisition and analysis for large suspension structures like the sfts based on a backbone hydroelastic modeling technique a global hydrodynamic physical model test of the sft at a geometric scale of 1 50 was firstly conducted under wave current field where the hydrodynamic similarity and global elasticity similarity of structure were both considered in the national engineering laboratory for port hydraulic construction technology of the tianjin research institute for water transport engineering m o t considering that the prototype tunnel has a span of 1 2 km and the model is 25 4 m in length this experiment boasts the global model test of the sft with the longest span worldwide so far fig 10a b and d based on the experiment the three dimensional hydroelastic response characteristics of the sft are analyzed in disparate hydrodynamic conditions and the global hydroelastic response mechanisms of the long span tunnel are revealed preliminarily under waves currents and combined wave current action as to the obtained experimental data it can provide a basis for verification of most existing numerical or theoretical models for analyzing the global hydrodynamic response of sfts 4 main existing problems and future of hydrodynamic response investigation method 4 1 problems with existing mathematical model methods as mentioned above the sft is bound to produce complex structural response under hydrodynamic effect which becomes more intricate with the increasing span of tunnel and the variability of environment the external hydrodynamic force is not only the leading cause of the response but also the key to the design of the sft system despite the consideration of environment and the tunnel tether tube vehicle multi factor coupling most of the previous studies were targeted at short span waters with relatively weak hydrodynamic conditions resulting in the shortage of concern in effects of more extreme and complex hydrodynamics in particular the existing numerical simulation methods or theoretical models mostly adopt theoretical regular waves and constant uniform currents in the selection of environmental conditions moreover the directions of waves and currents are assumed to be perpendicular to the tunnel axis without considering the directionality randomness or nonlinearity of waves as well as the distribution of wave and current along the tunnel axis in reality waves and currents in the sea areas are featured with extreme complexity due to the influences of near shore submarine topography coastline and tidal fluctuation which are characterized by spatial non uniformity irregularity multi directionality strong nonlinearity etc affected by such difference the mathematical models will differ immensely from the actual force and motion states additionally the existing mathematical models make excessive idealized assumptions about the tunnel tube and tethers such as the simplification of the tube into a beam without considering the structural internal forces of the tunnel tube wall internal roadbed as well as beams and columns or the simplification of tethers into massless springs or rods taking no account of the influences of their mass and rigidity the primary mathematical method remains the two steps procedure of calculating the external hydrodynamic load followed by the computation of structural response namely the one way coupling from the environmental load to the structural response all of these will bring about deviations in the simulating results 4 2 problems with existing physical modeling methods owing to a large span and a complicated internal structure the sfts undergo not only the global motion deformation but also the local deformation within the structure by the action of external hydrodynamic forces limited by the test site conditions all sectional model tests are carried out on a certain segment with a two dimensional flume for the existing model test studies lacking systematic three dimensional global model tests there present several problems a non uniformity and directionality of the wave and current field spatial distributions are over looked b neither the restraining action of adjacent structural segments concerning the tunnel nor the end restraints or the actual rigidity can be simulated on account of the flume width limitation c since the tunnel structure is deemed as a rigid body the elastic deformation of structure itself can hardly be taken into accurate consideration even for the backbone hydroelastic test research conducted by the authors of this paper preliminarily it is unable to obtain the force distribution state inside the tunnel structure fully in reality the sft is embedded in the rock at both ends with the restraint at the middle part being rather small which also diminishes as the length increases generally the existing model tests make the two ends fixed or completely free generating the either extremely great or small integral rigidity which is apparently inconsistent with the actual situation as a result they can hardly reflect the real underwater dynamics and force state of the sft structure preciously thereby reducing the effectiveness and practicality of research findings greatly 4 3 problems with using mathematical model or physical modeling method alone apart from the above problems the utilization of mathematical model or physical modeling alone has its respective intrinsic shortcomings existing mathematical model methods for sfts mostly adopt the theoretical waves and currents for describing their effects on structure as to the advantages of this type of method it is not affected by scale effect not limited by the site and experimental equipment and easy to modify which is suitable for the global response computation of structure in general nevertheless substantial simplifying assumptions generally adopted in mathematical models which leads to the failure of consideration to the propagation simulation of large scale complex waves and the precise computation of global and local motion deformation parameters of complex structures simultaneously this is particularly true when dealing with problems like wave breaking water impact and their strong nonlinear interaction with structures comparatively speaking the physical modeling can get access to real physical phenomena more easily which is appropriate for the investigation of complex nonlinear problems however the greatest drawback of such methods lies in the consideration of a limited area due to the limitation by the scope of experimental site equipment performance scale etc inflexibility for conversion and modification enormous expense and large consumption of time and labor large in scale sfts can cross dozens or even hundreds of kilometers of waters along the route the hydrodynamic environmental conditions vary greatly in space and the hydrodynamic responses are complex prior to designing it is of necessity to derive technical parameters of global structure including the motion and force and to clarify the detail and local deformation parameters taking a sft with a 30 km span as an example if only the physical modeling test is adopted where the appropriate minimum geometric scale is assumed to be 1 80 then the dimensions of water tank must be above 380 m 380 m to arrange the entire tunnel model into it obviously this is beyond the size range of existing test tanks in the world so far meanwhile in the case that the mathematical model is exclusively employed in view of the huge computational domain and structural scale considering the propagation simulation of large scale complex waves while simultaneously considering the precise computation of local motion deformation parameters of complex structures with existing technology cannot be realized apparently similar problems have also appeared in the research of the mooring system for the deep water offshore platform which is a common challenge encountered by the international marine engineering community at present 4 4 future of hydrodynamic response investigation method as the products of super long span large scale and deep water development of bridge and tunnel traffic engineering sfts will inevitably encounter marine environments more complex than the conventional bridge the tunnel and marine engineering as well as more complicated hydrodynamic response problems to sum up scholars worldwide have developed a range of simulation measures and methods targeting this problem and have yielded substantial major outcomes however on the whole certain technical defects remain existent in the existing mathematical model or physical modeling methods with the enhancement of computer performance algorithms simulation technologies and experimental conditions research methods will continue to be innovated reviewing the previous works and looking into the future the following several trends are present in the hydrodynamic response research of sfts the in depth research of which should be carried out correspondingly 1 more efficient and accurate mathematical model with the continuous upgrading of computer performance and algorithms an important trend is that the full time domain computational fluid mechanics cfd simulation of large scale 3d fluid structure interaction has become increasingly feasible to remove most of the numerical simplified assumptions hence the current two step computation mode of external hydrodynamic load followed by the structural response used in the past will develop towards the mode of direct 3d fluid structure interaction simulation for complex sft systems for example the total factor coupling between the hydrodynamic environment three dimensional sft tube tether vehicle and seabed foundation allows the interaction between the complex multidirectional waves complex currents and structural system responses to be considered another development direction is to seek coupling of different numerical or theoretical models for example multi face coupling of the wave potential theory for external wave propagation the computational fluid mechanics for computation of local wave current field and the elastic shell theory for computation of structural inner force etc 2 more complete physical modeling with the improved experimental conditions and the development of various modeling technologies direct three dimensional global hydroelastic model tests of sfts should become the mainstream hence the two dimensional flume section model test used in the past is supposed to develop towards the three dimensional multi segment global hydroelastic model test of large scale deep water wind current basins respecting the experimental conditions the development direction is from the single load tests such as still water pure current regular wave or irregular wave to the multidirectional nonlinear irregular wave or the wave current coupling 3 integration of mathematical model and physical modeling considering the key edge of sfts to address the problem of deep water strait crossing in the future they will surely extend to ultra long spans of tens of or even hundreds of kilometers for the ultra long span submerged floating structures there is yet no test basin in the world that can accommodate them for model testing besides mathematical model also has inevitable technical defects hence an integration of mathematical model and physical modeling is a vital solution to the investigation of hydrodynamic responses for sfts since the respective advantages of the two methods are exploited and their shortcomings are averted 4 consideration of multi disastrous factor and multi scale hydrodynamic problems the research on the mechanical mechanism and safety measures of sfts under the coupling of extreme multi disastrous loads e g marine seismic explosions tsunami internal wave fire disaster foundation damage leakage sudden cable breakage etc and hydrodynamic environments as well as multi scale dynamic numerical simulation and experiment under various special loads and disasters is the key to verify the theoretical models and to solve the technical challenges in engineering application 5 conclusion in this study the hydrodynamic response investigation methods of sft are analyzed in detail to prepare an up to date technical review from the mathematical model and the physical modeling aspects the following main conclusions are drawn from this study there are two major methods for determining the hydrodynamic load of sft tubes including morison equation and diffraction theory for normal construction conditions both morison equation and diffraction theory are found to yield accurate hydrodynamic calculations kunisu 2010 detailed analysis of the literature shows that the four factor coupling model of wave tube vehicle tether lin et al 2018 and the time domain hydroelastic model for wave tube tether vehicle interaction jin and kim 2020 are currently comparatively complete numerical models for the tether tube vehicle coupled analysis in hydrodynamic environments for the physical modeling investigations an obvious alternative to obtain the complete hydrodynamic response parameters of the sft is a direct three dimensional global model test including the tunnel shores the tube and tethers which is perhaps less common but on the increase the literature review also clearly show that the existing mathematical models use a lot of simplified assumptions which are efficient in relatively simple condition but less flexible in treating the actual complicated hydrodynamic environment and that the present physical model tests have difficult in properly simulating the end constraints actual stiffness and structural elastic deformation of the sft model therefore it is predicted that the full time domain fluid structure coupling mathematical model with complicated hydrodynamic environment the 3d full hydroelastic model test in large deep water basin and the integration of mathematical and physical models are the main attractive directions for the hydrodynamic response investigation of sft in future additionally the ultimate goal of hydrodynamic response research for sfts is to efficaciously control the motion and force of the structural system in line with the attained response value rather than targeting merely the problem itself so as to achieve safety and stability as countries around the world have put forward plans for the construction of sfts successively future research will be oriented more towards the actual projects for this reason the effective control of tunnel hydrodynamic response will become the focus of technological research and development in a gradual manner

20931,vulnerability is a crucial facet of a naval ship s operational capability in a hostile environment naval combatants are among the most complex and densely packed distributed systems created today these shipboard distributed systems are defined by their layout and componentry vulnerability assessments of these systems are therefore derived from failures of the integrated componentry layout due to hostile weapon impacts in late stage design programs these vulnerability assessments are accomplished via detailed modeling and computationally expensive simulation during early stage design this level of detailed modeling is unavailable but integrated system failure analysis remains essential for thorough vulnerability assessment the authors resolve this issue by utilizing an adaptable network based approach to reduce the design fidelity needed for modeling and simulation the approach allows for the development of a novel vulnerability assessment method for early stage design the approach is demonstrated through a representative naval case study keywords network theory vulnerability ship design early stage design naval engineering survivability 1 introduction vulnerability is a naval ship s hit tolerance or hardness the ability to withstand the impact of a hostile weapon ball 2003 goodfriend 2015 lower vulnerability for naval ships means increased mission efficacy capability and crew safety vulnerability assessments analyze the architectural weaknesses in a ship s design due to a hostile weapon impact these assessments are part of the greater survivability analysis consisting of susceptibility vulnerability and recoverability identifying critical weaknesses in a design provides indispensable information to design program decision makers and operators in many engineering disciplines the first products off the assembly line can be destructively tested for vulnerabilities but large capital naval programs do not have this luxury as the first product ship must perform instead naval vulnerability assessments turn to physics based models and knowledge of weapon envelopes the volumetric area of a weapon s blast and damage radius through probabilistic modeling and simulation of weapon impacts an assessment can be conducted ball 2003 1 1 challenges of current vulnerability assessments vulnerability studies are historically executed late in the naval design process after the major design characteristics have been determined since they require extensive modeling and probabilistic simulation jansen et al 2019 provide a discussion of high fidelity vulnerability assessment tools for late stage design and highlight the need for early stage design stage tools these computationally expensive simulations provide excellent results but require a detailed knowledge of the ship design this need for detailed design severely limits traditional vulnerability assessments ability to explore the unsolidified early stage design space they are similarly challenged in comparing multiple design variants due to the amount of modeling and computational expense traditional vulnerability studies provide valuable information but often so late in the design stage that architectural fixes are inefficient and extremely expensive molland 2008 the exponential relationship between stages in a design program and the cost to alter the design is illustrated in fig 1 mckenny 2013 ideally vulnerability should be integrated into early stage design in order to produce more effective naval ships as navy postgraduate professor robert e ball states in his textbook on survivability analysis and design vulnerability reduction is most effectively accomplished early in the design when component sizes locations materials construction and redundancies are being studied and selected ball 2003 late stage vulnerability reductions are not only inefficient but also extremely costly when changing ship architecture this expense relationship results in decision makers having to weigh program budget concerns against detrimental vulnerability shortcomings in order to minimize these vulnerability pitfalls decision makers need to be informed of the vulnerability implications of their design decisions as early as possible in the design program the earlier vulnerability issues are identified in a ship program the easier it is to deliver a more economical less vulnerable ship as a design program progresses its increasing cost pressure incentivizes decision makers to prefer insufficient add on vulnerability reduction features as opposed to architectural changes that fix vulnerable design issues while sometimes unavoidable these add on vulnerability reduction features often increase weight and cost e g ballistic panels to shield vulnerable components and are not as effective as eliminating the vulnerability issue completely e g relocation of vulnerable components a method of conducting an efficient vulnerability assessment during early stage design is needed to properly address the vulnerability implications of architectural decisions 1 2 objectives effective early stage vulnerability reduction requires an early stage vulnerability assessment the research presented in this paper provides a novel vulnerability assessment method for ship design managers by analyzing the architectural systems they are considering in the early stage design space the following three objectives for such a vulnerability assessment have been identified as necessary to effectively integrate into the early stage design phase and to provide meaningful information to naval decision makers 1 identify leading indicators for vulnerability issues arising from implications of architectural decisions the physical system logical system and combined integrated system architectures should be evaluated 2 compare the vulnerabilities of competing design variants in the early stage design space 3 adapt and assess rapid design modifications inherent in proper exploration of the early stage design space all three of these objectives are required to better inform decision makers earlier in the ship design program and form the motivation for this research network theory will be used to create a framework for this vulnerability assessment of the design space in order to meet the three objectives network theory provides a flexible approach that is adaptable to the information gradient of the knowledge space without the need for a traditional vulnerability assessment s detailed modeling and simulation it additionally allows for quick re routing substitution and elimination of components and their connections in naval design rigterink 2014 goodrum et al 2018 a novel four layer network framework for vulnerability assessments is created and demonstrated in this paper the framework allows for identification of leading indicators for vulnerability issues early in the design process this allows for proactive low vulnerability design influence instead of reactive vulnerability reduction techniques on a near complete ship design a case study utilizing the four layer network framework is presented on the integration of a cargo elevator system for a representative t ake class ship arrangement 1 3 not a replacement for traditional methods the need for a vulnerability assessment method that can efficiently assess designs during conceptual design has been previously identified and several approaches proposed in recent years these approaches have included but are not limited to genetic optimization parsons 2019 goodfriend and brown 2017 markov chains jansen 2019 and network science relationship frameworks goodrum et al 2018 shields 2017a b focus on naval distributed system design and assessment has further been explored over the past decade with the rise in demand on ship power systems doerry 2007 chalfant 2015 brefort et al 2018 the work presented here builds on the network science approach by providing a novel framework to assess the interdependencies of the logical architecture of a ship with that of the physical system within the realm of vulnerability the network framework and case study implementation strategy presented are not meant to replace the later stage vulnerability assessments based on computer models of detailed design a discussion of these more traditional vulnerability assessment models and tools can be found in stevens 2016 where it is noted that all these methods are designed to be used later in the design process than conceptual design those intensive vulnerability assessments provide important insights that are not attempted to be replaced by a network implementation instead this research is meant to help bridge the gap between early stage naval design and vulnerability analysis in order to better inform decision makers and procure more effective more dependable naval ships 2 vulnerability programs and implementation the vulnerability of a ship is directly derived from the architectural layout of its vital components piperakis 2013 the ship s componentry and architectural layout make up the ship s distributed service systems brefort et al 2018 as described by goodrum et al 2018 the overall architecture of distributed ship service systems can be discussed in terms of physical architecture logical architecture and operational architecture 1 1 this description reflects the findings of an ongoing research program on the design of naval distributed systems research collaborators include students researchers and faculty at the university of michigan virginia polytechnic institute and state university the university college london and delft university of technology this program is supported by u s office of naval research grant no n00014 15 1 2752 the physical architecture is the spatial relationship in the general arrangements of the ship the logical architecture is the relationship between vital components that generates system functionality the operational architecture is the use of distributed systems over time vulnerability focuses on the physical and logical systems this research will therefore also focus on the interconnectivity of the physical and logical systems in order to account for both systems architecture a vulnerability program should therefore accomplish three tasks ball 2003 1 identify the vital components and their kill modes 2 assess the vulnerability 3 reduce the vulnerability of the ship through feedback to the designers a reactive vulnerability program will analyze a ship design when it is close to completion and then recommend vulnerability reduction features a proactive vulnerability program will analyze a ship design early and continuously throughout the design program the proactive program cycles feedback from leading indicators that the vulnerability assessment provides back to the architectural designers of the ship s distributed systems the designers can then make informed revisions regarding the vulnerability implications of their architectural layouts and logic traditional vulnerability programs are heavily reactive due to their assessments requiring large amounts of precise information for complex modeling and simulations 2 1 identification of vital components and kill modes vital components are the critical parts required for a system to properly function kill modes are the ways in which the system fails due to damage or failure of one or more vital components in the system ball 2003 in order to conduct the vulnerability assessment it is imperative to know what types of componentry damage will result in a kill mode naval ship kill modes are either related to a mission capability or a navigational capability a mission kill mode results in a ship no longer being able to accomplish a critical mission mode e g a weapon system failure a navigational kill mode results in a loss of steering or propulsion these two types of kill modes are not exclusive as most navigational kill modes also result in a mission kill mode 2 2 naval vulnerability assessment probabilistic simulation of weapon effects on a computer model of the ship design results in vulnerability metrics the metric commonly used in quantifying a design s vulnerability is the probability of kill upon hit often denoted in literature as p k farris and stuckey 2000 ball 2003 this metric is typically calculated via probabilistic shotlines and evaluation of a design s kill modes smith 2010 once an assessment calculates the vulnerability metrics the results can be used to determine a down selection of competing design variants help inform the policy of operational leadership or revise the design design revisions can either alter the architecture or add a vulnerability reduction feature revision of the design allows for vulnerability reduction through iterative vulnerability assessments which is best conducted early this is illustrated in fig 2 2 3 vulnerability reduction there are two methodologies for reducing the vulnerability of naval design the first and most effective method is through an architectural change in the design of the system this option allows for re location of compartments and vital components which results in better placement and separation of redundant components unfortunately architectural changes are often not possible due to the cost of delaying and redesigning part of the ship for this reason architectural design changes should be done during early stage design when redesign is possible the second methodology for vulnerability reduction is adding a vulnerability reduction feature these methods provide smaller reductions than architectural changes but do not delay the design production an example addition is ballistic paneling ballistic paneling helps protect vital componentry within a compartment from weapon fragments but also adds significant weight to the ship design a more effective approach is to move the vulnerable componentry away from the vulnerable area through an architectural change during early stage design 2 3 vulnerability assessment implementation traditional vulnerability assessments are limited in being able to provide the vulnerability reduction options during early stage design but network based assessment reduces the design detail needed for analysis a network based vulnerability assessment can make use of an iterative approach based on leading indicators derived from analysis of the network with an example implementation strategy as seen in fig 3 this vulnerability information feedback loop allows design decision makers to make vulnerability conscious decisions earlier in the design process the metrics and constants shown in fig 3 are developed in section 3 of this paper 3 vulnerability assessment via networks networks allow for the reduction of the design detail needed to perform analysis on the architectural systems of a naval ship network theory stems from mathematical graph theory and has been widely applied to the sciences and engineering networks have more recently been applied to ship design as a tool for modeling and examining naval design spaces through information duals and shipboard distributed systems chalfant et al 2017 shields et al 2015 rigterink 2014 goodrum et al 2018 for a detailed presentation of network theory the reader is encouraged to consult the references of newman 2018 and barabási 2016 for an explicit mathematical representation of multi layer networks refer to the reference de domenico et al de domenico et al 2013 networks are made up of nodes which are the entities being modeled and edges which are the relationships between the nodes two nodes that have a relationship are then said to be linked by an edge the addition or deletion of an edge or node is instantaneous which makes networks adept at examining a changing complex design space a network containing multiple types of nodes can be broken into multi layer networks where each layer contains one type of node the level of detail modeled is up to the designer but clear rules for creating edges between nodes is essential to provide an accurate representation of the system being modeled 3 1 multilayer network approach a multilayer network was selected to allow for evaluation of both the coupled and decoupled physical and logical systems on a ship a four layer network is utilized and divided into two node layers for the physical system openings and compartments and two layers for the logical system vital components and functional links as seen in fig 4 the four layers are 1 openings layer contains nodes that represent physical openings between compartments e g doors hatches 2 compartments layer contains nodes that represent physical compartments e g bridge stairway ballast tank 3 vital components layer contains nodes that represent vital components of a logical system e g generator control panel pipe 4 functional links layer contains nodes that represent the functional links between vital components e g rotate transmit this four layer framework allows for separation and integration between the physical and logical architectures while nodes exist on each layer edges connect physical or logical relationships between nodes an example of mapping the physical and logical systems relationships is depicted in fig 5 the framework s integrated yet separated organization allows for assessments to be executed on an individual system as well as on integrated systems the integration of the physical and logical systems creates the physical system solution goodrum et al 2018 an important flexible advantage of modeling a ship with this four layer network framework is that even with vastly different physical architecture between multiple variants there are common reusable nodes for modeling for example only one node needs to be created for a ship s galley even if the competing design variants are a monohull and trimaran this galley node can be reused time and time again throughout the design program and only have its edges changed for analysis the efficient reuse of nodes is also true for a logical system s vital components as often only the relationship changes between design variants not their entire componentry this level of modeling adaptability is unattainable in a cad model where new models must be built for each variant 3 2 modeling damage failure in the network in order to evaluate the architectural implications due to damage cases nodes are removed nodes can be removed one at a time or in groups to simulate different types of damage or failure each layer s type of node results in the removal of a subset of the nodes and edges in the four layer network like in classical network theory when a node is removed from a network all edges associated with that node are also removed this allows for quick simulation of damage to the ship design without the need for probabilistic shotlines and intensive computer modeling simulations let the following sets of nodes be defined as o the openings c the compartments v the vital components and f the functional links let ψ0 represent the original set without removed nodes as shown in 1 and ψ be the new set of nodes post damage 1 ψ 0 o c v f let the subscript d denote the set of damaged nodes of the type that the subscript is acting on e g cd set of compartment nodes damaged the removal logic thus follows the following four rules using set notation 1 failure of an opening remove opening node from network as seen in 2 2 ψ ψ 0 c d 2 failure of a compartment remove compartment and remove vital components within compartment from network as seen in 3 3 ψ ψ 0 c d v d 3 failure of a vital component remove vital component and remove its functional links from network as seen in 4 4 ψ ψ 0 v d f d 4 failure of a functional link remove functional link from network as in 5 5 ψ ψ 0 f d 3 3 network projections and information duals networks that have two types of nodes like the physical and logical systems in fig 5 are called bipartite networks these two types of nodes can be split into two layers and then projected upon each other the network projection upon a layer replaces the inter layer edges and nodes of the projection layer with edges on the projected upon layer this results in a single layer representation with intra layer edges and only one node type the simpler projected layers are useful for efficient calculation and representation of a more complicated system shields et al 2015 these network projections are examples of information duals or network duals a depiction of two network projections and information duals is shown in the right side of fig 5 information duals are beneficial to complex distributed system analysis as they represent the recipients and transmitters of signals in the system without modeling the complex steps involved to send the signal rosvall 2005 information duals have proved useful in naval architecture by discovering interdependencies between distinct shipboard systems shields et al 2015 3 4 vulnerability leading indicator network based metrics a focus on leading indicators is an essential characteristic of an effective engineering product development metric reinertsen 1997 three network theory derived vulnerability metrics based on leading indicators are presented the metrics are intended to aid designers in understanding the vulnerability implications of architectural decisions at the physical system logical system and integrated physical system solution levels the three metrics of interdependency connectivity and adaptability provide leading indicators of vulnerable areas in the architectural design of the systems the metrics assess the importance of a node s role in the overall function of that network the higher the importance of a node the higher the risk as the system is too reliant on that single node for operations the leading indicator metrics therefore allow designers to address vulnerability issues in early design revisions in order to create a more capable ship for the customer 3 4 1 interdependency β interdependency quantifies a network s reliance on certain nodes interdependency is based on a measure of the network s betweenness centrality the average betweenness centrality of a node βi informs the number of the shortest paths between all node pairs that travel through that node as in 6 and 7 newman 2018 let gst be the total number of shortest paths from source to target nodes 6 β i s t x s t i g s t w h e r e i s t i n d i v i d u a l n o d e s o u r c e n o d e t a r g e t n o d e 7 x s t i 1 0 n o d e i o n s h o r t e s t p a t h b e t w e e n s a n d t o t h e r w i s e this metric is zero if the node is not on any shortest paths and proportional to the average rate at which traffic passes through a node newman 2018 interdependency provides a useful leading indicator by identifying nodes that are crucial to the successful operation of a network nodes with high interdependency act as a conduit for physical or logical traffic through the network for example in a physical system a stairway or elevator compartment is a high traffic area through a ship s decks and levels 3 4 2 connectivity κ connectivity identifies the nodes in the network that have a high number of edges this is based on a node s degree centrality which is the number of neighboring nodes a node is attached to newman 2018 the degree of a node and thus its connectivity score is shown in 8 and 9 8 κ i j 1 n a i j w h e r e i n a i j n o d e b e i n g i n s p e c t e d a l l n o d e s i n n e t w o r k n o d e a d j a c e n c y m a t r i x 9 a i j 1 0 e d g e e x i s t s b e t w e e n i a n d j o t h e r w i s e this metric is bounded between a minimum of zero where the node is not connected to another node and n where the node is connected to all other nodes in the network a high degree is related to a greater importance in the network s function because it identifies nodes with hub like properties in the network these network hubs like a ship power panel are potential leading indicators of vulnerable componentry that need to be preserved to maintain a ship s capability 3 4 3 adaptability α adaptability is the system s flexibility in changing routings between two nodes this is a direct measure of redundancy because it evaluates how many nodes are required to make a certain system or task fail a water pump that can be routed to two generators requires both to fail instead of only being connected to one hence a greater number of nodes must be removed from the network this behavior is captured in the network by the max flow min cut theorem which states that the number of independent paths the number of nodes to remove connection between two nodes the minimum cut set and the maximum flow between two nodes are all equal newman 2018 the average adaptability of a node can therefore be defined as seen in 10 and 11 10 α i j 1 n x j n w h e r e i n i n d i v i d u a l n o d e a l l n o d e s i n n e t w o r k 11 x j 1 0 n o d e j i n m i n i m u m c u t s e t o t h e r w i s e this metric is bounded by a minimum of zero where the node does not exist in any minimum cut set and a maximum of one which is that all shortest paths in the system run through the node a high adaptability means high redundancy for that task but a low adaptability can highlight areas and systems that need further vulnerability reduction in subsequent design revisions 3 5 vulnerability assessment robustness metric a robustness metric has been developed for operational evaluation of a ship design s ability to withstand a hostile weapon impact robustness tests a network s redundancy and separation in case of componentry failure it examines how much of the network is still operational after damage damage is simulated by the removal of nodes and edges from the network kill modes can then be analyzed and evaluated for operability see section 2 on kill modes the design s robustness ρ can thus be calculated as shown in 12 several competing design variants denoted by the subscript v can be compared through this metric to help inform decision makers 12 ρ v w i n δ n i μ n i n δ n i w h e r e v d e s i g n v a r i a n t w w e a p o n t h r e a t i w e a p o n i m p a c t r u n n u m b e r δ d e s i r e a b i l i t y c o e f f i c i e n t n n u m b e r o f e v a l u a t e d m i s s i o n s μ m i s s i o n t a s k the desirability constant δ allows for consideration of the necessity versus desirability of a given mission or capability the desirability constant can be adapted throughout the ship s design from being used to address the separate capabilities the customer wishes the conceptual ship to have in combat to more refined performance parameters later in detail design an example desirability constant table is shown in table 1 a possible assessment method when implementing the desirability constant for evaluation is to implement a baseline rule for example the failure of three or more compartments below the waterline can disable hydrostatic stability similarly one node and two node removal can prove useful in examining the result of individual or dual componentry failure while a removal of a large segment can provide information on the network s capability to handle a large weapon impact the given weapon w determines the weapon envelope due to its charge size and generalized blast damage equations the weapon envelope in turn determines the number of nodes removed from the network for simulating damage the robustness metric gives the vulnerability assessment director flexibility in choosing to run an assessment based on specific weapon envelopes and or to evaluate the entire system at an individual componentry level an example flowchart fig 3 of section 2 of this paper shows how the network framework and vulnerability assessment can be integrated into the ship design program to provide leading indicators and design variant comparisons for decision makers 4 representative case study in this case study an assessment was conducted on a representative naval ship design and its cargo elevator system as shown in figs 6 and 7 the representative ship design and physical system takes influence from the military sealift command s t ake dry cargo ammunition ship class the logical architecture examined six of the naval cargo elevators like that on the t ake class ship nassco the functionality of the cargo elevators is imperative for the ship s primary mission as a supply and replenishment vessel united states navy fact file online cargo elevator systems provide a useful case study as they exemplify the characteristics of many important shipboard systems complex shipboard systems require routing through many compartments and have supply and demand needs in the same manner as cargo elevators the products these shipboard systems deliver are their main difference e g cargo electricity chill water etc naval cargo elevators have proven a mission essential system in not only cargo vessels but also aircraft carriers most recently the uss gerald r ford has made the news after encountering extensive delays due to issues with the installation of its munitions elevators capaccio 2019 4 1 construction of the ship design s four layer network first a model set of general arrangements was created and then converted into the physical system network in the manner shown in fig 5 then the logical system architecture of the cargo elevators was mapped based on the naval ship s technical manual ch 772 on cargo and weapon elevators naval sea systems 1998 six cargo elevators were placed into the logical system architecture with their functions and links mapped as shown in the right side of fig 6 with an illustrative depiction of the general system on the ship in fig 7 redundancy is built into the logical system as pairs of cargo elevators serve one cargo hold on each deck pairs of cargo elevators were linked to a single cargo hold space on each below main deck level of the ship the cargo elevator logical system architecture was then integrated with the physical system architecture by placing edges between vital components and the compartments they reside within this results in the completed four layer network as shown in the center of fig 6 4 2 case study vulnerability leading indicators the physical system logical system and the integrated four layer network were assessed using the leading indicator metrics described in section 3 the networks used are shown in fig 6 and show how a lower fidelity early stage design can be assessed using the integrated four layer framework for an unbiased accurate framework the integrated four layer network analysis used only the compartments and openings that affect the cargo elevator logical system this ensures that unrelated physical architecture does not skew the results of the three metrics for example the measure of how many independent paths run between the bridge and the engine room is not relevant to the cargo elevator system being analyzed all the physical system elements can be incorporated if all shipboard systems were to be analyzed fig 8 shows the pairwise comparison graphs of the three network leading indicators on each network analyzed the diagonal plots within fig 8 represent the kernel density plots these plots show that most nodes score low near zero for each metric and only a small subset of nodes are shown to score high this small subset of high scoring individuals are the nodes that the rest of the system depends on and therefore the most important for vulnerability protection this behavior is indicative of a power law distribution or pareto distribution newman 2018 barabási 2016 4 2 1 physical system observations the physical system was seen to demonstrate the connectivity and interdependency of its hallways and stairwell compartments the top right score on the pairwise comparison of these two metrics in fig 8 for the physical system was the superstructure s hallways this result correctly illustrates expectations as halls and stairs are the main source of personnel movement throughout the ship s spatial layout low adaptability of low deck spaces and single passage doorways was also found to be consistent to expectations for example the lower deck ballast tanks make up part of the group of the adaptable physical system nodes scoring around zero throughout fig 8 the scores of the cargo elevator compartments within the physical system were unremarkable as they fell below the middle of the results this shows that without the context of the logical system the cargo elevators do not appear as important as they are to operations 4 2 2 logical system observations the importance of the cargo elevator platforms is seen in the logical system indicators the platforms are clustered together in the top right of fig 8 pairwise comparison plots for connectivity and interdependency the electrical connections and control panels scored the highest in low adaptability the leading indicators are therefore showcasing their intended characteristics as the electrical componentry and control panels have no redundancy in this case study 4 2 3 integrated 4 layer network observations the integrated network s leading indicators highlight vulnerable areas not seen by examining the physical or logical system cargo elevators elevator platforms machinery rooms and electrical sources scored high in at least one of the three indicators control panels mechanical linkages and electrical linkages were seen to have high adaptability scores as part of the highest adaptability scoring group in fig 8 the main deck cargo hold emerged as the dominant high scoring outlier and the maximum score in connectivity and interdependency it is plotted in fig 8 as the peak value for both these metrics this result is previously unseen by the physical or logical network model where the cargo hold s score was unremarkable in the pairwise comparisons 4 2 4 outlying top scores the highest scoring nodes in fig 8 for the integrated network based on the three leading indicators are shown in table 2 these identified nodes are crucial to the successful operation of the integrated network and thus need vulnerability reduction and protection design decision makers can now be informed of these vulnerable areas for improvement via revisions based on the vulnerability reduction techniques discussed in section 2 an assessment of the hardness of the design in response to a weapon threat can further highlight vulnerable areas within the environment of a hostile weapon impact this is demonstrated through a calculation of the case study design s robustness which is the other result of the network based vulnerability assessment as shown previously in fig 3 4 2 calculating robustness a set of representative missions was developed to demonstrate the robustness metric and the network based vulnerability assessment program illustrated back in fig 3 the six cargo elevators ability to move cargo from holds to on deck for transference were analyzed three missions one for each pair of cargo elevators were created all three missions were given a high importance and a high desirability constant from table 1 table 3 shows the missions and desirability constants used in the case study each mission s kill mode was defined as a failure of being able to move cargo from below decks to main deck if any pair of cargo elevators were unable to provide operational capability their respective mission is killed combining the missions and a weapon threat analysis allows for calculation of the robustness of the ship design air explosion threats airex are a common hostile threat to naval ships that need to be addressed in a vulnerability assessment smith 2010 to simulate an airex weapon a simulation was run on the network where every exterior compartment above the waterline between 2nd deck and 02 level was considered the point of impact for each exterior touching compartment in this ranges runs were conducted to simulate the damage in each run the impact compartment was removed from the integrated network the impact compartment s neighboring compartment nodes and their neighbors through openings were also removed to represent severe damage spreading this could be due to fire fragmentation or blast from the impact the integrated network was then modified in accordance with the rules stated in section 2 the integrated network was then analyzed for its ability to carry out its critical missions under this weapon threat selection only three impacts resulted in a cargo elevator failure this is shown in fig 9 the impacts of the machinery rooms of elevator 1 and elevator 2 both resulted in failure of those elevator platforms the network model correctly captured this damage case failure of the platforms is to be expected if the cargo elevator loses its mechanical and or electrical system since these two machinery rooms were directly exposed on the topside of the ship to the impact they are more vulnerable however since each pair of elevators is redundant and only one fails in these cases then the three missions defined in this case study are satisfied this highlights the network framework s ability to model redundancy the only compartment weapon impact in this scenario that resulted in a mission failure was to the cargo hold on the main deck this cargo hold on the main deck is serviced by elevators 3 4 5 6 which are the four that failed in this damage case this results in two out of three mission kills a high robustness score ρv airex 0 996 for this given threat and specific three missions can then be calculated for this design as shown in 12 this analysis represents one of many threats that could be examined the robustness can then be compared to another variant s performance under the same weapon threat to inform designers the logical system and the physical system individually did not show this main deck cargo hold to be vulnerable but the integrated four layer cargo elevator network directly pointed to this compartment as being the most vulnerable node in the network the main deck cargo hold is shown as ranking the highest in two out of the three leading indicators seen in table 3 this shows the power of the vulnerability assessment network method presented in being able to uncover vulnerability issues and rapidly compare results with other variants 5 conclusion this paper has demonstrated how a network based vulnerability assessment can be implemented in early stage design to better inform decision makers the use of the novel multi layer network framework to represent a ship design for vulnerability assessments helped to extend vulnerability assessments at a lower level of design fidelity than required for traditional methods a set of vulnerability leading indicator metrics were developed and illustrated in this research through a case study of a representative naval ship the case study further examined the effectiveness of the metrics in identifying important components in a distributed naval ship design the four layer network approach was also able to uncover previously unforeseen vulnerability issues by integrating a ship s logical and physical system for vulnerability analysis the research enables decision makers to understand the vulnerability implications of their design choices earlier in the design program thereby empowering the designers to deliver safer more effective ships to the operators on the front line the framework developed provides utility in the design space but does not extend to the operations domain future work on this research could examine dynamic time stepping for expansion into operation based analysis it could also integrate probabilistic failures for recoverability analysis or component lifespan investigation the addition of dynamics to the network could prove useful in identifying other types of weaknesses in a design that can further inform naval decision makers credit authorship contribution statement luke c brownlow writing original draft writing review editing

20931,vulnerability is a crucial facet of a naval ship s operational capability in a hostile environment naval combatants are among the most complex and densely packed distributed systems created today these shipboard distributed systems are defined by their layout and componentry vulnerability assessments of these systems are therefore derived from failures of the integrated componentry layout due to hostile weapon impacts in late stage design programs these vulnerability assessments are accomplished via detailed modeling and computationally expensive simulation during early stage design this level of detailed modeling is unavailable but integrated system failure analysis remains essential for thorough vulnerability assessment the authors resolve this issue by utilizing an adaptable network based approach to reduce the design fidelity needed for modeling and simulation the approach allows for the development of a novel vulnerability assessment method for early stage design the approach is demonstrated through a representative naval case study keywords network theory vulnerability ship design early stage design naval engineering survivability 1 introduction vulnerability is a naval ship s hit tolerance or hardness the ability to withstand the impact of a hostile weapon ball 2003 goodfriend 2015 lower vulnerability for naval ships means increased mission efficacy capability and crew safety vulnerability assessments analyze the architectural weaknesses in a ship s design due to a hostile weapon impact these assessments are part of the greater survivability analysis consisting of susceptibility vulnerability and recoverability identifying critical weaknesses in a design provides indispensable information to design program decision makers and operators in many engineering disciplines the first products off the assembly line can be destructively tested for vulnerabilities but large capital naval programs do not have this luxury as the first product ship must perform instead naval vulnerability assessments turn to physics based models and knowledge of weapon envelopes the volumetric area of a weapon s blast and damage radius through probabilistic modeling and simulation of weapon impacts an assessment can be conducted ball 2003 1 1 challenges of current vulnerability assessments vulnerability studies are historically executed late in the naval design process after the major design characteristics have been determined since they require extensive modeling and probabilistic simulation jansen et al 2019 provide a discussion of high fidelity vulnerability assessment tools for late stage design and highlight the need for early stage design stage tools these computationally expensive simulations provide excellent results but require a detailed knowledge of the ship design this need for detailed design severely limits traditional vulnerability assessments ability to explore the unsolidified early stage design space they are similarly challenged in comparing multiple design variants due to the amount of modeling and computational expense traditional vulnerability studies provide valuable information but often so late in the design stage that architectural fixes are inefficient and extremely expensive molland 2008 the exponential relationship between stages in a design program and the cost to alter the design is illustrated in fig 1 mckenny 2013 ideally vulnerability should be integrated into early stage design in order to produce more effective naval ships as navy postgraduate professor robert e ball states in his textbook on survivability analysis and design vulnerability reduction is most effectively accomplished early in the design when component sizes locations materials construction and redundancies are being studied and selected ball 2003 late stage vulnerability reductions are not only inefficient but also extremely costly when changing ship architecture this expense relationship results in decision makers having to weigh program budget concerns against detrimental vulnerability shortcomings in order to minimize these vulnerability pitfalls decision makers need to be informed of the vulnerability implications of their design decisions as early as possible in the design program the earlier vulnerability issues are identified in a ship program the easier it is to deliver a more economical less vulnerable ship as a design program progresses its increasing cost pressure incentivizes decision makers to prefer insufficient add on vulnerability reduction features as opposed to architectural changes that fix vulnerable design issues while sometimes unavoidable these add on vulnerability reduction features often increase weight and cost e g ballistic panels to shield vulnerable components and are not as effective as eliminating the vulnerability issue completely e g relocation of vulnerable components a method of conducting an efficient vulnerability assessment during early stage design is needed to properly address the vulnerability implications of architectural decisions 1 2 objectives effective early stage vulnerability reduction requires an early stage vulnerability assessment the research presented in this paper provides a novel vulnerability assessment method for ship design managers by analyzing the architectural systems they are considering in the early stage design space the following three objectives for such a vulnerability assessment have been identified as necessary to effectively integrate into the early stage design phase and to provide meaningful information to naval decision makers 1 identify leading indicators for vulnerability issues arising from implications of architectural decisions the physical system logical system and combined integrated system architectures should be evaluated 2 compare the vulnerabilities of competing design variants in the early stage design space 3 adapt and assess rapid design modifications inherent in proper exploration of the early stage design space all three of these objectives are required to better inform decision makers earlier in the ship design program and form the motivation for this research network theory will be used to create a framework for this vulnerability assessment of the design space in order to meet the three objectives network theory provides a flexible approach that is adaptable to the information gradient of the knowledge space without the need for a traditional vulnerability assessment s detailed modeling and simulation it additionally allows for quick re routing substitution and elimination of components and their connections in naval design rigterink 2014 goodrum et al 2018 a novel four layer network framework for vulnerability assessments is created and demonstrated in this paper the framework allows for identification of leading indicators for vulnerability issues early in the design process this allows for proactive low vulnerability design influence instead of reactive vulnerability reduction techniques on a near complete ship design a case study utilizing the four layer network framework is presented on the integration of a cargo elevator system for a representative t ake class ship arrangement 1 3 not a replacement for traditional methods the need for a vulnerability assessment method that can efficiently assess designs during conceptual design has been previously identified and several approaches proposed in recent years these approaches have included but are not limited to genetic optimization parsons 2019 goodfriend and brown 2017 markov chains jansen 2019 and network science relationship frameworks goodrum et al 2018 shields 2017a b focus on naval distributed system design and assessment has further been explored over the past decade with the rise in demand on ship power systems doerry 2007 chalfant 2015 brefort et al 2018 the work presented here builds on the network science approach by providing a novel framework to assess the interdependencies of the logical architecture of a ship with that of the physical system within the realm of vulnerability the network framework and case study implementation strategy presented are not meant to replace the later stage vulnerability assessments based on computer models of detailed design a discussion of these more traditional vulnerability assessment models and tools can be found in stevens 2016 where it is noted that all these methods are designed to be used later in the design process than conceptual design those intensive vulnerability assessments provide important insights that are not attempted to be replaced by a network implementation instead this research is meant to help bridge the gap between early stage naval design and vulnerability analysis in order to better inform decision makers and procure more effective more dependable naval ships 2 vulnerability programs and implementation the vulnerability of a ship is directly derived from the architectural layout of its vital components piperakis 2013 the ship s componentry and architectural layout make up the ship s distributed service systems brefort et al 2018 as described by goodrum et al 2018 the overall architecture of distributed ship service systems can be discussed in terms of physical architecture logical architecture and operational architecture 1 1 this description reflects the findings of an ongoing research program on the design of naval distributed systems research collaborators include students researchers and faculty at the university of michigan virginia polytechnic institute and state university the university college london and delft university of technology this program is supported by u s office of naval research grant no n00014 15 1 2752 the physical architecture is the spatial relationship in the general arrangements of the ship the logical architecture is the relationship between vital components that generates system functionality the operational architecture is the use of distributed systems over time vulnerability focuses on the physical and logical systems this research will therefore also focus on the interconnectivity of the physical and logical systems in order to account for both systems architecture a vulnerability program should therefore accomplish three tasks ball 2003 1 identify the vital components and their kill modes 2 assess the vulnerability 3 reduce the vulnerability of the ship through feedback to the designers a reactive vulnerability program will analyze a ship design when it is close to completion and then recommend vulnerability reduction features a proactive vulnerability program will analyze a ship design early and continuously throughout the design program the proactive program cycles feedback from leading indicators that the vulnerability assessment provides back to the architectural designers of the ship s distributed systems the designers can then make informed revisions regarding the vulnerability implications of their architectural layouts and logic traditional vulnerability programs are heavily reactive due to their assessments requiring large amounts of precise information for complex modeling and simulations 2 1 identification of vital components and kill modes vital components are the critical parts required for a system to properly function kill modes are the ways in which the system fails due to damage or failure of one or more vital components in the system ball 2003 in order to conduct the vulnerability assessment it is imperative to know what types of componentry damage will result in a kill mode naval ship kill modes are either related to a mission capability or a navigational capability a mission kill mode results in a ship no longer being able to accomplish a critical mission mode e g a weapon system failure a navigational kill mode results in a loss of steering or propulsion these two types of kill modes are not exclusive as most navigational kill modes also result in a mission kill mode 2 2 naval vulnerability assessment probabilistic simulation of weapon effects on a computer model of the ship design results in vulnerability metrics the metric commonly used in quantifying a design s vulnerability is the probability of kill upon hit often denoted in literature as p k farris and stuckey 2000 ball 2003 this metric is typically calculated via probabilistic shotlines and evaluation of a design s kill modes smith 2010 once an assessment calculates the vulnerability metrics the results can be used to determine a down selection of competing design variants help inform the policy of operational leadership or revise the design design revisions can either alter the architecture or add a vulnerability reduction feature revision of the design allows for vulnerability reduction through iterative vulnerability assessments which is best conducted early this is illustrated in fig 2 2 3 vulnerability reduction there are two methodologies for reducing the vulnerability of naval design the first and most effective method is through an architectural change in the design of the system this option allows for re location of compartments and vital components which results in better placement and separation of redundant components unfortunately architectural changes are often not possible due to the cost of delaying and redesigning part of the ship for this reason architectural design changes should be done during early stage design when redesign is possible the second methodology for vulnerability reduction is adding a vulnerability reduction feature these methods provide smaller reductions than architectural changes but do not delay the design production an example addition is ballistic paneling ballistic paneling helps protect vital componentry within a compartment from weapon fragments but also adds significant weight to the ship design a more effective approach is to move the vulnerable componentry away from the vulnerable area through an architectural change during early stage design 2 3 vulnerability assessment implementation traditional vulnerability assessments are limited in being able to provide the vulnerability reduction options during early stage design but network based assessment reduces the design detail needed for analysis a network based vulnerability assessment can make use of an iterative approach based on leading indicators derived from analysis of the network with an example implementation strategy as seen in fig 3 this vulnerability information feedback loop allows design decision makers to make vulnerability conscious decisions earlier in the design process the metrics and constants shown in fig 3 are developed in section 3 of this paper 3 vulnerability assessment via networks networks allow for the reduction of the design detail needed to perform analysis on the architectural systems of a naval ship network theory stems from mathematical graph theory and has been widely applied to the sciences and engineering networks have more recently been applied to ship design as a tool for modeling and examining naval design spaces through information duals and shipboard distributed systems chalfant et al 2017 shields et al 2015 rigterink 2014 goodrum et al 2018 for a detailed presentation of network theory the reader is encouraged to consult the references of newman 2018 and barabási 2016 for an explicit mathematical representation of multi layer networks refer to the reference de domenico et al de domenico et al 2013 networks are made up of nodes which are the entities being modeled and edges which are the relationships between the nodes two nodes that have a relationship are then said to be linked by an edge the addition or deletion of an edge or node is instantaneous which makes networks adept at examining a changing complex design space a network containing multiple types of nodes can be broken into multi layer networks where each layer contains one type of node the level of detail modeled is up to the designer but clear rules for creating edges between nodes is essential to provide an accurate representation of the system being modeled 3 1 multilayer network approach a multilayer network was selected to allow for evaluation of both the coupled and decoupled physical and logical systems on a ship a four layer network is utilized and divided into two node layers for the physical system openings and compartments and two layers for the logical system vital components and functional links as seen in fig 4 the four layers are 1 openings layer contains nodes that represent physical openings between compartments e g doors hatches 2 compartments layer contains nodes that represent physical compartments e g bridge stairway ballast tank 3 vital components layer contains nodes that represent vital components of a logical system e g generator control panel pipe 4 functional links layer contains nodes that represent the functional links between vital components e g rotate transmit this four layer framework allows for separation and integration between the physical and logical architectures while nodes exist on each layer edges connect physical or logical relationships between nodes an example of mapping the physical and logical systems relationships is depicted in fig 5 the framework s integrated yet separated organization allows for assessments to be executed on an individual system as well as on integrated systems the integration of the physical and logical systems creates the physical system solution goodrum et al 2018 an important flexible advantage of modeling a ship with this four layer network framework is that even with vastly different physical architecture between multiple variants there are common reusable nodes for modeling for example only one node needs to be created for a ship s galley even if the competing design variants are a monohull and trimaran this galley node can be reused time and time again throughout the design program and only have its edges changed for analysis the efficient reuse of nodes is also true for a logical system s vital components as often only the relationship changes between design variants not their entire componentry this level of modeling adaptability is unattainable in a cad model where new models must be built for each variant 3 2 modeling damage failure in the network in order to evaluate the architectural implications due to damage cases nodes are removed nodes can be removed one at a time or in groups to simulate different types of damage or failure each layer s type of node results in the removal of a subset of the nodes and edges in the four layer network like in classical network theory when a node is removed from a network all edges associated with that node are also removed this allows for quick simulation of damage to the ship design without the need for probabilistic shotlines and intensive computer modeling simulations let the following sets of nodes be defined as o the openings c the compartments v the vital components and f the functional links let ψ0 represent the original set without removed nodes as shown in 1 and ψ be the new set of nodes post damage 1 ψ 0 o c v f let the subscript d denote the set of damaged nodes of the type that the subscript is acting on e g cd set of compartment nodes damaged the removal logic thus follows the following four rules using set notation 1 failure of an opening remove opening node from network as seen in 2 2 ψ ψ 0 c d 2 failure of a compartment remove compartment and remove vital components within compartment from network as seen in 3 3 ψ ψ 0 c d v d 3 failure of a vital component remove vital component and remove its functional links from network as seen in 4 4 ψ ψ 0 v d f d 4 failure of a functional link remove functional link from network as in 5 5 ψ ψ 0 f d 3 3 network projections and information duals networks that have two types of nodes like the physical and logical systems in fig 5 are called bipartite networks these two types of nodes can be split into two layers and then projected upon each other the network projection upon a layer replaces the inter layer edges and nodes of the projection layer with edges on the projected upon layer this results in a single layer representation with intra layer edges and only one node type the simpler projected layers are useful for efficient calculation and representation of a more complicated system shields et al 2015 these network projections are examples of information duals or network duals a depiction of two network projections and information duals is shown in the right side of fig 5 information duals are beneficial to complex distributed system analysis as they represent the recipients and transmitters of signals in the system without modeling the complex steps involved to send the signal rosvall 2005 information duals have proved useful in naval architecture by discovering interdependencies between distinct shipboard systems shields et al 2015 3 4 vulnerability leading indicator network based metrics a focus on leading indicators is an essential characteristic of an effective engineering product development metric reinertsen 1997 three network theory derived vulnerability metrics based on leading indicators are presented the metrics are intended to aid designers in understanding the vulnerability implications of architectural decisions at the physical system logical system and integrated physical system solution levels the three metrics of interdependency connectivity and adaptability provide leading indicators of vulnerable areas in the architectural design of the systems the metrics assess the importance of a node s role in the overall function of that network the higher the importance of a node the higher the risk as the system is too reliant on that single node for operations the leading indicator metrics therefore allow designers to address vulnerability issues in early design revisions in order to create a more capable ship for the customer 3 4 1 interdependency β interdependency quantifies a network s reliance on certain nodes interdependency is based on a measure of the network s betweenness centrality the average betweenness centrality of a node βi informs the number of the shortest paths between all node pairs that travel through that node as in 6 and 7 newman 2018 let gst be the total number of shortest paths from source to target nodes 6 β i s t x s t i g s t w h e r e i s t i n d i v i d u a l n o d e s o u r c e n o d e t a r g e t n o d e 7 x s t i 1 0 n o d e i o n s h o r t e s t p a t h b e t w e e n s a n d t o t h e r w i s e this metric is zero if the node is not on any shortest paths and proportional to the average rate at which traffic passes through a node newman 2018 interdependency provides a useful leading indicator by identifying nodes that are crucial to the successful operation of a network nodes with high interdependency act as a conduit for physical or logical traffic through the network for example in a physical system a stairway or elevator compartment is a high traffic area through a ship s decks and levels 3 4 2 connectivity κ connectivity identifies the nodes in the network that have a high number of edges this is based on a node s degree centrality which is the number of neighboring nodes a node is attached to newman 2018 the degree of a node and thus its connectivity score is shown in 8 and 9 8 κ i j 1 n a i j w h e r e i n a i j n o d e b e i n g i n s p e c t e d a l l n o d e s i n n e t w o r k n o d e a d j a c e n c y m a t r i x 9 a i j 1 0 e d g e e x i s t s b e t w e e n i a n d j o t h e r w i s e this metric is bounded between a minimum of zero where the node is not connected to another node and n where the node is connected to all other nodes in the network a high degree is related to a greater importance in the network s function because it identifies nodes with hub like properties in the network these network hubs like a ship power panel are potential leading indicators of vulnerable componentry that need to be preserved to maintain a ship s capability 3 4 3 adaptability α adaptability is the system s flexibility in changing routings between two nodes this is a direct measure of redundancy because it evaluates how many nodes are required to make a certain system or task fail a water pump that can be routed to two generators requires both to fail instead of only being connected to one hence a greater number of nodes must be removed from the network this behavior is captured in the network by the max flow min cut theorem which states that the number of independent paths the number of nodes to remove connection between two nodes the minimum cut set and the maximum flow between two nodes are all equal newman 2018 the average adaptability of a node can therefore be defined as seen in 10 and 11 10 α i j 1 n x j n w h e r e i n i n d i v i d u a l n o d e a l l n o d e s i n n e t w o r k 11 x j 1 0 n o d e j i n m i n i m u m c u t s e t o t h e r w i s e this metric is bounded by a minimum of zero where the node does not exist in any minimum cut set and a maximum of one which is that all shortest paths in the system run through the node a high adaptability means high redundancy for that task but a low adaptability can highlight areas and systems that need further vulnerability reduction in subsequent design revisions 3 5 vulnerability assessment robustness metric a robustness metric has been developed for operational evaluation of a ship design s ability to withstand a hostile weapon impact robustness tests a network s redundancy and separation in case of componentry failure it examines how much of the network is still operational after damage damage is simulated by the removal of nodes and edges from the network kill modes can then be analyzed and evaluated for operability see section 2 on kill modes the design s robustness ρ can thus be calculated as shown in 12 several competing design variants denoted by the subscript v can be compared through this metric to help inform decision makers 12 ρ v w i n δ n i μ n i n δ n i w h e r e v d e s i g n v a r i a n t w w e a p o n t h r e a t i w e a p o n i m p

consideration of the necessity versus desirability of a given mission or capability the desirability constant can be adapted throughout the ship s design from being used to address the separate capabilities the customer wishes the conceptual ship to have in combat to more refined performance parameters later in detail design an example desirability constant table is shown in table 1 a possible assessment method when implementing the desirability constant for evaluation is to implement a baseline rule for example the failure of three or more compartments below the waterline can disable hydrostatic stability similarly one node and two node removal can prove useful in examining the result of individual or dual componentry failure while a removal of a large segment can provide information on the network s capability to handle a large weapon impact the given weapon w determines the weapon envelope due to its charge size and generalized blast damage equations the weapon envelope in turn determines the number of nodes removed from the network for simulating damage the robustness metric gives the vulnerability assessment director flexibility in choosing to run an assessment based on specific weapon envelopes and or to evaluate the entire system at an individual componentry level an example flowchart fig 3 of section 2 of this paper shows how the network framework and vulnerability assessment can be integrated into the ship design program to provide leading indicators and design variant comparisons for decision makers 4 representative case study in this case study an assessment was conducted on a representative naval ship design and its cargo elevator system as shown in figs 6 and 7 the representative ship design and physical system takes influence from the military sealift command s t ake dry cargo ammunition ship class the logical architecture examined six of the naval cargo elevators like that on the t ake class ship nassco the functionality of the cargo elevators is imperative for the ship s primary mission as a supply and replenishment vessel united states navy fact file online cargo elevator systems provide a useful case study as they exemplify the characteristics of many important shipboard systems complex shipboard systems require routing through many compartments and have supply and demand needs in the same manner as cargo elevators the products these shipboard systems deliver are their main difference e g cargo electricity chill water etc naval cargo elevators have proven a mission essential system in not only cargo vessels but also aircraft carriers most recently the uss gerald r ford has made the news after encountering extensive delays due to issues with the installation of its munitions elevators capaccio 2019 4 1 construction of the ship design s four layer network first a model set of general arrangements was created and then converted into the physical system network in the manner shown in fig 5 then the logical system architecture of the cargo elevators was mapped based on the naval ship s technical manual ch 772 on cargo and weapon elevators naval sea systems 1998 six cargo elevators were placed into the logical system architecture with their functions and links mapped as shown in the right side of fig 6 with an illustrative depiction of the general system on the ship in fig 7 redundancy is built into the logical system as pairs of cargo elevators serve one cargo hold on each deck pairs of cargo elevators were linked to a single cargo hold space on each below main deck level of the ship the cargo elevator logical system architecture was then integrated with the physical system architecture by placing edges between vital components and the compartments they reside within this results in the completed four layer network as shown in the center of fig 6 4 2 case study vulnerability leading indicators the physical system logical system and the integrated four layer network were assessed using the leading indicator metrics described in section 3 the networks used are shown in fig 6 and show how a lower fidelity early stage design can be assessed using the integrated four layer framework for an unbiased accurate framework the integrated four layer network analysis used only the compartments and openings that affect the cargo elevator logical system this ensures that unrelated physical architecture does not skew the results of the three metrics for example the measure of how many independent paths run between the bridge and the engine room is not relevant to the cargo elevator system being analyzed all the physical system elements can be incorporated if all shipboard systems were to be analyzed fig 8 shows the pairwise comparison graphs of the three network leading indicators on each network analyzed the diagonal plots within fig 8 represent the kernel density plots these plots show that most nodes score low near zero for each metric and only a small subset of nodes are shown to score high this small subset of high scoring individuals are the nodes that the rest of the system depends on and therefore the most important for vulnerability protection this behavior is indicative of a power law distribution or pareto distribution newman 2018 barabási 2016 4 2 1 physical system observations the physical system was seen to demonstrate the connectivity and interdependency of its hallways and stairwell compartments the top right score on the pairwise comparison of these two metrics in fig 8 for the physical system was the superstructure s hallways this result correctly illustrates expectations as halls and stairs are the main source of personnel movement throughout the ship s spatial layout low adaptability of low deck spaces and single passage doorways was also found to be consistent to expectations for example the lower deck ballast tanks make up part of the group of the adaptable physical system nodes scoring around zero throughout fig 8 the scores of the cargo elevator compartments within the physical system were unremarkable as they fell below the middle of the results this shows that without the context of the logical system the cargo elevators do not appear as important as they are to operations 4 2 2 logical system observations the importance of the cargo elevator platforms is seen in the logical system indicators the platforms are clustered together in the top right of fig 8 pairwise comparison plots for connectivity and interdependency the electrical connections and control panels scored the highest in low adaptability the leading indicators are therefore showcasing their intended characteristics as the electrical componentry and control panels have no redundancy in this case study 4 2 3 integrated 4 layer network observations the integrated network s leading indicators highlight vulnerable areas not seen by examining the physical or logical system cargo elevators elevator platforms machinery rooms and electrical sources scored high in at least one of the three indicators control panels mechanical linkages and electrical linkages were seen to have high adaptability scores as part of the highest adaptability scoring group in fig 8 the main deck cargo hold emerged as the dominant high scoring outlier and the maximum score in connectivity and interdependency it is plotted in fig 8 as the peak value for both these metrics this result is previously unseen by the physical or logical network model where the cargo hold s score was unremarkable in the pairwise comparisons 4 2 4 outlying top scores the highest scoring nodes in fig 8 for the integrated network based on the three leading indicators are shown in table 2 these identified nodes are crucial to the successful operation of the integrated network and thus need vulnerability reduction and protection design decision makers can now be informed of these vulnerable areas for improvement via revisions based on the vulnerability reduction techniques discussed in section 2 an assessment of the hardness of the design in response to a weapon threat can further highlight vulnerable areas within the environment of a hostile weapon impact this is demonstrated through a calculation of the case study design s robustness which is the other result of the network based vulnerability assessment as shown previously in fig 3 4 2 calculating robustness a set of representative missions was developed to demonstrate the robustness metric and the network based vulnerability assessment program illustrated back in fig 3 the six cargo elevators ability to move cargo from holds to on deck for transference were analyzed three missions one for each pair of cargo elevators were created all three missions were given a high importance and a high desirability constant from table 1 table 3 shows the missions and desirability constants used in the case study each mission s kill mode was defined as a failure of being able to move cargo from below decks to main deck if any pair of cargo elevators were unable to provide operational capability their respective mission is killed combining the missions and a weapon threat analysis allows for calculation of the robustness of the ship design air explosion threats airex are a common hostile threat to naval ships that need to be addressed in a vulnerability assessment smith 2010 to simulate an airex weapon a simulation was run on the network where every exterior compartment above the waterline between 2nd deck and 02 level was considered the point of impact for each exterior touching compartment in this ranges runs were conducted to simulate the damage in each run the impact compartment was removed from the integrated network the impact compartment s neighboring compartment nodes and their neighbors through openings were also removed to represent severe damage spreading this could be due to fire fragmentation or blast from the impact the integrated network was then modified in accordance with the rules stated in section 2 the integrated network was then analyzed for its ability to carry out its critical missions under this weapon threat selection only three impacts resulted in a cargo elevator failure this is shown in fig 9 the impacts of the machinery rooms of elevator 1 and elevator 2 both resulted in failure of those elevator platforms the network model correctly captured this damage case failure of the platforms is to be expected if the cargo elevator loses its mechanical and or electrical system since these two machinery rooms were directly exposed on the topside of the ship to the impact they are more vulnerable however since each pair of elevators is redundant and only one fails in these cases then the three missions defined in this case study are satisfied this highlights the network framework s ability to model redundancy the only compartment weapon impact in this scenario that resulted in a mission failure was to the cargo hold on the main deck this cargo hold on the main deck is serviced by elevators 3 4 5 6 which are the four that failed in this damage case this results in two out of three mission kills a high robustness score ρv airex 0 996 for this given threat and specific three missions can then be calculated for this design as shown in 12 this analysis represents one of many threats that could be examined the robustness can then be compared to another variant s performance under the same weapon threat to inform designers the logical system and the physical system individually did not show this main deck cargo hold to be vulnerable but the integrated four layer cargo elevator network directly pointed to this compartment as being the most vulnerable node in the network the main deck cargo hold is shown as ranking the highest in two out of the three leading indicators seen in table 3 this shows the power of the vulnerability assessment network method presented in being able to uncover vulnerability issues and rapidly compare results with other variants 5 conclusion this paper has demonstrated how a network based vulnerability assessment can be implemented in early stage design to better inform decision makers the use of the novel multi layer network framework to represent a ship design for vulnerability assessments helped to extend vulnerability assessments at a lower level of design fidelity than required for traditional methods a set of vulnerability leading indicator metrics were developed and illustrated in this research through a case study of a representative naval ship the case study further examined the effectiveness of the metrics in identifying important components in a distributed naval ship design the four layer network approach was also able to uncover previously unforeseen vulnerability issues by integrating a ship s logical and physical system for vulnerability analysis the research enables decision makers to understand the vulnerability implications of their design choices earlier in the design program thereby empowering the designers to deliver safer more effective ships to the operators on the front line the framework developed provides utility in the design space but does not extend to the operations domain future work on this research could examine dynamic time stepping for expansion into operation based analysis it could also integrate probabilistic failures for recoverability analysis or component lifespan investigation the addition of dynamics to the network could prove useful in identifying other types of weaknesses in a design that can further inform naval decision makers credit authorship contribution statement luke c brownlow writing original draft writing review editing

20932,control of a twin turbine submerged floating system in turbulent flow atsushi sato a hiroyoshi kanoh b ken takagi c a japan marine united corp japan japan marine united corp japan japan marine united corp japan b eurus energy holdings corp japan eurus energy holdings corp japan eurus energy holdings corp japan c the university of tokyo japan the university of tokyo japan the university of tokyo japan corresponding author control of a twin turbine submerged floating system ttsfs with model predictive control mpc is discussed in this paper the ttsfs has been developed to harvest ocean current energy and it has twin turbines and a weather vaning ability by using a single point mooring system the ttsfs is perturbed and the output power fluctuates due to turbulence in the flow the aim of this study is to show the possibility to mitigate motions of the ttsfs and fluctuations of the output power simultaneously in turbulent flow using blade pitch control and torque control of the generator the control simulation is performed using a motion simulator which can simulate nonlinear 6 dof motions of the ttsfs coupled with rotating twin turbines and a single point mooring system based on the simulation results it is concluded that motion control is necessary to prevent large asymmetric motion which may affect the integrity of the mooring system also mpc has the ability to mitigate motions of the ttsfs and the fluctuation of the output power simultaneously however there are tradeoffs among the variance of the motions the variance of the angular velocity or the torque and the average of the output power keywords ocean current turbine model predictive control floating system marine renewable energy 1 introduction ocean current energy is a promising power resource for japan since the kuroshio current one of the strongest ocean currents in the world passes near the japanese coast ihi corporation and new energy and industrial technology development organization nedo orporation and i dem 2019 have developed a twin turbine submerged floating system ttsfs using a single point mooring for harvesting the kuroshio energy van zwieten et al van zwieten et al 2006a also proposed a floating twin turbine concept with the single mooring system similar concepts are reported by several researchers for example in chen et al 2016 and shirasawa et al 2016 the floating system can be adopted for the deep water regions where the ocean current flows and the single mooring system has a weather vaning function which helps that the turbine is always facing the inflow direction the floating system is also utilized for energy harvesting from tidal currents for example orbital marine power limited http www scotrenewable 2019 is credited with pioneering floating tidal stream turbines clarke et al 2007 and clarke et al 2009 utilized a contra rotating turbine to minimize the size of floater their concept has been evolved into a full scale device and has been tested by nautricity limited http www nautricity co 2019 other types of floating systems have been proposed and their motions have been analyzed by several researchers for example in guo et al 2018 and barbarelli et al 2018 the floating system has another advantage that the turbine can be closer to the sea surface where the current speed is usually faster than near the seafloor see for example winkel et al 2002 and imamura et al 2019 however the turbulence of the current and ocean wave effects see for example imamura et al 2019 induce unsteady motions in the floating system thus it is preferable to utilize motion control for the submerged floating system whereas surface floating systems i e http www scotrenewable 2019 and guo et al 2018 do not need control because of strong static restoring forces in the case of submerged floating systems control of buoyancy and thrust forces are used to sustain the turbine at a proper position beneath the sea surface where the overall vertical position of the system is determined by a balance among the thrust force on the turbine the drag force on the floater the device buoyancy and the mooring force asymmetric motions are induced in realistic flow since the turbulence is not symmetric and should be controlled moreover in case of the twin turbine concept the asymmetric motion is more prominent since the inflow velocity is not exactly the same for each turbine van zwieten et al van zwieten et al 2006b proposed to use wing tips and a canard fin to control the pitch and the roll motion as well as the vertical position barbarelli et al 2018 used a rudder and an elevator to control both the symmetric and asymmetric motions ihi s system in nagaya et al 2014 uses blade pitch control to reduce asymmetric motions instead of using a wing shaped control fin since this control system is already implemented for increasing the output power in addition takeda et al 2013 found that the thrust force induced by turbines is the dominant force in determining the motion of the system thus utilizing blade pitch control for the motion control should be more efficient than the wing shaped fin system which requires an additional device and control system it is well known that blade pitch control and generator torque control are utilized to increase the quality and the quantity of output power as shown in reviews of recent control methodology for wind turbines in njiri et al njiri and söffker 2016 and menezes et al 2018 and for tidal turbines in qian et al 2019 therefore using blade pitch control and torque control motions of the ttsfs and the output power fluctuations can be mitigated simultaneously the aim of this study is to show the possibility to mitigate motions of the ttsfs and fluctuations of the output power simultaneously with blade pitch control and torque control of the generator using a multi input multi output control system the model predictive control mpc maciejowski 2002 is one suitable methodology for this purpose since the algorithm can easily handle constraints on inputs and outputs thus mpc is utilized in the present study although the shape and the configuration are different mpc was used for a floating wind turbine to mitigate structural load by minimizing yawing and pitching moments on the rotor by raach et al 2014 chaaban et al chaaban and fritzen 2014 used mpc for both reducing blade fatigue and damping platform motions of floating wind turbines similar work has been reported in mirzaei et al 2013 where a lidar measurement is used as an input to a feed forward controller in section 2 the mathematical model of a simulation used in the study are explained and the condition of inflow are mentioned a method of control based on mpc is proposed in section 3 and results on case studies using the proposed control method are discussed in section 4 2 mathematical modeling 2 1 full scale ttsfs the main body of the full scale ttsfs is composed of two pods which contain a generator and its control system and a cross beam which connects the two pods although the prototype system introduced in orporation and i dem 2019 mounts a buoyancy control system on the center of cross beam the full scale ttsfs is planned to store it in both pods to achieve a concise appearance and to minimize the structural weight and cost of the main body as a result it has a relatively small cross beam and the forces acting on the main body are dominated by the turbine thrust weight and buoyancy of the main body and the mooring line tension rather than the lift acting on the cross beam as mentioned previously the rated flow velocity of the full scale system is planned to be 1 5 m s the diameter of turbine blade is approximately 43 m to achieve the rated output of 0 95 mw for each turbine although the applicable water depth ranges from 100 m to 1000 m the water depth is assumed to be 500 m in this study although the detail is slightly changed the original plan of the ttsfs are found in takagi et al 2012 fig 1 shows the top view and the back view of the full scale ttsfs and the principal dimensions are listed in table 1 2 2 motion simulator the motion simulator has been developed and validated with experimental results by takeda et al 2013 which can simulate nonlinear 6 dof motions of the ttsfs with rotating twin turbines the equations of motion for the main body of the system are fully coupled with equations of rotations for two turbine rotor the ttsfs is moored by the v shaped single mooring system which is also coupled with the motions of the main body the differences between a y shaped mooring system and a v shaped mooring system is the connecting point and two mooring lines are connected at the anchor point in v shaped system the hydrodynamic force on the turbine blades are estimated by the blade element momentum bem theory see for example vaz et al 2011 the inflow velocity for each cross section of the blade takes the influence of relative current velocity caused by the turbulence including wave effects the velocity profile and the motion of the main body into account in addition the added mass of the turbine is considered based on the relative acceleration for each cross section assuming that the blade is a flat plate although the effect of added mass is negligibly small for the normal motion hydrodynamic forces on the main body such as the wave force the added mass the wave damping force the vortex induced drag force the surface friction and the lift force are considered where the former three are estimated by potential theory and later three are estimated from a model experiment it is mentioned that the mooring line is assumed to be a synthetic fiber since the ttsfs is moored at 500 m deep sea matsuda et al 2011 developed and validated a mooring simulator based on the lumped mass method which is adopted by the simulator in addition to the above mentioned mathematical models a model of the drive train is newly adopted by the simulator for simulating the effect of moment of inertia of the generator the turbine drive train is assumed to be represented by the following equation 1 i r i m a 2 i e ω q a q g where q is the torque on the turbine q g the torque on the generator i r the moment of inertia of the turbine rotor i m the added moment of inertia i e the moment of inertia of the generator ω the rate of rotation of the turbine rotor and a the gear ratio it is noted that block letters are vectors i e it has two components for example q q l q r where l and r denote the left turbine and the right turbine respectively it is also noted that the influences of the overall electrical system of the generator and the twisting rigidity of the drive shaft should be considered for performing more accurate simulations it is noted that the asymmetric motions of the ttsfs are quite unique which are mainly caused by the v shaped single point mooring system the v shaped mooring lines are connected to two pods and the anchor point see fig 1 and fig a1 the roll yaw and sway motions at the center of gravity of the main body are basically coupled with each other once there is a roll motion at the center of gravity i e heave motion for each pod the surge motion for each pod is induced since the heave motion of each pod is coupled with the surge motion of the pod because of the mooring as a result the yaw motion at the center of gravity occurs the thrust force on the turbine rotor is perpendicular to the rotor surface and thus the thrust vector has a certain angle with the x axis according to the yaw motion which induces a horizontal force and the sway motion the motion characteristics due to the y shaped mooring system is basically the same as far as the linearized equation shown in appendix a is valid 2 3 environmental conditions the ocean current is believed to be a stable energy source for the electrical power generation however it has fluctuations which are reported by for example kiyomatsu etc kiyomatsu et al 2014 fluctuations due to tides is major reason of low frequency fluctuations which can be controlled with buoyancy control on the contrary higher frequency fluctuations due to the turbulence are not controlled with buoyancy control and thus blade pitch control should be utilized since blade pitch control is focused on in the present work we limit the frequency range of the fluctuations from 0 00167 hz to 0 2 hz it is supposed that the main fluctuations in this frequency range is due to the turbulence of the flow therefore the spectrum of the fluctuated velocity is supposed to correspond to the inertial range which is represented as 2 s u f c f 5 3 where s u f is the spectrum of fluctuated velocity f the frequency of the fluctuation c a coefficient varying with the turbulent intensity the turbulence intensity is one of important parameters when we evaluate the motion of the main body and the fluctuation of the output power imamura et al 2019 showed that the turbulence intensity of the ocean current near kuchinosima is about 0 1 which is based on the duration of 10 min we use this value in this study another important parameter is the spatial coherence because the asymmetric motion is mainly induced by the difference of the inflow velocity between two turbines pyakurel et al 2017 presented a numerical modeling of turbulence of the ocean current they used the davenport model initially proposed for wind modeling which is described by an exponential function with a decay parameter c 3 γ 2 exp c f r u where γ is the coherence r the distance u the average of the flow imamura et al imamura and takagi 2019 reported the decay parameter of ocean current measured near kuchinoshima we used a typical decay parameter c 8 which is based on imamura s result to know the influence of the coherence on simultaneous control of motion and output power the numerical modeling proposed by pyakurel et al 2017 is used to generate the turbulent flow for the motion simulation some numerical examples of the turbulent flow and motions of the ttsfs based on the numerical modeling are found in kanoh and takagi 2018 3 control 3 1 control strategies the ttsfs has two control systems for controlling motions of the main body one is blade pitch control which is used not only for motion control but also control of generating power the other buoyancy control is used for slow symmetric motions which are mainly caused by a slow variation of the inflow velocity due to for example the tidal flow gonoji et al 2013 showed the motion of ttsfs at the time of startup and an accident they concluded that buoyancy control is not enough to keep the submerged depth because it consumes energy and the response is slow and a combination with blade pitch control improves controllability it is mentioned that ihi s prototype is controlled with blade pitch control so that motions of the main body should keep within a certain limit since the safety is the priority of the project thus they didn t try to maximize the output power and safe operation simultaneously nagaya 2018 in this paper we try to maximize the output power while motions of the main body are kept at a certain level in addition the fluctuation of the output power is reduced as much as possible it is mentioned again that in realistic control the slow movement is controlled by the buoyancy control system so the controllable range of frequency will be wider the generator control system is usually used for maximize the output power it is also utilized for motion control of the ttsfs in the present study since it can change the thrust force on the turbine mpc is used for the present study since it is suitable for a multi input and multi output control with restrictions as mentioned previously the control system used here should satisfy this requirement and many restrictions such as the range of blade pitch angle the rotational speed of the blade pitch angle the output power limit and so on 3 2 simplified linear mathematical model in order to utilize mpc a linear mathematical model is necessary to represent the motion of the main body and turbines although it is possible to obtain a linear mathematical model directly from fully coupled nonlinear motion equation it is complex and time consuming for utilizing in the mpc algorithm therefore we obtained linearized equations of motion at first and then the linear mathematical model was obtained using the linearized equation of motion the derivation of the linearized equations of motion is shown in appendix a the linearized equation of motion is valid only if the motion is small however the target motions for controlling are small and the main body is close to the equilibrium position in a normal operation considering small variations around an operating point the following linear mathematical model for mpc is obtained where the thrust force and the moment on the drive shaft are linearized following their characteristic curve obtained by the bem 4 m m 11 sin 2 θ 0 m 33 cos 2 θ 0 l 2 δ θ n 11 sin 2 θ 0 t s u m v sin 2 θ 0 l 2 δ θ t d i f v b l sin 2 θ 0 δ ψ t d i f v b l sin θ

inflow velocity at the center of turbine q g s u m the sum of the torque on the generator and δ denotes a small variation the pitch angle is common to all blades on a rotor it is noted that n m m except for n 11 are omitted because n m m is originated from the drag force which is proportional to the square of the velocity variation it is also mentioned that the inflow velocity is assumed to be measured by an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv at the center of turbine with the sampling speed of 0 1 s however the measurement error is not considered although mpc can control multi output it is preferable to reduce the number of control outputs the heave and the yaw are selected as the output parameters since the heave is coupled with the surge and the yaw is coupled with the sway and the roll variations of the heave δ h and the yaw δ ϕ are calculated from δ θ δ ψ and δ φ as 8 δ h δ ϕ δ θ l sin θ 0 δ ψ sin θ 0 δ φ cos θ 0 using these equations a state space model is described as 9 x k 1 a x x k a u u k a d d k 10 y k b x x k b u u k where a x a u a d b x and b u are the system matrices x k the state vector u k the control input d k the measurable disturbance and y k the output vector x k y k and u k in the control system are defined as 11 x k δ θ δ θ δ ψ δ ψ δ φ δ φ δ ω δ β δ q g t 12 y k δ h δ ϕ δ ω δ q g t 13 u k δ β ci δ q g ci t 14 d k δ v t where p denotes the output power of the generator β ci and q g ci represent the control input of the blade pitch angle and the generator torque respectively which are calculated in the mpc controller for the sake of simplicity the actuator models are assumed to be represented by a first order response model as 15 δ β 1 τ β δ β ci δ β 16 δ q g 1 τ g δ q g ci δ q g where τ β and τ g are the time constants which are chosen to be 0 1 s the reference value of the generator is based on the command value which is obtained by the maximum power tracking hansen et al 2005 the control domain is divided into three regions based on the angular velocity of the generator ω g when ω g 0 94 ω g r the command value q g c is given by 17 q g c π ρ r 5 c p m a x 2 a 3 λ o p t 3 η ω g 2 where c p m a x is the maximum power coefficient λ o p t denotes the optimum tip speed ratio which gives the maximum power coefficient and ω g r is the rated angular velocity of the generator when ω g r ω g the command value is restricted so that it doesn t exceed the rated power p r thus the command value is obtained as 18 q g c p r ω g when 0 94 ω g r ω g ω g r the command value is calculated by the linear interpolation between the command values for ω g 0 94 ω g r and ω g ω g r the rated angular velocity and the power are assumed to be 600 rpm and 1000 kw respectively in this work the output vector y k is defined as the difference between the current value and a reference value the reference values for the heave and the yaw are 50 m and 0 rad respectively which are the operation position the reference value for the angular velocity is chosen to be ω 0 v λ o p t r so that the turbine works at the optimum tip speed ratio where r denotes the radius of the rotor the reference value for the generator torque q gc is determined according to the maximum power tracking method mentioned above where ω 0 is used for the maximum power tracking as an input angular velocity since the efficiency of turbine is sensitive to the blade pitch angle a constraint is imposed on the variation of the blade pitch angle the variation of the generator torque is also subjected to a constraint which is determined so that the generator torque does not exceed 110 of the rated torque constrains on variations of the blade pitch angle δ β ci and the generator torque δ q g ci are expressed as 19 1 0 deg δ β ci 1 0 deg q g 0 δ q g ci 0 1 q g 0 where q g 0 denotes the rated torque of the generator which is 15 9 knm the rate of blade pitch angle is also restricted because of the limitation of the pitch control mechanism the restriction is expressed as 20 0 5 deg s δ β ci 0 5 deg s according to maciejowski 2002 the cost function u k for the optimization is generally defined as the following equation 21 min u ˆ k i k i 0 1 n c 1 u k i 1 n p y ˆ k i k q 2 i 2 i 0 n c 1 u ˆ k i k r 2 i 2 i 0 n c 1 u ˆ k i k r 2 u i 2 numerical simulations have been performed in matlab simulink by the nonlinear simulator mentioned in section 2 2 in order to get derivatives of f and q in equations 4 7 the thrust coefficient and the power coefficient are approximated by a cubic curve the sampling time of mpc is chosen to be 0 1 s while the sampling time for the nonlinear motion simulator is 0 01 s 3 3 pid controllers a pid controller is designed as a reference controller the pid controller is designed to control the heave the yaw and the generator torque with δ β and δ q g the same as the mpc controller however control is performed independently the gain factors of the pid controller are tuned so that the output vector x δ h δ ϕ δ q g becomes as small as possible although the pid controller cannot take the restrictions into account the restrictions on the blade pitch angle is satisfied compulsory in the motion simulator 4 results and discussions the mpc controller is tuned so that the output vector is almost equivalent to that of pid control with the similar magnitude of the control input the weight of mpc controller tuned is hereinafter referred to as the baseline weight fig 2 shows a comparison of motions among no control pid control and mpc control with baseline weights when control is not adapted a large drift motion is observed in sway however it is usually returned with a very long period about 1 h one of important aim for motion control is to prevent such a large motion which may affect the integrity of the mooring system or in the worst case may trigger the device to capsize it is apparent that both pid control and mpc prevent the large drift motion in the sway it is also mentioned that motion control is not applied directly to the sway but the yaw this means that yaw control is effective for other asymmetric motions similarly heave control affects not only the heave but also the surge and the pitch on the other hand the effect of mpc on the short period fluctuations is not apparent the reduction of short period fluctuations will be tried later fig 3 shows a comparison of the blade pitch angle between pid control and mpc since the baseline weight for mpc is tuned so that the magnitude of output vectors is almost identical to the pid the magnitude of the blade pitch angle is almost the same however the time history of mpc result is not sinusoidal while the pid results is almost a sinusoidal curve it is supposed that mpc reflects an interaction between blade pitch control and generator torque control fig 4 shows comparisons of the generator torque the generator s angular velocity and the output power upper figures show that the upper limit of pid control is smaller than that of mpc the reason is considered that the maximum command value of the generator is 15 9 knm and pid controller adheres to this value on the other hand the restriction of mpc is not subject to the torque itself but the variation of torque which is 10 of this value therefore mpc gives higher torque however it does not exceed 110 of the maximum command value regarding the variation width pid control seems smaller than mpc however the difference is not apparent the variance of time histories will be discussed in the end of this section the middle figures show the angular velocity of the turbine it is observed that the variation width of mpc is narrower than pid control this is natural since the angular velocity in pid control is not controlled while the angular velocity is one of components of the cost function in mpc the average of mpc is lower than that of pid control because the average of torque is larger than pid control the output power is shown in the lower figures despite controlling both the angular velocity and the torque the variation of mpc output power is not small compared with that of pid control this suggests that the variation of output power should be included in the cost function to reduce the fluctuation range of the output power it is noted that the output power in fig 4 is obtained after applying the transmission efficiency of 0 95 to the generator output power in order to investigate possibilities of mpc several trials are made by changing the baseline weights the trials include minimization of the yaw the angular velocity and the output power weights for the minimization of the yaw are shown in table 2 as a ratio to the baseline weights it is not easy to obtain the general methodology for tuning of the best weights because number of parameters in the output vector is larger than that in the control input thus only case studies for demonstrating possibility of mpc are shown here firstly the reduction of the yaw is chosen the weight for the yaw is increased as 6 times larger than the baseline weights to minimize the yaw since blade pitch control is more direct to change the thrust force than generator torque control the motion of blade pitch angle easily becomes aggressive thus a larger weight is applied for the control input value of blade pitch angle on the contrary the weight for the generator torque is reduced to 1 10 of the baseline weight and controlling the yaw motion becomes more important in the controller the result of yaw motion is shown in fig 5 in which the yaw motion with weights in table 2 is compared with the results of baseline weights where results of no control and pid control are shown as references it is obvious that the fluctuating range of mpc with the weights minimizing the yaw is smallest and it is less than 1 2 of that with the baseline weights on the other hand since blade pitch control directly induce the yaw moment the variation of the blade pitch angle is large compared to that in the case of baseline weights that is shown in fig 6 it is observed that the change of blade pitch angle is aggressive in spite of larger weight applied here than the baseline weight it is noted that in order not to spoil the resultant yaw motion reduction the restriction of blade pitch angle is extended to 2 to allow a large amplitude of blade pitch the change of generator torque is also effective to reduce the yaw thus the range of variation of the generator torque is large compared to that in the case of baseline weights fig 7 shows a comparison of time history of the generator torque between the baseline weights and the yaw minimizing weights an aggressive change of the generator torque in the case of yaw minimizing weights is obvious however it does not exceed the upper limit the next trial is to reduce the variation width of the angular velocity table 3 shows the weights for minimizing the variation width of the angular velocity a larger weight is applied to the variation of angular velocity δ ω on the other hand a smaller weight is applied to the variation of generator torque a large weight for the blade pitch angle is used again to suppress an aggressive change of the angle since the aggressive change induces motions of the ttsfs and the large motion usually does not give a good result for the fluctuation of the angular velocity in addition the definition of the reference value of the angular velocity is slightly changed as ω 0 v λ o p t r where the time average of inflow velocity v is used instead of instantaneous value of v t fig 8 shows a comparison of the time history of the angular velocity between the baseline weights and the weights minimizing the angular velocity although the weights minimizing the variation width of the angular velocity is smaller than the baseline weights the difference is not obvious this suggests that to reduce the variation width of the angular velocity is not easy since an aggressive change of the blade pitch angle does not give a good result a large weight for the blade pitch is used as stated above fig 9 shows that the time history of minimizing the angular velocity variation case is far from periodic and sometimes it shows abrupt changes or keeps a large angle though the large change is limited by the restriction of the mpc controller a correlation between the motions of the ttsfs and the angular velocity is supposed to be one of reasons why the time history shows such a strange behavior it is found that when we reduce the weight for the blade pitch angle the change of angle becomes more aggressive and the resultant motions sometimes become infinitely large this fact also suggests that minimizing the variation width of the angular velocity is challenging a time history of the generator torque in the case of the weights minimizing the variation of the angular velocity is shown in fig 10 it is obvious that the variation width of the torque is large compared to that in the case of baseline weights the violent change of the generator torque causes a large variation of the output power thus minimizing the variation of the angular velocity is not a good strategy to reduce the variation width of the output power finally minimizing the variation width of the output power was attempted the weights for minimizing the variation of the output power is shown in table 4 the variation of power is included in the output vector instead of the generator torque to minimize it the variation of power δ p is defined as 22 δ p q g 0 δ ω ω 0 δ q g it is noted that the vector notation is not used in equation 22 in order to avoid complex expression however the same definition is applied to both the right and left turbines it is also noted that the reference value of the angular velocity ω 0 is the same as that in the case of baseline weights but a different definition of the reference value of the turbine torque is used i e the instantaneous value of the angular velocity ω is used as the input of maximum power tracking process instead of ω 0 the output vector y k in this trial is defined as 23 y k δ h δ ϕ δ ω δ p t the weighs for the output vector are almost the same as the baseline weights except for the angular velocity if the weight of angular velocity is zero the variation of output power is dramatically reduced while other weights are not sensitive a large weight is used for the blade pitch angle since the aggressive change of the angle does not give a good result as observed in the other trials fig 11 shows the time history of the output power the variation width of output power with the output variation minimizing weights is very small compared to that with baseline weights it is noted that this result only shows the possibility of smoothing since the influence of the electrical controller on the generator torque is not considered in this work however one reason can be considered to be that the rotation of the heavy rotor can store a large amount of kinetic energy the average power seems smaller than the case of baseline weights it is supposed that the definition of reference torque makes the average power smaller however if the original definition of the reference value is used the computation sometimes failed when we used the variation of power as a component of output vector thus it is considered that there is a trade off between the variation width of the output power and the average output power the average and the variance of the time histories will be discussed at the end of this section fig 12 shows the time histories of the angular velocity and the generator torque the variations of the angular velocity and the generator torque are not small however the resultant output power is almost constant it is interesting that the average angular velocity is higher than other cases one reason is that the weight for the variation of the angular velocity is zero and as a result the average angular velocity is free from the reference value which is around 0 43 rad s in this simulation the other reason is considered is that if the angular velocity is larger than the rated value the output power is restricted to the maximum power while the generator torque is able to change according to other control requirements i e the reduction of the motion it is noted that the change of blade pitch angle is small and cyclic throughout the simulation table 5 shows variances of the motions the generator torque the angular velocity and the output power the variances support the above mentioned discussions the baseline case is slightly better than pid control for all items except for the generator torque and the output power however the improvement is not obvious in the case of yaw minimum weights the variance of yaw is greatly improved but the variances of the generator torque and the angular velocity becomes worse when the minimization of the fluctuation range is tried the variance of the angular velocity is improved but the variances of other variables becomes worse the weights minimizing the variation of output power case shows that the variance of the output power is very small and the variances of the roll the pitch and the yaw are slightly better than that of baseline case however the average output power becomes lower which is shown in table 6 regarding the average output power the cases of the baseline weights the yaw minimum weights and the output power variation minimum weights result in slightly higher power output than the pid case summarizing the results there is a tradeoff between the variance of motions and the variances of the angular velocity and the generator torque in addition there is another tradeoff between the variances and the average of the output power 5 conclusions mpc is utilized to mitigate the motions of the ttsfs and the fluctuation of the output power the simulation of control is performed using a motion simulator which can simulate nonlinear 6 dof motions of the ttsfs coupled with motions of twin turbines and the v shaped single mooring system the simulation is performed in coherent turbulent flow four sets of the mpc controller weights were applied to show the possibility of the mitigation the baseline weights case shows the possibility to reduce the variances of the motions of the ttsfs and the angular velocity of the turbine at the same time but the advantage of mpc is not obvious compared to pid control the other three trials show the possibilities to reduce the yaw motion the fluctuation width of the angular velocity and the variation of the output power however it is found that there is a tradeoff between the variance of motions and the variances of the angular velocity and the generator torque in addition there is another tradeoff between the variances and the average of the output power summarizing the results it is concluded that motion control is necessary to prevent a large asymmetric motion which may affect the integrity of the mooring system or in the worst case may trigger the device to capsize also it is concluded that mpc has an ability to mitigate motions of the ttsfs and the fluctuation of the output power simultaneously however there are tradeoffs among the variance of the motions the variance of the angular velocity or the torque and the average of the output power since this work shows the possibility to mitigate the variations based on the limited trials in order to establish the optimum controller impacts on the cost of energy due to the fluctuation of each variable should be considered which gives a solution for the above mentioned tradeoffs this may be the future work credit authorship contribution statement atsushi satoh conceptualization validation

ordinate system fig a1 the flow is assumed to be parallel to the x axis and it flows in the negative x direction where o x y z coordinate system is fixed on the main body of the ttsfs as shown in figure a1 the ttsfs is decomposed into a main body two turbines and a v shape mooring system in the nonlinear motion simulator and the motion of each component induced by a fluctuation of the flow is

denote the right turbine and the left turbine respectively and r t represents the position of the turbine rotor it is noted that the shape and the weight distribution of main body are assumed to be vertically and laterally symmetry the 6dof turbine motions are separately estimated as a4 m t v tg ω t v tg e frd e fft a5 h t ω t h t e mrt e mft a6 h t n e tn i t n ω t n where m t is the mass of

moment e mrt is identical to the drive shaft reaction moment e frd except for x component it is also noted that equations of a4 a5 and a6 are common for both the right and the left turbines and hereinafter r and l will be added to the subscript when we need to distinguish the right and left in order to obtain the linearized equation of motion the following assumptions are used since the frequency of turbine rotation is much higher than the frequency of typical body motion it is assumed that the instantaneous position of the turbine blade is ignorable and the shape of turbine rotor is modeled as a circular disc this assumption leads i t 2 i t 3 and e f f t 2 e f f t 3 0 another assumption is that the turbine force and moment in the linearized equation can be estimated with the relative fluid velocity at the center of turbine in addition since the fluctuation v of the inflow to the turbine is small compared to the average inflow velocity v 0 it is assumed that v v 0 o ε where ε 1 this assumption leads that the order of v bg ω b v tg ω t 2 ω t 3 is o ε similarly the fluctuation of the rate of rotation is considered to be o ε therefore the order of the sum of both rotation is ω t 1 r ω t 1 l o ε since the left and the right turbines rotate opposite direction summing up the equations of translational motion for the main body and two turbines and neglecting small terms of o ε 2 the linearized equation of translational motion is obtained as a7 m b 2 m t v bg e ffb e fmb e b 1 e f f t 1 r e f f t 1 l where v bg is the velocity at the center of gravity when the main body and two turbines are combined and it is represented as a8 v bg v bg 2 m t m b 2 m t l a e b 2 ω b 3 e b 3 ω b 2 the transformation of equation a5 into the main body coordinate is not strait

equation a2 and a10 and omitting the small terms of o ε 2 the equation of rotational motion for the combined body is obtained as a11 h b 2 n e bn i t n ω b n e b 1 i t 1 ω r ω l e mfb e mbb e b 1 e m

other hand since the lowest order of equation a5 is o 1 eliminating small terms of o ε an equation of the turbine rotation is obtained as a12 i t 1 ω e m r t 1 e m f t 1 it is noted that i t 1 i r i m a 2 i e ω a q g e m r t 1 q e m f t 1 and a q g e m r d 1 and thus equation a12 is equivalent to equation 1 eliminating small terms in a4 and substituting it together with a12 into a11 the equation of rotational motion for the combined body is obtained as a13 h b e mfb e mbb e b 1 e m r d 1 r e m r d 1 r e b 3 r t 2 r e f f t 1 r e f f t 1 l where h b is represented as a14 h b n e bn i b n 2 i t n

of motion for the combined body it is noted that the equation of rotation for the combined body a13 is defined around the new center of gravity the hydrodynamic force and moment are given as a15 e ffb n e bn m n n v b g n n n n v b g n e mfb n e bn m ν ν ω b n n ν ν ω b n ν n 3 where m n n the added mass and the added moment of inertia n n n the damping coefficient it is noted that m m n and n m n m n are omitted because the shape of the main body is assumed to be symmetric since the main body is upright at the beginning of the simulation the basis vectors in equation a13 and a14 coincide with the basis in the earth fixed coordinate system and the direction of basis vectors does not change in the linearized equations therefore it is convenient to define a new notation of the inertia moment for the combined body i n as a16 i 4 i b 1 2 i t 1 2 m t r t 2 2 i 5 i b 2 m b l a 2 2 i t 2 2 m t r t 1 2 i 6 i b 3 m b l a 2 2 i t 3 m t r t 1 2 r t 2 2 since the mooring lines give constraints to the main body motions it is convenient to use a new coordinate system o ξ η ζ that is fixed on the seabed with the initial mooring angle θ 0 the v shaped mooring line is on the ξ η plane and the origin o corresponds to the anchor point if we assume that the mooring lines are connected at a point x z 0 and stretching of the mooring lines is negligible the main body motions except for the pitch motion can be represented by rotational motions θ φ and ψ and the linearized constraints are automatically satisfied as a17 v b 1 v b 3 tan θ 0 l θ sin θ 0 ω b 1 sin θ 0 ω b 3 cos θ 0 v b 2 l φ using

current energy and it has twin turbines and a weather vaning ability by using a single point mooring system the ttsfs is perturbed and the output power fluctuates due to turbulence in the flow the aim of this study is to show the possibility to mitigate motions of the ttsfs and fluctuations of the output power simultaneously in turbulent flow using blade pitch control and torque control of the generator the control simulation is performed using a motion simulator which can simulate nonlinear 6 dof motions of the ttsfs coupled with rotating twin turbines and a single point mooring system based on the simulation results it is concluded that motion control is necessary to prevent large asymmetric motion which may affect the integrity of the mooring system also mpc has the ability to mitigate motions of the ttsfs and the fluctuation of the output power simultaneously however there are tradeoffs among the variance of the motions the variance of the angular velocity or the torque and the average of the output power keywords ocean current turbine model predictive control floating system marine renewable energy 1 introduction ocean current energy is a promising power resource for japan since the kuroshio current one of the strongest ocean currents in the world passes near the japanese coast ihi corporation and new energy and industrial technology development organization nedo orporation and i dem 2019 have developed a twin turbine submerged floating system ttsfs using a single point mooring for harvesting the kuroshio energy van zwieten et al van zwieten et al 2006a also proposed a floating twin turbine concept with the single mooring system similar concepts are reported by several researchers for example in chen et al 2016 and shirasawa et al 2016 the floating system can be adopted for the deep water regions where the ocean current flows and the single mooring system has a weather vaning function which helps that the turbine is always facing the inflow direction the floating system is also utilized for energy harvesting from tidal currents for example orbital marine power limited http www scotrenewable 2019 is credited with pioneering floating tidal stream turbines clarke et al 2007 and clarke et al 2009 utilized a contra rotating turbine to minimize the size of floater their concept has been evolved into a full scale device and has been tested by nautricity limited http www nautricity co 2019 other types of floating systems have been proposed and their motions have been analyzed by several researchers for example in guo et al 2018 and barbarelli et al 2018 the floating system has another advantage that the turbine can be closer to the sea surface where the current speed is usually faster than near the seafloor see for example winkel et al 2002 and imamura et al 2019 however the turbulence of the current and ocean wave effects see for example imamura et al 2019 induce unsteady motions in the floating system thus it is preferable to utilize motion control for the submerged floating system whereas surface floating systems i e http www scotrenewable 2019 and guo et al 2018 do not need control because of strong static restoring forces in the case of submerged floating systems control of buoyancy and thrust forces are used to sustain the turbine at a proper position beneath the sea surface where the overall vertical position of the system is determined by a balance among the thrust force on the turbine the drag force on the floater the device buoyancy and the mooring force asymmetric motions are induced in realistic flow since the turbulence is not symmetric and should be controlled moreover in case of the twin turbine concept the asymmetric motion is more prominent since the inflow velocity is not exactly the same for each turbine van zwieten et al van zwieten et al 2006b proposed to use wing tips and a canard fin to control the pitch and the roll motion as well as the vertical position barbarelli et al 2018 used a rudder and an elevator to control both the symmetric and asymmetric motions ihi s system in nagaya et al 2014 uses blade pitch control to reduce asymmetric motions instead of using a wing shaped control fin since this control system is already implemented for increasing the output power in addition takeda et al 2013 found that the thrust force induced by turbines is the dominant force in determining the motion of the system thus utilizing blade pitch control for the motion control should be more efficient than the wing shaped fin system which requires an additional device and control system it is well known that blade pitch control and generator torque control are utilized to increase the quality and the quantity of output power as shown in reviews of recent control methodology for wind turbines in njiri et al njiri and söffker 2016 and menezes et al 2018 and for tidal turbines in qian et al 2019 therefore using blade pitch control and torque control motions of the ttsfs and the output power fluctuations can be mitigated simultaneously the aim of this study is to show the possibility to mitigate motions of the ttsfs and fluctuations of the output power simultaneously with blade pitch control and torque control of the generator using a multi input multi output control system the model predictive control mpc maciejowski 2002 is one suitable methodology for this purpose since the algorithm can easily handle constraints on inputs and outputs thus mpc is utilized in the present study although the shape and the configuration are different mpc was used for a floating wind turbine to mitigate structural load by minimizing yawing and pitching moments on the rotor by raach et al 2014 chaaban et al chaaban and fritzen 2014 used mpc for both reducing blade fatigue and damping platform motions of floating wind turbines similar work has been reported in mirzaei et al 2013 where a lidar measurement is used as an input to a feed forward controller in section 2 the mathematical model of a simulation used in the study are explained and the condition of inflow are mentioned a method of control based on mpc is proposed in section 3 and results on case studies using the proposed control method are discussed in section 4 2 mathematical modeling 2 1 full scale ttsfs the main body of the full scale ttsfs is composed of two pods which contain a generator and its control system and a cross beam which connects the two pods although the prototype system introduced in orporation and i dem 2019 mounts a buoyancy control system on the center of cross beam the full scale ttsfs is planned to store it in both pods to achieve a concise appearance and to minimize the structural weight and cost of the main body as a result it has a relatively small cross beam and the forces acting on the main body are dominated by the turbine thrust weight and buoyancy of the main body and the mooring line tension rather than the lift acting on the cross beam as mentioned previously the rated flow velocity of the full scale system is planned to be 1 5 m s the diameter of turbine blade is approximately 43 m to achieve the rated output of 0 95 mw for each turbine although the applicable water depth ranges from 100 m to 1000 m the water depth is assumed to be 500 m in this study although the detail is slightly changed the original plan of the ttsfs are found in takagi et al 2012 fig 1 shows the top view and the back view of the full scale ttsfs and the principal dimensions are listed in table 1 2 2 motion simulator the motion simulator has been developed and validated with experimental results by takeda et al 2013 which can simulate nonlinear 6 dof motions of the ttsfs with rotating twin turbines the equations of motion for the main body of the system are fully coupled with equations of rotations for two turbine rotor the ttsfs is moored by the v shaped single mooring system which is also coupled with the motions of the main body the differences between a y shaped mooring system and a v shaped mooring system is the connecting point and two mooring lines are connected at the anchor point in v shaped system the hydrodynamic force on the turbine blades are estimated by the blade element momentum bem theory see for example vaz et al 2011 the inflow velocity for each cross section of the blade takes the influence of relative current velocity caused by the turbulence including wave effects the velocity profile and the motion of the main body into account in addition the added mass of the turbine is considered based on the relative acceleration for each cross section assuming that the blade is a flat plate although the effect of added mass is negligibly small for the normal motion hydrodynamic forces on the main body such as the wave force the added mass the wave damping force the vortex induced drag force the surface friction and the lift force are considered where the former three are estimated by potential theory and later three are estimated from a model experiment it is mentioned that the mooring line is assumed to be a synthetic fiber since the ttsfs is moored at 500 m deep sea matsuda et al 2011 developed and validated a mooring simulator based on the lumped mass method which is adopted by the simulator in addition to the above mentioned mathematical models a model of the drive train is newly adopted by the simulator for simulating the effect of moment of inertia of the generator the turbine drive train is assumed to be represented by the following equation 1 i r i m a 2 i e ω q a q g where q is the torque on the turbine q g the torque on the generator i r the moment of inertia of the turbine rotor i m the added moment of inertia i e the moment of inertia of the generator ω the rate of rotation of the turbine rotor and a the gear ratio it is noted that block letters are vectors i e it has two components for example q q l q r where l and r denote the left turbine and the right turbine respectively it is also noted that the influences of the overall electrical system of the generator and the twisting rigidity of the drive shaft should be considered for performing more accurate simulations it is noted that the asymmetric motions of the ttsfs are quite unique which are mainly caused by the v shaped single point mooring system the v shaped mooring lines are connected to two pods and the anchor point see fig 1 and fig a1 the roll yaw and sway motions at the center of gravity of the main body are basically coupled with each other once there is a roll motion at the center of gravity i e heave motion for each pod the surge motion for each pod is induced since the heave motion of each pod is coupled with the surge motion of the pod because of the mooring as a result the yaw motion at the center of gravity occurs the thrust force on the turbine rotor is perpendicular to the rotor surface and thus the thrust vector has a certain angle with the x axis according to the yaw motion which induces a horizontal force and the sway motion the motion characteristics due to the y shaped mooring system is basically the same as far as the linearized equation shown in appendix a is valid 2 3 environmental conditions the ocean current is believed to be a stable energy source for the electrical power generation however it has fluctuations which are reported by for example kiyomatsu etc kiyomatsu et al 2014 fluctuations due to tides is major reason of low frequency fluctuations which can be controlled with buoyancy control on the contrary higher frequency fluctuations due to the turbulence are not controlled with buoyancy control and thus blade pitch control should be utilized since blade pitch control is focused on in the present work we limit the frequency range of the fluctuations from 0 00167 hz to 0 2 hz it is supposed that the main fluctuations in this frequency range is due to the turbulence of the flow therefore the spectrum of the fluctuated velocity is supposed to correspond to the inertial range which is represented as 2 s u f c f 5 3 where s u f is the spectrum of fluctuated velocity f the frequency of the fluctuation c a coefficient varying with the turbulent intensity the turbulence intensity is one of important parameters when we evaluate the motion of the main body and the fluctuation of the output power imamura et al 2019 showed that the turbulence intensity of the ocean current near kuchinosima is about 0 1 which is based on the duration of 10 min we use this value in this study another important parameter is the spatial coherence because the asymmetric motion is mainly induced by the difference of the inflow velocity between two turbines pyakurel et al 2017 presented a numerical modeling of turbulence of the ocean current they used the davenport model initially proposed for wind modeling which is described by an exponential function with a decay parameter c 3 γ 2 exp c f r u where γ is the coherence r the distance u the average of the flow imamura et al imamura and takagi 2019 reported the decay parameter of ocean current measured near kuchinoshima we used a typical decay parameter c 8 which is based on imamura s result to know the influence of the coherence on simultaneous control of motion and output power the numerical modeling proposed by pyakurel et al 2017 is used to generate the turbulent flow for the motion simulation some numerical examples of the turbulent flow and motions of the ttsfs based on the numerical modeling are found in kanoh and takagi 2018 3 control 3 1 control strategies the ttsfs has two control systems for controlling motions of the main body one is blade pitch control which is used not only for motion control but also control of generating power the other buoyancy control is used for slow symmetric motions which are mainly caused by a slow variation of the inflow velocity due to for example the tidal flow gonoji et al 2013 showed the motion of ttsfs at the time of startup and an accident they concluded that buoyancy control is not enough to keep the submerged depth because it consumes energy and the response is slow and a combination with blade pitch control improves controllability it is mentioned that ihi s prototype is controlled with blade pitch control so that motions of the main body should keep within a certain limit since the safety is the priority of the project thus they didn t try to maximize the output power and safe operation simultaneously nagaya 2018 in this paper we try to maximize the output power while motions of the main body are kept at a certain level in addition the fluctuation of the output power is reduced as much as possible it is mentioned again that in realistic control the slow movement is controlled by the buoyancy control system so the controllable range of frequency will be wider the generator control system is usually used for maximize the output power it is also utilized for motion control of the ttsfs in the present study since it can change the thrust force on the turbine mpc is used for the present study since it is suitable for a multi input and multi output control with restrictions as mentioned previously the control system used here should satisfy this requirement and many restrictions such as the range of blade pitch angle the rotational speed of the blade pitch angle the output power limit and so on 3 2 simplified linear mathematical model in order to utilize mpc a linear mathematical model is necessary to represent the motion of the main body and turbines although it is possible to obtain a linear mathematical model directly from fully coupled nonlinear motion equation it is complex and time consuming for utilizing in the mpc algorithm therefore we obtained linearized equations of motion at first and then the linear mathematical model was obtained using the linearized equation of motion the derivation of the linearized equations of motion is shown in appendix a the linearized equation of motion is valid only if the motion is small however the target motions for controlling are small and the main body is close to the equilibrium position in a normal operation considering small variations around an operating point the following linear mathematical model for mpc is obtained where the thrust force and the moment on the drive shaft are linearized following their characteristic curve obtained by the bem 4 m m 11 sin 2 θ 0 m 33 cos 2 θ 0 l 2 δ θ n 11 sin 2 θ 0 t s u m v sin 2 θ 0 l 2 δ θ t d i f v b l sin 2 θ 0 δ ψ t d i f v b l sin θ

inflow velocity at the center of turbine q g s u m the sum of the torque on the generator and δ denotes a small variation the pitch angle is common to all blades on a rotor it is noted that n m m except for n 11 are omitted because n m m is originated from the drag force which is proportional to the square of the velocity variation it is also mentioned that the inflow velocity is assumed to be measured by an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv at the center of turbine with the sampling speed of 0 1 s however the measurement error is not considered although mpc can control multi output it is preferable to reduce the number of control outputs the heave and the yaw are selected as the output parameters since the heave is coupled with the surge and the yaw is coupled with the sway and the roll variations of the heave δ h and the yaw δ ϕ are calculated from δ θ δ ψ and δ φ as 8 δ h δ ϕ δ θ l sin θ 0 δ ψ sin θ 0 δ φ cos θ 0 using these equations a state space model is described as 9 x k 1 a x x k a u u k a d d k 10 y k b x x k b u u k where a x a u a d b x and b u are the system matrices x k the state vector u k the control input d k the measurable disturbance and y k the output vector x k y k and u k in the control system are defined as 11 x k δ θ δ θ δ ψ δ ψ δ φ δ φ δ ω δ β δ q g t 12 y k δ h δ ϕ δ ω δ q g t 13 u k δ β ci δ q g ci t 14 d k δ v t where p denotes the output power of the generator β ci and q g ci represent the control input of the blade pitch angle and the generator torque respectively which are calculated in the mpc controller for the sake of simplicity the actuator models are assumed to be represented by a first order response model as 15 δ β 1 τ β δ β ci δ β 16 δ q g 1 τ g δ q g ci δ q g where τ β and τ g are the time constants which are chosen to be 0 1 s the reference value of the generator is based on the command value which is obtained by the maximum power tracking hansen et al 2005 the control domain is divided into three regions based on the angular velocity of the generator ω g when ω g 0 94 ω g r the command value q g c is given by 17 q g c π ρ r 5 c p m a x 2 a 3 λ o p t 3 η ω g 2 where c p m a x is the maximum power coefficient λ o p t denotes the optimum tip speed ratio which gives the maximum power coefficient and ω g r is the rated angular velocity of the generator when ω g r ω g the command value is restricted so that it doesn t exceed the rated power p r thus the command value is obtained as 18 q g c p r ω g when 0 94 ω g r ω g ω g r the command value is calculated by the linear interpolation between the command values for ω g 0 94 ω g r and ω g ω g r the rated angular velocity and the power are assumed to be 600 rpm and 1000 kw respectively in this work the output vector y k is defined as the difference between the current value and a reference value the reference values for the heave and the yaw are 50 m and 0 rad respectively which are the operation position the reference value for the angular velocity is chosen to be ω 0 v λ o p t r so that the turbine works at the optimum tip speed ratio where r denotes the radius of the rotor the reference value for the generator torque q gc is determined according to the maximum power tracking method mentioned above where ω 0 is used for the maximum power tracking as an input angular velocity since the efficiency of turbine is sensitive to the blade pitch angle a constraint is imposed on the variation of the blade pitch angle the variation of the generator torque is also subjected to a constraint which is determined so that the generator torque does not exceed 110 of the rated torque constrains on variations of the blade pitch angle δ β ci and the generator torque δ q g ci are expressed as 19 1 0 deg δ β ci 1 0 deg q g 0 δ q g ci 0 1 q g 0 where q g 0 denotes the rated torque of the generator which is 15 9 knm the rate of blade pitch angle is also restricted because of the limitation of the pitch control mechanism the restriction is expressed as 20 0 5 deg s δ β ci 0 5 deg s according to maciejowski 2002 the cost function u k for the optimization is generally defined as the following equation 21 min u ˆ k i k i 0 1 n c 1 u k i 1 n p y ˆ k i k q 2 i 2 i 0 n c 1 u ˆ k i k r 2 i 2 i 0 n c 1 u ˆ k i k r 2 u i 2 numerical simulations have been performed in matlab simulink by the nonlinear simulator mentioned in section 2 2 in order to get derivatives of f and q in equations 4 7 the thrust coefficient and the power coefficient are approximated by a cubic curve the sampling time of mpc is chosen to be 0 1 s while the sampling time for the nonlinear motion simulator is 0 01 s 3 3 pid controllers a pid controller is designed as a reference controller the pid controller is designed to control the heave the yaw and the generator torque with δ β and δ q g the same as the mpc controller however control is performed independently the gain factors of the pid controller are tuned so that the output vector x δ h δ ϕ δ q g becomes as small as possible although the pid controller cannot take the restrictions into account the restrictions on the blade pitch angle is satisfied compulsory in the motion simulator 4 results and discussions the mpc controller is tuned so that the output vector is almost equivalent to that of pid control with the similar magnitude of the control input the weight of mpc controller tuned is hereinafter referred to as the baseline weight fig 2 shows a comparison of motions among no control pid control and mpc control with baseline weights when control is not adapted a large drift motion is observed in sway however it is usually returned with a very long period about 1 h one of important aim for motion control is to prevent such a large motion which may affect the integrity of the mooring system or in the worst case may trigger the device to capsize it is apparent that both pid control and mpc prevent the large drift motion in the sway it is also mentioned that motion control is not applied directly to the sway but the yaw this means that yaw control is effective for other asymmetric motions similarly heave control affects not only the heave but also the surge and the pitch on the other hand the effect of mpc on the short period fluctuations is not apparent the reduction of short period fluctuations will be tried later fig 3 shows a comparison of the blade pitch angle between pid control and mpc since the baseline weight for mpc is tuned so that the magnitude of output vectors is almost identical to the pid the magnitude of the blade pitch angle is almost the same however the time history of mpc result is not sinusoidal while the pid results is almost a sinusoidal curve it is supposed that mpc reflects an interaction between blade pitch control and generator torque control fig 4 shows comparisons of the generator torque the generator s angular velocity and the output power upper figures show that the upper limit of pid control is smaller than that of mpc the reason is considered that the maximum command value of the generator is 15 9 knm and pid controller adheres to this value on the other hand the restriction of mpc is not subject to the torque itself but the variation of torque which is 10 of this value therefore mpc gives higher torque however it does not exceed 110 of the maximum command value regarding the variation width pid control seems smaller than mpc however the difference is not apparent the variance of time histories will be discussed in the end of this section the middle figures show the angular velocity of the turbine it is observed that the variation width of mpc is narrower than pid control this is natural since the angular velocity in pid control is not controlled while the angular velocity is one of components of the cost function in mpc the average of mpc is lower than that of pid control because the average of torque is larger than pid control the output power is shown in the lower figures despite controlling both the angular velocity and the torque the variation of mpc output power is not small compared with that of pid control this suggests that the variation of output power should be included in the cost function to reduce the fluctuation range of the output power it is noted that the output power in fig 4 is obtained after applying the transmission efficiency of 0 95 to the generator output power in order to investigate possibilities of mpc several trials are made by changing the baseline weights the trials include minimization of the yaw the angular velocity and the output power weights for the minimization of the yaw are shown in table 2 as a ratio to the baseline weights it is not easy to obtain the general methodology for tuning of the best weights because number of parameters in the output vector is larger than that in the control input thus only case studies for demonstrating possibility of mpc are shown here firstly the reduction of the yaw is chosen the weight for the yaw is increased as 6 times larger than the baseline weights to minimize the yaw since blade pitch control is more direct to change the thrust force than generator torque control the motion of blade pitch angle easily becomes aggressive thus a larger weight is applied for the control input value of blade pitch angle on the contrary the weight for the generator torque is reduced to 1 10 of the baseline weight and controlling the yaw motion becomes more important in the controller the result of yaw motion is shown in fig 5 in which the yaw motion with weights in table 2 is compared with the results of baseline weights where results of no control and pid control are shown as references it is obvious that the fluctuating range of mpc with the weights minimizing the yaw is smallest and it is less than 1 2 of that with the baseline weights on the other hand since blade pitch control directly induce the yaw moment the variation of the blade pitch angle is large compared to that in the case of baseline weights that is shown in fig 6 it is observed that the change of blade pitch angle is aggressive in spite of larger weight applied here than the baseline weight it is noted that in order not to spoil the resultant yaw motion reduction the restriction of blade pitch angle is extended to 2 to allow a large amplitude of blade pitch the change of generator torque is also effective to reduce the yaw thus the range of variation of the generator torque is large compared to that in the case of baseline weights fig 7 shows a comparison of time history of the generator torque between the baseline weights and the yaw minimizing weights an aggressive change of the generator torque in the case of yaw minimizing weights is obvious however it does not exceed the upper limit the next trial is to reduce the variation width of the angular velocity table 3 shows the weights for minimizing the variation width of the angular velocity a larger weight is applied to the variation of angular velocity δ ω on the other hand a smaller weight is applied to the variation of generator torque a large weight for the blade pitch angle is used again to suppress an aggressive change of the angle since the aggressive change induces motions of the ttsfs and the large motion usually does not give a good result for the fluctuation of the angular velocity in addition the definition of the reference value of the angular velocity is slightly changed as ω 0 v λ o p t r where the time average of inflow velocity v is used instead of instantaneous value of v t fig 8 shows a comparison of the time history of the angular velocity between the baseline weights and the weights minimizing the angular velocity although the weights minimizing the variation width of the angular velocity is smaller than the baseline weights the difference is not obvious this suggests that to reduce the variation width of the angular velocity is not easy since an aggressive change of the blade pitch angle does not give a good result a large weight for the blade pitch is used as stated above fig 9 shows that the time history of minimizing the angular velocity variation case is far from periodic and sometimes it shows abrupt changes or keeps a large angle though the large change is limited by the restriction of the mpc controller a correlation between the motions of the ttsfs and the angular velocity is supposed to be one of reasons why the time history shows such a strange behavior it is found that when we reduce the weight for the blade pitch angle the change of angle becomes more aggressive and the resultant motions sometimes become infinitely large this fact also suggests that minimizing the variation width of the angular velocity is challenging a time history of the generator torque in the case of the weights minimizing the variation of the angular velocity is shown in fig 10 it is obvious that the variation width of the torque is large compared to that in the case of baseline weights the violent change of the generator torque causes a large variation of the output power thus minimizing the variation of the angular velocity is not a good strategy to reduce the variation width of the output power finally minimizing the variation width of the output power was attempted the weights for minimizing the variation of the output power is shown in table 4 the variation of power is included in the output vector instead of the generator torque to minimize it the variation of power δ p is defined as 22 δ p q g 0 δ ω ω 0 δ q g it is noted that the vector notation is not used in equation 22 in order to avoid complex expression however the same definition is applied to both the right and left turbines it is also noted that the reference value of the angular velocity ω 0 is the same as that in the case of baseline weights but a different definition of the reference value of the turbine torque is used i e the instantaneous value of the angular velocity ω is used as the input of maximum power tracking process instead of ω 0 the output vector y k in this trial is defined as 23 y k δ h δ ϕ δ ω δ p t the weighs for the output vector are almost the same as the baseline weights except for the angular velocity if the weight of angular velocity is zero the variation of output power is dramatically reduced while other weights are not sensitive a large weight is used for the blade pitch angle since the aggressive change of the angle does not give a good result as observed in the other trials fig 11 shows the time history of the output power the variation width of output power with the output variation minimizing weights is very small compared to that with baseline weights it is noted that this result only shows the possibility of smoothing since the influence of the electrical controller on the generator torque is not considered in this work however one reason can be considered to be that the rotation of the heavy rotor can store a large amount of kinetic energy the average power seems smaller than the case of baseline weights it is supposed that the definition of reference torque makes the average power smaller however if the original definition of the reference value is used the computation sometimes failed when we used the variation of power as a component of output vector thus it is considered that there is a trade off between the variation width of the output power and the average output power the average and the variance of the time histories will be discussed at the end of this section fig 12 shows the time histories of the angular velocity and the generator torque the variations of the angular velocity and the generator torque are not small however the resultant output power is almost constant it is interesting that the average angular velocity is higher than other cases one reason is that the weight for the variation of the angular velocity is zero and as a result the average angular velocity is free from the reference value which is around 0 43 rad s in this simulation the other reason is considered is that if the angular velocity is larger than the rated value the output power is restricted to the maximum power while the generator torque is able to change according to other control requirements i e the reduction of the motion it is noted that the change of blade pitch angle is small and cyclic throughout the simulation table 5 shows variances of the motions the generator torque the angular velocity and the output power the variances support the above mentioned discussions the baseline case is slightly better than pid control for all items except for the generator torque and the output power however the improvement is not obvious in the case of yaw minimum weights the variance of yaw is greatly improved but the variances of the generator torque and the angular velocity becomes worse when the minimization of the fluctuation range is tried the variance of the angular velocity is improved but the variances of other variables becomes worse the weights minimizing the variation of output power case shows that the variance of the output power is very small and the variances of the roll the pitch and the yaw are slightly better than that of baseline case however the average output power becomes lower which is shown in table 6 regarding the average output power the cases of the baseline weights the yaw minimum weights and the output power variation minimum weights result in slightly higher power output than the pid case summarizing the results there is a tradeoff between the variance of motions and the variances of the angular velocity and the generator torque in addition there is another tradeoff between the variances and the average of the output power 5 conclusions mpc is utilized to mitigate the motions of the ttsfs and the fluctuation of the output power the simulation of control is performed using a motion simulator which can simulate nonlinear 6 dof motions of the ttsfs coupled with motions of twin turbines and the v shaped single mooring system the simulation is performed in coherent turbulent flow four sets of the mpc controller weights were applied to show the possibility of the mitigation the baseline weights case shows the possibility to reduce the variances of the motions of the ttsfs and the angular velocity of the turbine at the same time but the advantage of mpc is not obvious compared to pid control the other three trials show the possibilities to reduce the yaw motion the fluctuation width of the angular velocity and the variation of the output power however it is found that there is a tradeoff between the variance of motions and the variances of the angular velocity and the generator torque in addition there is another tradeoff between the variances and the average of the output power summarizing the results it is concluded that motion control is necessary to prevent a large asymmetric motion which may affect the integrity of the mooring system or in the worst case may trigger the device to capsize also it is concluded that mpc has an ability to mitigate motions of the ttsfs and the fluctuation of the output power simultaneously however there are tradeoffs among the variance of the motions the variance of the angular velocity or the torque and the average of the output power since this work shows the possibility to mitigate the variations based on the limited trials in order to establish the optimum controller impacts on the cost of energy due to the fluctuation of each variable should be considered which gives a solution for the above mentioned tradeoffs this may be the future work credit authorship contribution statement atsushi satoh conceptualization validation

ordinate system fig a1 the flow is assumed to be parallel to the x axis and it flows in the negative x direction where o x y z coordinate system is fixed on the main body of the ttsfs as shown in figure a1 the ttsfs is decomposed into a main body two turbines and a v shape mooring system in the nonlinear motion simulator and the motion of each component induced by a fluctuation of the flow is estimated with independent sets of motion equation the equations of motion for the translational motion and the rotational motion of the main body are represented as a1 m b v bg ω b v bg e frdr e frdl e ffb e fmb a2 h b ω b h b e mrdr e mrdl e frdr r tr e frdl r tl e mfb e mbb a3 h b n e bn i b n ω b n where m b is the mass of the main body v bg the translational velocities of the main body ω b the angular velocities of the main body h b the angular momentum of the main body e bn the basis in o x y z co ordinate systems on the main body i b n the rotational inertia of the main body ω b n the components of ω b hereinafter those with a number in the subscript represent a component of vectors the external forces and moments include the hydrodynamic force e ffb and moment e mfb the mooring force e fmb and the buoyancy moment e mbb the external forces and moments also include the drive shaft reaction force e frd and the drive shaft reaction moment e mrd where r and l in the subscript denote the right turbine and the left turbine respectively and r t represents the position of the turbine rotor it is noted that the shape and the weight distribution of main body are assumed to be vertically and laterally symmetry the 6dof turbine motions are separately estimated as a4 m t v tg ω t v tg e frd e fft a5 h t ω t h t e mrt e mft a6 h t n e tn i t n ω t n where m t is the mass of the turbine rotor v tg the translational velocities of the turbine rotor ω t the angular velocities of the turbine rotor h t the angular momentum of the turbine rotor e tn the basis in the turbine fixed co ordinate systems i t n the rotational inertia of the turbine rotor e fft the hydrodynamic force e mrt the turbine rotor moment e mft the hydrodynamic moment it is noted that the turbine rotor moment e mrt is identical to the drive shaft reaction moment e frd except for x component it is also noted that equations of a4 a5 and a6 are common for both the right and the left turbines and hereinafter r and l will be added to the subscript when we need to distinguish the right and left in order to obtain the linearized equation of motion the following assumptions are used since the frequency of turbine rotation is much higher than the frequency of typical body motion it is assumed that the instantaneous position of the turbine blade is ignorable and the shape of turbine rotor is modeled as a circular disc this assumption leads i t 2 i t 3 and e f f t 2 e f f t 3 0 another assumption is that the turbine force and moment in the linearized equation can be estimated with the relative fluid velocity at the center of turbine in addition since the fluctuation v of the inflow to the turbine is small compared to the average inflow velocity v 0 it is assumed that v v 0 o ε where ε 1 this assumption leads that the order of v bg ω b v tg ω t 2 ω t 3 is o ε similarly the fluctuation of the rate of rotation is considered to be o ε therefore the order of the sum of both rotation is ω t 1 r ω t 1 l o ε since the left and the right turbines rotate opposite direction summing up the equations of translational motion for the main body and two turbines and neglecting small terms of o ε 2 the linearized equation of translational motion is obtained as a7 m b 2 m t v bg e ffb e fmb e b 1 e f f t 1 r e f f t 1 l where v bg is the velocity at the center of gravity when the main body and two turbines are combined and it is represented as a8 v bg v bg 2 m t m b 2 m t l a e b 2 ω b 3 e b 3 ω b 2 the transformation of equation a5 into the main body coordinate is not strait forward eliminating the small terms of o ε 2 the left hand side of equation a5 is altered as a9 h t ω t h t n e tn i t n ω t n ω t 1 e t 2 ω t 3 e t 3 ω t 2 i t 1 i t 2 transforming the basis vector and the turbine rotation to the main body coordinate equation a9 is represented as a10 h t ω t h t e b 1 i t 1 ω t 1 n 2 3 e bn i t n ω b n ω t 1 e b 2 ω b 3 e b 3 ω b 2 i t 1 i t 2 summing up equation a2 and a10 and omitting the small terms of o ε 2 the equation of rotational motion for the combined body is obtained as a11 h b 2 n e bn i t n ω b n e b 1 i t 1 ω r ω l e mfb e mbb e b 1 e m r t 1 r e m r t 1 l e m r d 1 r e m r d 1 l e m f t 1 r e m f t 1 l e frdr r tr e frdl r tl where ω t 1 ω b 1 ω is used ω is the rate of rotation of the turbine rotor as defined in section 2 on the other hand since the lowest order of equation a5 is o 1 eliminating small terms of o ε an equation of the turbine rotation is obtained as a12 i t 1 ω e m r t 1 e m f t 1 it is noted that i t 1 i r i m a 2 i e ω a q g e m r t 1 q e m f t 1 and a q g e m r d 1 and thus equation a12 is equivalent to equation 1 eliminating small terms in a4 and substituting it together with a12 into a11 the equation of rotational motion for the combined body is obtained as a13 h b e mfb e mbb e b 1 e m r d 1 r e m r d 1 r e b 3 r t 2 r e f f t 1 r e f f t 1 l where h b is represented as a14 h b n e bn i b n 2 i t n

of motion for the combined body it is noted that the equation of rotation for the combined body a13 is defined around the new center of gravity the hydrodynamic force and moment are given as a15 e ffb n e bn m n n v b g n n n n v b g n e mfb n e bn m ν ν ω b n n ν ν ω b n ν n 3 where m n n the added mass and the added moment of inertia n n n the damping coefficient it is noted that m m n and n m n m n are omitted because the shape of the main body is assumed to be symmetric since the main body is upright at the beginning of the simulation the basis vectors in equation a13 and a14 coincide with the basis in the earth fixed coordinate system and the direction of basis vectors does not change in the linearized equations therefore it is convenient to define a new notation of the inertia moment for the combined body i n as a16 i 4 i b 1 2 i t 1 2 m t r t 2 2 i 5 i b 2 m b l a 2 2 i t 2 2 m t r t 1 2 i 6 i b 3 m b l a 2 2 i t 3 m t r t 1 2 r t 2 2 since the mooring lines give constraints to the main body motions it is convenient to use a new coordinate system o ξ η ζ that is fixed on the seabed with the initial mooring angle θ 0 the v shaped mooring line is on the ξ η plane and the origin o corresponds to the anchor point if we assume that the mooring lines are connected at a point x z 0 and stretching of the mooring lines is negligible the main body motions except for the pitch motion can be represented by rotational motions θ φ and ψ and the linearized constraints are automatically satisfied as a17 v b 1 v b 3 tan θ 0 l θ sin θ 0 ω b 1 sin θ 0 ω b 3 cos θ 0 v b 2 l φ using the new coordinate system the mooring force and the buoyancy induced moment are represented as a18 e fmb b w e b 1 θ e b 2 φ sin θ 0 e b 3 cot θ 0 θ e mbb e b 3 b g b φ sin θ 0 ψ cos θ 0 where b is the buoyancy w the overall weight and b g the distance between the center of buoyancy and the center of gravity transferring equation a7 and a13 to o ξ η ζ coordinate system the linearized equations

method es fem and smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method es fem sph is proposed for solving fsi problems where the edge based smoothed finite element method is used to model the movement and deformation of structures and the smoothed particle hydrodynamics is used to model the fluid flow in es fem the gradient smoothing technique is applied over the smoothing domain and it can effectively overcome the overly stiff effect in conventional fem model some correction algorithms including density correction kernel gradient correction and particle shift technique are integrated into the sph method to improve computational stability and accuracy a virtual particle coupling scheme is used to implement the coupling of es fem and sph with complex geometry interface as es fem is more accurate than conventional fem and it is expected that this es fem sph coupling approach should be superior than existing fem sph coupling approaches a number of test examples with fsi are investigated with the presented es fem sph and compared with results from other approaches including fem sph from the obtained numerical results we can conclude that the es fem sph coupling approach is effective to simulate fsi problems keywords edge based smoothed finite element method es fem smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph fluid structure interaction fsi 1 introduction fsi is a significant field in aerospace marine engineering biomechanics and other applications bennet and edwards 1998 van loon and van de vosse 2010 taylor and figueroa 2009 in recent decades a plenty of numeric methods have been proposed for fsi problems among which the grid based method occupies the dominant position in numerical research the lagrangian grid based methods such as the finite element method fem strang et al 1973 are commonly used for structural modeling while the eulerian grid based methods such as the finite difference method fdm brandimarte 1960 the finite volume method fvm versteeg and malalasekera 1995 and finite element method fem strang et al 1973 are classically used for fluid modeling there are some ways for coupling eulerian grid and lagrangian grid such as the immersed boundary method ibm peskin 2002 and arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method donea et al 1982 hirt et al 1974 however these methods are time consuming for tracking moving boundaries or interfaces donea et al 1982 hirt et al 1974 morinishi and fukui 2012 peskin 2002 it is very attractive to solve the fsi problem under the unified lagrangian description because it can deal with the moving interface naturally recently the fsi problem is solved by coupling the finite element method with mesh free methods fourey et al 2010 groenenboom and cartwright 2009 hu et al 2014 long et al 2017 vuyst et al 2005 yang et al 2012 zhang and wan 2018 and the coupling approaches leverage the advantages of convenience of mesh free methods to simulate hydrodynamics and robustness of fem to solve structural dynamics the fem has become a powerful and effective technique for numeric simulation in science and engineering however some shortcomings also exist in the conventional fem it is well known that the overly stiff characteristic of the conventional finite element models often leads to a significant reduction in the accuracy of numerical solutions liu and quek 2003 certainly the fem sph approaches have the overly stiff characteristic because of conventional finite element model thus it is important to develop an effective numerical technique for dealing with this issue the smoothed finite element method s fem was proposed by liu et al 2007a which is based on the gradient smoothing technique of mesh less method chen et al 2001 the gradient smoothing technique provides a good way to reduce the over stiffness liu 2008 a new class of smoothing methods have been developed that can effectively soften the numerical model such as cell based s fem cs fem liu et al 2007b nodal based s fem ns fem liu et al 2009b edge based s fem es fem liu et al 2009a and face based s fem fs fem nguyen thoi et al 2009 in addition thanks to the gradient smoothing technique smoothed point interpolation methods s pims have been proposed gui rong and gui yong 2013 liu and zhang 2008 and s pims are developed for fsi problems wang et al 2017 2018 zhang et al 2018 furthermore s fem is also utilized to fsi problems zhang et al proposed immersed s fem is fem to solve fsi problems zhang et al 2012 recently jiang et al proposed a sharp interface is fem for interactions between large deformation structures and incompressible flows the method has great application prospects for fsi problems jiang et al 2018 since the es fem provides more precise solutions than the traditional linear fem liu et al 2009a in this paper the es fem is used to model the structure domain the sph approach is a purely lagrangian mesh free approach which was originally developed by lucy 1977 and monaghan and gingold gingold and monaghan 1977 monaghan and gingold 1983 it is widely applied in astrophysics impact dynamics fluid mechanics and other fields recently han and hu used a uniform sph frame to modeling fluid structure interaction problems han and hu 2018 yang et al proposed an improved sph ebg element bending group method for interactions between free surface flows and flexible structures yang et al 2016 zhang et al reviewed the latest developments in sph methods and their typical applications in fsi problems zhang et al 2017 asai et al proposed a stabilized incompressible sph to simulate the free surface flow problems asai et al 2012 he et al 2020 used a finite particle method to modeling the solitary wave breaking over a slope in this article the sph approach is applied to solve the fluid domain the meshless property of sph approach eliminates the troubles caused by large deformations therefore sph is quite suitable to solve fluid flows with moving interfaces and free surfaces in the fem sph model the sph is used to solve the fluid domain and the fem is applied to solve the solid domain where the coupling strategy usually utilizes a pure lagrangian description in both media the fem sph coupling approach was firstly developed by attaway et al 1994 to investigate impact problems vuyst et al 2005 investigated fluid structure impact problems using an fem sph model the fem sph coupling approach can also be applied to interaction between elastic structures and free surface flow fourey et al 2010 groenenboom and cartwright 2009 hu et al 2014 yang et al 2012 the master slave schemes are utilized in most fem sph models and the contact forces are used to prevent particles from entering the element mesh attaway et al 1994 groenenboom and cartwright 2009 hu et al 2014 each coupling approach has its own specific feature for the modeling of complex fsi problems some fem sph coupling approaches without contact algorithm are also proposed fourey et al 2010 long et al 2017 yang et al 2012 fourrey et al fourey et al 2010 utilized the virtual particles coupling strategy to realize the fem sph model yang et al 2012 used monaghan type repulsive force to prevent the particles penetrate the element meshes long et al 2017 developed a virtual particle coupling scheme for fem sph model with complex geometry interface in which the virtual particles are produced through discretizing the truncated region of support domain of kernel function recently fourey et al 2017 proposed an efficient coupling scheme between sph and fem for violent fluid structure interaction modeling in this paper the coupling method of es fem and sph is proposed for simulating fsi problems and the virtual particles coupling scheme is used for the es fem sph model three node triangular elements are used to discretize the structure domain which is simple and flexible the particles are used to discretize the fluid domain and the fsi in es fem sph model is implemented through deploying virtual particles within es fem elements since es fem provides a more precise solution than traditional linear fem using the same constant strain triangular element it can be expected that es fem sph coupling model will be applicable to fsi problems comparisons between the es fem sph model and the fem sph coupling approach are given for several numerical examples the organization of this paper is as follows firstly the es fem to solve the solid domain is concisely introduced secondly the sph approach to solve hydrodynamics is briefly introduced thirdly the coupled es fem sph model is briefly described finally numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the es fem sph model 2 es fem formulations in this paper the es fem for solving the deformation and motion structure based on total lagrangian format is adopted and the structure is discretized by using linear triangular elements zhang and liu 2014 the smoothed deformation gradient smoothed green lagrange strain tensor and the smoothed second piola kirchhoff pk2 stress tensor are derived at the initial configuration in es fem the displacement u i s and the current spacial position x i s are approximated by 1 u i s n i u i i s 2 x i s n i x i i s where n i is the shape functions of es fem u i i s is the nodal displacement component of the node i and x i i s is the current spatial position of node i in es fem a set of non overlapping smoothing domains is needed to compute the field variable s smoothing gradient herein the es fem t3 settings are illustrated in fig 1 the smoothed displacement gradient of the smoothing domain ω k s is defined 3 u i j s 1 a k s ω k s u i s x j d ω where a k s is the area of the smoothing domain ω k s x j is the material coordinates applying a divergence theorem the smoothed deformation gradient can be derived by 4 u i j s 1 a k s γ k s u i s n j d γ 1 a k s γ k s n i u i i s n j d γ n i j u i i s where n j is the external normal vector of the smoothing domain boundary γ k s and n i j is the smoothed derivatives of shape function defined as 5 n i j 1 a k s γ k s n i n j γ the smoothed deformation gradient of the smoothing domain ω k s is given by 6 f i j 1 a k s γ k s u i s n j d γ δ i j u i j s δ i j where δ i j is the component of a unit tensor using the smoothed deformation gradient f i j it can easily construct the smoothed second piola kirchhoff stress tensor the smoothed green strain the smoothed nominal stress and so on using the explicit time integration based on the center difference algorithm the transient solutions of the nonlinear solid are obtained es fem formulations cui et al 2013 are given as 7 m i a i i f i i int f i i ext 8 f i i int ω 0 n i j p j i d ω 9 f i i ext ω 0 n i ρ 0 s b i d ω γ 0 t n i t i d γ where a i i is the acceleration for the node i m i is the lumped mass for the node i ρ 0 s is the initial density of solid f i i int and f i i ext is equivalent internal force and external force respectively p j i is the smoothed nominal stress t i and b i is surface force and body force respectively and γ 0 t is the boundary of traction moreover the mass damping is considered the mass damping matrix is 10 c ω 0 η ρ 0 s n i n j d ω 0 where η is a damping coefficient two kinds of nonlinear constitutive models are adopted in this paper one is the saint venant kirchhoff constitutive model and the expression of strain energy density function is as follows 11 w 1 2 λ tr e 2 μ tr e 2 where e is the green strain tensor λ and μ are lamé constants the other model is mooney rivlin hyper elastic model treloar 1940 and the expression of strain energy density function is as follows 12 w c 01 j 1 3 c 10 j 2 3 1 2 κ j 3 1 2 where κ is the bulk modulus c 01 and c 10 are constants and j 1 j 2 j 3 are reduced invariants of the cauchy green deformation tensor 3 sph formulations 3 1 governing equations in this paper the working fluid is assumed incompressible and newtonian the weakly compressible sph wcsph method is used for modeling incompressible fluid flows this treatment actually assumes the incompressible fluid to be slightly or weakly compressible the mass conservation and momentum conservation equations are as follows 13 1 ρ d ρ d t v 0 14 d v d t 1 ρ p υ o 2 v f where t is the time ρ is the density of fluid v is the velocity vector υ o is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid p is the pressure and f is the body force applying the weakly compressible sph approach the discretization of governing equations can be written as 15 d ρ i d t ρ i j m j ρ j v i v j i w i j 16 d v i d t j m j p i ρ i 2 p j ρ j 2 i j i w i j f where m is the mass w is short for kernel function with a smooth length h and cubic spline kernel function monaghan et al 1985 is used in this paper is the monaghan artificial viscosity monaghan 1994 and 17 π i j α π c i j ρ i j h v i j x i j x i j 2 v i j x i j 0 0 v i j x i j 0 where α π is a free constant that depends on the problem c i j c i c j 2 is the mean numerical speed of sound ρ i j ρ i ρ j 2 is the average density x i j x i x j and v i j v i v j is the relative position and velocity of particles respectively the approximation of laminar viscous term is presented by morris morris et al 1997 which is as follows 18 υ o 2 v i j m j υ o i υ o j x i j i w i j ρ j x i j 2 η 2 v i j where η 0 1 h is a parameter that avoids the null denominator in this paper the laminar in addition the pressure is computed by the equation of state eos antoci et al 2007 and its expression is as follows 19 p c 2 ρ ρ 0 where c is a numerical speed of sound ρ 0 is a reference density to satisfy the weakly compressible condition the constraint c 10 max u max p max ρ 0 is usually adopted sun et al 2017 where u max and p max are the maximum expected velocity and pressure respectively this ensures that the density variations are below 1 in agreement with the weakly compressibility hypothesis in addition the speed of sound should not be too large which leads to too small time step 3 2 numerical treatment of sph in this paper the kgc kernel gradient correction density correction and pst particle shifting technique are combined to ameliorate the stability and accuracy in modeling fluid flow the kgc is used to improve the kernel gradient in sph approximation shao et al 2012 a corrected kernel gradient is obtained from taylor series expansion method for kgc technique in two dimensional spaces the new kernel gradient of the smoothing function i c w i j can be obtained as follows 20 i c w i j l x i i w i j 21 l x i j x j i w i j x i y j i w i j x i x j i w i j y i y j i w i j y i v j 1 as the pressure calculated by the equation of state the small random oscillation in density due to numerical high frequencies acoustic will lead to large random oscillation in pressure a correction algorithm for density developed by yildiz et al ozbulut et al 2013 is utilized to prevent pressure oscillation in this paper and it can be written as 22 ρ ˆ i ρ i ω j ρ i ρ j w i j j w i j where ρ ˆ i is the modified density and ω is a constant with a value of 1 0 in this paper the distribution of particles has a significant influence on the precision of sph model the highly disordered distribution of particles can seriously affect the calculation precision of sph and even make the calculation stop the pst is developed by xu et al lind et al 2012 xu et al 2009 to prevent disordered particle distributions in this article the virtual particles have different scales with fluid particle in order to deal with the different size particles on the interface the particle shifting vector is modified as long et al 2017 23 δ x i β j x i j x i j 3 r o 2 m j m i v max δ t and 24 r o j 1 n f x i j n f where δ x i is the particle shifting vector β is a parameter that depends on the problem and the value of β is set to 0 01 in this article r o is the average particle distance and n f is the number of adjacent fluid particles after the particle shifting is used for particles the field variable values at the new position should be modified using the taylor series interpolates and it can be written as 25 φ i φ i δ x i φ i where φ i and φ i are the general field variable at old position and new position respectively 4 coupling strategy of sph with es fem as shown in fig 2 the structure domain is simulated by es fem and the fluid domain is solved by sph approach as shown in fig 3 the virtual particle coupling strategy proposed by long et al 2017 is used in this paper in which kernel support domain s truncated region is divided into sub regions relating to interface segments and the sub regions are discretized to generate virtual particles then the interaction pairs between the particle and element can be established by using the corresponding virtual particles as illustrated in fig 3 a the truncated region is divided into sub regions of ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 in which ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 correspond with ab bc and cd separately as illustrated in fig 4 if the segment have a sub region of particle i there are three relative position relationships between the segment and fluid particle i after identifying the interaction pairs virtual particles are produced by discretizing sub region for each pair the method of producing virtual particles proposed by long et al 2017 is used in this paper based on boundary condition the physical variables of virtual particles can be given out by interpolation long et al 2017 as illustrated in fig 6 the sub region has been discretized into arches and triangles each triangle or arch has produced a virtual particle the virtual particle is situated in the center of the corresponding arch or triangle and the volume of a virtual particle is equivalent to the volume of corresponding arch or triangle according to the type of boundary conditions the velocity or pressure of virtual particles can be obtained for example as shown in fig 5 for the no slip boundary condition the velocity of virtual particle k is takeda et al 1994 26 v k v s v i d 2 d 1 v s where v k and v s are the velocity of the virtual particle k and the point s in segment hk respectively d 1 is the vertical distances between the fluid particle i and the segment d 2 is the distances between the virtual particle k and the segment hk moreover the density of the virtual particle is also obtained by the boundary condition if the boundary condition of pressure on the interface is enforced as p n s 0 the density of virtual particle is equal to the density of fluid particle if the pressure boundary condition should satisfy cauchy boundary condition p n s ρ 0 g n s the density of virtual particle is calculated based on equation of state and the density of fluid particle more information of virtual particle can be found in ref long et al 2017 the virtual particles are produced dynamically and automatically for each interaction pair of a segment and a fluid particle at each time step while the information of virtual particles can be obtained from the fluid particles and boundary segments based on boundary condition fig 6 shows an interaction pair of the fluid particle i and boundary segment mn the virtual particles are produced to calculate the interaction force the force f s m n t f i for the segment mn acting on the particle i is 27 f s m n t f i j ω m n p q f g j t f i m i j ω m n p q m j p i ρ i 2 p j ρ j 2 i w i j j ω m

triangular elements is 1082 and 640 for rigid part and elastic plate respectively and the initial particle spacing is set to be 0 0125m which corresponds to 12800 particles fig 8 shows the stress pressure fields at 0 5s both methods have provided smooth stress pressure fields fig 9 shows time histories of plate s midpoint deflection relating to three different spatial resolutions element size and the abbreviation es denotes mesh spacing for all examples as the overly stiff characteristic of the conventional fem models the magnitude of vertical displacement obtained by fem sph model is relatively small the displacements calculated by es fem sph model agree well with the theoretical static displacement fig 9 also shows the comparison with the results calculated by fem sph model by fourey et al 2017 and li et al leduc et al 2015 in their models the overly stiff characteristic is overcome with quadrilateral elements are used therefore the results obtain by fourey et al 2017 and li et al leduc et al 2015 are better than the fem sph model using triangular elements although the es fem sph model uses the triangular elements the results by es fem sph model es 0 0125m are superior with respect to those by sph fem solvers by li et al leduc et al 2015 as well as fourey et al 2017 fig 10 shows the convergence of vertical displacement error norm l 2 compared with the fem sph model es fem sph model can obtain better accuracy and convergence the results show that es fem sph model is more accurate than fem sph model 5 2 a hyper elastic gate under water pressure the deformation of a hyper elastic gate under water pressure has been studied experimentally and numerically by antoci et al 2007 at t 0 s the elastic gate is released the water begins to collapse and the elastic gate is deformed the initial configuration of model is shown in fig 11 the geometric dimensions are l 0 079m h 0 14m a 0 1m and s 0 005m separately the density of water is ρ 1000 kg m3 the numerical speed of sound is c 25 m s the viscous term approximation advised by morris morris et al 1997 is applied in this instance and the kinematic viscosity of fluid is υ f 10 6 m 2 s mooney rivlin model is utilized to model the elastic gate with material constant c 01 379310 3 n m 2 c 10 1327586 2 n m 2 and κ 18 97 mpa the elastic gate s density is ρ s 1100 kg m3 the acceleration of gravity is g 9 8 m s2 and air is ignored in simulations in fem sph and es fem sph models the number of triangular elements is 4960 and 936 for rigid part and elastic gate respectively and the initial particle spacing is set to be 0 001m which corresponds to 14000 particles the es fem sph results are compared to experimental and fem sph results as illustrated in fig 12 the elastic gate is deformed by the impulse of the fluid flow the shapes of the free surface and the elastic gate are comfortably simulated and the smooth pressure fields are obtained the sph method with correction algorithms can obtained smooth pressure field and it indicates that the correction algorithms are effective moreover the influences of the element and particle resolution on es fem sph model and fem sph model are studied as illustrated in fig 13 the abbreviation ps denotes fluid particle spacing for all examples respectively the elastic gate mesh spacing 0 0025m 0 00125m 0 001m corresponds to 134 512 and 936 elements separately the fluid particle spacing 0 0020m 0 0013m 0 001m corresponds to 3500 7875 and 14000 particles separately the horizontal displacements calculated by es fem sph method are closer to experimental results than those obtained by fem sph method because the fem with three node triangular element is over stiff the horizontal displacements obtained by fem sph model are relatively small especially for the coarse triangular elements the size of element is a critical issue to guarantee of numerical solution of fem sph using the constant strain triangular element because the es fem is softer than the fem with using the gradient smoothing technique the displacements obtained by es fem sph model are larger than those obtained by fem sph model it is noted that the es fem sph can produce numerical results with satisfactory accuracy even for coarse triangular elements 5 3 an elastic wall in a lid driven cavity flow the deformation of a hyper elastic wall at the bottom of a lid driven cavity filled with fluid is studied this study was originally studied by dunn dunne 2006 with the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian method it was then repeated and confirmed by zhao et al 2008 as shown in fig 14 a hyper elastic wall with height 0 5 cm and width 2 cm is located at lower bottom of a cavity with size 2 cm 2 cm and the space above is filled with fluid the upper cover of the cavity is driven by a spatial correlation velocity function 32 v x 0 5 sin 2 π x 0 6 x 0 0 0 3 1 x 0 3 1 7 sin 2 π x 2 0 0 6 x 1 7 2 0 cm s the other boundary conditions in the fluid region satisfy the no slip boundary conditions the density of fluid is ρ 1 0 g cm3 the dynamic viscosity of fluid is μ f 0 2 g cm s 2 neo hookean material is utilized for the hyper elastic wall with the material constants c 01 0 1 g cm s 2 c 10 0 and κ 0 and the density of the hyper elastic wall is ρ s 1 0 g cm3 the viscous term approximation advised by morris morris et al 1997 is applied in this case in fem sph and es fem sph models the number of triangular element is 524 and 820 for rigid part and hyper elastic wall respectively and the initial particle spacing is set to be 0 01 cm which corresponds to 30000 particles as shown in fig 15 the deformed hyper elastic wall reaches a steady state at t 8s and the fluid particles that are colored by velocity are presented and the deformation of hyper elastic wall obtained by fem sph model is less than that obtained by es fem sph model fig 16 shows the comparison of final position of fluid structure interface the deformation of hyper elastic wall calculated by es fem sph model is consistent with the reference result of ale method dunne 2006 however the deformation of hyper elastic wall obtained by fem sph model is quite different from the reference results moreover the effects of the element resolution on es fem sph model and fem sph model are studied as illustrated in fig 17 the es fem sph model can obtain satisfactory accuracy with coarse elements but the fem sph model is unreasonable especially for cases with coarse elements the reason is that the fem with triangular element is over stiff again this example also clearly demonstrates that the es fem sph method with triangular element is effective and accurate to solving fsi problems 5 4 an elastic beam in a fluid tunnel in this example an elastic beam placed in a fluid tunnel is analyzed and this example was simulated previously using immersed s fem is fem zhang et al 2012 as shown in fig 18 the length of the fluid tunnel is l 4 cm and the height is h 1 cm the thickness of the beam is a 0 04 cm and the length is b 0 8 cm at the bottom edge of the fluid domain the no slip boundary condition is assumed and at the top edge the velocity symmetric condition is applied at the left edge the inlet velocity is defined by 33 v x 1 5 2 y y 2 at the right edge only the reference pressure is set to be zero the fluid properties are given as ρ 1 0 g cm 3 and the dynamic viscosity of fluid is μ f 0 1 g cm s 2 the material properties of elastic beam are density ρ s 7 8 g cm3 young modulus e 10 5 g cm s 2 and poisson ratio υ s 0 3 the elastic beam adopts saint venant kirchhoff model the viscous term approximation advised by morris morris et al 1997 is applied in this case in fem sph and es fem sph models the number of triangular element is 1640 and 640 for rigid part and hyper elastic wall respectively and the initial particle spacing is set to be 0 01 cm which corresponds to 40482 particles as shown in fig 19 the particles that are colored by velocity and the deformation of the elastic beam are presented at different time steps the smooth velocity field are obtained by the sph method the effectiveness of sph method is demonstrated again fig 20 shows the time history of horizontal displacement at tip point b the different mesh spacing is used for flexible beam which the mesh spacing 0 0002m 0 0001m 0 00005m corresponds to 160 640 and 2560 elements separately the horizontal displacement obtained by fem sph model is unreasonable when the element spacing is set to 0 0002m and 0 0001m however the es fem sph model can obtain satisfactory accuracy even the element spacing is set to 0 0002m it indicates that the es fem sph model can use less number of elements than fem sph model and the es fem sph model is better than fem sph model fig 21 shows the stress contour at the steady state for the beam this case further indicates the es fem sph model behaves softer than fem sph model and provides more accurate solutions than the fem sph model using the same constant strain triangular elements 5 5 flow past a cylinder with an elastic beam the flow past a fixed cylinder with an elastic beam fsi2 defined by turek and hron 2007 is studied as illustrated in fig 22 the length of computational domain is l 2 50m and the height of computational domain is h 0 41m the circle s radius is r 0 05 and the center of circle is located at c 0 2 0 2 which is measured from the lower left corner of the domain the length and height of the elastic beam is l 0 35m and h 0 02m respectively the control point a is attached to the free end of beam as marked in fig 22 the elastic beam s material properties are poisson ratio υ s 0 4 young modulus e 1 4 106 n m2 and density ρ s 10000 kg m3 t the elastic beam adopts saint venant kirchhoff model the density and kinematic viscosity of fluid are ρ 1000 kg m3 and υ f 0 001 m 2 s respectively the numerical speed of sound is c 25 m s the viscous term approximation advised by morris morris et al 1997 is applied in this instance the number of triangular element is 4918 and 578 for rigid part and flexible beam respectively and the particle spacing is set to be δ x 0 005 m which corresponds to 41224 particles fluid flows into the region at a parabolic velocity from the left its expressed is as follows 34 v x in 0 y 1 5 u 4 0 0 1681 y 0 41 y where u is the average inflow velocity and its value is 1 m s a starting procedure advised by turek and hron 2007 is used by applying a smooth rise of the inflow velocity in time as 35 v x in t 0 y v x in 0 y 1 cos π t 2 2 if t 2 0 v x in 0 y otherwise the outflow condition on the right edge is the prescribed pressure of zero the no slip wall is used for interface between structure and fluid table 1 illustrates the comparison of the es fem sph results fem sph results and reference results bhardwaj and mittal 2012 tian et al 2014 turek 2014 the basic frequency f 0 is the frequency of the trailing edge s vertical displacement it is noted that though the values of f 0 2 r u from difference sources are basically the same the values of the amplitude in y direction from difference sources are different as shown in table 1 for the turek hron test the value of the amplitude in y direction is closely related to the damping effect of the system it is noted that ref turek 2014 did not provide information regarding to the damping effect ref bhardwaj and mittal 2012 did not consider the damping effect and ref tian et al 2014 considered the damping effect but did not provide the damping coefficient it is clear that as ref bhardwaj and mittal 2012 the damping effect did not be taken into account the obtained amplitude in y direction is much larger than that from ref turek 2014 in contrast as the damping effect is considered in ref tian et al 2014 the obtained amplitude in y direction is smaller than but closer to that from ref turek 2014 the results of fem sph and es fem sph model with the mass damping matrix for fem are provided also in table 1 it is seen in table 1 that for fem sph and es fem sph simulations if the damping effect is not considered the obtained amplitudes in y direction are slightly higher than that from ref turek 2014 however when considering the damping effect the obtained amplitudes in y direction for both fem sph and es fem sph simulations are close to that from ref turek 2014 for the es fem sph model when the damping coefficient is 0 5 the obtained amplitudes in y direction is in good agreement with that from ref turek 2014 we can also observe from the results listed in table 1 that es fem sph predicts a higher value of the amplitudes in y direction than fem sph and this means that es fem sph is softer than fem sph which is associated with overly stiff feature in summary for this benchmark test compared to the results from other sources our results es fem sph and es fem sph are more accurate whether considering damping effect or not fig 23 presents the time history of y displacement at control point a it can be seen that both methods can obtain a periodical vibration after around 7 s fig 24 illustrates the velocity distribution two timeshots in an oscillation period where t represents the oscillation period in fig 25 the particles that are colored by pressure are given out for two timeshots in fig 26 the nodes that are colored by contour of stress σ x x are given out as using gradient smoothing technique the es fem model is softer than fem model then the values of σ x x is smaller for the es fem sph method than that ones for the fem sph in this case the results calculated by es fem sph model are consistent with those in reference bhardwaj and mittal 2012 tian et al 2014 turek 2014 the results indicate virtual particle scheme is effective and it can be handle the moving boundary and complex geometric boundary and es fem sph model is very suitable for the simulation of fsi problems 5 6 elastic structure impacting on free surface as shown in fig 27 the high dynamic impact of elastic structure on free surfaces is studied scolan 2004 which was simulated previously by using fem sph model fourey et al 2010 2017 leduc et al 2015 at t 0 0s the structure initially impacts the free surface of water at rest with a velocity of v o 30 m s in the vertical direction that is maintained throughout the whole simulation and imposed on the nodes along the outer edges as well as those along the line of symmetry of the structure the geometric dimensions are l 0 6m e 0 04m and β 10 separately the material properties of elastic structure are density ρ s 2700 kg m 3 young modulus e 67 5 gpa and poisson ratio υ s 0 34 the density of water is ρ 1000 kg m3 and the numerical speed of sound is c 1500 m s the viscous term approximation advised by morris morris et al 1997 is applied in this instance and the kinematic viscosity of fluid is υ f 10 6 m 2 s gravity s acceleration is g 9 81 m s2 and air is ignored in simulation and the number of triangular element is 960 for elastic structure in order to limit the total number of particles the fluid discretization will be separated into two zones the first one 1 0 x 1 0 y 1 0 will be discretized with initial particle spacing 5 mm the second zone will be discretized with initial particle spacing 10 mm as shown in fig 28 the displacement of middle point m on the structure relative to the point o on the structure is presented the results calculated by es fem sph and fem sph model are coincidence with the semi analytical solution scolan 2004 and the results obtained by fourey et al 2010 however the results calculated by es fem sph model are better than those obtained by fem sph model since the fem model is overly stiff by using three node triangular element fig 29 shows the vertical force acting on the structure and good consistency is observed fig 30 shows the computed solution s snapshots for es fem sph and fem sph coupling approach these snapshots are plotted with pressure and stress σ x x contours the pressure fields of fluid domain are smoothing it further indicates that sph method with correction algorithms is effective in modeling free surface fluid the results show that the es fem sph model is effective in modeling fsi problems 6 conclusions in this paper the recently developed es fem is coupled with sph for modeling fsi problems in this coupling approach es fem is used to model the movement and deformation of structures and sph is used to model fluid flow linear triangular elements are adopted to discretize the structure making the es fem sph model suitable for fsi problems with complicated geometries as es fem is associated with the gradient smoothing technique in structure domain the overly stiff effect in the conventional fem model can be properly neutralized and the accuracy of the solutions is thus improved also the particle shifting technique density correction and kernel gradient correction integrated in sph ensure the computational accuracy of sph in modeling fluid flow es fem sph is implemented through virtual particle scheme and the virtual particles are produced dynamically and automatically for each interaction pair of a segment and a fluid particle at each time step while the information of virtual particles can be obtained from the fluid particles and boundary segments based on boundary condition the es fem sph model leverage the advantages of robustness of es fem for solving structural dynamics and convenience of sph for simulating fluid dynamics six typical examples with fsi are investigated with es fem sph and compared with results from other resources from the analyses and numerical results we conclude that es fem is effective in modeling the deformation and movement of structures and it is accurate and flexible even using the simple linear triangular elements the sph method after integrating with particle shifting technique density correction and kernel gradient correction is effective and robust in modeling fluid flows we also demonstrated that through virtual particle scheme es fem can be efficiently coupled with sph and es fem sph is an effective approach for modeling fsi problems and can obtain

simulate fsi problems keywords edge based smoothed finite element method es fem smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph fluid structure interaction fsi 1 introduction fsi is a significant field in aerospace marine engineering biomechanics and other applications bennet and edwards 1998 van loon and van de vosse 2010 taylor and figueroa 2009 in recent decades a plenty of numeric methods have been proposed for fsi problems among which the grid based method occupies the dominant position in numerical research the lagrangian grid based methods such as the finite element method fem strang et al 1973 are commonly used for structural modeling while the eulerian grid based methods such as the finite difference method fdm brandimarte 1960 the finite volume method fvm versteeg and malalasekera 1995 and finite element method fem strang et al 1973 are classically used for fluid modeling there are some ways for coupling eulerian grid and lagrangian grid such as the immersed boundary method ibm peskin 2002 and arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method donea et al 1982 hirt et al 1974 however these methods are time consuming for tracking moving boundaries or interfaces donea et al 1982 hirt et al 1974 morinishi and fukui 2012 peskin 2002 it is very attractive to solve the fsi problem under the unified lagrangian description because it can deal with the moving interface naturally recently the fsi problem is solved by coupling the finite element method with mesh free methods fourey et al 2010 groenenboom and cartwright 2009 hu et al 2014 long et al 2017 vuyst et al 2005 yang et al 2012 zhang and wan 2018 and the coupling approaches leverage the advantages of convenience of mesh free methods to simulate hydrodynamics and robustness of fem to solve structural dynamics the fem has become a powerful and effective technique for numeric simulation in science and engineering however some shortcomings also exist in the conventional fem it is well known that the overly stiff characteristic of the conventional finite element models often leads to a significant reduction in the accuracy of numerical solutions liu and quek 2003 certainly the fem sph approaches have the overly stiff characteristic because of conventional finite element model thus it is important to develop an effective numerical technique for dealing with this issue the smoothed finite element method s fem was proposed by liu et al 2007a which is based on the gradient smoothing technique of mesh less method chen et al 2001 the gradient smoothing technique provides a good way to reduce the over stiffness liu 2008 a new class of smoothing methods have been developed that can effectively soften the numerical model such as cell based s fem cs fem liu et al 2007b nodal based s fem ns fem liu et al 2009b edge based s fem es fem liu et al 2009a and face based s fem fs fem nguyen thoi et al 2009 in addition thanks to the gradient smoothing technique smoothed point interpolation methods s pims have been proposed gui rong and gui yong 2013 liu and zhang 2008 and s pims are developed for fsi problems wang et al 2017 2018 zhang et al 2018 furthermore s fem is also utilized to fsi problems zhang et al proposed immersed s fem is fem to solve fsi problems zhang et al 2012 recently jiang et al proposed a sharp interface is fem for interactions between large deformation structures and incompressible flows the method has great application prospects for fsi problems jiang et al 2018 since the es fem provides more precise solutions than the traditional linear fem liu et al 2009a in this paper the es fem is used to model the structure domain the sph approach is a purely lagrangian mesh free approach which was originally developed by lucy 1977 and monaghan and gingold gingold and monaghan 1977 monaghan and gingold 1983 it is widely applied in astrophysics impact dynamics fluid mechanics and other fields recently han and hu used a uniform sph frame to modeling fluid structure interaction problems han and hu 2018 yang et al proposed an improved sph ebg element bending group method for interactions between free surface flows and flexible structures yang et al 2016 zhang et al reviewed the latest developments in sph methods and their typical applications in fsi problems zhang et al 2017 asai et al proposed a stabilized incompressible sph to simulate the free surface flow problems asai et al 2012 he et al 2020 used a finite particle method to modeling the solitary wave breaking over a slope in this article the sph approach is applied to solve the fluid domain the meshless property of sph approach eliminates the troubles caused by large deformations therefore sph is quite suitable to solve fluid flows with moving interfaces and free surfaces in the fem sph model the sph is used to solve the fluid domain and the fem is applied to solve the solid domain where the coupling strategy usually utilizes a pure lagrangian description in both media the fem sph coupling approach was firstly developed by attaway et al 1994 to investigate impact problems vuyst et al 2005 investigated fluid structure impact problems using an fem sph model the fem sph coupling approach can also be applied to interaction between elastic structures and free surface flow fourey et al 2010 groenenboom and cartwright 2009 hu et al 2014 yang et al 2012 the master slave schemes are utilized in most fem sph models and the contact forces are used to prevent particles from entering the element mesh attaway et al 1994 groenenboom and cartwright 2009 hu et al 2014 each coupling approach has its own specific feature for the modeling of complex fsi problems some fem sph coupling approaches without contact algorithm are also proposed fourey et al 2010 long et al 2017 yang et al 2012 fourrey et al fourey et al 2010 utilized the virtual particles coupling strategy to realize the fem sph model yang et al 2012 used monaghan type repulsive force to prevent the particles penetrate the element meshes long et al 2017 developed a virtual particle coupling scheme for fem sph model with complex geometry interface in which the virtual particles are produced through discretizing the truncated region of support domain of kernel function recently fourey et al 2017 proposed an efficient coupling scheme between sph and fem for violent fluid structure interaction modeling in this paper the coupling method of es fem and sph is proposed for simulating fsi problems and the virtual particles coupling scheme is used for the es fem sph model three node triangular elements are used to discretize the structure domain which is simple and flexible the particles are used to discretize the fluid domain and the fsi in es fem sph model is implemented through deploying virtual particles within es fem elements since es fem provides a more precise solution than traditional linear fem using the same constant strain triangular element it can be expected that es fem sph coupling model will be applicable to fsi problems comparisons between the es fem sph model and the fem sph coupling approach are given for several numerical examples the organization of this paper is as follows firstly the es fem to solve the solid domain is concisely introduced secondly the sph approach to solve hydrodynamics is briefly introduced thirdly the coupled es fem sph model is briefly described finally numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the es fem sph model 2 es fem formulations in this paper the es fem for solving the deformation and motion structure based on total lagrangian format is adopted and the structure is discretized by using linear triangular elements zhang and liu 2014 the smoothed deformation gradient smoothed green lagrange strain tensor and the smoothed second piola kirchhoff pk2 stress tensor are derived at the initial configuration in es fem the displacement u i s and the current spacial position x i s are approximated by 1 u i s n i u

the smoothed green strain the smoothed nominal stress and so on using the explicit time integration based on the center difference algorithm the transient solutions of the nonlinear solid are obtained es fem formulations cui et al 2013 are given as 7 m i a i i f i i int f i i ext 8 f i i int ω 0 n i j p j i d ω 9 f i i ext ω 0 n i ρ 0 s b i d ω γ 0 t n i t i d γ where a i i is the acceleration for

density function is as follows 11 w 1 2 λ tr e 2 μ tr e 2 where e is the green strain tensor λ and μ are lamé constants the other model is mooney rivlin hyper elastic model treloar 1940 and the expression of strain energy density function is as follows 12 w c 01 j 1 3 c 10 j 2 3 1 2 κ j 3 1 2 where κ is the bulk modulus c 01 and c 10 are constants and j 1 j 2 j 3 are reduced invariants of the cauchy green deformation tensor 3 sph formulations 3 1 governing equations in this paper the working fluid is assumed incompressible and newtonian the weakly compressible sph wcsph method is used for modeling incompressible fluid flows this treatment actually assumes the incompressible fluid to be slightly or weakly compressible the mass conservation and momentum conservation equations are as follows 13 1 ρ d ρ d t v 0 14 d v d t 1 ρ p υ o 2 v f where t is the time ρ is the density of fluid v is the velocity vector υ o is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid p is the pressure and f is the

morris morris et al 1997 which is as follows 18 υ o 2 v i j m j υ o i υ o j x i j i w i j ρ j x i j 2 η 2 v i j where η 0 1 h is a parameter that avoids the null denominator in this paper the laminar in addition the pressure is computed by the equation of state eos antoci et al 2007 and its expression is as follows 19 p c 2 ρ ρ 0 where c is a numerical speed of sound ρ 0 is a reference density to satisfy the weakly compressible condition the constraint c 10 max u max p max ρ 0 is usually adopted sun et al 2017 where u max and p max are the maximum expected velocity and pressure respectively this ensures that the density variations are below 1 in agreement with the weakly compressibility hypothesis in addition the speed of sound should not be too large which leads to too small time step 3 2 numerical treatment of sph in this paper the kgc kernel gradient correction density correction and pst particle shifting technique are combined to ameliorate the stability and accuracy in modeling fluid flow the kgc is used to improve the kernel gradient in sph approximation shao et al 2012 a corrected kernel gradient is obtained from taylor series expansion method for kgc technique in two

particle distributions in this article the virtual particles have different scales with fluid particle in order to deal with the different size particles on the interface the particle shifting vector is modified as long et al 2017 23 δ x i β j x i j x i j 3 r o 2 m j m i v max δ t and 24 r o j 1 n f x i j n f where δ x i is the particle shifting vector β is a parameter that depends on the problem and the value of β is set to 0 01 in this article r o is the average particle distance and n f is the number of adjacent fluid particles after the particle shifting is used for particles the field variable values at the new position should be modified using the taylor series interpolates and it can be written as 25 φ i φ i δ x i φ i where φ i and φ i are the general field variable at old position and new position respectively 4 coupling strategy of sph with es fem as shown in fig 2 the structure domain is simulated by es fem and the fluid domain is solved by sph approach as shown in fig 3 the virtual particle coupling strategy proposed by long et al 2017 is used in this paper in which kernel support domain s truncated region is divided into sub regions relating to interface segments and the sub regions are discretized to generate virtual particles then the interaction pairs between the particle and element can be established by using the corresponding virtual particles as illustrated in fig 3 a the truncated region is divided into sub regions of ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 in which ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 correspond with ab bc and cd separately as illustrated in fig 4 if the segment have a sub region of particle i there are three relative position relationships between the segment and fluid particle i after identifying the interaction pairs virtual particles are produced by discretizing sub region for each pair the method of producing virtual particles proposed by long et al 2017 is used in this paper based on boundary condition the physical variables of virtual particles can be given out by interpolation long et al 2017 as illustrated in fig 6 the sub region has been discretized into arches and triangles each triangle or arch has produced a virtual particle the virtual particle is situated in the center of the corresponding arch or triangle and the volume of a virtual particle is equivalent to the volume of corresponding arch or triangle according to the type of boundary conditions the velocity or pressure of virtual particles can be obtained for example as shown in fig 5 for the no slip boundary condition the velocity of virtual particle k is takeda et al 1994 26 v k v s v i d 2 d 1 v s where v k and v s are the velocity of the virtual particle k and the point s in segment hk respectively d 1 is the vertical distances between the fluid particle i and the segment d 2 is the distances between the virtual particle k and the segment hk moreover the density of the virtual particle is also obtained by the boundary condition if the boundary condition of pressure on the interface is enforced as p n s 0 the density of virtual particle is equal to the density of fluid particle if the pressure boundary condition should satisfy cauchy boundary condition p n s ρ 0 g n s the density of virtual particle is calculated based on equation of state and the density of fluid particle more information of virtual particle can be found in ref long et al 2017 the virtual particles are produced dynamically and automatically for each interaction pair of a segment and a fluid particle at each time step while the information of virtual particles can be obtained from the fluid particles and boundary segments based on boundary condition fig 6 shows an interaction pair of the fluid particle i and boundary segment mn the virtual particles are produced to calculate the interaction force the force f s m n t f i for the segment mn acting on the particle i is 27 f s m n t f i j ω m n p q f g j t f i m i j ω m n p q m j p i ρ i 2 p j ρ j 2 i w i j j ω m n p q m j υ o i υ o j x i j i w i j ρ j x i j 2 η 2 v i j where f g j t f i denotes the force virtual particle j acting on fluid particle i the force f f i t s m n for the particle i acting on the segment mn is 28 f f i t s m n f s m n t f i and f f i t s m n 2 is applied on node m and n respectively 5 numerical examples with fluid structure interaction in this section six examples of hydrostatic water on a linear elastic plate a hyper elastic gate under water pressure an elastic wall in a lid driven cavity flow an elastic beam in a fluid tunnel flow past a cylinder with an elastic beam and elastic structure impacting on free surface are utilized to validate the es fem sph model comparisons between the es fem sph and the fem sph coupling approach are provided and the same coupling scheme is used for es fem sph and fem sph coupling approach 5 1 hydrostatic water on a linear elastic plate the test case proposed by fourey et al 2017 is used for test accuracy property of the coupling approach and it also has been treated by leduc et al 2015 this test case is very interesting as the problem s analytic solution is known as shown in fig 7 the height and length of the water are h 2m and l 1m respectively and elastic plate s thickness is e 0 05m the density of water is ρ 1000 kg m 3 and the numerical speed of sound is c 100 m s the viscous term approximation advised by morris morris et al 1997 is applied in this instance and the kinematic viscosity of fluid is υ f 10 6 m 2 s the material properties of elastic plate are density ρ s 2700 kg m 3 young modulus e 67 5 gpa and poisson ratio υ s 0 34 gravity s acceleration is g 9 81 m s2 and air is ignored in simulations according to the solution based on static theory the elastic plate s analytical vertical displacement w x is timoshenko and woinowsky krieger 1959 29 w x 1 d ρ g h ρ s g e 1 12 l x 3 1 24 x 4 1 24 l 2 x 2 where the expression of d is 30 d e e 3 12 1 υ 2 the convergence of the coupling approach is studied by using the vertical displacement error norm l 2 and its expression is as follows 31 l 2 x i 1 n e w i n u m e r i c a l w i a n a l y t i c a l 2 n e where n e is total number of element nodes of elastic plate w i a n a l y t i c a l and w i n u m e r i c a l are the analytical and numerical vertical displacement respectively in fem sph and es fem sph models the number of triangular elements is 1082 and 640 for rigid part and elastic plate respectively and the initial particle spacing is set to be 0 0125m which corresponds to 12800 particles fig 8 shows the stress pressure fields at 0 5s both methods have provided smooth stress pressure fields fig 9 shows time histories of plate s midpoint deflection relating to three different spatial resolutions element size and the abbreviation es denotes mesh spacing for all examples as the overly stiff characteristic of the conventional fem models the magnitude of vertical displacement obtained by fem sph model is relatively small the displacements calculated by es fem sph model agree well with the theoretical static displacement fig 9 also shows the comparison with the results calculated by fem sph model by fourey et al 2017 and li et al leduc et al 2015 in their models the overly stiff characteristic is overcome with quadrilateral elements are used therefore the results obtain by fourey et al 2017 and li et al leduc et al 2015 are better than the fem sph model using triangular elements although the es fem sph model uses the triangular elements the results by es fem sph model es 0 0125m are superior with respect to those by sph fem solvers by li et al leduc et al 2015 as well as fourey et al 2017 fig 10 shows the convergence of vertical displacement error norm l 2 compared with the fem sph model es fem sph model can obtain better accuracy and convergence the results show that es fem sph model is more accurate than fem sph model 5 2 a hyper elastic gate under water pressure the deformation of a hyper elastic gate under water pressure has been studied experimentally and numerically by antoci et al 2007 at t 0 s the elastic gate is released the water begins to collapse and the elastic gate is deformed the initial configuration of model is shown in fig 11 the geometric dimensions are l 0 079m h 0 14m a 0 1m and s 0 005m separately the density of water is ρ 1000 kg m3 the numerical speed of sound is c 25 m s the viscous term approximation advised by morris morris et al 1997 is applied in this instance and the kinematic viscosity of fluid is υ f 10 6 m 2 s mooney rivlin model is utilized to model the elastic gate with material constant c 01 379310 3 n m 2 c 10 1327586 2 n m 2 and κ 18 97 mpa the elastic gate s density is ρ s 1100 kg m3 the acceleration of gravity is g 9 8 m s2 and air is ignored in simulations in fem sph and es fem sph models the number of triangular elements is 4960 and 936 for rigid part and elastic gate respectively and the initial particle spacing is set to be 0 001m which corresponds to 14000 particles the es fem sph results are compared to experimental and fem sph results as illustrated in fig 12 the elastic gate is deformed by the impulse of the fluid flow the shapes of the free surface and the elastic gate are comfortably simulated and the smooth pressure fields are obtained the sph method with correction algorithms can obtained smooth pressure field and it indicates that the correction algorithms are effective moreover the influences of the element and particle resolution on es fem sph model and fem sph model are studied as illustrated in fig 13 the abbreviation ps denotes fluid particle spacing for all examples respectively the elastic gate mesh spacing 0 0025m 0 00125m 0 001m corresponds to 134 512 and 936 elements separately the fluid particle spacing 0 0020m 0 0013m 0 001m corresponds to 3500 7875 and 14000 particles separately the horizontal displacements calculated by es fem sph method are closer to experimental results than those obtained by fem sph method because the fem with three node triangular element is over stiff the horizontal displacements obtained by fem sph model are relatively small especially for the coarse triangular elements the size of element is a critical issue to guarantee of numerical solution of fem sph using the constant strain triangular element because the es fem is softer than the fem with using the gradient smoothing technique the displacements obtained by es fem sph model are larger than those obtained by fem sph model it is noted that the es fem sph can produce numerical results with satisfactory accuracy even for coarse triangular elements 5 3 an elastic wall in a lid driven cavity flow the deformation of a hyper elastic wall at the bottom of a lid driven cavity filled with fluid is studied this study was originally studied by dunn dunne 2006 with the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian method it was then repeated and confirmed by zhao et al 2008 as shown in fig 14 a hyper elastic wall with height 0 5 cm and width 2 cm is located at lower bottom of a cavity with size 2 cm 2 cm and the space above is filled with fluid the upper cover of the cavity is driven by a spatial correlation velocity function 32 v x 0 5 sin 2 π x 0 6 x 0 0 0 3 1 x 0 3 1 7 sin 2 π x 2 0 0 6 x 1 7 2 0 cm s the other boundary conditions in the fluid region satisfy the no slip boundary conditions the density of fluid is ρ 1 0 g cm3 the dynamic viscosity of fluid is μ f 0 2 g cm s 2 neo hookean material is utilized for the hyper elastic wall with the material constants c 01 0 1 g cm s 2 c 10 0 and κ 0 and the density of the hyper elastic wall is ρ s 1 0 g cm3 the viscous term approximation advised by morris morris et al 1997 is applied in this case in fem sph and es fem sph models the number of triangular element is 524 and 820 for rigid part and hyper elastic wall respectively and the initial particle spacing is set to be 0 01 cm which corresponds to 30000 particles as shown in fig 15 the deformed hyper elastic wall reaches a steady state at t 8s and the fluid particles that are colored by velocity are presented and the deformation of hyper elastic wall obtained by fem sph model is less than that obtained by es fem sph model fig 16 shows the comparison of final position of fluid structure interface the deformation of hyper elastic wall calculated by es fem sph model is consistent with the reference result of ale method dunne 2006 however the deformation of hyper elastic wall obtained by fem sph model is quite different from the reference results moreover the effects of the element resolution on es fem sph model and fem sph model are studied as illustrated in fig 17 the es fem sph model can obtain satisfactory accuracy with coarse elements but the fem sph model is unreasonable especially for cases with coarse elements the reason is that the fem with triangular element is over stiff again this example also clearly demonstrates that the es fem sph method with triangular element is effective and accurate to solving fsi problems 5 4 an elastic beam in a fluid tunnel in this example an elastic beam placed in a fluid tunnel is analyzed and this example was simulated previously using immersed s fem is fem zhang et al 2012 as shown in fig 18 the length of the fluid tunnel is l 4 cm and the height is h 1 cm the thickness of the beam is a 0 04 cm and the length is b 0 8 cm at the bottom edge of the fluid domain the no slip boundary condition is assumed and at the top edge the velocity symmetric condition is applied at the left edge the inlet velocity is defined by 33 v x 1 5 2 y y 2 at the right edge only the reference pressure is set to be zero the fluid properties are given as ρ 1 0 g cm 3 and the dynamic viscosity of fluid is μ f 0 1 g cm s 2 the material properties of elastic beam are density ρ s 7 8 g cm3 young modulus e 10 5 g cm s 2 and poisson ratio υ s 0 3 the elastic beam adopts saint venant kirchhoff model the viscous term approximation advised by morris morris et al 1997 is applied in this case in fem sph and es fem sph models the number of triangular element is 1640 and 640 for rigid part and hyper elastic wall respectively and the initial particle spacing is set to be 0 01 cm which corresponds to 40482 particles as shown in fig 19 the particles that are colored by velocity and the deformation of the elastic beam are presented at different time steps the smooth velocity field are obtained by the sph method the effectiveness of sph method is demonstrated again fig 20 shows the time history of horizontal displacement at tip point b the different mesh spacing is used for flexible beam which the mesh spacing 0 0002m 0 0001m 0 00005m corresponds to 160 640 and 2560 elements separately the horizontal displacement obtained by fem sph model is unreasonable when the element spacing is set to 0 0002m and 0 0001m however the es fem sph model can obtain satisfactory accuracy even the element spacing is set to 0 0002m it indicates that the es fem sph model can use less number of elements than fem sph model and the es fem sph model is better than fem sph model fig 21 shows the stress contour at the steady state for the beam this case further indicates the es fem sph model behaves softer than fem sph model and provides more accurate solutions than the fem sph model using the same constant strain triangular elements 5 5 flow past a cylinder with an elastic beam the flow past a fixed cylinder with an elastic beam fsi2 defined by turek and hron 2007 is studied as illustrated in fig 22 the length of computational domain is l 2 50m and the height of computational domain is h 0 41m the circle s radius is r 0 05 and the center of circle is located at c 0 2 0 2 which is measured from the lower left corner of the domain the length and height of the elastic beam is l 0 35m and h 0 02m respectively the control point a is attached to the free end of beam as marked in fig 22 the elastic beam s material properties are poisson ratio υ s 0 4 young modulus e 1 4 106 n m2 and density ρ s 10000 kg m3 t the elastic beam adopts saint venant kirchhoff model the density and kinematic viscosity of fluid are ρ 1000 kg m3 and υ f 0 001 m 2 s respectively the numerical speed of sound is c 25 m s the viscous term approximation advised by morris morris et al 1997 is applied in this instance the number of triangular element is 4918 and 578 for rigid part and flexible beam respectively and the particle spacing is set to be δ x 0 005 m which corresponds to 41224 particles fluid flows into the region at a parabolic velocity from the left its expressed is as follows 34 v x in 0 y 1 5 u 4 0 0 1681 y 0 41 y where u is the average inflow velocity and its value is 1 m s a starting procedure advised by turek and hron 2007 is used by applying a smooth rise of the inflow velocity in time as 35 v x in t 0 y v x in 0 y 1 cos π t 2 2 if t 2 0 v x in 0 y otherwise the outflow condition on the right edge is the prescribed pressure of zero the no slip wall is used for interface between structure and fluid table 1 illustrates the comparison of the es fem sph results fem sph results and reference results bhardwaj and mittal 2012 tian et al 2014 turek 2014 the basic frequency f 0 is the frequency of the trailing edge s vertical displacement it is noted that though the values of f 0 2 r u from difference sources are basically the same the values of the amplitude in y direction from difference sources are different as shown in table 1 for the turek hron test the value of the amplitude in y direction is closely related to the damping effect of the system it is noted that ref turek 2014 did not provide information regarding to the damping effect ref bhardwaj and mittal 2012 did not consider the damping effect and ref tian et al 2014 considered the damping effect but did not provide the damping coefficient it is clear that as ref bhardwaj and mittal 2012 the damping effect did not be taken into account the obtained amplitude in y direction is much larger than that from ref turek 2014 in contrast as the damping effect is considered in ref tian et al 2014 the obtained amplitude in y direction is smaller than but closer to that from ref turek 2014 the results of fem sph and es fem sph model with the mass damping matrix for fem are provided also in table 1 it is seen in table 1 that for fem sph and es fem sph simulations if the damping effect is not considered the obtained amplitudes in y direction are slightly higher than that from ref turek 2014 however when considering the damping effect the obtained amplitudes in y direction for both fem sph and es fem sph simulations are close to that from ref turek 2014 for the es fem sph model when the damping coefficient is 0 5 the obtained amplitudes in y direction is in good agreement with that from ref turek 2014 we can also observe from the results listed in table 1 that es fem sph predicts a higher value of the amplitudes in y direction than fem sph and this means that es fem sph is softer than fem sph which is associated with overly stiff feature in summary for this benchmark test compared to the results from other sources our results es fem sph and es fem sph are more accurate whether considering damping effect or not fig 23 presents the time history of y displacement at control point a it can be seen that both methods can obtain a periodical vibration after around 7 s fig 24 illustrates the velocity distribution two timeshots in an oscillation period where t represents the oscillation period in fig 25 the particles that are colored by pressure are given out for two timeshots in fig 26 the nodes that are colored by contour of stress σ x x are given out as using gradient smoothing technique the es fem model is softer than fem model then the values of σ x x is smaller for the es fem sph method than that ones for the fem sph in this case the results calculated by es fem sph model are consistent with those in reference bhardwaj and mittal 2012 tian et al 2014 turek 2014 the results indicate virtual particle scheme is effective and it can be handle the moving boundary and complex geometric boundary and es fem sph model is very suitable for the simulation of fsi problems 5 6 elastic structure impacting on free surface as shown in fig 27 the high dynamic impact of elastic structure on free surfaces is studied scolan 2004 which was simulated previously by using fem sph model fourey et al 2010 2017 leduc et al 2015 at t 0 0s the structure initially impacts the free surface of water at rest with a velocity of v o 30 m s in the vertical direction that is maintained throughout the whole simulation and imposed on the nodes along the outer edges as well as those along the line of symmetry of the structure the geometric dimensions are l 0 6m e 0 04m and β 10 separately the material properties of elastic structure are density ρ s 2700 kg m 3 young modulus e 67 5 gpa and poisson ratio υ s 0 34 the density of water is ρ 1000 kg m3 and the numerical speed of sound is c 1500 m s the viscous term approximation advised by morris morris et al 1997 is applied in this instance and the kinematic viscosity of fluid is υ f 10 6 m 2 s gravity s acceleration is g 9 81 m s2 and air is ignored in simulation and the number of triangular element is 960 for elastic structure in order to limit the total number of particles the fluid discretization will be separated into two zones the first one 1 0 x 1 0 y 1 0 will be discretized with initial particle spacing 5 mm the second zone will be discretized with initial particle spacing 10 mm as shown in fig 28 the displacement of middle point m on the structure relative to the point o on the structure is presented the results calculated by es fem sph and fem sph model are coincidence with the semi analytical solution scolan 2004 and the results obtained by fourey et al 2010 however the results calculated by es fem sph model are better than those obtained by fem sph model since the fem model is overly stiff by using three node triangular element fig 29 shows the vertical force acting on the structure and good consistency is observed fig 30 shows the computed solution s snapshots for es fem sph and fem sph coupling approach these snapshots are plotted with pressure and stress σ x x contours the pressure fields of fluid domain are smoothing it further indicates that sph method with correction algorithms is effective in modeling free surface fluid the results show that the es fem sph model is effective in modeling fsi problems 6 conclusions in this paper the recently developed es fem is coupled with sph for modeling fsi problems in this coupling approach es fem is used to model the movement and deformation of structures and sph is used to model fluid flow linear triangular elements are adopted to discretize the structure making the es fem sph model suitable for fsi problems with complicated geometries as es fem is associated with the gradient smoothing technique in structure domain the overly stiff effect in the conventional fem model can be properly neutralized and the accuracy of the solutions is thus improved also the particle shifting technique density correction and kernel gradient correction integrated in sph ensure the computational accuracy of sph in modeling fluid flow es fem sph is implemented through virtual particle scheme and the virtual particles are produced dynamically and automatically for each interaction pair of a segment and a fluid particle at each time step while the information of virtual particles can be obtained from the fluid particles and boundary segments based on boundary condition the es fem sph model leverage the advantages of robustness of es fem for solving structural dynamics and convenience of sph for simulating fluid dynamics six typical examples with fsi are investigated with es fem sph and compared with results from other resources from the analyses and numerical results we conclude that es fem is effective in modeling the deformation and movement of structures and it is accurate and flexible even using the simple linear triangular elements the sph method after integrating with particle shifting technique density correction and kernel gradient correction is effective and robust in modeling fluid flows we also demonstrated that through virtual particle scheme es fem can be efficiently coupled with sph and es fem sph is an effective approach for modeling fsi problems and can obtain

20934,numerical and experimental study on the instability of unstiffened mild steel cone cylinder assembly under simultaneously acting quasi static axial compression and thermal load is presented in this paper results for one model subjected to axial compression were obtained first then the combined action of axial compression and temperature was applied to the remaining four models there was a good correlation between the experimental data and the numerically obtained buckling load for the cone cylinders assembly the percentage difference between experimental to the numerically predicted failure load ranges from 10 to 7 finally the first combined stability domains for cone cylinder assembly under combined axial compression and temperature was presented further study has been conducted to evaluate the buckling effect for cone cylinder shell subjected to combined loading to the change of these parameters i dimensionless radius to thickness ratio rcyl t ii semi vertex cone angle β and iii dimensionless cylinder length to cylinder radius ratio lcyl rcyl finally the influence of structural initial imperfection also has been considered by following the recommendation of eccs 2008 keywords cone cylinder assembly buckling combined loading heating axial compression 1 introduction cone cylinder shells are common structural components in a lot of industrial applications in real life situation such shells are frequently exposed to different loading conditions ranging from single loads such as axial compression bending external or internal pressure thermal torsion to combined loading as a result of the various application of the shell structures it is customary to design cone cylinder wall thickness with respect to their specific application as an example in aeronautic and aerospace applications the cone cylinder shells are predominantly thinner shells in which the failure is controlled by elastic buckling whilst in offshore and marine applications thicker shells which fail mainly by plastic buckling are commonly used in general the cylindrical shell may buckle in three possible modes of failure i axisymmetric collapse ii asymmetric collapse and iii general instability the axisymmetric collapse is described when the structure deforms in a folded shape that develops between the ends of the shell while the asymmetric collapse often in the shape of lobar buckling or panel instability whereas the general instability is characterized by an overall asymmetric collapse of the complete shell nonetheless for the case of cone cylinder shell the failure mode is often in the shape of axisymmetric collapse with buckle mostly occurred at the cone cylinder transition area this type of failure at the intersection according to zingoni 2002 zingoni et al 2015 may be attributed to the development of both circumferential stresses and local bending at the intersection resulting from the non continuous slope of shell meridian at the junction to name a few the works on the discontinuity shell structure were also reported in flores and godoy 1991 teng 1996 zhao and teng 2003 the earlier test shows that axially compressed cylindrical shells failed at a much lower load against the experimental values by less than 30 eccs 1988 this finding also demonstrates the sensitivity of initial imperfection that contribute to a major difference in correlating the numerical and experimental buckling load estimation few examples of experimental works into the buckling behaviour of axially compressed cylinder can be found in błachut 2015 ghazijahani et al 2014 haynie et al 2010 ifayefunmi 2016 ghazijahani et al 2014 introduced the imperfection using the indentation technique at shells mid section with various depth and orientation twenty seven 27 locally dented steel specimens were fabricated and tested the obtained experimental results were benchmark against other studies and standard code guideline it is evident that the type of imperfection i e dent s depth and orientation is critically important in estimating the amount of buckling load together with shell failure pattern formation błachut 2015 tested 18 steel cylindrical shells that categorized by 15 specimens with imperfect length and 3 with the perfect length the cylinders were cnc machined and subjected to axial compression the test data revealed that the failure load of the shell is highly dependent on the magnitude of the axial imperfection i e imperfect length waviness and this was confirmed by the numerical calculation haynie et al 2010 examined the behaviour of axially compressed aluminium cylinders under the influence of lateral load at shell mid section the lateral load was used as an imperfection to estimate cylinder lower bound buckling load numerical results were used to support the experimentation data it was reported that the lateral perturbation is significant in reducing the shell load carrying capacity thus produces a lower bound buckling load ifayefunmi 2016 examined 4 different thickness of mild steel cylinder subjected to axial compressive load the shell considered to be a thick cylinder as rcyl t 100 there was a good correlation between the finite element result and the experimental test data as the differences are within the range of 2 7 experimental investigations into the instability of axially compressed cones are available in blachut and ifayefunmi 2010 blachut et al 2011 błachut et al 2013 ifayefunmi 2015 ifayefunmi błachut 2011 2013 blachut et al 2013 reported a plastic buckling of steel cone by adopting several material models of i elastic perfectly plastic ii engineering stress strain and iii true stress true strain the test results were benchmark against eccs code with 50 difference obtained the differences have also been supported by ifayefunmi 2015 an investigation into the buckling behaviour of axially compressed imperfect cone is presented in ifayefunmi and błachut 2013 few imperfection approaches were adopted such as i eigenmode imperfections and ii axisymmetric outward bulge in numerical part of the report the results reveal that the worst imperfection type is not always the eigenmode imperfections for instance as compared to eigenmode imperfection the localized axisymmetric outward bulge is more severe in reducing the buckling load of the cone to mentioned a few experimental studies on buckling behaviour of reinforced i e stiffened shells under axial compressive load were reported in chryssanthopoulos and poggi 2001 singer et al 1966 spagnoli 1997 2001 spagnoli and chryssanthopoulos 1999 weller and singer 1970 for cone and arbocz et al 1971 singer and rosen 1976 weller and singer 1971 1974 for cylinder early research on cone and or cylinder subjected to thermal loading can be found in abir and nardo 1959 bendavid and singer 1967 bushnell and smith 1971 lu and chang 1967 ross et al 1966 tani 1978 for instance abir and nardo 1959 analyzed the buckling of the cylindrical shell using donnell s equations this is done by assuming constant stresses through the shell thickness and in the longitudinal axial direction while fourier series is used to express thermal stress variation along the circumference of the shell ross et al 1966 using an experimental approach proposed design stability data for uniformly heated fixed thin circular cylinders eleven 11 stainless steel aisi type 304 and 1006 cold rolled cylinders having the radius to thickness ratio of r t 291 and 344 were tested sequence load was applied by introducing the thermal heat load and finished with axial compression the range of temperatures was varied between 30 f 227 f a comparison of the present experimental results indicated a poor comparison of experimental and theoretical calculation anderson 1962 presented a linear theoretical solution for the buckling behaviour of ring stiffened cylinder subjected to combined temperature and axial compressive load experimental works were also included for verification purpose buckling charts that cover a large range of cylinder geometry i e a radius to thickness ratio of 100 r t 2000 are proposed for both fixed and simply supported cylindrical shells the adopted range of temperatures was between 80 f 550 f a technical paper that analyzed the buckling behaviour of space shuttle external tank super light weight liquid oxygen lo2 tank was reported by nemeth et al 1998 1996 two full scale structural tests that were carried out via two prelaunch loading conditions the analyzed results showed thermal load originated from liquid oxygen lo2 was highly apparent to affect the tank buckling load shen 1998 reported a post buckling analysis of unstiffened and stiffened cylinders under external pressure and uniform incremental temperature boundary layers shell buckling theory that includes nonlinear pre buckling deformation effect post buckling nonlinear large deflection effect and shells initial geometric imperfection was adopted the study benchmarked some experimental and numerical results available in the open literature to conclude under combined loading the unstiffened cylinder experienced a stable equilibrium path and becomes non sensitive to imperfection shen et al 1991 1993 numerically analyzed buckling and post buckling behaviour of perfect and imperfect unstiffened and stiffened cylinders subjected to external pressure and axial compressive load comparative results were made with some available experimental data it was reported that the buckling and post buckling behaviour of stiffened and unstiffened cylinders subjected to combined loading strongly depends on three 3 factors i the geometric parameter ii the load proportional parameter and the iii imperfection parameter ifayefunmi and błachut 2011 2013 examined the effect of eigenmode imperfections on the load carrying capacity of relatively thick cones under i axial compression ii external pressure and iii combined loading the asme case code 2286 2 design procedure was used to establish the combined interactive plot for steel cones to identify a portion of safe design operation as reported in ifayefunmi 2014 results of this investigation reveal the limitation of the equivalent cylinders approach in predicting a safe design for relatively thick cone subjected to combined loading to date there has been no information available in the open literature on the stability behaviour of cone cylinder transition shell subjected combined axial compression and thermal loading i e elevated temperature the current paper aims to provide experimental data with the support of numerical results for buckling of cone cylinder shell subjected to i axial compression alone and ii combined axial compression and thermal loading further study has been conducted to evaluate the buckling effect for cone cylinder shell subjected to combined loading to the change of these parameters i dimensionless radius to thickness ratio rcyl t ii semi vertex cone angle β and iii dimensionless cylinder length to cylinder radius ratio lcyl rcyl finally the influence of structural initial imperfection also has been considered by following the eccs 2008 recommendation 2 cone cylinder experimentation 2 1 the fabrication process pre test measurement and material properties five 5 laboratory scaled cone cylinder transition shells cc1 cc2 cc3 cc4 and cc5 were fabricated using 1 mm mild steel sheet as illustrated in fig 1 a the specimens were assumed to have the same nominal geometry and it is given by bigger radius to smaller radius ratio rcone rcyl 0 571 bigger radius to wall thickness ratio rcyl t 70 0 cone angle β 16 7 and the wall thickness t 1 mm whilst the cone axial length and the cylinder axial length was 100 mm respectively it is worth mentioning that the number before abbreviation t and f specifically indicate the sequence of loading during buckling test first tensile test was conducted separately to extract the material data of the mild steel plate six 6 coupon specimens were cut from steel sheet for tensile test the british standard bs en 10002 1 2001 was used in designing the samples three 3 flat coupon were cut in the vertical direction while another three 3 were cut in a horizontal direction of the steel sheet the coupon specimens have not undergone any heat treatment full engineering stress strain were extracted from the tensile test overall the results of the tensile test are given in table 1 it can be seen that the average value of young s modulus was found to be 193 667 gpa conversely the obtained yield stress was 217 97 mpa to note the mild steel material yield point was based on 0 2 of proof stress the average value of young s modulus e and yield stress σyield upper were used in the numerical analysis specimens were cut from 1 mm mild steel plate using waterjet machining after the cutting process the samples were rolled into a conical and cylindrical form using a conventional rolling machine then metal inert gas welding mig was used to weld the seam between the two neighbouring longitudinal free edges of the cones and cylinders separately afterwards the circumferential ends of both cone and cylinder were welded together using the same welding process fig 1b depicts the photograph of the cone cylinder model cc1 after manufacturing to make sure that the test data were repeatability some of the specimens were fabricated and tested under the same loading condition this aims to provide two test results for the tested specimens with the same nominal dimension and loading condition 2 2 collapse test before the buckling test a series of measurements were taken on all the cone cylinder models first measurement of the wall thickness was carried out using micrometre screw gage at different equal distance point along axial length this was then adopted at 36 deg spaced across the circumference table 2 provides the thickness measured data for all the models next the measurement of the inner and outer diameters of the cone cylinder shells was conducted using vernier calliper ten equidistant points were considered during the measurements with the results given in table 3 then the height of the cone slant length of the cone and height of the cylinder were measured using vernier calliper as presented in table 3 cone cylinder specimen cc1 was tested first under axial compression while the remaining cone cylinder models cc2 cc3 cc4 and cc5 were subjected to the combined action of axial compressive load and temperature of 5 150 150 and 250 respectively using 100 kn shimadzu compression machine before testing thick plates were used to covers the specimens at the top and bottom ends as depicted in fig 1b this is presumed to create the necessary boundary condition for the experiment next the cone cylinder shells were inserted between the platens of 100 kn shimadzu machine then the moving crosshead is slowly controlled until the shimadzu platen is touching the specimen thereby establishing contact between them the stepwise axial compressive load was applied to the upper end of the cone cylinder at the speed of 1 mm min for cone cylinder specimen cc1 subjected to axial compression only the use of the temperature chamber was not required as shown in fig 2 an incremental axial load was applied to the cone cylinder shell until the specimen fails to verify the deformation recorded by the machine controller it was decided to use two clock gauges positioned on the top covering plate of the small end of the cone see fig 2 this was done to obtain the actual compression extension of the cone cylinder shell during the experiment however the gauges were not attached to any online system the reading was taken manually hence only one gauge was recorded up to the collapse load fig 3 presents the plot of experimental load versus axial shortening for cone cylinder cc1 from fig 3 it is apparent that readings given by the clock gauge produce a plot that has a similar trend to that of the machine controller also the plot from the clock gauge produces a marginal stiffer slope as compared to the plot from the machine controller this can be attributed to the contribution of the measurement of deformation from the crosshead movement for the remaining cone cylinders shells cc2 cc3 cc4 and cc5 subjected to temperature and axial compressive load the use of the temperature chamber was employed as shown in fig 4 hence the use of the clock gauges was practically impossible during the combined load application the testing procedure was executed in two 2 phases first the specimens were heated to the desired magnitude of the temperature of 50 150 150 and 250 for cone cylinder cc2 cc3 cc4 and cc5 respectively two models cc3 and cc4 were subjected to the same temperature load of 150 this would give two test data for specimens with the same nominal dimension and loading condition then once the desired magnitude of temperature is reached in the second phase keeping the temperature load constant an incremental axial compression load is applied to the models until the specimen collapse fig 5 presents the plot of experimental load versus axial shortening for cone cylinder models with different temperature the corresponding magnitude of the experimental collapse load is given in table 4 from the trend displayed in table 4 it is apparent that as the temperature goes up the failure load of the cone cylinder specimen decreases again it is apparent that two identical specimens with the same loading condition cc3 and cc4 produce a close experimental collapse load hence confirming repeatability of the experimental data fig 6 depicts the photograph of all specimens after being tested all models failed in an axisymmetric pattern with junction transition area being the most severed while the conical and cylinder part remained in membrane state the failure mostly occurred in the form of bending at the junction due to concentrated discontinuity stresses expectedly this behaviour can be said to as a result of non continuous membrane stress at the junction reflecting the localized and rapidly changing behaviour of bending disturbance that is when subjected to combined loading the state of stress in the cone cylinder assembly is majorly membrane stress away from the intersection however moving closer to the intersection from either the top or the bottom ends the stress state in the cone cylinder changes from membrane stress to a combination of bending and membrane stress zingoni 2002 3 cone cylinder numerical modelling numerical predictions were carried out via abaqus fe software to i serve as a benchmark for the experimental data and ii provide further analysis for cone cylinder shells with varying geometric parameter this appears to be important to ascertain the appropriateness of the modelling techniques adopted in this paper the shell is assumed to be from mild steel with young s modulus e 193 667 gpa and yield stress σyield 217 97 mpa obtained from the experiment see section 2 1 for more detail the poisson s ratio ν 0 3 extracted from the material datasheet the value of thermal coefficient of expansion was set to be constant for both material models α 10 10 6 c three 3 types of material models were used in the study they are i elastic perfectly plastic ii gillie 2009 and iii eccs 1989 elastic perfectly plastic was exclusively used for the shell under axial compression only in the finite element calculations j2 flow plasticity theory was adopted whereas for cone cylinder shell subjected to combined temperature and axial compression temperature dependent material data were used adopting the gillie and eccs material models fig 7 shows the responses of elastic modulus of the mild steel according to the changes of temperature for both material models i e gillie and eccs a similar plot showing the yield stress response is presented in fig 8 from figs 7 and 8 it can be observed that the eccs model considered changes both elastic modulus and yield stress according to the increment of temperature although gillie s model only considered a change of yield stress with constant elastic modulus the shell is assumed to be fully clamped at the base i e bottom the top of the shell is also restrained to move in any direction except in axial direction since the shell is a joining assembly between cone and cylinder it should be treated differently in terms of buckling analysis unlikely single shell e g cone and cylinder as it may possess the discontinuity stress effect schmidt 2018 the continuity equation of displacement at the cone cylinder intersection is expressed by ux cyl ūx con uy cyl ūy con and uz cyl uz con from the designation above u corresponds to displacements with local coordinate represented as ux uy uz and global coordinate as ūx ūy ūz whilst ф correspond to rotations shells were subjected to combined temperature and axial compression the loading sequence was carried out in two 2 phases they are i first the shell is subjected to temperature i e thermal load to the desired magnitude and ii keeping the temperature constant axial compression load is then applied to the model until collapse nonlinear static riks analysis was employed in the numerical analysis in the finite element analysis four node shell element having six degrees of freedom s4r in abaqus element library was employed as implemented in abaqus software the s4r shell element provide solutions to shell problems that are adequately described by classical kirchhoff shell theory and the bending strain are approximations to those of koiter sanders shell theory convergence studies as presented in table 5 reveals that 2960 elements are sufficient to models the specimen 3 1 plastic analysis of cone cylinder shell subjected to combined axial compression and thermal loading this section examines the i plastic deformation ii strain and iii stress distribution of cone cylinder shell that buckled under combined axial compression and thermal load the point of interest in this analysis lies on the deformation of the shell along the meridional line e g total shell length of the cone cylinder structure at i collapse and ii post collapse i e 50 of the collapse magnitude regions a comparison was made between the shell subjected to i ambient temperature and ii t 250 c the starting point was taken at the cone top node and end at the bottom node of the cylinder fig 9 presents a dimensionless ratio of deformation to thickness of the cone cylinder shell before the collapse and post collapse corresponding at 50 of buckling load under a condition of temperature i t ambient and ii t 250 c from the given result as expected a large difference of dimensionless ratio of deformation to thickness 93 is seen for the shell under i collapse and ii post collapse conditions nonetheless about 6 of differences was calculated in the comparison between ambient and thermal condition under a post collapse buckling mode the distribution of plastic strains and stresses are depicted in fig 10 a b it worth noting here that the recorded data confirmed 6 differences between ambient and thermal condition at post collapse mode for plastic strain analysis the 6 differences at the post collapse of i dimensionless ratio of deformation to thickness of the cone cylinder shell and its ii plastic strain are associated with the influence of thermal load at the initial phase of the analysis on the other hand since the shell is predominantly axially compressed it explicitly indicates that the deformation mostly takes place at the top section of the shell thus leaving the cylinder end with little plasticity effect interestingly the stress distribution analysis specifies that the collapse mode was marginally higher to the post collapse mode with approximately around 40 see fig 10 b as expected the shell failed at the cone cylinder junction for both conditions i e i ambient and ii t 250 c this can be said to be due to non continuous slope at the cone cylinder junction along the shell meridian thereby ensuing in local bending and circumferential stresses at the intersection zingoni 2002 also under combined loading condition e g thermal and axial compression moving away from the cone cylinder intersection the stress condition in multi segment shell assembly is pre dominantly membrane stress however once the intersection is being approached from either top or bottom of the shell the state of stress changes from membrane stress to a combination of membrane and bending stresses as reported in ismail et al 2019 alternatively some study will recommend strengthening the cone cylinder shell structure by introducing a reinforcement or either increasing the thickness of the shell at the junction ismail et al 2018 schmidt 2018 zingoni et al 2015 from the analysis it is evident that the characteristic of plastic deformation of a cone cylinder shell i e buckled at the intersection is similar to what has been reported for i cylinder cone cylinder shell eccs 1998 ismail et al 2019 and ii torispherical shell błachut 2018a 2018b as those mentioned structures are associated with multi segmented shell assembly 4 comparison of experimental and numerical results fig 11 presents the comparison of collapse load between experimental and numerical analyses of i axial compression alone and ii combined axial compression with elevated temperatures and the corresponding magnitude of collapse load is given in table 4 the numbers in parenthesis denote the ratio of experimental collapse load to that of the numerically predicted load from the results it is apparent that the collapse loads predicted by both material models i e gillie s and eccs are in good agreement with experiment the percentage difference ranging from 2 to 11 and 5 to 2 for gillie and eccs model respectively the average error between experimental and numerical results was found to be 4 4 for gillie mode a and 2 8 for eccs model b furthermore it is apparent from table 4 that gillie s model underestimates the experimental collapse load for all tested cone cylinder shells whereas the eccs model underestimates the cone cylinder shell with an elevated temperature of 0 c and 250 c and overestimate the shell structure with an elevated temperature of 50 c and 150 c the best way to explain this phenomenon is by recounting the uniqueness of the eccs model where the elastic modulus changes accordingly to the temperature hence the use of eccs material model will be employed in the subsequent analysis furthermore it can be observed that at elevated temperature the load carrying capacity of the cone cylinder shell decreases for example passing from 0 c to 150 c the experimental buckling load of the axially compressed cone cylinder shell reduces from 46 49 kn to 40 75 kn about 12 reduction a similar trend was also noticed from the numerical calculations further analysis was conducted to examine the buckling behaviour of cone cylinder shells subjected to combined axial compression and temperature the investigations are devoted to analysing the buckling behaviour of cone cylinder shells under combined loading by considering the effect of i big radius to thickness ratio rcyl t ranging from 72 to 350 ii cone semi vertex angle β i e 10 20 30 and 40 and iii cylinder length to big radius ratio lcyl rcyl of 1 0 1 429 2 143 and 2 857 a typical combined stability plot for cone cylinder shells with rcone rcyl 0 571 rcyl t 72 19 t 0 9588 mm and β 16 89 subjected to combined axial compression and thermal load is presented in fig 12 there is no bifurcation between zero and the collapse load riks method the bifurcation analysis predicts higher buckling load than the riks method since there is no bifurcation in the range of zero to collapse load this confirms that the cone cylinder shell failure is governed by material plasticity rather than structural instability i e elastic buckling the material plasticity failure may be attributed to the small value of radius to thickness ratio rcyl t designed for the tested specimen the load versus deflection curve at point a i e axial compression only is plotted in fig 13 a similar plot at point b combined axial compression and thermal load is shown in fig 14 fig 13 indicates the first yield force fyield and the collapse force fcoll it can be seen that the first yield of the structures occurs at a magnitude of about 67 of the collapse force it is apparent that the load deflection curve is linear up to the first yield force and after the first yield force nonlinear behaviour begins until the collapse force is reached however a different behaviour was observed from fig 14 for combined axial compression and temperature it can be noticed that as a result of the initial thermal loading there is an expansion of the cone cylinder shells and with the application of axial compression load at constant temperature axial shortening of the cone cylinder shell was observed this implies that for axially compressed cone cylinder structures at elevated temperature there are always two changes occurring in the length of the structures they are i expansion in the length resulting from an increase in temperature and ii axial shortening in the length as a result of axial compression of the structure this is quite significant because repeated action of this phenomena i e expansion and contraction in length over a while will lead to fatigue of the cone cylinder shells again it can be observed that at elevated temperature there is a drop in both the first yield force and the collapse force of the shells while the latter is significant about 16 the former is marginal about 2 this can be attributed to the presence of thermal deformation on the cone cylinder shells before the application of the axial compressive load fig 15 presents an interactive plot for cone cylinder shells with different bid radius to thickness ratio rcyl t values all the curves show similar trend except that as the big radius to thickness increases the axial compressive load of the shell reduces a similar result was observed when the cone angle changes from 10 to 40 as shown in fig 16 again increasing the cone angle β results in a reduction in the load carrying capacity of axially compressed cone cylinder shells at elevated temperature although a contrary result was noticed by changing the cylinder length big radius ratio lcyl rcyl as depicted in fig 17 from fig 17 it can be seen that by increasing the cylinder length to big radius ratio has no effect on the collapse load of the cone cylinder shell at elevated temperature above all the parametric studies confirm that radius and semi vertex cone angle effect in changing buckling load of the cone cylinder shell while the length of the cylinder seems to be insignificant in influencing the buckling load this can be attributed to the axially compressed load as those geometries i e cylinder radius and semi vertex cone angle have a greater influence to determine the strength of the cone cylinder shell nonetheless the discontinuity effects at the junction intersection of the cone cylinder shell may be the reason for no changes in the structural load carrying capacity 5 buckling of the imperfect cone cylinder shell under combined loading axial compression and thermal the influence of initial geometric imperfections for cone cylinder shell subjected to combined loading i e i axial compression and ii thermal loading acting simultaneously is discussed in this section for this analysis the cone cylinder shell is fully clamped at the larger and smaller radius end whereas the only axial movement was allowed at the smaller radius end in this section calculations have been carried out by taking an example of cone cylinder shell with configuration of rcyl t 72 19 rcone rcyl 0 571 lcyl rcyl 1 43 and β 16 89 normally the initial geometric imperfections are defined in terms of i imperfection amplitude ii technique and iii location of imperfection thereby in this analysis the computations include i the calculation of imperfection amplitude according to the recommendation by eccs 2008 and ii axisymmetric outward bulge aob technique of imperfection was selected since the failure of shells is predominantly located at the intersection the nonlinear imperfection analysis was carried out with the amplitude of imperfection calculated using the following equation 1 1 l g x 4 r c y l t in referring to the eccs 2008 recommendation of fabrication tolerance quality class c uo max 0 016 the amplitude of imperfection for the examined shell was calculated to be w 0 5214 mm thus consequence the imperfection amplitude to thickness dimensionless ratio w t 0 5437 the imperfection analyses were numerically calculated under the condition of i ambient temperature and ii elevated temperature i e t 250 c typically combined stability envelope for such cone cylinder when geometrically perfect and imperfect are plotted in fig 18 a b the response curves are presented in two 2 domains i e i elastic and ii plastic it can be observed from fig 18 a that the elastic domain of the stability plot experienced a steady curve at f fref domain before significantly decreases around the region of 0 t tref 0 2 on the other hand for the case of imperfect shell the elastic domain of the stability plot experienced a steady curve as well at f fref domain yet prolonged to the area of 0 t tref 0 43 later the plotted imperfect elastic domain curved starts to drastically drop until t tref 1 next the calculated area between the domains of elastic and elastic plastic of combined interactive curve yields to be 50 and 11 54 for perfect and imperfect shells again this seems to be appropriate with the amount of shrinkage experienced by the imperfect shell 11 54 as the decreasing area of elastic plastic for imperfect shell can be attributed to the factors of i imperfection amplitude and ii elevated thermal loading thus further weaken the structure from the given results the stability interaction of imperfect shell was calculated to shrink around 3 in comparison to the perfect ones the decreases in the area for the imperfect shell is comparable to what been reported in ifayefunmi and błachut 2013 on the other hand the small amount of shrinkage calculated for the imperfect shell is likely to be possible as the shell may be considered as a thick shell since the dimensionless radius to thickness ratio was relatively small i e rcyl t 72 19 hence the eccs 2008 guideline may suggest that the consequence of imperfection may not have been severe for the tested cone cylinder structure in affecting its load carrying capacity 6 conclusions this paper presents the first experimental data on the buckling behaviour of cone cylinder shell subjected to combined axial compression and thermal load two nominally identical axially compressed cone cylinder shell at an elevated temperature of 150 c collapse at a very close magnitude i e 41 77 kn vs 40 75 kn hence confirming repeatability of experimental data furthermore there is a good agreement between experimental collapse load and numerically predicted load for the two temperature dependent models considered the percentage difference ranges from 2 to 11 for model a gillie s model and 5 2 for model b eccs model from the ensuing numerical calculation for different geometric parameters the following conclusion can be drawn i the presence of elevated temperature results in a reduction in the load carrying capacity of an axially compressed cone cylinder shell ii increasing the big radius to thickness ratio rcyl t lead to decrease in the collapse load of the cone cylinder shell iii increasing the cone angle β will produce a reduction in the failure load of the cone cylinder shells iv changing the cylinder length to big radius ratio lcyl rcyl does not affect the load carrying capacity of the cone cylinder models and finally v the imperfection amplitude recommended by eccs 2008 guideline was not detrimental in affecting the cone cylinder structure load carrying capacity for the case of imperfection analysis credit authorship contribution statement o

20934,numerical and experimental study on the instability of unstiffened mild steel cone cylinder assembly under simultaneously acting quasi static axial compression and thermal load is presented in this paper results for one model subjected to axial compression were obtained first then the combined action of axial compression and temperature was applied to the remaining four models there was a good correlation between the experimental data and the numerically obtained buckling load for the cone cylinders assembly the percentage difference between experimental to the numerically predicted failure load ranges from 10 to 7 finally the first combined stability domains for cone cylinder assembly under combined axial compression and temperature was presented further study has been conducted to evaluate the buckling effect for cone cylinder shell subjected to combined loading to the change of these parameters i dimensionless radius to thickness ratio rcyl t ii semi vertex cone angle β and iii dimensionless cylinder length to cylinder radius ratio lcyl rcyl finally the influence of structural initial imperfection also has been considered by following the recommendation of eccs 2008 keywords cone cylinder assembly buckling combined loading heating axial compression 1 introduction cone cylinder shells are common structural components in a lot of industrial applications in real life situation such shells are frequently exposed to different loading conditions ranging from single loads such as axial compression bending external or internal pressure thermal torsion to combined loading as a result of the various application of the shell structures it is customary to design cone cylinder wall thickness with respect to their specific application as an example in aeronautic and aerospace applications the cone cylinder shells are predominantly thinner shells in which the failure is controlled by elastic buckling whilst in offshore and marine applications thicker shells which fail mainly by plastic buckling are commonly used in general the cylindrical shell may buckle in three possible modes of failure i axisymmetric collapse ii asymmetric collapse and iii general instability the axisymmetric collapse is described when the structure deforms in a folded shape that develops between the ends of the shell while the asymmetric collapse often in the shape of lobar buckling or panel instability whereas the general instability is characterized by an overall asymmetric collapse of the complete shell nonetheless for the case of cone cylinder shell the failure mode is often in the shape of axisymmetric collapse with buckle mostly occurred at the cone cylinder transition area this type of failure at the intersection according to zingoni 2002 zingoni et al 2015 may be attributed to the development of both circumferential stresses and local bending at the intersection resulting from the non continuous slope of shell meridian at the junction to name a few the works on the discontinuity shell structure were also reported in flores and godoy 1991 teng 1996 zhao and teng 2003 the earlier test shows that axially compressed cylindrical shells failed at a much lower load against the experimental values by less than 30 eccs 1988 this finding also demonstrates the sensitivity of initial imperfection that contribute to a major difference in correlating the numerical and experimental buckling load estimation few examples of experimental works into the buckling behaviour of axially compressed cylinder can be found in błachut 2015 ghazijahani et al 2014 haynie et al 2010 ifayefunmi 2016 ghazijahani et al 2014 introduced the imperfection using the indentation technique at shells mid section with various depth and orientation twenty seven 27 locally dented steel specimens were fabricated and tested the obtained experimental results were benchmark against other studies and standard code guideline it is evident that the type of imperfection i e dent s depth and orientation is critically important in estimating the amount of buckling load together with shell failure pattern formation błachut 2015 tested 18 steel cylindrical shells that categorized by 15 specimens with imperfect length and 3 with the perfect length the cylinders were cnc machined and subjected to axial compression the test data revealed that the failure load of the shell is highly dependent on the magnitude of the axial imperfection i e imperfect length waviness and this was confirmed by the numerical calculation haynie et al 2010 examined the behaviour of axially compressed aluminium cylinders under the influence of lateral load at shell mid section the lateral load was used as an imperfection to estimate cylinder lower bound buckling load numerical results were used to support the experimentation data it was reported that the lateral perturbation is significant in reducing the shell load carrying capacity thus produces a lower bound buckling load ifayefunmi 2016 examined 4 different thickness of mild steel cylinder subjected to axial compressive load the shell considered to be a thick cylinder as rcyl t 100 there was a good correlation between the finite element result and the experimental test data as the differences are within the range of 2 7 experimental investigations into the instability of axially compressed cones are available in blachut and ifayefunmi 2010 blachut et al 2011 błachut et al 2013 ifayefunmi 2015 ifayefunmi błachut 2011 2013 blachut et al 2013 reported a plastic buckling of steel cone by adopting several material models of i elastic perfectly plastic ii engineering stress strain and iii true stress true strain the test results were benchmark against eccs code with 50 difference obtained the differences have also been supported by ifayefunmi 2015 an investigation into the buckling behaviour of axially compressed imperfect cone is presented in ifayefunmi and błachut 2013 few imperfection approaches were adopted such as i eigenmode imperfections and ii axisymmetric outward bulge in numerical part of the report the results reveal that the worst imperfection type is not always the eigenmode imperfections for instance as compared to eigenmode imperfection the localized axisymmetric outward bulge is more severe in reducing the buckling load of the cone to mentioned a few experimental studies on buckling behaviour of reinforced i e stiffened shells under axial compressive load were reported in chryssanthopoulos and poggi 2001 singer et al 1966 spagnoli 1997 2001 spagnoli and chryssanthopoulos 1999 weller and singer 1970 for cone and arbocz et al 1971 singer and rosen 1976 weller and singer 1971 1974 for cylinder early research on cone and or cylinder subjected to thermal loading can be found in abir and nardo 1959 bendavid and singer 1967 bushnell and smith 1971 lu and chang 1967 ross et al 1966 tani 1978 for instance abir and nardo 1959 analyzed the buckling of the cylindrical shell using donnell s equations this is done by assuming constant stresses through the shell thickness and in the longitudinal axial direction while fourier series is used to express thermal stress variation along the circumference of the shell ross et al 1966 using an experimental approach proposed design stability data for uniformly heated fixed thin circular cylinders eleven 11 stainless steel aisi type 304 and 1006 cold rolled cylinders having the radius to thickness ratio of r t 291 and 344 were tested sequence load was applied by introducing the thermal heat load and finished with axial compression the range of temperatures was varied between 30 f 227 f a comparison of the present experimental results indicated a poor comparison of experimental and theoretical calculation anderson 1962 presented a linear theoretical solution for the buckling behaviour of ring stiffened cylinder subjected to combined temperature and axial compressive load experimental works were also included for verification purpose buckling charts that cover a large range of cylinder geometry i e a radius to thickness ratio of 100 r t 2000 are proposed for both fixed and simply supported cylindrical shells the adopted range of temperatures was between 80 f 550 f a technical paper that analyzed the buckling behaviour of space shuttle external tank super light weight liquid oxygen lo2 tank was reported by nemeth et al 1998 1996 two full scale structural tests that were carried out via two prelaunch loading conditions the analyzed results showed thermal load originated from liquid oxygen lo2 was highly apparent to affect the tank buckling load shen 1998 reported a post buckling analysis of unstiffened and stiffened cylinders under external pressure and uniform incremental temperature boundary layers shell buckling theory that includes nonlinear pre buckling deformation effect post buckling nonlinear large deflection effect and shells initial geometric imperfection was adopted the study benchmarked some experimental and numerical results available in the open literature to conclude under combined loading the unstiffened cylinder experienced a stable equilibrium path and becomes non sensitive to imperfection shen et al 1991 1993 numerically analyzed buckling and post buckling behaviour of perfect and imperfect unstiffened and stiffened cylinders subjected to external pressure and axial compressive load comparative results were made with some available experimental data it was reported that the buckling and post buckling behaviour of stiffened and unstiffened cylinders subjected to combined loading strongly depends on three 3 factors i the geometric parameter ii the load proportional parameter and the iii imperfection parameter ifayefunmi and błachut 2011 2013 examined the effect of eigenmode imperfections on the load carrying capacity of relatively thick cones under i axial compression ii external pressure and iii combined loading the asme case code 2286 2 design procedure was used to establish the combined interactive plot for steel cones to identify a portion of safe design operation as reported in ifayefunmi 2014 results of this investigation reveal the limitation of the equivalent cylinders approach in predicting a safe design for relatively thick cone subjected to combined loading to date there has been no information available in the open literature on the stability behaviour of cone cylinder transition shell subjected combined axial compression and thermal loading i e elevated temperature the current paper aims to provide experimental data with the support of numerical results for buckling of cone cylinder shell subjected to i axial compression alone and ii combined axial compression and thermal loading further study has been conducted to evaluate the buckling effect for cone cylinder shell subjected to combined loading to the change of these parameters i dimensionless radius to thickness ratio rcyl t ii semi vertex cone angle β and iii dimensionless cylinder length to cylinder radius ratio lcyl rcyl finally the influence of structural initial imperfection also has been considered by following the eccs 2008 recommendation 2 cone cylinder experimentation 2 1 the fabrication process pre test measurement and material properties five 5 laboratory scaled cone cylinder transition shells cc1 cc2 cc3 cc4 and cc5 were fabricated using 1 mm mild steel sheet as illustrated in fig 1 a the specimens were assumed to have the same nominal geometry and it is given by bigger radius to smaller radius ratio rcone rcyl 0 571 bigger radius to wall thickness ratio rcyl t 70 0 cone angle β 16 7 and the wall thickness t 1 mm whilst the cone axial length and the cylinder axial length was 100 mm respectively it is worth mentioning that the number before abbreviation t and f specifically indicate the sequence of loading during buckling test first tensile test was conducted separately to extract the material data of the mild steel plate six 6 coupon specimens were cut from steel sheet for tensile test the british standard bs en 10002 1 2001 was used in designing the samples three 3 flat coupon were cut in the vertical direction while another three 3 were cut in a horizontal direction of the steel sheet the coupon specimens have not undergone any heat treatment full engineering stress strain were extracted from the tensile test overall the results of the tensile test are given in table 1 it can be seen that the average value of young s modulus was found to be 193 667 gpa conversely the obtained yield stress was 217 97 mpa to note the mild steel material yield point was based on 0 2 of proof stress the average value of young s modulus e and yield stress σyield upper were used in the numerical analysis specimens were cut from 1 mm mild steel plate using waterjet machining after the cutting process the samples were rolled into a conical and cylindrical form using a conventional rolling machine then metal inert gas welding mig was used to weld the seam between the two neighbouring longitudinal free edges of the cones and cylinders separately afterwards the circumferential ends of both cone and cylinder were welded together using the same welding process fig 1b depicts the photograph of the cone cylinder model cc1 after manufacturing to make sure that the test data were repeatability some of the specimens were fabricated and tested under the same loading condition this aims to provide two test results for the tested specimens with the same nominal dimension and loading condition 2 2 collapse test before the buckling test a series of measurements were taken on all the cone cylinder models first measurement of the wall thickness was carried out using micrometre screw gage at different equal distance point along axial length this was then adopted at 36 deg spaced across the circumference table 2 provides the thickness measured data for all the models next the measurement of the inner and outer diameters of the cone cylinder shells was conducted using vernier calliper ten equidistant points were considered during the measurements with the results given in table 3 then the height of the cone slant length of the cone and height of the cylinder were measured using vernier calliper as presented in table 3 cone cylinder specimen cc1 was tested first under axial compression while the remaining cone cylinder models cc2 cc3 cc4 and cc5 were subjected to the combined action of axial compressive load and temperature of 5 150 150 and 250 respectively using 100 kn shimadzu compression machine before testing thick plates were used to covers the specimens at the top and bottom ends as depicted in fig 1b this is presumed to create the necessary boundary condition for the experiment next the cone cylinder shells were inserted between the platens of 100 kn shimadzu machine then the moving crosshead is slowly controlled until the shimadzu platen is touching the specimen thereby establishing contact between them the stepwise axial compressive load was applied to the upper end of the cone cylinder at the speed of 1 mm min for cone cylinder specimen cc1 subjected to axial compression only the use of the temperature chamber was not required as shown in fig 2 an incremental axial load was applied to the cone cylinder shell until the specimen fails to verify the deformation recorded by the machine controller it was decided to use two clock gauges positioned on the top covering plate of the small end of the cone see fig 2 this was done to obtain the actual compression extension of the cone cylinder shell during the experiment however the gauges were not attached to any online system the reading was taken manually hence only one gauge was recorded up to the collapse load fig 3 presents the plot of experimental load versus axial shortening for cone cylinder cc1 from fig 3 it is apparent that readings given by the clock gauge produce a plot that has a similar trend to that of the machine controller also the plot from the clock gauge produces a marginal stiffer slope as compared to the plot from the machine controller this can be attributed to the contribution of the measurement of deformation from the crosshead movement for the remaining cone cylinders shells cc2 cc3 cc4 and cc5 subjected to temperature and axial compressive load the use of the temperature chamber was employed as shown in fig 4 hence the use of the clock gauges was practically impossible during the combined load application the testing procedure was executed in two 2 phases first the specimens were heated to the desired magnitude of the temperature of 50 150 150 and 250 for cone cylinder cc2 cc3 cc4 and cc5 respectively two models cc3 and cc4 were subjected to the same temperature load of 150 this would give two test data for specimens with the same nominal dimension and loading condition then once the desired magnitude of temperature is reached in the second phase keeping the temperature load constant an incremental axial compression load is applied to the models until the specimen collapse fig 5 presents the plot of experimental load versus axial shortening for cone cylinder models with different temperature the corresponding magnitude of the experimental collapse load is given in table 4 from the trend displayed in table 4 it is apparent that as the temperature goes up the failure load of the cone cylinder specimen decreases again it is apparent that two identical specimens with the same loading condition cc3 and cc4 produce a close experimental collapse load hence confirming repeatability of the experimental data fig 6 depicts the photograph of all specimens after being tested all models failed in an axisymmetric pattern with junction transition area being the most severed while the conical and cylinder part remained in membrane state the failure mostly occurred in the form of bending at the junction due to concentrated discontinuity stresses expectedly this behaviour can be said to as a result of non continuous membrane stress at the junction reflecting the localized and rapidly changing behaviour of bending disturbance that is when subjected to combined loading the state of stress in the cone cylinder assembly is majorly membrane stress away from the intersection however moving closer to the intersection from either the top or the bottom ends the stress state in the cone cylinder changes from membrane stress to a combination of bending and membrane stress zingoni 2002 3 cone cylinder numerical modelling numerical predictions were carried out via abaqus fe software to i serve as a benchmark for the experimental data and ii provide further analysis for cone cylinder shells with varying geometric parameter this appears to be important to ascertain the appropriateness of the modelling techniques adopted in this paper the shell is assumed to be from mild steel with young s modulus e 193 667 gpa and yield stress σyield 217 97 mpa obtained from the experiment see section 2 1 for more detail the poisson s ratio ν 0 3 extracted from the material datasheet the value of thermal coefficient of expansion was set to be constant for both material models α 10 10 6 c three 3 types of material models were used in the study they are i elastic perfectly plastic ii gillie 2009 and iii eccs 1989 elastic perfectly plastic was exclusively used for the shell under axial compression only in the finite element calculations j2 flow plasticity theory was adopted whereas for cone cylinder shell subjected to combined temperature and axial compression temperature dependent material data were used adopting the gillie and eccs material models fig 7 shows the responses of elastic modulus of the mild steel according to the changes of temperature for both material models i e gillie and eccs a similar plot showing the yield stress response is presented in fig 8 from figs 7 and 8 it can be observed that the eccs model considered changes both elastic modulus and yield stress according to the increment of temperature although gillie s model only considered a change of yield stress with constant elastic modulus the shell is assumed to be fully clamped at the base i e bottom the top of the shell is also restrained to move in any direction except in axial direction since the shell is a joining assembly between cone and cylinder it should be treated differently in terms of buckling analysis unlikely single shell e g cone and cylinder as it may possess the discontinuity stress effect schmidt 2018 the continuity equation of displacement at the cone cylinder intersection is expressed by ux cyl ūx con uy cyl ūy con and uz cyl uz con from the designation above u corresponds to displacements with local coordinate represented as ux uy uz and global coordinate as ūx ūy ūz whilst ф correspond to rotations shells were subjected to combined temperature and axial compression the loading sequence was carried out in two 2 phases they are i first the shell is subjected to temperature i e thermal load to the desired magnitude and ii keeping the temperature constant axial compression load is then applied to the model until collapse nonlinear static riks analysis was employed in the numerical analysis in the finite element analysis four node shell element having six degrees of freedom s4r in abaqus element library was employed as implemented in abaqus software the s4r shell element provide solutions to shell problems that are adequately described by classical kirchhoff shell theory and the bending strain are approximations to those of koiter sanders shell theory convergence studies as presented in table 5 reveals that 2960 elements are sufficient to models the specimen 3 1 plastic analysis of cone cylinder shell subjected to combined axial compression and thermal loading this section examines the i plastic deformation ii strain and iii stress distribution of cone cylinder shell that buckled under combined axial compression and thermal load the point of interest in this analysis lies on the deformation of the shell along the meridional line e g total shell length of the cone cylinder structure at i collapse and ii post collapse i e 50 of the collapse magnitude regions a comparison was made between the shell subjected to i ambient temperature and ii t 250 c the starting point was taken at the cone top node and end at the bottom node of the cylinder fig 9 presents a dimensionless ratio of deformation to thickness of the cone cylinder shell before the collapse and post collapse corresponding at 50 of buckling load under a condition of temperature i t ambient and ii t 250 c from the given result as expected a large difference of dimensionless ratio of deformation to thickness 93 is seen for the shell under i collapse and ii post collapse conditions nonetheless about 6 of differences was calculated in the comparison between ambient and thermal condition under a post collapse buckling mode the distribution of plastic strains and stresses are depicted in fig 10 a b it worth noting here that the recorded data confirmed 6 differences between ambient and thermal condition at post collapse mode for plastic strain analysis the 6 differences at the post collapse of i dimensionless ratio of deformation to thickness of the cone cylinder shell and its ii plastic strain are associated with the influence of thermal load at the initial phase of the analysis on the other hand since the shell is predominantly axially compressed it explicitly indicates that the deformation mostly takes place at the top section of the shell thus leaving the cylinder end with little plasticity effect interestingly the stress distribution analysis specifies that the collapse mode was marginally higher to the post collapse mode with approximately around 40 see fig 10 b as expected the shell failed at the cone cylinder junction for both conditions i e i ambient and ii t 250 c this can be said to be due to non continuous slope at the cone cylinder junction along the shell meridian thereby ensuing in local bending and circumferential stresses at the intersection zingoni 2002 also under combined loading condition e g thermal and axial compression moving away from the cone cylinder intersection the stress condition in multi segment shell assembly is pre dominantly membrane stress however once the intersection is being approached from either top or bottom of the shell the state of stress changes from membrane stress to a combination of membrane and bending stresses as reported in ismail et al 2019 alternatively some study will recommend strengthening the cone cylinder shell structure by introducing a reinforcement or either increasing the thickness of the shell at the junction ismail et al 2018 schmidt 2018 zingoni et al 2015 from the analysis it is evident that the characteristic of plastic deformation of a cone cylinder shell i e buckled at the intersection is similar to what has been reported for i cylinder cone cylinder shell eccs 1998 ismail et al 2019 and ii torispherical shell błachut 2018a 2018b as those mentioned structures are associated with multi segmented shell assembly 4 comparison of experimental and numerical results fig 11 presents the comparison of collapse load between experimental and numerical analyses of i axial compression alone and ii combined axial compression with elevated temperatures and the corresponding magnitude of collapse load is given in table 4 the numbers in parenthesis denote the ratio of experimental collapse load to that of the numerically predicted load from the results it is apparent that the collapse loads predicted by both material models i e gillie s and eccs are in good agreement with experiment the percentage difference ranging from 2 to 11 and 5 to 2 for gillie and eccs model respectively the average error between experimental and numerical results was found to be 4 4 for gillie mode a and 2 8 for eccs model b furthermore it is apparent from table 4 that gillie s model underestimates the experimental collapse load for all tested cone cylinder shells whereas the eccs model underestimates the cone cylinder shell with an elevated temperature of 0 c and 250 c and overestimate the shell structure with an elevated temperature of 50 c and 150 c the best way to explain this phenomenon is by recounting the uniqueness of the eccs model where the elastic modulus changes accordingly to the temperature hence the use of eccs material model will be employed in the subsequent analysis furthermore it can be observed that at elevated temperature the load carrying capacity of the cone cylinder shell decreases for example passing from 0 c to 150 c the experimental buckling load of the axially compressed cone cylinder shell reduces from 46 49 kn to 40 75 kn about 12 reduction a similar trend was also noticed from the numerical calculations further analysis was conducted to examine the buckling behaviour of cone cylinder shells subjected to combined axial compression and temperature the investigations are devoted to analysing the buckling behaviour of cone cylinder shells under combined loading by considering the effect of i big radius to thickness ratio rcyl t ranging from 72 to 350 ii cone semi vertex angle β i e 10 20 30 and 40 and iii cylinder length to big radius ratio lcyl rcyl of 1 0 1 429 2 143 and 2 857 a typical combined stability plot for cone cylinder shells with rcone rcyl 0 571 rcyl t 72 19 t 0 9588 mm and β 16 89 subjected to combined axial compression and thermal load is presented in fig 12 there is no bifurcation between zero and the collapse load riks method the bifurcation analysis predicts higher buckling load than the riks method since there is no bifurcation in the range of zero to collapse load this confirms that the cone cylinder shell failure is governed by material plasticity rather than structural instability i e elastic buckling the material plasticity failure may be attributed to the small value of radius to thickness ratio rcyl t designed for the tested specimen the load versus deflection curve at point a i e axial compression only is plotted in fig 13 a similar plot at point b combined axial compression and thermal load is shown in fig 14 fig 13 indicates the first yield force fyield and the collapse force fcoll it can be seen that the first yield of the structures occurs at a magnitude of about 67 of the collapse force it is apparent that the load deflection curve is linear up to the first yield force and after the first yield force nonlinear behaviour begins until the collapse force is reached however a different behaviour was observed from fig 14 for combined axial compression and temperature it can be noticed that as a result of the initial thermal loading there is an expansion of the cone cylinder shells and with the application of axial compression load at constant temperature axial shortening of the cone cylinder shell was observed this implies that for axially compressed cone cylinder structures at elevated temperature there are always two changes occurring in the length of the structures they are i expansion in the length resulting from an increase in temperature and ii axial shortening in the length as a result of axial compression of the structure this is quite significant because repeated action of this phenomena i e expansion and contraction in length over a while will lead to fatigue of the cone cylinder shells again it can be observed that at elevated temperature there is a drop in both the first yield force and the collapse force of the shells while the latter is significant about 16 the former is marginal about 2 this can be attributed to the presence of thermal deformation on the cone cylinder shells before the application of the axial compressive load fig 15 presents an interactive plot for cone cylinder shells with different bid radius to thickness ratio rcyl t values all the curves show similar trend except that as the big radius to thickness increases the axial compressive load of the shell reduces a similar result was observed when the cone angle changes from 10 to 40 as shown in fig 16 again increasing the cone angle β results in a reduction in the load carrying capacity of axially compressed cone cylinder shells at elevated temperature although a contrary result was noticed by changing the cylinder length big radius ratio lcyl rcyl as depicted in fig 17 from fig 17 it can be seen that by increasing the cylinder length to big radius ratio has no effect on the collapse load of the cone cylinder shell at elevated temperature above all the parametric studies confirm that radius and semi vertex cone angle effect in changing buckling load of the cone cylinder shell while the length of the cylinder seems to be insignificant in influencing the buckling load this can be attributed to the axially compressed load as those geometries i e cylinder radius and semi vertex cone angle have a greater influence to determine the strength of the cone cylinder shell nonetheless the discontinuity effects at the junction intersection of the cone cylinder shell may be the reason for no changes in the structural load carrying capacity 5 buckling of the imperfect cone cylinder shell under combined loading axial compression and thermal the influence of initial geometric imperfections for cone cylinder shell subjected to combined loading i e i axial compression and ii thermal loading acting simultaneously is discussed in this section for this analysis the cone cylinder shell is fully clamped at the larger and smaller radius end whereas the only axial movement was allowed at the smaller radius end in this section calculations have been carried out by taking an example of cone cylinder shell with configuration of rcyl t 72 19 rcone rcyl 0 571 lcyl rcyl 1 43 and β 16 89 normally the initial geometric imperfections are defined in terms of i imperfection amplitude ii technique and iii location of imperfection thereby in this analysis the computations include i the calculation of imperfection amplitude according to the recommendation by eccs 2008 and ii axisymmetric outward bulge aob technique of imperfection was selected since the failure of shells is predominantly located at the intersection the nonlinear imperfection analysis was carried out with the amplitude of imperfection calculated using the following equation 1 1 l g x 4 r c y l t in referring to the eccs 2008 recommendation of fabrication tolerance quality class c uo max 0 016 the amplitude of imperfection for the examined shell was calculated to be w 0 5214 mm thus consequence the imperfection amplitude to thickness dimensionless ratio w t 0 5437 the imperfection analyses were numerically calculated under the condition of i ambient temperature and ii elevated temperature i e t 250 c typically combined stability envelope for such cone cylinder when geometrically perfect and imperfect are plotted in fig 18 a b the response curves are presented in two 2 domains i e i elastic and ii plastic it can be observed from fig 18 a that the elastic domain of the stability plot experienced a steady curve at f fref domain before significantly decreases around the region of 0 t tref 0 2 on the other hand for the case of imperfect shell the elastic domain of the stability plot experienced a steady curve as well at f fref domain yet prolonged to the area of 0 t tref 0 43 later the plotted imperfect elastic domain curved starts to drastically drop until t tref 1 next the calculated area between the domains of elastic and elastic plastic of combined interactive curve yields to be 50 and 11 54 for perfect and imperfect shells again this seems to be appropriate with the amount of shrinkage experienced by the imperfect shell 11 54 as the decreasing area of elastic plastic for imperfect shell can be attributed to the factors of i imperfection amplitude and ii elevated thermal loading thus further weaken the structure from the given results the stability interaction of imperfect shell was calculated to shrink around 3 in comparison to the perfect ones the decreases in the area for the imperfect shell is comparable to what been reported in ifayefunmi and błachut 2013 on the other hand the small amount of shrinkage calculated for the imperfect shell is likely to be possible as the shell may be considered as a thick shell since the dimensionless radius to thickness ratio was relatively small i e rcyl t 72 19 hence the eccs 2008 guideline may suggest that the consequence of imperfection may not have been severe for the tested cone cylinder structure in affecting its load carrying capacity 6 conclusions this paper presents the first experimental data on the buckling behaviour of cone cylinder shell subjected to combined axial compression and thermal load two nominally identical axially compressed cone cylinder shell at an elevated temperature of 150 c collapse at a very close magnitude i e 41 77 kn vs 40 75 kn hence confirming repeatability of experimental data furthermore there is a good agreement between experimental collapse load and numerically predicted load for the two temperature dependent models considered the percentage difference ranges from 2 to 11 for model a gillie s model and 5 2 for model b eccs model from the ensuing numerical calculation for different geometric parameters the following conclusion can be drawn i the presence of elevated temperature results in a reduction in the load carrying capacity of an axially compressed cone cylinder shell ii increasing the big radius to thickness ratio rcyl t lead to decrease in the collapse load of the cone cylinder shell iii increasing the cone angle β will produce a reduction in the failure load of the cone cylinder shells iv changing the cylinder length to big radius ratio lcyl rcyl does not affect the load carrying capacity of the cone cylinder models and finally v the imperfection amplitude recommended by eccs 2008 guideline was not detrimental in affecting the cone cylinder structure load carrying capacity for the case of imperfection analysis credit authorship contribution statement o
