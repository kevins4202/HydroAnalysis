9375,regulated deficit irrigation rdi during hull split can reduce water applied in almond orchards strategies for imposing rdi in almond orchards with multiple varieties with different hull split schedules have not been extensively developed commonly irrigation system design requires the same irrigation schedule for all varieties in the orchard a 2 year study evaluated the impacts of two different regulated deficit irrigation strategies in an almond orchard with butte aldrich and nonpareil varieties in the sacramento valley of california usa the two strategies were 1 rdi in all varieties during nonpareil hull split timing and 2 rdi according to variety specific hull split timing the two levels of irrigation were 50 and 75 of potential crop evapotranspiration et c replacement during the hull split period results show that the kernel thickness of the aldrich almonds increased under 75 et c irrigation replacement during the aldrich hull split period compared to 75 et c and 50 et c irrigation replacement during the nonpareil hull split period in the butte almonds 75 et c and 50 et c irrigation replacement during variety specific hull split reduced the fraction of sealed shells of the butte variety compared to 75 et c and 50 et c irrigation replacement during the nonpareil hull split period this study demonstrated that an irrigation system design that allows for the independent irrigation scheduling of each variety can change the almond physical quality in the butte and aldrich varieties rdi according to variety specific hull split did not result in significant marketable kernel yield improvements after two years of imposing the irrigation strategies more research should be conducted for different orchard designs varieties and climates keywords evapotranspiration navel orangeworm midday stem water potential soil water content light interception water use efficiency 1 introduction uncertainty of water availability is a significant concern for almond farmers california usa is the world leader in almond production with a 6 09 billion usd almond industry covering almost 619 000 ha in 2019 california department of food and agriculture 2020 2019 increasing acreage of almonds and uncertainty about water deliveries from the sacramento san joaquin delta has contributed to a greater demand for groundwater by farmers harter 2015 the increased pressure on groundwater as a water resource for agriculture effectively led to the passage of the sustainable groundwater management act sgma in 2014 which will ultimately limit the amount of groundwater that farmers can pump to halt groundwater overdraft pavley 2014 furthermore climate change has resulted in increased uncertainty of water availability for agriculture and increased crop water demands a trend that is expected to continue in the future pathak et al 2018 improvements in water use efficiency must be developed to address uncertainties in water availability due to climate change water policies and water scarcity in january 2019 the almond board of california set a goal of reducing the amount of water used to produce a pound of almonds by 20 by the year 2025 almond board of california 2019 meeting this goal could involve irrigating less than 100 potential crop evapotranspiration et c through regulated deficit irrigation rdi rdi is a strategy that involves applying less than 100 et c during specific phenological stages when a crop is less sensitive to water deficit to reduce water use while avoiding severe losses in crop productivity zhang and theib 1999 hull split is one phenological stage when almond yield is less sensitive to deficit irrigation stewart et al 2011 mild to moderate rdi at hull split can reduce water applied the incidence of hull rot and the number of sticktights i e hulls that don t split goldhamer et al 2006 teviotdale et al 2001 the relationship between applied water and yield in almond orchards is nonlinear so rdi has the potential to reduce the amount of water used to produce a pound of almonds goldhamer and fereres 2017 for example an overall seasonal irrigation treatment of 55 et c with deficit irrigation biased towards the pre harvest period reduced kernel dry weight by 17 compared to the control showing that major reductions in water applied through rdi may result in comparatively moderate reductions in yield for almond orchards goldhamer et al 2006 the research shows that rdi during hull split is a suitable strategy for considerably reducing water applied a complication of rdi during hull split is that orchards with multiple varieties have different hull split schedules with hull split initiating between late june to mid august depending on the variety in the sacramento valley of california connell et al 2010 most commercial almond varieties are self incompatible so almond orchards usually have two or three different varieties for effective cross pollination hamby and zalom 2013 typically each tree row has the same variety and the rows alternate between varieties irrigation systems are usually designed for irrigating the entire orchard on the same irrigation schedule farmers who cut back irrigation during hull split usually do so according to the hull split schedule of the nonpareil variety in california farmers typically favor irrigation toward optimizing the yield and quality of the nonpareil which is the most valuable almond variety in california almond board of california 2015 however other varieties in the same orchard may not be optimally irrigated according to the variety specific phenological stages research is lacking on implementing rdi by variety in california usa even though approximately 97 of california s almond orchards have more than one variety california department of food and agriculture 2019 some research has been done in spain in a study in spain three almond varieties received various deficit irrigation amounts and the marta variety was more sensitive to drought conditions than the other varieties according to stem water potential and stomatal conductance measurements indicating the need to consider variety as a factor in irrigation scheduling guti√©rrez gordillo et al 2019 this paper aims to evaluate the almond yield and quality effects of two irrigation strategies during hull split 1 the conventional practice of rdi during nonpareil hull split in all varieties in the orchard and 2 an advanced rdi strategy during variety specific hull split the hypothesis was that rdi during hull split by variety could improve yield and quality compared to the conventional practice the goal is to evaluate if the ability to irrigate by row i e by variety is important to the irrigation system design of cross pollinating almond orchards 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted at a 1 6 hectare almond prunus dulcis orchard of mature cv nonpareil aldrich and butte trees planted on peach rootstock 4 3 m tree spacing 6 m row spacing located near arbuckle california united states 38 97 n 122 07 w the climate of the region is semi arid mediterranean with warm dry summers and cool wet winters the soil was sandy loam with a gravel layer at approximately 1 m below the soil surface total precipitation during the irrigation season between 1 march and 15 september was 106 mm in 2019 and 23 mm in 2020 obtained from the california irrigation management information system station in williams ca 11 miles from the experimental site an unusually dry winter occurred in 2020 with zero precipitation during february fig 1 shows the elevation silt and sand content in the top 30 cm the root zone depth was about 1 m typical for mature almond orchards each row of the orchard was irrigated with two lines of polyethylene drip tubing 18 mm diameter with 38 cm emitter spacing and an average emitter flow rate of 1 9 l h 2 2 experimental design and treatments table 1 shows the experimental treatments for the butte and aldrich varieties these treatments were selected to compare the two irrigation strategies 1 the conventional practice of rdi during nonpareil hull split in all varieties in the orchard and 2 an advanced rdi strategy during variety specific hull split the nonpareil butte and aldrich rows of each block had a control treatment s1 75 et c during nonpareil hull split and s3 50 et c during nonpareil hull split representing the conventional timing for rdi in addition the aldrich and butte rows of each block had treatments s2 75 et c during variety specific hull split and s4 50 et c during variety specific hull split representing the advanced strategy of rdi by variety in nonpareil s1 and s2 would be identical and s3 and s4 would be identical so this paper will only mention s1 and s3 in nonpareil in this paper additional land was available for an additional irrigation strategy so the nonpareil row in each block had the well watered irrigation practice s5 100 et c during nonpareil hull split in total there were 15 rows and each row contained approximately 50 trees each of the four subplots within each row contained approximately 10 trees allowing approximately five trees to serve as border trees at the ends of each row all trees in a row are the same variety and the rows alternate by variety the rows of trees cannot be moved so randomization of the variety factor was not possible using the land available for the experiment the orchard was divided into five main blocks or replications each block divided vertically into three rows i e one for each variety each block was split horizontally into four sections in a strip plot experimental design resulting in 12 subplots in each block since there were concerns of lateral movement of water in the soil between adjacent subplots it made sense to strip the rows in a strip plot design and randomize the irrigation among the strips 2 3 irrigation scheduling a wireless network of solenoid valves controlled the irrigation in all 60 subplots one solenoid valve actuator circuit board controlled all four irrigation treatments in each row in 2019 the solenoid valve actuator circuit boards used were developed by metronome systems berkeley ca while those used in 2020 were developed at the university of california davis coates et al 2013 the remote valve actuator system required manually inputting the irrigation runtimes for all 60 subplots into a website every irrigation irrigation runtimes were determined based on et c which was calculated using the single crop coefficient method shown by eq 1 where et c is the potential crop evapotranspiration et o is the reference evapotranspiration of a well watered grass surface and k c is the crop coefficient specific to the growth stage and crop allen et al 1998 1 etc eto kc et o was obtained from the williams california irrigation management information system cimis station obtained from the cimis penman equation which uses a wind function developed at university of california davis and unique cloud factor values for each cimis station location https cimis water ca gov resources aspx k c values of 1 15 1 17 and 1 12 were used in july august and september respectively goldhamer and girona 2012 etc was 221 205 and 163 mm in july august and september in 2019 etc was 238 195 and 154 mm in july august and september in 2020 which were close to 2019 cumulative et c mm since the previous irrigation was converted into a runtime using the area of the subplot the emitter specifications and the rdi reduction for each treatment a plant spacing of 4 3 m row spacing of 6 m and an emission uniformity of 90 were used to calculate a net application rate i n of 0 147 cm per hour using eq 2 2 i n k eu 100 e q a s p s r where k is 0 1 for unit conversion e is the number of emitters per plant 22 q a is the emission point discharge 1 9 l h s p is the distance between plants in the row 4 3 m and s r is the distance between plant rows 6 m actual irrigation applied was measured using a water meter in each of the 60 subplots twice a week neptune t 10 ¬æ potable water meter tallassee alabama usa before hull split initiation the orchard was irrigated by the farmer guided by a watermark sensor at one location in the orchard careful observation of hull split initiation led to the decision of when to begin rdi treatments although the trees at the ends of the rows began hull split first rdi treatments were postponed until most of the trees in the inner parts of the orchard showed approximately 1 hull split initiation typically starting at the top of the trees the blank nuts no kernel inside the shell usually begin splitting about a week before the sound nuts kernel inside so careful observations were made to wait until sound nuts began splitting the 1 hull split initiation harvest pickup dates and days between 1 hull split initiation and harvest in 2019 and 2020 are shown in table 2 the number of days between 1 hull split initiation and harvest i e shaking of the nuts to the ground influenced the total amount of water applied in each rdi treatment in this study 2 4 midday stem water potential and soil water content neutron probe counts were measured at 30 cm 60 cm 90 cm 120 cm and 150 cm depths using a neutron probe cpn 503 elite hydroprobe instrotek raleigh north carolina usa measurements were done in all subplots twice a week between april and september of both years of the experiment and usually immediately before irrigation a local calibration equation was developed using volumetric soil samples collected at 30 cm and 60 cm depths from the study field in 2020 using a madera probe with a soil volume of 66 cc n 11 r2 0 86 the bulk density was measured using the same soil samples and was between 1 28 and 1 72 g cc the neutron probe counts were converted into volumetric soil water content with the calibration equation for each subplot average soil water content was calculated for the top 150 cm of the soil measurements less than 0 05 m3 m 3 were ignored because there was too much uncertainty in the calibration equation at low volumetric water content midday stem water potential mswp was measured using a pressure chamber model 615d pms instruments albany oregon usa measurements were done in all subplots on most occasions that neutron probe counts were measured which was usually immediately before irrigation the mswp measurements were used as feedback for irrigation adequacy typically all treatments were irrigated once every three or four days 2 5 almond yield quality and water use efficiency the almonds were harvested with a mechanical shaker on the dates listed in table 2 using a shockwave sprint model made by orchard machinery corporation omc in yuba city ca usa the almonds dried on the orchard ground for 12 15 days after the trees were shaken then the almonds were picked up for total yield and almond sample collection all almonds in each subplot were picked up with a harvesting machine and total yield was measured with a load cell based scale retrofitted onto a tractor that picks up the almonds off the ground at harvest of each variety the total yield was multiplied by the fraction of kernel weight to the total weight hulls shells and kernels to determine the kernel yield of each subplot the marketable kernel yield measurements were reduced by 10 to account for rocks leaves and other debris collected with the almonds based on expert consultation with the farm advisor of the almond orchard the orchard ground was thoroughly conditioned with a blower to remove most of the pre existing debris before the harvest so only a 10 correction was needed to account for leaves from the harvest and any rocks not moved by the blower unlike at larger commercial orchards which may have less thorough conditioning and may require a larger correction than 10 almond samples were collected at harvest in all subplots of each variety for a physical nut quality analysis the quality analysis included quantifying 1 the number of sealed shells out of 50 shells 2 weights of 50 hulls 50 inshell kernels and 50 shelled kernels 3 counts of double twin blank gum severe shrivel and insect damage detected in 50 almonds and 4 measurements of kernel length width and thickness of 10 kernels lined up end to end in a row side by side and flipped each possible way length width and height nonpareil is a soft shelled almond whereas aldrich and butte are hard shelled almonds so it is expected that nonpareil would have fewer sealed shells per 50 than aldrich and butte almonds almond board of california 2015 double is when two separate embryos form and grow into two individual almonds located in the same shell twin is when a single almond has two radicals blank is when a kernel did not develop within the shell gum is a rust colored hard and shiny resin that sometimes is clear almond kernel shrivel can occur on almond trees planted on peach rootstock and is caused by the peach yellow leafroll phytoplasma adaskaveg et al 2017 kernel irrigation water use efficiency kiwue was calculated as the ratio of marketable almond yield the kernels y kg divided by the total amount of irrigation from march 1st to harvest i mm as shown in eq 3 3 kiwue y i 2 6 light interception photosynthetically active radiation par intercepted by the canopy was measured at solar noon in each subplot on 14 june 2019 20 july 2019 8 june 2020 and 2 august 2020 par intercepted by the canopy has been well correlated with kernel yield in almond trees lampinen et al 2012 the par measurements were intended to corroborate the yield measurements measurements were done using a mobile par measurement system lampinen et al 2012 data from the left and right sides of the mobile par measurement system were kept separate to allow partitioning of canopy par interception for each variety independently 2 7 statistical analysis statistical comparisons were made across the irrigation strategies of each variety to assess differences in marketable kernel yield various almond physical quality measurements and canopy par interception using analysis of variance anova the main objective of the statistical comparisons was to identify significant differences in the response variables due to the irrigation strategy for each variety significant differences in yield or quality across irrigation strategies could help inform a farmer whether to design their irrigation system to have the ability to irrigate by row i e by variety the blocking effect was included because there was a pre existing yield and plant canopy size gradient with larger yields and canopy going from east to west furthermore a previous experiment in 2016 2017 involved rdi treatments in blocks 1 3 and full irrigation in blocks 4 5 in the nonpareil rows kizer et al 2017 data were analyzed using the proc glimmix procedure in sas https support sas com rnd app stat procedures glimmix html means were separated at the 0 05 significance level using the tukey type least squares means lsmeans procedure in sas a two factor strip plot anova model with variety and irrigation factors shown in eq 4 was tested but did not detect significant differences across irrigation strategies in eq 4 yijk is the response variable Œº is the overall mean i is the block effect Œ±j is the variety effect Œ¥ij is the whole plot error of the variety factor Œ≤k is the irrigation effect Œªik is the whole plot error of the irrigation factor Œ±Œ≤ ij is the interaction between variety and irrigation factors and Œµijk is the experimental error term 4 yijk Œº i Œ±j Œ±œÅ ij Œ≤k œÅŒ≤ ik Œ±Œ≤ ij Œµijk there are several implications to the strip plot experimental design the whole plot a treatment is confounded with the whole plots of factor a the whole plot b treatment is confounded with the whole plots of factor b the strip plot design tends to sacrifice precision in testing the main effects but improves precision in testing interaction effects eq 5 shows the anova model used in this study where yij is the response variable Œº is the overall mean i is the block effect Œ≤j is the irrigation effect œÅŒ≤ ij is the interaction between the block effect and the irrigation effect and Œµij is the experimental error term 5 yij Œº i Œ≤j œÅŒ≤ ij Œµij separate anova tests following the model in eq 5 were done on each of the three varieties to optimize the precision of the irrigation effect significant differences not detected by the two factor strip plot anova model from eq 4 were detected in the single factor anova model from eq 5 the variety factor in the two factor strip plot anova model had an overwhelming effect on the almond physical quality and marketable kernel yield so differences within a variety due to the irrigation treatments were less detectable by the two factor strip plot anova model therefore it made sense to do a single factor anova on each variety to optimize the precision of the irrigation effect of a single variety at a time strong variety effects likely due to genetics were so dominant that irrigation effects played a small role in the overall effect on the physical quality parameters so it was not possible to see the irrigation effect on the physical quality parameters unless a single factor anova was done on each variety the purpose of the study was to identify the most optimal irrigation regime for each variety in terms of various response variables so the variety main effect was not of primary interest to this study in reality a farmer would need to decide the best irrigation strategy for each variety independently of the other varieties so eq 5 aligns better with real irrigation decisions 3 results 3 1 cumulative irrigation the grower scheduled the irrigation before the experimental treatments began in july in 2019 the grower applied 327 mm of water between 12 april 2019 and the beginning of july in 2020 the grower applied 554 mm of water between 3 march 2020 and the beginning of july the grower applied more irrigation in the spring of 2020 due to less precipitation compared to 2020 table 3 shows the total water applied from leaf out to harvest in all the irrigation treatments of each variety differences in total water applied between irrigation treatments were small because the periods of the rdi treatments ranged between only 32 and 46 days as shown in table 2 compared to the total irrigation season for the year of approximately 240 days march to october the total water applied shown in table 3 does not include the post harvest irrigation between september and november fig 2 shows the cumulative water applied since the grower began irrigation in the spring from each irrigation treatment in each variety as the average of five replicates in 2019 in the aldrich variety s2 and s4 were at 100 et c until aldrich hull split started on 27 july 2019 so s2 and s4 trees received more water at the beginning of the season than s1 and s3 which were at 75 et c and 50 et c beginning on 09 july 2019 when nonpareil hull split initiated by harvest on 11 september 2019 s2 received the most water of the irrigation treatments in aldrich because it was irrigated at the 75 et c rate during hull split and the rdi treatment was initiated for fewer days than s1 and s3 due to variety differences in the period between 1 hull split initiation and harvest as shown in table 2 there were some differences in water applied between s2 and s4 before aldrich hull split due to malfunctions with the irrigation system on 25 july 2019 although they should have both received the same amount of water at the 100 et c rate in the butte variety s2 and s4 were at 100 etc until butte hull split started on 07 august 2019 so s2 and s4 trees received more water at the beginning of the season than s1 and s3 which were at 75 et c and 50 et c beginning on 09 july 2019 when nonpareil hull split initiated water applied increased in s1 and s3 after the nonpareil trees were harvested on 22 august 2019 by harvest on 11 september s2 received the most water of the irrigation treatments in butte because it was irrigated at the 75 et c rate during hull split and the rdi treatment was initiated for fewer days than s1 and s3 due to variety differences in the period between 1 hull split initiation and harvest as shown in table 2 in the nonpareil variety s5 was irrigated at 100 et c and received the most water of all the treatments s1 received 75 et c and s3 received 50 et c nonpareil during hull split which began on 09 july 2019 a plateau in cumulative water applied in all the irrigation treatments began around 03 august 2019 as the grower restricted irrigation to dry the orchard ground in preparation for the harvest activities the irrigation strategies in 2020 follow the same pattern as described for 2019 3 2 irrigation effect on soil water content fig 3 a through h shows the average volumetric soil water content in the top 150 cm in all the irrigation treatments of each variety in 2019 most soil water content measurements were taken immediately before irrigation when the soil water content was expected to be low large standard deviations were found in the soil water content in each treatment this was likely due to spatial variations in water holding capacity due to heterogeneity in the soil texture or topographic influences on distribution uniformity the soil water content was not the same across all subplots of the orchard under the grower s irrigation due to spatial variability in soil texture shown by fig 1 this spatial variability in soil water content affected the soil water content when the rdi treatments began in general the soil water content followed the pattern of the irrigation strategies irrigation by aldrich hull split schedule led to higher soil water content compared to irrigation according to the conventional strategy at the 75 et c level figure a and e but not clearly at the 50 et c level in 2019 and 2020 fig 3 c and g in the aldrich variety there was a malfunction with the irrigation system on 25 july 2019 so s1 had a large unintended spike in soil water content the grower irrigated on 19 august 2019 so all the treatments had approximately the same soil water content on that day after the nonpareil harvest on 22 august 2019 treatments s1 and s3 entered the 100 et c irrigation stage and soil water content increased although it took longer for s3 to replenish the soil water content due to having been under more limited irrigation before harvest the two nonpareil based hull split treatments s1 and s3 increased in soil water content in september after the completion of harvest activities the soil water content of s2 and s4 remained low until the aldrich harvest on 11 september 2019 a malfunction with the irrigation system resulted in unintended extra irrigation in s4 on 28 august 2019 although it should have followed the trend of s2 irrigation by the conventional strategy led to similar soil water content in butte at the 75 etc level in 2019 and 2020 fig 3 b and f irrigation by butte hull split schedule resulted in consistently higher soil water content in august at the 50 etc level s4 fig 3 d and h 3 3 irrigation effect on midday stem water potential fig 4 shows the midday stem water potential mswp in the aldrich and butte varieties highlighting the differences between the conventional irrigation strategies s1 and s3 and the irrigation by variety strategies s2 and s4 the mswp measurements are shown in mpa where 1 mpa is equal to 10 bars most mswp measurements were taken immediately before irrigation when the mswp was expected to be low high water stress in the aldrich variety the average mswp in 2019 and 2020 respectively were 1 6 and 1 5 mpa in s1 1 3 and 1 2 mpa in s2 1 7 and 1 6 mpa in s3 and 1 6 and 1 6 mpa in s4 in both years in the aldrich variety 75 et c during the variety specific hull split period s2 resulted in the least water stress whereas 50 et c during the nonpareil hull split period s3 resulted in the most water stress in the butte variety the average mswp in 2019 and 2020 respectively were 1 6 and 1 2 mpa in s1 1 2 and 1 0 mpa in s2 1 8 and 1 3 mpa in s3 and 1 5 and 1 1 mpa in s4 there was more water stress in 2019 than in 2020 in the butte variety in both years in the butte variety 75 et c during the variety specific hull split period s2 resulted in the least water stress whereas 50 et c during the nonpareil hull split period s3 resulted in the most water stress which was the same result as in the aldrich variety in the nonpareil variety the average mswp in 2019 and 2020 respectively were 1 5 and 1 1 mpa in s1 1 6 and 1 5 in s3 and 1 3 and 1 1 in s5 between the two years of the study s5 100 et c resulted in the least water stress followed by s1 75 et c and then by s3 50 et c the grower irrigated the orchard on 19 august 2019 so the mswp was approximately the same in all subplots 3 4 irrigation effect on the almond physical quality table 4 shows the physical quality results of the aldrich almond samples under different irrigation regimes in the aldrich variety the thickness per 10 kernels was significantly higher in s2 than s3 in 2019 and significantly higher in s2 than both s1 and s3 in 2020 at the 95 confidence level this means that 75 et c during the variety specific hull split period s2 in aldrich resulted in significantly thicker kernels than 75 et c and 50 et c during the nonpareil hull split period s1 and s3 in the aldrich variety s3 resulted in a significantly higher occurrence of severe shrivel in s3 than in s1 and s4 in 2020 although not significant both nonpareil based hull split rdi treatments resulted in a higher occurrence of severe shrivel than both variety specific hull split rdi treatments in 2019 no significant differences were found across irrigation treatments in the aldrich variety in the length and width per 10 kernels sealed shells per 50 shells grams per 50 kernels double twin blank gum or insect damage at the 95 confidence level s1 resulted in significantly fewer sealed shells out of 50 shells than s3 in 2019 at the 90 confidence level table 5 shows the physical quality results of the butte almond samples under different irrigation regimes in 2019 both variety specific hull split rdi treatments s2 and s4 resulted in significantly fewer sealed shells out of 50 shells than both nonpareil based hull split rdi treatments s1 and s3 in 2020 although only s2 had significantly fewer sealed shells out of 50 shells than s3 both variety specific hull split rdi treatments s2 and s4 resulted in fewer sealed shells out of 50 shells than both nonpareil based hull split rdi treatments s1 and s3 no significant differences were found across irrigation treatments in the butte variety in the thickness length width per 10 kernels grams per 50 kernels shrivel double twin blank gum or insect damage at the 95 confidence level however the occurrence of severe shrivel was significantly higher in s2 than s1 in 2019 at a 90 confidence level s2 and s4 according to variety specific hull split tended to have more shrivel than s1 and s3 according to nonpareil hull split although not significant table 6 shows the physical quality results of the nonpareil variety under different irrigation regimes no significant differences were found across irrigation treatments in the nonpareil variety in the thickness length width per 10 kernels sealed shells per 50 shells grams per 50 kernels shrivel double twin blank gum or insect damage at the 95 confidence level however s5 resulted in significantly higher thickness per 10 kernels than s3 in 2020 at the 90 confidence level also s1 resulted in a significantly higher occurrence of severe shrivel than s5 in 2020 at the 90 confidence level 3 5 yield table 7 shows the marketable kernel yield of almond trees under different irrigation regimes in 2019 and 2020 no significant differences were found across any of the irrigation treatments in the aldrich butte and nonpareil varieties in 2019 and 2020 at the 90 or 95 confidence levels although not statistically significant the marketable kernel yield of the aldrich variety under both variety specific hull split rdi regimes s2 at 4048 kg hectare and s4 at 4180 kg hectare was higher than the marketable kernel yield of the aldrich variety under the nonpareil based hull split rdi regimes s1 at 3993 kg hectare and s3 at 3825 kg hectare the marketable kernel yield in 2020 was considerably higher than in 2019 in the aldrich and nonpareil varieties between 123 and 147 increase in aldrich and between 37 and 45 increase in nonpareil which was likely due to no rainfall during peak bloom in 2020 and was corroborated by record breaking almond yields across california the aldrich variety is known for a strong alternate bearing response and usually alternates between high yield and low yield from year to year which partly explains the large increase in marketable kernel yield from 2019 to 2020 the butte variety showed a minimal increase in marketable kernel yield between 2019 and 2020 possibly related to its later maturity in 2019 and 2020 the marketable kernel yield of the nonpareil variety was the highest in s5 100 et c during nonpareil hull split period followed by s1 75 et c during nonpareil hull split period and then by s3 50 et c during nonpareil hull split period meaning that marketable kernel yield increased with increased water applied although the differences were not statistically significant 3 6 kernel irrigation water use efficiency table 8 shows the kernel irrigation water use efficiency of aldrich butte and nonpareil almond trees under various irrigation regimes in 2019 and 2020 in 2019 and 2020 the kernel irrigation water use efficiency of the butte variety was higher in both nonpareil based hull split rdi treatments s1 and s3 than the two variety specific hull split rdi treatments s2 and s4 meaning that more marketable kernel yield was produced per volume of water applied when irrigating the butte trees according to nonpareil hull split schedule earlier rdi application in both nonpareil based hull split rdi treatments s1 and s3 resulted in less total water applied during the growing season than rdi application according to variety specific hull split s2 and s4 due to variety differences in the duration between hull split initiation and harvest in 2019 the kernel irrigation water use efficiency in butte of s1 was significantly higher than in s2 and s4 at the 95 confidence level in 2020 the kernel irrigation water use efficiency in butte of s3 was significantly higher than in s2 and s4 at the 95 confidence level no significant differences in kernel irrigation water use efficiency were found across irrigation treatments in the aldrich and nonpareil varieties in 2019 and 2020 3 7 light interception table 9 shows the percent of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the canopy percent par of almond trees under various irrigation regimes on the 14 june 2019 20 july 2019 and 2 august 2020 no significant differences in percent par were found across irrigation treatments light interception measurements in any of the varieties at the 90 or 95 confidence levels however the p value decreased between 14 june 2019 and 8 june 2020 mid season dates as well as between 20 july 2019 and 2 august 2020 late season dates in all varieties indicating that the significance of the irrigation effect on percent par increased over the two years of the experiment on 8 june 2020 the percent par of the aldrich variety was significantly higher in s4 50 et c during the variety specific hull split period compared to s1 75 et c during nonpareil hull split period at the 95 confidence level however this significant difference was not repeated on any of the other dates of light interception measurements and does not align with the expectation that more water applied leads to a higher percent par no significant differences across irrigation treatments were found in the percent difference in percent par between 14 june 2019 and 8 june 2020 mid season dates as well as between 20 july 2019 and 2 august 2020 late season dates at the 90 or 95 confidence levels in the aldrich variety the percent difference in percent par was higher in both 50 et c treatments s3 at 17 and s4 at 10 than the two 75 et c treatments s1 at 5 and s2 at 8 between 14 june 2019 and 8 june 2020 mid season dates similarly the percent par of the aldrich variety slightly decreased between 20 july 2019 and 2 august 2020 in the two 75 et c treatments s1 at 1 and s2 at 2 but increased between 20 july 2019 and 2 august 2020 in both 50 et c treatments s3 at 6 and s4 at 3 in the butte variety the percent par increased between 14 june 2019 and 8 june 2020 as well as between 20 july 2019 and 2 august 2020 in all the irrigation treatments except for s3 50 et c during nonpareil hull split period which resulted in 0 change between both sets of dates 4 discussion the rdi treatments in this study resulted in minor reductions in total water applied because the hull split period when rdi was implemented is short between 32 and 46 days compared to the total irrigation season for the year of approximately 240 days march to october for example 50 et c during hull split in nonpareil resulted in 14 15 less total water applied than 100 et c in nonpareil rdi according to variety specific hull split in later splitting varieties such as aldrich and butte resulted in more total water applied than rdi according to nonpareil based hull split as shown in table 3 in the aldrich and butte varieties s2 75 et c rate during variety specific hull split resulted in the most total water applied of all the irrigation treatments in this study and more total water applied than the similar treatment s1 75 et c rate during nonpareil hull split due to differences in the length of the hull split period across the varieties implementing rdi in butte during butte hull split resulted in lower water use efficiency due to fewer days in between 1 hull split initiation and harvest the butte variety had only 35 and 32 days between 1 hull split initiation and harvest in 2019 and 2020 respectively whereas the aldrich variety had 46 and 43 days and the nonpareil variety had 44 and 37 days in 2019 and 2020 respectively as shown in table 2 a farmer may use significantly more water per weight of butte almonds produced by implementing rdi during butte hull split as opposed to during nonpareil hull split which is the opposite of the almond board of california s goal of reducing the amount of water used to produce a pound of almonds by 20 by 2025 a reduction in the fraction of sealed shells induced by rdi during variety specific hull split in butte increases the exposure of the edible kernel to the environment and may have implications on kernel damage a lower percentage of sealed shells has been correlated with a higher percentage of navel orangeworm amyelois transitella infestation of the kernel hamby et al 2011 hamby and zalom 2013 a lower percentage of navel orangeworm infestation has been correlated with later splitting varieties such as butte hamby et al 2011 this study did not detect significant differences in insect damage to the kernel which mostly included the occurrence of navel orangeworm and ant damage across irrigation treatments the orchard used in this study did not have a recent history of navel orangeworm infestation because it was sprayed with insecticide and mummy nuts were removed each winter further research should investigate rdi during butte hull split period in butte at an almond orchard with a history of navel orangeworm infestation to quantify the effects of irrigation induced changes in the fraction of sealed shells on navel orangeworm occurrence further research should also investigate possible functional explanations for the reduction in sealed shells induced by rdi during variety specific hull split in butte almonds an increase in the thickness of the kernel induced by rdi during variety specific hull split in aldrich may have implications on its marketability and storage requirements other physical quality measurements such as kernel length and width grams per 50 kernels double twin blank and gum did not show significant differences after two years of the rdi irrigation treatments and do not seem to be affected by the variations in rdi schedules from this study the marketable kernel yield data was higher than in the literature for california almond varieties likely because most of the literature was from many years ago when almond yields were considerably lower goldhamer et al 2006 goldhamer and fereres 2017 management practices of almond orchards have improved marketable kernel yield in recent years light interception results aligned with yield results with no significant differences across irrigation treatments the lack of significant effect of irrigation treatments on marketable kernel yield indicates that outlying variables other than the irrigation strategy contribute to the yield response of almonds or that the experiment was not conducted for long enough irrigation system design that allows independent irrigation by row might not improve yield using similar irrigation strategies as in this study the midday stem water potential responded to the various rdi treatments in each variety as shown in fig 4 indicating that midday stem water potential could be used as feedback on irrigation scheduling regimes based on phenological schedules such as hull split the effect of soil texture was observed to affect the midday stem water potential and especially the soil water content further research should evaluate the coupled roles of soil properties and variety differences that may together impact the productivity of almond orchards for a more robust understanding of how to improve water use implementing the intended irrigation treatments was cumbersome under the strip plot experimental design due to the involvement of 60 independently irrigated subplots that required precise amounts of irrigation water to be applied the wireless communication system and solenoid valves were intended to ease the labor involved in independently controlling the irrigation amounts in 60 subplots in this study but they were not reliable enough resulting in frequent manual irrigations to keep the irrigation on track to meet the requirements of the experimental irrigation treatments problems that occurred included valves not opening or closing due to broken solenoids frequent low battery voltage in the controllers communication issues in the wireless communication system and web server outages further research and development should refine the technology of remote irrigation control systems to achieve a high level of reliability for the application of irrigating by variety by row to reduce the labor and time for the farmer to implement rdi by variety 5 conclusions this study evaluated a novel irrigation strategy for cross pollinating almond orchards regulated deficit irrigation rdi was implemented in three almond varieties aldrich butte and nonpareil under two different irrigation strategies 1 a conventional practice of rdi during hull split according to one variety nonpareil and 2 an advanced practice of rdi during variety specific hull split the objective was to compare these irrigation strategies in terms of marketable kernel yield total water applied water use efficiency nut physical quality light interception soil water content and midday stem water potential rdi during butte hull split in butte reduced the fraction of sealed shells compared to the conventional irrigation strategy increasing the vulnerability of the kernel to the environment and possible pests kernel thickness increased in the aldrich variety when rdi was implemented during aldrich hull split instead of the conventional irrigation strategy kernel irrigation water use efficiency decreased in the butte variety when it was irrigated during butte hull split instead of the conventional irrigation strategy due to a fewer number of days in between the initiation of butte hull split and harvest compared to nonpareil no increase in marketable kernel yield was achieved by implementing rdi according to variety specific hull split compared to the conventional irrigation strategy the lack of yield improvement demonstrated by the rdi by variety suggests an advanced irrigation system design that allows irrigation by row might not be worth the investment more research is needed for different orchard designs varieties climates and for longer durations of the irrigation strategies by variety declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

9375,regulated deficit irrigation rdi during hull split can reduce water applied in almond orchards strategies for imposing rdi in almond orchards with multiple varieties with different hull split schedules have not been extensively developed commonly irrigation system design requires the same irrigation schedule for all varieties in the orchard a 2 year study evaluated the impacts of two different regulated deficit irrigation strategies in an almond orchard with butte aldrich and nonpareil varieties in the sacramento valley of california usa the two strategies were 1 rdi in all varieties during nonpareil hull split timing and 2 rdi according to variety specific hull split timing the two levels of irrigation were 50 and 75 of potential crop evapotranspiration et c replacement during the hull split period results show that the kernel thickness of the aldrich almonds increased under 75 et c irrigation replacement during the aldrich hull split period compared to 75 et c and 50 et c irrigation replacement during the nonpareil hull split period in the butte almonds 75 et c and 50 et c irrigation replacement during variety specific hull split reduced the fraction of sealed shells of the butte variety compared to 75 et c and 50 et c irrigation replacement during the nonpareil hull split period this study demonstrated that an irrigation system design that allows for the independent irrigation scheduling of each variety can change the almond physical quality in the butte and aldrich varieties rdi according to variety specific hull split did not result in significant marketable kernel yield improvements after two years of imposing the irrigation strategies more research should be conducted for different orchard designs varieties and climates keywords evapotranspiration navel orangeworm midday stem water potential soil water content light interception water use efficiency 1 introduction uncertainty of water availability is a significant concern for almond farmers california usa is the world leader in almond production with a 6 09 billion usd almond industry covering almost 619 000 ha in 2019 california department of food and agriculture 2020 2019 increasing acreage of almonds and uncertainty about water deliveries from the sacramento san joaquin delta has contributed to a greater demand for groundwater by farmers harter 2015 the increased pressure on groundwater as a water resource for agriculture effectively led to the passage of the sustainable groundwater management act sgma in 2014 which will ultimately limit the amount of groundwater that farmers can pump to halt groundwater overdraft pavley 2014 furthermore climate change has resulted in increased uncertainty of water availability for agriculture and increased crop water demands a trend that is expected to continue in the future pathak et al 2018 improvements in water use efficiency must be developed to address uncertainties in water availability due to climate change water policies and water scarcity in january 2019 the almond board of california set a goal of reducing the amount of water used to produce a pound of almonds by 20 by the year 2025 almond board of california 2019 meeting this goal could involve irrigating less than 100 potential crop evapotranspiration et c through regulated deficit irrigation rdi rdi is a strategy that involves applying less than 100 et c during specific phenological stages when a crop is less sensitive to water deficit to reduce water use while avoiding severe losses in crop productivity zhang and theib 1999 hull split is one phenological stage when almond yield is less sensitive to deficit irrigation stewart et al 2011 mild to moderate rdi at hull split can reduce water applied the incidence of hull rot and the number of sticktights i e hulls that don t split goldhamer et al 2006 teviotdale et al 2001 the relationship between applied water and yield in almond orchards is nonlinear so rdi has the potential to reduce the amount of water used to produce a pound of almonds goldhamer and fereres 2017 for example an overall seasonal irrigation treatment of 55 et c with deficit irrigation biased towards the pre harvest period reduced kernel dry weight by 17 compared to the control showing that major reductions in water applied through rdi may result in comparatively moderate reductions in yield for almond orchards goldhamer et al 2006 the research shows that rdi during hull split is a suitable strategy for considerably reducing water applied a complication of rdi during hull split is that orchards with multiple varieties have different hull split schedules with hull split initiating between late june to mid august depending on the variety in the sacramento valley of california connell et al 2010 most commercial almond varieties are self incompatible so almond orchards usually have two or three different varieties for effective cross pollination hamby and zalom 2013 typically each tree row has the same variety and the rows alternate between varieties irrigation systems are usually designed for irrigating the entire orchard on the same irrigation schedule farmers who cut back irrigation during hull split usually do so according to the hull split schedule of the nonpareil variety in california farmers typically favor irrigation toward optimizing the yield and quality of the nonpareil which is the most valuable almond variety in california almond board of california 2015 however other varieties in the same orchard may not be optimally irrigated according to the variety specific phenological stages research is lacking on implementing rdi by variety in california usa even though approximately 97 of california s almond orchards have more than one variety california department of food and agriculture 2019 some research has been done in spain in a study in spain three almond varieties received various deficit irrigation amounts and the marta variety was more sensitive to drought conditions than the other varieties according to stem water potential and stomatal conductance measurements indicating the need to consider variety as a factor in irrigation scheduling guti√©rrez gordillo et al 2019 this paper aims to evaluate the almond yield and quality effects of two irrigation strategies during hull split 1 the conventional practice of rdi during nonpareil hull split in all varieties in the orchard and 2 an advanced rdi strategy during variety specific hull split the hypothesis was that rdi during hull split by variety could improve yield and quality compared to the conventional practice the goal is to evaluate if the ability to irrigate by row i e by variety is important to the irrigation system design of cross pollinating almond orchards 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted at a 1 6 hectare almond prunus dulcis orchard of mature cv nonpareil aldrich and butte trees planted on peach rootstock 4 3 m tree spacing 6 m row spacing located near arbuckle california united states 38 97 n 122 07 w the climate of the region is semi arid mediterranean with warm dry summers and cool wet winters the soil was sandy loam with a gravel layer at approximately 1 m below the soil surface total precipitation during the irrigation season between 1 march and 15 september was 106 mm in 2019 and 23 mm in 2020 obtained from the california irrigation management information system station in williams ca 11 miles from the experimental site an unusually dry winter occurred in 2020 with zero precipitation during february fig 1 shows the elevation silt and sand content in the top 30 cm the root zone depth was about 1 m typical for mature almond orchards each row of the orchard was irrigated with two lines of polyethylene drip tubing 18 mm diameter with 38 cm emitter spacing and an average emitter flow rate of 1 9 l h 2 2 experimental design and treatments table 1 shows the experimental treatments for the butte and aldrich varieties these treatments were selected to compare the two irrigation strategies 1 the conventional practice of rdi during nonpareil hull split in all varieties in the orchard and 2 an advanced rdi strategy during variety specific hull split the nonpareil butte and aldrich rows of each block had a control treatment s1 75 et c during nonpareil hull split and s3 50 et c during nonpareil hull split representing the conventional timing for rdi in addition the aldrich and butte rows of each block had treatments s2 75 et c during variety specific hull split and s4 50 et c during variety specific hull split representing the advanced strategy of rdi by variety in nonpareil s1 and s2 would be identical and s3 and s4 would be identical so this paper will only mention s1 and s3 in nonpareil in this paper additional land was available for an additional irrigation strategy so the nonpareil row in each block had the well watered irrigation practice s5 100 et c during nonpareil hull split in total there were 15 rows and each row contained approximately 50 trees each of the four subplots within each row contained approximately 10 trees allowing approximately five trees to serve as border trees at the ends of each row all trees in a row are the same variety and the rows alternate by variety the rows of trees cannot be moved so randomization of the variety factor was not possible using the land available for the experiment the orchard was divided into five main blocks or replications each block divided vertically into three rows i e one for each variety each block was split horizontally into four sections in a strip plot experimental design resulting in 12 subplots in each block since there were concerns of lateral movement of water in the soil between adjacent subplots it made sense to strip the rows in a strip plot design and randomize the irrigation among the strips 2 3 irrigation scheduling a wireless network of solenoid valves controlled the irrigation in all 60 subplots one solenoid valve actuator circuit board controlled all four irrigation treatments in each row in 2019 the solenoid valve actuator circuit boards used were developed by metronome systems berkeley ca while those used in 2020 were developed at the university of california davis coates et al 2013 the remote valve actuator system required manually inputting the irrigation runtimes for all 60 subplots into a website every irrigation irrigation runtimes were determined based on et c which was calculated using the single crop coefficient method shown by eq 1 where et c is the potential crop evapotranspiration et o is the reference evapotranspiration of a well watered grass surface and k c is the crop coefficient specific to the growth stage and crop allen et al 1998 1 etc eto kc et o was obtained from the williams california irrigation management information system cimis station obtained from the cimis penman equation which uses a wind function developed at university of california davis and unique cloud factor values for each cimis station location https cimis water ca gov resources aspx k c values of 1 15 1 17 and 1 12 were used in july august and september respectively goldhamer and girona 2012 etc was 221 205 and 163 mm in july august and september in 2019 etc was 238 195 and 154 mm in july august and september in 2020 which were close to 2019 cumulative et c mm since the previous irrigation was converted into a runtime using the area of the subplot the emitter specifications and the rdi reduction for each treatment a plant spacing of 4 3 m row spacing of 6 m and an emission uniformity of 90 were used to calculate a net application rate i n of 0 147 cm per hour using eq 2 2 i n k eu 100 e q a s p s r where k is 0 1 for unit conversion e is the number of emitters per plant 22 q a is the emission point discharge 1 9 l h s p is the distance between plants in the row 4 3 m and s r is the distance between plant rows 6 m actual irrigation applied was measured using a water meter in each of the 60 subplots twice a week neptune t 10 ¬æ potable water meter tallassee alabama usa before hull split initiation the orchard was irrigated by the farmer guided by a watermark sensor at one location in the orchard careful observation of hull split initiation led to the decision of when to begin rdi treatments although the trees at the ends of the rows began hull split first rdi treatments were postponed until most of the trees in the inner parts of the orchard showed approximately 1 hull split initiation typically starting at the top of the trees the blank nuts no kernel inside the shell usually begin splitting about a week before the sound nuts kernel inside so careful observations were made to wait until sound nuts began splitting the 1 hull split initiation harvest pickup dates and days between 1 hull split initiation and harvest in 2019 and 2020 are shown in table 2 the number of days between 1 hull split initiation and harvest i e shaking of the nuts to the ground influenced the total amount of water applied in each rdi treatment in this study 2 4 midday stem water potential and soil water content neutron probe counts were measured at 30 cm 60 cm 90 cm 120 cm and 150 cm depths using a neutron probe cpn 503 elite hydroprobe instrotek raleigh north carolina usa measurements were done in all subplots twice a week between april and september of both years of the experiment and usually immediately before irrigation a local calibration equation was developed using volumetric soil samples collected at 30 cm and 60 cm depths from the study field in 2020 using a madera probe with a soil volume of 66 cc n 11 r2 0 86 the bulk density was measured using the same soil samples and was between 1 28 and 1 72 g cc the neutron probe counts were converted into volumetric soil water content with the calibration equation for each subplot average soil water content was calculated for the top 150 cm of the soil measurements less than 0 05 m3 m 3 were ignored because there was too much uncertainty in the calibration equation at low volumetric water content midday stem water potential mswp was measured using a pressure chamber model 615d pms instruments albany oregon usa measurements were done in all subplots on most occasions that neutron probe counts were measured which was usually immediately before irrigation the mswp measurements were used as feedback for irrigation adequacy typically all treatments were irrigated once every three or four days 2 5 almond yield quality and water use efficiency the almonds were harvested with a mechanical shaker on the dates listed in table 2 using a shockwave sprint model made by orchard machinery corporation omc in yuba city ca usa the almonds dried on the orchard ground for 12 15 days after the trees were shaken then the almonds were picked up for total yield and almond sample collection all almonds in each subplot were picked up with a harvesting machine and total yield was measured with a load cell based scale retrofitted onto a tractor that picks up the almonds off the ground at harvest of each variety the total yield was multiplied by the fraction of kernel weight to the total weight hulls shells and kernels to determine the kernel yield of each subplot the marketable kernel yield measurements were reduced by 10 to account for rocks leaves and other debris collected with the almonds based on expert consultation with the farm advisor of the almond orchard the orchard ground was thoroughly conditioned with a blower to remove most of the pre existing debris before the harvest so only a 10 correction was needed to account for leaves from the harvest and any rocks not moved by the blower unlike at larger commercial orchards which may have less thorough conditioning and may require a larger correction than 10 almond samples were collected at harvest in all subplots of each variety for a physical nut quality analysis the quality analysis included quantifying 1 the number of sealed shells out of 50 shells 2 weights of 50 hulls 50 inshell kernels and 50 shelled kernels 3 counts of double twin blank gum severe shrivel and insect damage detected in 50 almonds and 4 measurements of kernel length width and thickness of 10 kernels lined up end to end in a row side by side and flipped each possible way length width and height nonpareil is a soft shelled almond whereas aldrich and butte are hard shelled almonds so it is expected that nonpareil would have fewer sealed shells per 50 than aldrich and butte almonds almond board of california 2015 double is when two separate embryos form and grow into two individual almonds located in the same shell twin is when a single almond has two radicals blank is when a kernel did not develop within the shell gum is a rust colored hard and shiny resin that sometimes is clear almond kernel shrivel can occur on almond trees planted on peach rootstock and is caused by the peach yellow leafroll phytoplasma adaskaveg et al 2017 kernel irrigation water use efficiency kiwue was calculated as the ratio of marketable almond yield the kernels y kg divided by the total amount of irrigation from march 1st to harvest i mm as shown in eq 3 3 kiwue y i 2 6 light interception photosynthetically active radiation par intercepted by the canopy was measured at solar noon in each subplot on 14 june 2019 20 july 2019 8 june 2020 and 2 august 2020 par intercepted by the canopy has been well correlated with kernel yield in almond trees lampinen et al 2012 the par measurements were intended to corroborate the yield measurements measurements were done using a mobile par measurement system lampinen et al 2012 data from the left and right sides of the mobile par measurement system were kept separate to allow partitioning of canopy par interception for each variety independently 2 7 statistical analysis statistical comparisons were made across the irrigation strategies of each variety to assess differences in marketable kernel yield various almond physical quality measurements and canopy par interception using analysis of variance anova the main objective of the statistical comparisons was to identify significant differences in the response variables due to the irrigation strategy for each variety significant differences in yield or quality across irrigation strategies could help inform a farmer whether to design their irrigation system to have the ability to irrigate by row i e by variety the blocking effect was included because there was a pre existing yield and plant canopy size gradient with larger yields and canopy going from east to west furthermore a previous experiment in 2016 2017 involved rdi treatments in blocks 1 3 and full irrigation in blocks 4 5 in the nonpareil rows kizer et al 2017 data were analyzed using the proc glimmix procedure in sas https support sas com rnd app stat procedures glimmix html means were separated at the 0 05 significance level using the tukey type least squares means lsmeans procedure in sas a two factor strip plot anova model with variety and irrigation factors shown in eq 4 was tested but did not detect significant differences across irrigation strategies in eq 4 yijk is the response variable Œº is the overall mean i is the block effect Œ±j is the variety effect Œ¥ij is the whole plot error of the variety factor Œ≤k is the irrigation effect Œªik is the whole plot error of the irrigation factor Œ±Œ≤ ij is the interaction between variety and irrigation factors and Œµijk is the experimental error term 4 yijk Œº i Œ±j Œ±œÅ ij Œ≤k œÅŒ≤ ik Œ±Œ≤ ij Œµijk there are several implications to the strip plot experimental design the whole plot a treatment is confounded with the whole plots of factor a the whole plot b treatment is confounded with the whole plots of factor b the strip plot design tends to sacrifice precision in testing the main effects but improves precision in testing interaction effects eq 5 shows the anova model used in this study where yij is the response variable Œº is the overall mean i is the block effect Œ≤j is the irrigation effect œÅŒ≤ ij is the interaction between the block effect and the irrigation effect and Œµij is the experimental error term 5 yij Œº i Œ≤j œÅŒ≤ ij Œµij separate anova tests following the model in eq 5 were done on each of the three varieties to optimize the precision of the irrigation effect significant differences not detected by the two factor strip plot anova model from eq 4 were detected in the single factor anova model from eq 5 the variety factor in the two factor strip plot anova model had an overwhelming effect on the almond physical quality and marketable kernel yield so differences within a variety due to the irrigation treatments were less detectable by the two factor strip plot anova model therefore it made sense to do a single factor anova on each variety to optimize the precision of the irrigation effect of a single variety at a time strong variety effects likely due to genetics were so dominant that irrigation effects played a small role in the overall effect on the physical quality parameters so it was not possible to see the irrigation effect on the physical quality parameters unless a single factor anova was done on each variety the purpose of the study was to identify the most optimal irrigation regime for each variety in terms of various response variables so the variety main effect was not of primary interest to this study in reality a farmer would need to decide the best irrigation strategy for each variety independently of the other varieties so eq 5 aligns better with real irrigation decisions 3 results 3 1 cumulative irrigation the grower scheduled the irrigation before the experimental treatments began in july in 2019 the grower applied 327 mm of water between 12 april 2019 and the beginning of july in 2020 the grower applied 554 mm of water between 3 march 2020 and the beginning of july the grower applied more irrigation in the spring of 2020 due to less precipitation compared to 2020 table 3 shows the total water applied from leaf out to harvest in all the irrigation treatments of each variety differences in total water applied between irrigation treatments were small because the periods of the rdi treatments ranged between only 32 and 46 days as shown in table 2 compared to the total irrigation season for the year of approximately 240 days march to october the total water applied shown in table 3 does not include the post harvest irrigation between september and november fig 2 shows the cumulative water applied since the grower began irrigation in the spring from each irrigation treatment in each variety as the average of five replicates in 2019 in the aldrich variety s2 and s4 were at 100 et c until aldrich hull split started on 27 july 2019 so s2 and s4 trees received more water at the beginning of the season than s1 and s3 which were at 75 et c and 50 et c beginning on 09 july 2019 when nonpareil hull split initiated by harvest on 11 september 2019 s2 received the most water of the irrigation treatments in aldrich because it was irrigated at the 75 et c rate during hull split and the rdi treatment was initiated for fewer days than s1 and s3 due to variety differences in the period between 1 hull split initiation and harvest as shown in table 2 there were some differences in water applied between s2 and s4 before aldrich hull split due to malfunctions with the irrigation system on 25 july 2019 although they should have both received the same amount of water at the 100 et c rate in the butte variety s2 and s4 were at 100 etc until butte hull split started on 07 august 2019 so s2 and s4 trees received more water at the beginning of the season than s1 and s3 which were at 75 et c and 50 et c beginning on 09 july 2019 when nonpareil hull split initiated water applied increased in s1 and s3 after the nonpareil trees were harvested on 22 august 2019 by harvest on 11 september s2 received the most water of the irrigation treatments in butte because it was irrigated at the 75 et c rate during hull split and the rdi treatment was initiated for fewer days than s1 and s3 due to variety differences in the period between 1 hull split initiation and harvest as shown in table 2 in the nonpareil variety s5 was irrigated at 100 et c and received the most water of all the treatments s1 received 75 et c and s3 received 50 et c nonpareil during hull split which began on 09 july 2019 a plateau in cumulative water applied in all the irrigation treatments began around 03 august 2019 as the grower restricted irrigation to dry the orchard ground in preparation for the harvest activities the irrigation strategies in 2020 follow the same pattern as described for 2019 3 2 irrigation effect on soil water content fig 3 a through h shows the average volumetric soil water content in the top 150 cm in all the irrigation treatments of each variety in 2019 most soil water content measurements were taken immediately before irrigation when the soil water content was expected to be low large standard deviations were found in the soil water content in each treatment this was likely due to spatial variations in water holding capacity due to heterogeneity in the soil texture or topographic influences on distribution uniformity the soil water content was not the same across all subplots of the orchard under the grower s irrigation due to spatial variability in soil texture shown by fig 1 this spatial variability in soil water content affected the soil water content when the rdi treatments began in general the soil water content followed the pattern of the irrigation strategies irrigation by aldrich hull split schedule led to higher soil water content compared to irrigation according to the conventional strategy at the 75 et c level figure a and e but not clearly at the 50 et c level in 2019 and 2020 fig 3 c and g in the aldrich variety there was a malfunction with the irrigation system on 25 july 2019 so s1 had a large unintended spike in soil water content the grower irrigated on 19 august 2019 so all the treatments had approximately the same soil water content on that day after the nonpareil harvest on 22 august 2019 treatments s1 and s3 entered the 100 et c irrigation stage and soil water content increased although it took longer for s3 to replenish the soil water content due to having been under more limited irrigation before harvest the two nonpareil based hull split treatments s1 and s3 increased in soil water content in september after the completion of harvest activities the soil water content of s2 and s4 remained low until the aldrich harvest on 11 september 2019 a malfunction with the irrigation system resulted in unintended extra irrigation in s4 on 28 august 2019 although it should have followed the trend of s2 irrigation by the conventional strategy led to similar soil water content in butte at the 75 etc level in 2019 and 2020 fig 3 b and f irrigation by butte hull split schedule resulted in consistently higher soil water content in august at the 50 etc level s4 fig 3 d and h 3 3 irrigation effect on midday stem water potential fig 4 shows the midday stem water potential mswp in the aldrich and butte varieties highlighting the differences between the conventional irrigation strategies s1 and s3 and the irrigation by variety strategies s2 and s4 the mswp measurements are shown in mpa where 1 mpa is equal to 10 bars most mswp measurements were taken immediately before irrigation when the mswp was expected to be low high water stress in the aldrich variety the average mswp in 2019 and 2020 respectively were 1 6 and 1 5 mpa in s1 1 3 and 1 2 mpa in s2 1 7 and 1 6 mpa in s3 and 1 6 and 1 6 mpa in s4 in both years in the aldrich variety 75 et c during the variety specific hull split period s2 resulted in the least water stress whereas 50 et c during the nonpareil hull split period s3 resulted in the most water stress in the butte variety the average mswp in 2019 and 2020 respectively were 1 6 and 1 2 mpa in s1 1 2 and 1 0 mpa in s2 1 8 and 1 3 mpa in s3 and 1 5 and 1 1 mpa in s4 there was more water stress in 2019 than in 2020 in the butte variety in both years in the butte variety 75 et c during the variety specific hull split period s2 resulted in the least water stress whereas 50 et c during the nonpareil hull split period s3 resulted in the most water stress which was the same result as in the aldrich variety in the nonpareil variety the average mswp in 2019 and 2020 respectively were 1 5 and 1 1 mpa in s1 1 6 and 1 5 in s3 and 1 3 and 1 1 in s5 between the two years of the study s5 100 et c resulted in the least water stress followed by s1 75 et c and then by s3 50 et c the grower irrigated the orchard on 19 august 2019 so the mswp was approximately the same in all subplots 3 4 irrigation effect on the almond physical quality table 4 shows the physical quality results of the aldrich almond samples under different irrigation regimes in the aldrich variety the thickness per 10 kernels was significantly higher in s2 than s3 in 2019 and significantly higher in s2 than both s1 and s3 in 2020 at the 95 confidence level this means that 75 et c during the variety specific hull split period s2 in aldrich resulted in significantly thicker kernels than 75 et c and 50 et c during the nonpareil hull split period s1 and s3 in the aldrich variety s3 resulted in a significantly higher occurrence of severe shrivel in s3 than in s1 and s4 in 2020 although not significant both nonpareil based hull split rdi treatments resulted in a higher occurrence of severe shrivel than both variety specific hull split rdi treatments in 2019 no significant differences were found across irrigation treatments in the aldrich variety in the length and width per 10 kernels sealed shells per 50 shells grams per 50 kernels double twin blank gum or insect damage at the 95 confidence level s1 resulted in significantly fewer sealed shells out of 50 shells than s3 in 2019 at the 90 confidence level table 5 shows the physical quality results of the butte almond samples under different irrigation regimes in 2019 both variety specific hull split rdi treatments s2 and s4 resulted in significantly fewer sealed shells out of 50 shells than both nonpareil based hull split rdi treatments s1 and s3 in 2020 although only s2 had significantly fewer sealed shells out of 50 shells than s3 both variety specific hull split rdi treatments s2 and s4 resulted in fewer sealed shells out of 50 shells than both nonpareil based hull split rdi treatments s1 and s3 no significant differences were found across irrigation treatments in the butte variety in the thickness length width per 10 kernels grams per 50 kernels shrivel double twin blank gum or insect damage at the 95 confidence level however the occurrence of severe shrivel was significantly higher in s2 than s1 in 2019 at a 90 confidence level s2 and s4 according to variety specific hull split tended to have more shrivel than s1 and s3 according to nonpareil hull split although not significant table 6 shows the physical quality results of the nonpareil variety under different irrigation regimes no significant differences were found across irrigation treatments in the nonpareil variety in the thickness length width per 10 kernels sealed shells per 50 shells grams per 50 kernels shrivel double twin blank gum or insect damage at the 95 confidence level however s5 resulted in significantly higher thickness per 10 kernels than s3 in 2020 at the 90 confidence level also s1 resulted in a significantly higher occurrence of severe shrivel than s5 in 2020 at the 90 confidence level 3 5 yield table 7 shows the marketable kernel yield of almond trees under different irrigation regimes in 2019 and 2020 no significant differences were found across any of the irrigation treatments in the aldrich butte and nonpareil varieties in 2019 and 2020 at the 90 or 95 confidence levels although not statistically significant the marketable kernel yield of the aldrich variety under both variety specific hull split rdi regimes s2 at 4048 kg hectare and s4 at 4180 kg hectare was higher than the marketable kernel yield of the aldrich variety under the nonpareil based hull split rdi regimes s1 at 3993 kg hectare and s3 at 3825 kg hectare the marketable kernel yield in 2020 was considerably higher than in 2019 in the aldrich and nonpareil varieties between 123 and 147 increase in aldrich and between 37 and 45 increase in nonpareil which was likely due to no rainfall during peak bloom in 2020 and was corroborated by record breaking almond yields across california the aldrich variety is known for a strong alternate bearing response and usually alternates between high yield and low yield from year to year which partly explains the large increase in marketable kernel yield from 2019 to 2020 the butte variety showed a minimal increase in marketable kernel yield between 2019 and 2020 possibly related to its later maturity in 2019 and 2020 the marketable kernel yield of the nonpareil variety was the highest in s5 100 et c during nonpareil hull split period followed by s1 75 et c during nonpareil hull split period and then by s3 50 et c during nonpareil hull split period meaning that marketable kernel yield increased with increased water applied although the differences were not statistically significant 3 6 kernel irrigation water use efficiency table 8 shows the kernel irrigation water use efficiency of aldrich butte and nonpareil almond trees under various irrigation regimes in 2019 and 2020 in 2019 and 2020 the kernel irrigation water use efficiency of the butte variety was higher in both nonpareil based hull split rdi treatments s1 and s3 than the two variety specific hull split rdi treatments s2 and s4 meaning that more marketable kernel yield was produced per volume of water applied when irrigating the butte trees according to nonpareil hull split schedule earlier rdi application in both nonpareil based hull split rdi treatments s1 and s3 resulted in less total water applied during the growing season than rdi application according to variety specific hull split s2 and s4 due to variety differences in the duration between hull split initiation and harvest in 2019 the kernel irrigation water use efficiency in butte of s1 was significantly higher than in s2 and s4 at the 95 confidence level in 2020 the kernel irrigation water use efficiency in butte of s3 was significantly higher than in s2 and s4 at the 95 confidence level no significant differences in kernel irrigation water use efficiency were found across irrigation treatments in the aldrich and nonpareil varieties in 2019 and 2020 3 7 light interception table 9 shows the percent of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the canopy percent par of almond trees under various irrigation regimes on the 14 june 2019 20 july 2019 and 2 august 2020 no significant differences in percent par were found across irrigation treatments light interception measurements in any of the varieties at the 90 or 95 confidence levels however the p value decreased between 14 june 2019 and 8 june 2020 mid season dates as well as between 20 july 2019 and 2 august 2020 late season dates in all varieties indicating that the significance of the irrigation effect on percent par increased over the two years of the experiment on 8 june 2020 the percent par of the aldrich variety was significantly higher in s4 50 et c during the variety specific hull split period compared to s1 75 et c during nonpareil hull split period at the 95 confidence level however this significant difference was not repeated on any of the other dates of light interception measurements and does not align with the expectation that more water applied leads to a higher percent par no significant differences across irrigation treatments were found in the percent difference in percent par between 14 june 2019 and 8 june 2020 mid season dates as well as between 20 july 2019 and 2 august 2020 late season dates at the 90 or 95 confidence levels in the aldrich variety the percent difference in percent par was higher in both 50 et c treatments s3 at 17 and s4 at 10 than the two 75 et c treatments s1 at 5 and s2 at 8 between 14 june 2019 and 8 june 2020 mid season dates similarly the percent par of the aldrich variety slightly decreased between 20 july 2019 and 2 august 2020 in the two 75 et c treatments s1 at 1 and s2 at 2 but increased between 20 july 2019 and 2 august 2020 in both 50 et c treatments s3 at 6 and s4 at 3 in the butte variety the percent par increased between 14 june 2019 and 8 june 2020 as well as between 20 july 2019 and 2 august 2020 in all the irrigation treatments except for s3 50 et c during nonpareil hull split period which resulted in 0 change between both sets of dates 4 discussion the rdi treatments in this study resulted in minor reductions in total water applied because the hull split period when rdi was implemented is short between 32 and 46 days compared to the total irrigation season for the year of approximately 240 days march to october for example 50 et c during hull split in nonpareil resulted in 14 15 less total water applied than 100 et c in nonpareil rdi according to variety specific hull split in later splitting varieties such as aldrich and butte resulted in more total water applied than rdi according to nonpareil based hull split as shown in table 3 in the aldrich and butte varieties s2 75 et c rate during variety specific hull split resulted in the most total water applied of all the irrigation treatments in this study and more total water applied than the similar treatment s1 75 et c rate during nonpareil hull split due to differences in the length of the hull split period across the varieties implementing rdi in butte during butte hull split resulted in lower water use efficiency due to fewer days in between 1 hull split initiation and harvest the butte variety had only 35 and 32 days between 1 hull split initiation and harvest in 2019 and 2020 respectively whereas the aldrich variety had 46 and 43 days and the nonpareil variety had 44 and 37 days in 2019 and 2020 respectively as shown in table 2 a farmer may use significantly more water per weight of butte almonds produced by implementing rdi during butte hull split as opposed to during nonpareil hull split which is the opposite of the almond board of california s goal of reducing the amount of water used to produce a pound of almonds by 20 by 2025 a reduction in the fraction of sealed shells induced by rdi during variety specific hull split in butte increases the exposure of the edible kernel to the environment and may have implications on kernel damage a lower percentage of sealed shells has been correlated with a higher percentage of navel orangeworm amyelois transitella infestation of the kernel hamby et al 2011 hamby and zalom 2013 a lower percentage of navel orangeworm infestation has been correlated with later splitting varieties such as butte hamby et al 2011 this study did not detect significant differences in insect damage to the kernel which mostly included the occurrence of navel orangeworm and ant damage across irrigation treatments the orchard used in this study did not have a recent history of navel orangeworm infestation because it was sprayed with insecticide and mummy nuts were removed each winter further research should investigate rdi during butte hull split period in butte at an almond orchard with a history of navel orangeworm infestation to quantify the effects of irrigation induced changes in the fraction of sealed shells on navel orangeworm occurrence further research should also investigate possible functional explanations for the reduction in sealed shells induced by rdi during variety specific hull split in butte almonds an increase in the thickness of the kernel induced by rdi during variety specific hull split in aldrich may have implications on its marketability and storage requirements other physical quality measurements such as kernel length and width grams per 50 kernels double twin blank and gum did not show significant differences after two years of the rdi irrigation treatments and do not seem to be affected by the variations in rdi schedules from this study the marketable kernel yield data was higher than in the literature for california almond varieties likely because most of the literature was from many years ago when almond yields were considerably lower goldhamer et al 2006 goldhamer and fereres 2017 management practices of almond orchards have improved marketable kernel yield in recent years light interception results aligned with yield results with no significant differences across irrigation treatments the lack of significant effect of irrigation treatments on marketable kernel yield indicates that outlying variables other than the irrigation strategy contribute to the yield response of almonds or that the experiment was not conducted for long enough irrigation system design that allows independent irrigation by row might not improve yield using similar irrigation strategies as in this study the midday stem water potential responded to the various rdi treatments in each variety as shown in fig 4 indicating that midday stem water potential could be used as feedback on irrigation scheduling regimes based on phenological schedules such as hull split the effect of soil texture was observed to affect the midday stem water potential and especially the soil water content further research should evaluate the coupled roles of soil properties and variety differences that may together impact the productivity of almond orchards for a more robust understanding of how to improve water use implementing the intended irrigation treatments was cumbersome under the strip plot experimental design due to the involvement of 60 independently irrigated subplots that required precise amounts of irrigation water to be applied the wireless communication system and solenoid valves were intended to ease the labor involved in independently controlling the irrigation amounts in 60 subplots in this study but they were not reliable enough resulting in frequent manual irrigations to keep the irrigation on track to meet the requirements of the experimental irrigation treatments problems that occurred included valves not opening or closing due to broken solenoids frequent low battery voltage in the controllers communication issues in the wireless communication system and web server outages further research and development should refine the technology of remote irrigation control systems to achieve a high level of reliability for the application of irrigating by variety by row to reduce the labor and time for the farmer to implement rdi by variety 5 conclusions this study evaluated a novel irrigation strategy for cross pollinating almond orchards regulated deficit irrigation rdi was implemented in three almond varieties aldrich butte and nonpareil under two different irrigation strategies 1 a conventional practice of rdi during hull split according to one variety nonpareil and 2 an advanced practice of rdi during variety specific hull split the objective was to compare these irrigation strategies in terms of marketable kernel yield total water applied water use efficiency nut physical quality light interception soil water content and midday stem water potential rdi during butte hull split in butte reduced the fraction of sealed shells compared to the conventional irrigation strategy increasing the vulnerability of the kernel to the environment and possible pests kernel thickness increased in the aldrich variety when rdi was implemented during aldrich hull split instead of the conventional irrigation strategy kernel irrigation water use efficiency decreased in the butte variety when it was irrigated during butte hull split instead of the conventional irrigation strategy due to a fewer number of days in between the initiation of butte hull split and harvest compared to nonpareil no increase in marketable kernel yield was achieved by implementing rdi according to variety specific hull split compared to the conventional irrigation strategy the lack of yield improvement demonstrated by the rdi by variety suggests an advanced irrigation system design that allows irrigation by row might not be worth the investment more research is needed for different orchard designs varieties climates and for longer durations of the irrigation strategies by variety declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

the authors set out to examine lead hazards in food crop consumers as well as lead transmission along the water soil plant continuum under different treatments considering these facts this study was conducted i to investigate the toxicity level of lead pb in water soil and food crops ii to evaluate the soil pollution intensity iii to determine various mobility and pollution indices including health risk which will be of utmost importance for redressing and safely guarding the public from toxicosis resulting from the consumption of contaminated food crops from said heavy metal 2 materials

correlation of pb in soil but a moderate correlation in crops while site 2 vs s 3 had a moderate positive correlation in soils and a very low correlation in crop samples fig 3 similarly a strong positive significant correlation in soils vs crops was also observed fig 4 the positive correlation shows the synergistic effect of pb on all sites of soil and crops the regression analysis also indicated a low to moderate positive significant p 0 001 value of lead in the soil and a very low to very low significant p 0 001 regression in the crop samples figs 3 and 4 but a highly significant positive regression in the soil vs crop samples fig 5 3 5 pollution load index pli bioconcentration factor bcf and enrichment factor ef in lead the pb pollution load index ranged from 0 367 to 1 641 pli was lowest in c album at s 3 and greatest in r sativus at site 1 treated with t 3 and t 1 respectively table s 1 the mean value of the pollution load index was found to be a maximum of 1 34 at t 1

and tube well water 0 057 and 0 032 mg l was lower but in canal water 0 029 mg l was higher than the reported value of yu et al 2022 in contrast pb in tubewell water was higher but lower in wastewater compared to the values 0 005 0 061 mg l given by kharazi et al 2021 liu et al 2020a evaluated very much higher concentrations of pb in tubewell water and wastewater 7 64 and 7 15 mg l respectively than the current findings the pb contents were considerably lower than those 0 05 0 06 mg l predicted by alghobar and suresha 2016 in ground and sewage water samples all the water samples contain the lowest pb concentration compared to the maximum permissible limit 5 mg l of irrigated water reported by the usepa 2012 iron and steel engineering melting of copper and burning of char were the main causes of lead pollution in water sources forstner and wittmann 2012 however lead studies have verified that it is mostly engaged by the uppermost layer of soil and is not readily available to plants muszynska and labudda 2019 yang et al 2020 the concentration of pb in irrigated water sources for crops may not increase the pb availability to plants al othman et al 2016 this may be due to environmental sources such as pollution due to heavy traffic or due to other sources like environmental pollution due to traffic onakpa et al 2018 4 2 lead pb concentration in agricultural soil treated with different sources of water in the present research the pb concentration was lower in all soils than kharazi et al 2021 reported values in tubewell water and wastewater values 24 81 and 86 65 mg l respectively liu et al 2020a reported a similar concentration of pb 7 14 mg kg in soil irrigated with wastewater chaoua et al 2019 and liang et al 2011 reported elevated levels of pb 44 9 and 57 36 mg kg respectively in soil irrigated with wastewater aydin et al 2015 reported a lower pb content 5 32 mg kg than the present findings the pb level in the soil samples irrigated with wastewater was higher than the safety standards 8 5 mg kg singh et al 2010 soil irrigated with wastewater proved unhealthy and very toxic to consume inorganic lead is readily absorbed by soil green leafy crops absorb the most pb followed by roots such as radish and carrot sandeep et al 2019 chlorosis root blackening and stunted growth were all severe effects linked with high amounts of lead increasing pb levels were linked to lower enzyme activity alterations in water balance hormone concentration membrane integrity and permeability abdalla et al 2012 irrigation with municipal wastewater produces heavy metal buildup in agricultural soils putting inhabitants health at risk musa et al 2017 lead does not degrade or dissipate with time and it can be found in soil for thousands of years lead poisoning poses serious health concerns to humans particularly children under the age of six trejo et al 2021 by producing too many reactive oxygen species ros lead poisoning inhibits atp generation lipid peroxidation and dna damage yu et al 2020 lead also decreases seed germination root elongation seedling development plant growth transpiration chlorophyll production and water and protein content among other things zulfiqar et al 2019 4 3 lead pb concentration in edible parts of food crops treated with different sources of water in comparison to the current findings lead in tubewell water and wastewater treated crops was higher than the value reported by kharazi et al 2021 0 09 and 0 42 mg kg neeratanaphan et al 2017 and yu et al 2016 0 14 and 0 67 mg kg respectively asdeo 2014 found higher pb levels 5 96 mg kg in crops grown in wastewater the lead concentrations observed in the food crops samples in the present research were higher than the maximum permissible limit 3 mg kg fao who 2001 at all sites the current pb level was higher in food crops than the acceptable limit for all sites and treatments which may be due to polluted water irrigation severe environmental pollution and uptake of direct pb from the plant body surface via leaves samples of these crops were taken along highly trafficked roads which might account for the elevated levels of pb found in them even in crops irrigated with tube well water plants normally never take up lead and store it in their tissues ma et al 2019 when lead contaminated soil or air pollution settles lead particles may be found on vegetables produced in these places ogutucu et al 2021 if people consume unclean fruits and vegetables they might be exposed to pb contamination onakpa et al 2018 root absorption from soils and leaf uptake from air aerosols are widely considered the key mechanisms for heavy metal buildup in plants peng et al 2020 4 4 pollution load index pli bioconcentration factor bcf and enrichment factor ef in lead the pollution load index values for waste canal and tube well waters 0 049 0 078 and 0 050 respectively reported by yu et al 2022 were lower than the present findings jorfi et al 2017 reported a higher value of pli 3 8 than the current findings the pli for pb 1 was found in all of the samples treated with waste and canal waters at all sites in this study the pli values for pb were lower than the reference values 3 proposed by dosumu et al 2005 pli values greater than one indicate polluted soil while values less than one indicate clean soil jorfi et al 2017 pb in the current work has a pli value greater than one indicating that the soil was contaminated with pb the presence of pollution from manure waste canal waters and fertilisers may be the cause of higher pli levels in the soil treated with t 1 waste and canal waters the bioconcentration factors in a similar study reported by yu et al 2022 for wastewater 2 201 canal water 2 052 and tubewell water 2 045 were higher than the present findings ahmad et al 2018 evaluated the bcf 0 29 value for pb in ground irrigated crops lower than the present study the bcf for pb in all crops was significantly greater than the values 0 005 and 0 01 proposed by xiao rui et al 2016 and sakizadeh and ghorbani 2017 respectively soil is not the only source of pb bioconcentration airborne pb is also a primary component of pb in plants peng et al 2020 atmospheric deposition accounts for 73 95 of pb accumulation in crops liu et al 2020a a bioconcentration component greater than one indicates that the plant can collect toxic metals whereas a bcf less than one indicates that the plant can only absorb metal singh et al 2010 the bioconcentration factor for pb was less than one at all sites indicating that no lead metal was transferred from soil to plant the enrichment factor in wastewater reported by sarwar et al 2020 83 was much higher than the present findings at two separate locations khan et al 2016 3 48 and taha et al 2013 3 4 calculated greater ef values for pb than the current findings ef determines the ability of plant roots to be enriched by metals and the availability of metals heavy metal buildup in the soil was caused by both natural and human sources nevertheless it was difficult to determine which source contributes to which fraction of the soil metal burden as stated by zhang et al 2018 long term irrigation with sewage water leads to soil contamination owing to increased quantities of heavy metals in soil even though the concentration of heavy metals in wastewater is insufficient mohammed and folorunsho 2015 4 5 daily intake of metal dim health risk index hri and target hazard quotient thq in lead the daily intake of metal in wastewater grown crops of present investigation were higher than the findings of liu et al 2020a 0 0011 mg kg day higher daily pb intakes 0 015 and 0 03 mg kg day respectively have been reported by chaoua et al 2019 and khan et al 2013 we observed that the daily intake of pb 0 0003 mg kg day was much lower than previously reported the daily pb intake was below the who fao 2007 suggested permissible level of 0 214 mg kg day the health risk index in a similar study reported by yu et al 2022 in waste canal and tubewell waters 2 201 2 149 and 1 35 was much higher than the present findings liu et al 2020a reported hri 0 33 in wastewater grown crops that was lower than the present findings all food crops exhibited a reduced hri for pb compared to the values published by chaoua et al 2019 and khan et al 2013 pb was less bioavailable to plants because it was maintained in the top layer of the soil ankenbauer and loheide 2017 the human risk index hri for pb was found to be less than 1 that ensured that all crops were safe for consumption wastewater irrigated crops tested by gemeda et al 2021 sanaei et al 2021 and wang et al 2015 had thq values for pb that were much lower 0 065 0 07 and 0 011 respectively than this study isiuku and enyoh 2020 found a comparable thq finding 1 1 for pb in wastewater irrigated crops balkhair and ashraf 2016 reported very much higher thq value 1 81 than the current calculations it is possible that the eating of crops treated with wastewater may provide a hazardous danger to inhabitants in the vicinity usepa 2000 however the present findings shows if the thq was 1 indicating no cancer risk for consumers liu et al 2020b 5 conclusion due to a lack of fresh water supplies farmers have turned to wastewater as a means of increasing agricultural yields soil and crops had pb concentrations that were elevated fao who recommended safe levels the results indicate that soils were enriched with pb wastewater application resulted in a buildup of pb in soil and their transfer to the edible parts of food crops the soil and food crops contamination with pb and possible future health risk were examined in this study which indicates pb contamination not pose hazardous consequence because health risk index hri and target hazard quotient thq value were less than 1 however there is increasing trend of pb in soil and crops so its toxicity can be anticipated if these crops are consumed for longer period therefore strict monitoring of water contamination and treatment is required to prevent toxicity of pb from building up in soils and food crops and posing long term health

9376,in many countries where wastewater irrigation has become a common practice the accumulation of heavy metals by crops has been regarded as a severe environmental hazard the evaluation of the toxic element lead pb in water agricultural soils and food crops and their potential damage to human health is the focus of the present study samples of eleven food crops soil with three treatments waste canal and tube well waters were collected from three feeding sites sargodha city sahiwal shahpur and evaluated for pb concentration the results indicates that the range of pb in the water soil and crop samples were from 0 023 to 0 039 mg l 2 932 13 687 mg kg and 1 241 4 825 mg kg respectively the metal concentration was significantly higher p 0 001 in wastewater treated soil and crop samples that exceed the permissible limit of the world health organization who there is a positive correlation between the pb concentration in the soil and crop samples the pollution load index and enrichment factor are greater than 1 indicating a high level of soil contamination and the influence of natural and anthropogenic sources of pb metal accumulation in soils the bioconcentration factor bcf daily intake of metal dim health risk index hri and metal values are less than 1 indicating that toxic pb are present in lower quantities in food crops and had no health risks to consumers in wastewater treated soils there is a significant accumulation of pb toxicity therefore it is vitally important to address pb contamination and its potential entrance route into the human food chain keywords

in fine soil particles which can be absorbed through soil dust huang et al 2020 lead in soil can also be converted into a pb containing mineral in contact with another element in the soil arshad et al 2016 pb levels in soil tend to rise which raises pb levels in plants lead is firmly attached to the soil surface and its bond with the soil improves as the amount of organic matter in the soil increases kwon et al 2017 because of their exposure to lead dust which accumulates over time soils near highways had higher levels of lead than soils in other places plants can absorb lead dust through their leaves if they are exposed to it de silva et al 2021 plants are also capable of absorbing trace levels of lead from the soil the sources of pb in soil might be wastewater and environmental pollution kanwar et al 2020 by reducing wastewater irrigation and planting phytoremediator plants the soil level of pb can be balanced within safe limits khalid et al 2017 plants take up pb by absorption from polluted water irrigated soil which is a major source khanam et al 2020 plants have a limited potential to absorb pb directly from the soil but they do so to some extent at high

polluted soil better than s criniflorum when comparing p hortorum and s criniflorum p hortorum had a greater pb accumulation per plant as a result the authors suggested that p hortorum be used to treat pb polluted soils through interaction with air water and food heavy metals become a component of the body system and they cannot be removed simply by washing fruits and vegetables instead they accumulate in the main edible portion el ramady et al 2015 yu et al 2022 when pb enters the human body it poses a greater threat to human health klamerth et al 2013 rehman et al 2019 plumbism is a

for the comprehensive evaluation of the degree of contamination in soil and crops that may pose health risks to humans ahmad et al 2016 bhatti et al 2015 hembrom et al 2020 for the calculation of pollution various indices were used such as the pollution load index pli bioconcentration factor bcf and enrichment factor ef these pollution indices are used to make recommendations about metal contamination in the soil and the transfer of heavy metal concentrations in various parts of plants parts from the soil andem et al 2015 bakshi et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 to measure the level of the health risk posed by heavy metals various health indices such as daily intake of metals dim health risk index hri and target hazard quotients thq were developed by the united states environmental protection agency for the estimation of potential health risks associated with long term exposure to chemical pollutants ezemonye et al 2019 hembrom et al 2020 hussain et al 2021 miranzadeh et al 2020 as a result it is necessary to monitor the level of toxicity of lead pb metal as this determines the hazards of pb to plants and human health in the environment under various irrigation water sources the authors set out to examine lead hazards in food crop consumers as well as lead transmission along the water soil plant continuum under different treatments considering these facts this study was conducted i to investigate the toxicity level of lead pb in water soil and food crops ii to evaluate the soil pollution intensity iii to determine various mobility and pollution indices including health risk which will be of utmost importance for redressing and safely guarding the public from toxicosis resulting from the consumption of contaminated food crops from said heavy metal 2 materials

tube well water t 3 three sites were selected to obtain soil and crop samples fig 1 clean pvc label bags were used to collect soil and food crop samples while clean plastic label bottles were used to collect water samples the specimens were taken during the 2018 2019 crop season from a variety of peri urban agriculture areas in selected locations 2 2 preparation of test samples to collect samples a randomised complete block design rcbd was used for sampling selected food crops table 1 three composite samples were obtained from three sites each with three replicates 2 2 1 water sampling and preservation the total n 27 water samples were collected from nine major wastewater canal water and tubewell water collection points in the field that were used to irrigate the selected food crops in the study samples were taken using standard sampling techniques one millilitre of hno3 per liter of water sample was added to preserve the heavy metal content water samples were transferred to the lab and kept at 4 c in the dark and dry conditions 2 2 2 soil and food crop sampling and preservation samples of soil and selected food crops n 99 were taken selected locations in the district sargodha table 1 an auger sampler was used to obtain soil samples at a depth of 5 30 cm in areas where food crops were grown three composite samples were made for each soil and food crop the soil and plant samples were taken from the same area of the field to remove dust and unwanted materials crop samples were rinsed with deionized water and transported to the laboratory in marked paper bags to assess the potential for metal deposition and human ingestion after wastewater irrigation mostly edible components were taken the soil and food crop samples were oven dried at 70 c until a consistent weight was achieved finally the samples were thoroughly ground and blended with a mixer and transported to polyethylene airtight zipper bags and carried inside the laboratory 2 3 analysis of heavy metals 2 3

in t 1 treated crops because the lead concentration in irrigated water was higher than that built up in soil and transferred to the crops 3 4 scatter plot analysis for lead pb concentration in soils

correlation of pb in soil but a moderate correlation in crops while site 2 vs s 3 had a moderate positive correlation in soils and a very low correlation in crop samples fig 3 similarly a strong positive significant correlation in soils vs crops was also observed fig 4 the positive correlation shows the synergistic effect of pb on all sites of soil and crops the regression analysis also indicated a low to moderate positive significant p 0 001 value of lead in the soil and a very low to very low significant p 0 001 regression in the crop samples figs 3 and 4 but a highly significant positive regression in the soil vs crop samples fig 5 3 5 pollution load index pli bioconcentration factor bcf and enrichment factor ef in lead the pb pollution load index ranged from 0 367 to 1 641

and tube well water 0 057 and 0 032 mg l was lower but in canal water 0 029 mg l was higher than the reported value of yu et al 2022 in contrast pb in tubewell water was higher but lower in wastewater compared to the values 0 005 0 061 mg l given by kharazi et al 2021 liu et al 2020a evaluated very much higher concentrations of pb in tubewell water and wastewater 7 64 and 7 15 mg l respectively than the current findings the pb contents were considerably lower than those 0 05 0 06 mg l predicted by alghobar and suresha 2016 in ground and sewage water samples all the water samples contain the lowest pb concentration compared to the maximum permissible limit 5 mg l of irrigated water reported by the usepa 2012 iron and steel engineering melting of copper and burning of char were the main causes of lead pollution in water sources forstner and wittmann 2012 however lead studies have verified that it is mostly engaged by the uppermost layer of soil and is not readily available to plants muszynska and labudda 2019 yang et al 2020 the concentration of pb in irrigated water sources for crops may not increase the pb availability to plants al othman et al 2016 this may be due to environmental sources such as pollution due to heavy traffic or due to other sources like environmental pollution due to traffic onakpa et al 2018 4 2 lead pb concentration in agricultural soil treated with different sources of water in the present research the pb concentration was lower in all soils than kharazi et al 2021 reported values in tubewell water and wastewater values 24 81 and 86 65 mg l respectively liu et al 2020a reported a similar concentration of pb 7 14 mg kg in soil irrigated with wastewater chaoua et al 2019 and liang et al 2011 reported elevated levels of pb 44 9 and 57 36 mg kg respectively in soil irrigated with wastewater aydin et al 2015 reported a lower pb content 5 32 mg kg than the present findings the pb level in the soil samples irrigated with wastewater was higher than the safety standards 8 5 mg kg singh et al 2010 soil irrigated with wastewater proved unhealthy and very toxic to consume inorganic lead is readily absorbed by soil green leafy crops absorb the most pb followed by roots such as radish and carrot sandeep et al 2019 chlorosis root blackening and stunted growth were all severe effects linked with high amounts of lead increasing pb levels were linked to lower enzyme activity alterations in water balance hormone concentration membrane integrity and permeability abdalla et al 2012 irrigation with municipal wastewater produces heavy metal buildup in agricultural soils putting inhabitants health at risk musa et al 2017 lead does not degrade or dissipate with time and it can be found in soil for thousands of years lead poisoning poses serious health concerns to humans particularly children under the age of six trejo et al 2021 by producing too many reactive oxygen species ros lead poisoning inhibits atp generation lipid peroxidation and dna damage yu et al 2020 lead also decreases seed germination root elongation seedling development plant growth transpiration chlorophyll production and water and protein content among other things zulfiqar et al 2019 4 3 lead pb concentration in edible parts of food crops treated with different sources of water in comparison to the current findings lead in tubewell water and wastewater treated crops was higher than the value reported by kharazi et al 2021 0 09 and 0 42 mg kg neeratanaphan et al 2017 and yu et al 2016 0 14 and 0 67 mg kg respectively asdeo 2014 found higher pb levels 5 96 mg kg in crops grown in wastewater the lead concentrations observed in the food crops samples in the present research were higher than the maximum permissible limit 3 mg kg fao who 2001 at all sites the current pb level was higher in food crops than the acceptable limit for all sites and treatments which may be due to polluted water irrigation severe environmental pollution and uptake of direct pb from the plant body surface via leaves samples of these crops were taken along highly trafficked roads which might account for the elevated levels of pb found in them even in crops irrigated with tube well water plants normally never take up lead and store it in their tissues ma et al 2019 when lead contaminated soil or air pollution settles lead particles may be found on vegetables produced in these places ogutucu et al 2021 if people consume unclean fruits and vegetables they might be exposed to pb contamination onakpa et al 2018 root absorption from soils and leaf uptake from air aerosols are widely considered the key mechanisms for heavy metal buildup in plants peng et al 2020 4 4 pollution load index pli bioconcentration factor bcf and enrichment factor ef in lead the pollution load index values for waste canal and tube well waters 0 049 0 078 and 0 050 respectively reported by yu et al 2022 were lower than the present findings jorfi et al 2017 reported a higher value of pli 3 8 than the current findings the pli for pb 1 was found in all of the samples treated with waste and canal waters at all sites in this study the pli values for pb were lower than the reference values 3 proposed by dosumu et al 2005 pli values greater than one indicate polluted soil while values less than one indicate clean soil jorfi et al 2017 pb in the current work has a pli value greater than one indicating that the soil was contaminated with pb the presence of pollution from manure waste canal waters and fertilisers may be the cause of higher pli levels in the soil treated with t 1 waste and canal waters the bioconcentration factors in a similar study reported by yu et al 2022 for wastewater 2 201 canal water 2 052 and tubewell water 2 045 were higher than the present findings ahmad et al 2018 evaluated the bcf 0 29 value for pb in ground irrigated crops lower than the present study the bcf for pb in all crops was significantly greater than the values 0 005 and 0 01 proposed by xiao rui et al 2016 and sakizadeh and ghorbani 2017 respectively soil is not the only source of pb bioconcentration airborne pb is also a primary component of pb in plants peng et al 2020 atmospheric deposition accounts for 73 95 of pb accumulation in crops liu et al 2020a a bioconcentration component greater than one indicates that the plant can collect toxic metals whereas a bcf less than one indicates that the plant can only absorb metal singh et al 2010 the bioconcentration factor for pb was less than one at all sites indicating that no lead metal was transferred from soil to plant the enrichment factor in wastewater reported by sarwar et al 2020 83 was much higher than the present findings at two separate locations khan et al 2016 3 48 and taha et al 2013 3 4 calculated greater ef values for pb than the current findings ef determines the ability of plant roots to be enriched by metals and the availability of metals heavy metal buildup in the soil was caused by both natural and human sources nevertheless it was difficult to determine which source contributes to which fraction of the soil metal burden as stated by zhang et al 2018 long term irrigation with sewage water leads to soil contamination owing to increased quantities of heavy metals in soil even though the concentration of heavy metals in wastewater is insufficient mohammed and folorunsho 2015 4 5 daily intake of metal dim health risk index hri and target hazard quotient thq in lead the daily intake of metal in wastewater grown crops of present investigation were higher than the findings of liu et al 2020a 0 0011 mg kg day higher daily pb intakes 0 015 and 0 03 mg kg day respectively have been reported by chaoua et al 2019 and khan et al 2013 we observed that the daily intake of pb 0 0003 mg kg day was much lower than previously reported the daily pb intake was below the who fao 2007 suggested permissible level of 0 214 mg kg day the health risk index in a similar study reported by yu et al 2022 in waste canal and tubewell waters 2 201 2 149 and 1 35 was much higher than the present findings liu et al 2020a reported hri 0 33 in wastewater grown crops that was lower than the present findings all food crops exhibited a reduced hri for pb compared to the values published by chaoua et al 2019 and khan et al 2013 pb was less bioavailable to plants because it was maintained in the top layer of the soil ankenbauer and loheide 2017 the human risk index hri for pb was found to be less than 1 that ensured that all crops were safe for consumption wastewater irrigated crops tested by gemeda et al 2021 sanaei et al 2021 and wang et al 2015 had thq values for pb that were much lower 0 065 0 07 and 0 011 respectively than this study isiuku and enyoh 2020 found a comparable thq finding 1 1 for pb in wastewater irrigated crops balkhair and ashraf 2016 reported very much higher thq value 1 81 than the current calculations it is possible that the eating of crops treated with wastewater may provide a hazardous danger to inhabitants in the vicinity usepa 2000 however the present findings shows if the thq was 1 indicating no cancer risk for consumers liu et al 2020b 5 conclusion due to a lack of fresh water supplies farmers have turned to wastewater as a means of increasing agricultural yields soil and crops had pb concentrations that were elevated fao who recommended safe levels the results indicate that soils were enriched with pb wastewater application resulted in a buildup of pb in soil and their transfer to the edible parts of food crops the soil and food crops contamination with pb and possible future health risk were examined in this study which indicates pb contamination not pose hazardous consequence because health risk index hri and target hazard quotient thq value were less than 1 however there is increasing trend of pb in soil and crops so its toxicity can be anticipated if these crops are consumed for longer period therefore strict monitoring of water contamination and treatment is required to prevent toxicity of pb from building up in soils and food crops and posing long term health

9377,the excessive irrigation and fertilization are common in wheat triticum aestivum l production in northwest china which not only results in resources waste and environmental pollution but also not necessarily guarantee high wheat yield due to the plant overgrowth it is thus crucial to explore a suitable irrigation and fertilization strategy that benefits high yield wheat cultivation by regulating post anthesis dry matter accumulation and translocation a consecutive four season field experiment 2014 2018 was undertaken on drip fertigated winter wheat with three irrigation levels based on the soil moisture content of moistening layers w1 normal irrigation w2 mild deficit irrigation w3 severe deficit irrigation and three fertilization n p2o5 k2o rates f1 175 117 150 kg ha 1 f2 125 84 108 kg ha 1 f3 75 50 65 kg ha 1 the results showed that the logistic growth equation could well describe the accumulation process of aboveground dry matter with r 2 ranging 0 989 0 999 p 0 01 water stress advanced the thermal time required from sowing to the maximum aboveground dry matter rate while the maximum aboveground dry matter rate and average accumulated rate of aboveground dry matter increased with the increase of irrigation and fertilization regimes dry matter translocation showed a negative relationship with fertilization rate however both the post anthesis dry matter accumulation and its contribution to total dry matter at maturity cdma increased with the increasing fertilization rate with the increase of water and fertilizer supply dry matter translocation efficiency decreased but cdma showed the opposite trend the post anthesis dry matter accumulation was positively related to winter wheat grain yield when the grain yield reached above 7 5 mg ha 1 in northwest china the post anthesis accumulated dry matter should be more than 4 7 mg ha 1 it was concluded that the mild deficit irrigation along with n p2o5 k2o fertilization of 125 84 108 kg ha 1 enhanced the productivity of winter wheat by increasing the post anthesis dry matter translocation and accumulation keywords drip fertigation grain yield growing degree days logistic equation dry matter accumulation and translocation 1 introduction due to the burgeoning population on the globe more staple food is urgently needed wheat triticum aestivum l is widely planted in the world and is an important food sources for humans contributing approximately 20 to the global calorific consumption liu et al 2020a b china as the largest wheat producer and consumer around the world produces 133 6 million tons wheat with a planting area of 23 7 million ha in 2019 fao 2019 however the scarce water resources resulting from the low precipitation and frequent drought especially over the growing period of winter wheat is a major factor that limits the wheat production in northwest china lu et al 2022 si et al 2020 water deficiency negatively influences crop growth and yield formation because drought stress results in many plant physiological and biochemical reactions jiang et al 2020 sidhua et al 2021 liu et al 2016 irrigation especially drip irrigation is conductive to saving water and improving crop photosynthesis and promoting dry matter accumulation grain filling and yield formation cao et al 2021 li et al 2021 madani et al 2010 yan et al 2022 yang et al 2020 found that compared to border irrigation drip irrigation reduced spring wheat evapotranspiration soil evaporation and transpiration by an average of 3 5 mm 18 5 mm and 22 mm per year respectively water deficit is beneficial for the mobilization and translocation of water before the anthesis stage of wheat however water stress adversely affects the photosynthesis and accelerates the flag leaves senescence especially after the anthesis stage wu et al 2014 therefore there is an urgent need to investigate how water supply can improve the grain yield of wheat by regulating dry matter distribution reasonably fertilizer supply through providing the soil and plants with the macronutrients nitrogen phosphorus and potassium also directly or indirectly influences the dry matter distribution and assimilate production arduini et al 2006 gaju et al 2014 lollato et al 2019 yan et al 2020 nitrogen exerts important impact on the normal growth of crops and the partition of dry matter to reproductive organs wang et al 2017 2021 the excessive fertilization however not only leads to serious ecological pollution for instance soil nitrogen leaching greenhouse gases emission and surface water eutrophication but also causes high economic inputs guo et al 2010 a large number of studies have found that the interaction between water and fertilizer management practices affects crop growth yield and resources use hamzei 2018 it is thus crucial to seek the proper irrigation and fertilization patterns of wheat for developing water saving agriculture and reducing the negative impact of the soil macronutrients surplus the grain yield of wheat mainly relies on its components like grain number per spike spike length and spike number per square meter qin et al 2015 grain dry matter after harvest is also a crucial standard for evaluating wheat productivity weichert et al 2017 the accumulation partitioning and translocation of dry matter in plant organs vary with soil chemical characteristics influenced by irrigation and fertilization practices ferrise et al 2010 yan et al 2019 however there is a competitive relationship between the wheat vegetative and reproductive growth especially the stem and spike previous studies found that at the rapid grain filling stage after defoliation of wheat the dry matter of stem reduced for providing grains with assimilates madani et al 2010 blindly reducing the non grain dry matter for increasing dry weight of grains may restrict photosynthesis capacity and restrain retranslocation of stored carbohydrates to grains and spikes also require assimilate supply foulkes et al 2011 rivera amado et al 2019 vegetative organs of wheat are the main sources of grain dry matter during grain filling and it strongly influences the grain yield formation when the photo assimilation accounts for 50 67 of total grain dry matter huang et al 2020 hence the optimization of grain partitioning not only needs to improve dry matter partitioning of wheat spikes at anthesis but also requires to guarantee the post anthesis growth of non grain components for maintaining the photosynthetic capacity and soluble carbohydrate translocation in wheat plants ba et al 2020 parry et al 2011 rivera amado et al 2019 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 besides another way for increasing spike growth at anthesis is to extend the relative duration of phenological stage of spike growth gonz√°lez et al 2011 both the delayed harvest period and prolonged grain filling period were beneficial to the dry matter accumulation markoviƒá et al 2020 consequently the accumulation partitioning and translocation of dry matter in each organ during the growth period of wheat plays an essential impact in the final grain yield formation in pursuit of high grain yield of wheat the response of grain formation to biomass production needs to be further explored temperature is one of main limiting factors for dry matter accumulation in wheat li et al 2001 markoviƒá et al 2020 the simulation of crop dynamics under effective accumulated temperature is helpful to explicitly explore crop growth characteristics it is common to use simple and accurate mathematical models to express the relationships between crop growth and temperatures e g logistic gompertz weibull and richards equations richard 1959 verhulst 1838 winsor 1932 weibull 1951 among these the logistic model is the most frequently used equation that successfully simulates the dynamic crop growth including both grain and crop dry matter jia et al 2014 previous results found that the logistic equation performed well in simulating the characteristic parameters of wheat growth curves ding et al 2019 the logistic growth functions could well describe the aboveground biomass accumulation of wheat with the adjusted r 2 of 0 89 0 99 p 0 001 xiao et al 2019 however little information is still known whether the logistic function can simulate the aboveground dry matter of winter wheat at various irrigation and fertilization levels in northwest china the objectives of the present study were to 1 explore the variations of dry matter accumulation partitioning and translocation of each organ wheat yield and its components under various irrigation amounts and fertilization rates and 2 investigate the response of grain yield formation to dry matter accumulation this study can provide important information for high yielding and high efficient winter wheat production in northwest china 2 material and methods 2 1 study site field experiments were performed over

aboveground dry matter is the carbohydrate accumulated by plants during photosynthesis which is also closely related to the final production the changes of aboveground dry matter of winter wheat with accumulated temperature after sowing under different water and fertilizer supplies during the four consecutive growing seasons of 2014 2018 are shown in fig 1 generally the aboveground dry matter of winter wheat showed a slight increase at the early stages a rapid growth at the middle stages and then maintained stable or declined gradually after reaching the maximum value the logistic equation could better describe the relationship between aboveground dry matter and accumulated temperature with r 2 ranging 0 989 0 999 table 2 p 0 01 the coefficient of variation cv of b was 32 9 which was greater than that of a 21 9 and c 9 5 the coefficients of variation of both maximum aboveground dry matter rate v max and average accumulated rate of aboveground dry matter v were relatively large but that of the thermal time required from sowing to maximum aboveground dry matter rate t max was only 5 4 the a value in the logistic equation declined with the increasing water stress table 3 w1 and w2 obtained significantly greater a value than w3 p 0 05 but there was insignificant difference between w1 and w2 p 0 05 irrigation levels did not affect the b value significantly p 0 05 the t max also

fertilization rate highly significantly affected t max v max d and v p 0 01 which also meant both of them greatly affected the accumulation time and rate of aboveground dry matter however the hydrological year only showed extremely significant effect on t max and d p 0 01 which implied that the hydrological year only affected the accumulation time of aboveground dry matter greatly the

fertilization rates at the same irrigation amount but those of leaves and rachis glume showed opposite trends table 4 the proportions of stem and grain under nf were significantly greater compared with those under f1 f2 and f3 p 0 05 w3 obtained significantly higher proportions of stem and grain than w1 p 0 05 but it had insignificant difference from w2 p 0 05 compared with nf f1 f2 and f3

significantly higher than those under f1 f2 and f3 except for grain proportion under f3 conversely the proportions of leaves and rachis glume increased with increasing fertilization rates and those under nf were significantly lower than those under f1 f2 and f3 except for rachis glume proportion under f3 the hydrological year had certain impact on dry matter partitioning in organs at maturity especially the proportions of leaf and grains the proportions of stem leaves rachis glume and grain at the maturity stage of winter wheat ranged from 25 9 to 28 3 from 8 6 to 12 9 from 11 5 to 16 7 and from 46 3 to 49 4 during the four growing seasons respectively irrigation amount affected the proportions of leaves and spike at anthesis significantly p 0 05 and it also had highly significant

post anthesis accumulation and dry matter translocation y 0 156x 3 139 r 2 0 26 p 0 001 fig 4b 4 discussion 4 1 effects of various drip fertigation regimes on dry matter accumulation of winter wheat dry matter accumulation strongly depends on water and fertilization conditions as well as weather conditions biomass was significantly associated with grain yield of wheat regardless of species which has been confirmed in previous studies agegnehu et al 2014 the achievement of high yield strongly depends on the improved spike dry matter at anthesis and grain number per spike duan et al 2018 similarly the results of this study indicated that wheat yield had positively liner relationships with the effective growing degree days average accumulated rate of dry matter and post anthesis dry matter accumulation the logistic equation well fitted the process of aboveground dry matter accumulation under different water and fertilizer supplies in this study the logistic model has also been successfully used to capture the trends of dry matter accumulation of wheat liu et al 2020a b xiao et al 2019 based on the fitting of the richard equation song et al 2016 found that irrigation at overwintering and jointing stages can postpone the total period of dry matter accumulation of winter wheat while nitrogen application significantly improved the average and maximum rates of dry matter accumulation and the hydrological year affected the rapid growth period and the time to reach the maximal rate of dry matter accumulation however based on a three year field experiment zhao et al 2013 found that there was insignificant correlation between nitrogen application and population dry matter accumulation rate by fitting the logistic equation the reasons for the differences in the results of the present study may be related to the nitrogen application rate and soil nutrients supply capacity previous studies have found that the distribution and translocation of dry matter were affected by many factors for example varieties climatic conditions planting patterns and field management practices arduini et al 2006 fang et al 2010 liu et al 2020a b weichert et al 2017 where water and fertilizer supply are the main human factors affecting dry matter distribution and post anthesis dry matter translocation ding et al 2016 in the present study irrigation and fertilization had highly significant effect on t max v max d and v p 0 01 which indicated that irrigation and fertilization influenced the period and rate of aboveground dry matter accumulation the hydrological year highly significantly influenced t max and d p 0 01 previous studies indicated that water deficit inhibited photosynthesis promoted early aging decreased the post anthesis assimilation and shortened grain filling period thereby causing lower grain yield jiang et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 compared with rain fed irrigation significantly shortened the period before the jointing stage and prolonged the period of grain filling of wheat villegas et al 2001 which was similar to the finding of the present study water stress advanced t max while v max and v showed decreasing trends with the increasing water stress mineral nutrition supply is a major factor influencing carbohydrate partitioning ding and xu 2011 xu et al 2021 reported that the maximal mean crop growth rate of wheat maize intercropping improved with topdressing n fertilizer which was consistent with the result of the present study that both v max and v increased with increasing fertilization rates 4 2 effects of various drip fertigation regimes on the partitioning and translocation efficiency of aboveground dry matter of winter wheat dry matter partitioning and translocation is essential to achieve high and stable wheat yield ding and xu 2011 gonz√°lez et al 2011 increasing dry matter is the premise for obtaining high yield and then distributing more nutrients to grains also plays a curial role xu et al 2021 the translocation and assimilation of vegetative organs after anthesis affected by irrigation fertilization and hydrological year is the main source of grain yield formation irrigation and fertilization can promote grain yield of wheat by influencing the canopy structure of wheat population and photosynthetic rate as well as regulating the proportion of sink to source feng et al 2017 liu et al 2020a b yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 this study indicated that the proportions of both stem and grain dry matter at maturity showed decreasing trends with increasing fertilization rates and the proportions of stem and grain dry matter under water stressed conditions were significantly greater than those under normal irrigation in order to enhance the grain filling capacity stem and spike reserves for support is a curial physiological characteristic in wheat madani et al 2010 ding and xu 2011 found that high yielding wheat accumulated more dry matter from booting to maturity obtained relatively greater proportions of stem and spike dry matter at anthesis and lower translocation of leaf dry matter madani et al 2010 pointed out that the source limitation enhanced stem and spike reserve contributions to grain filling processes while water stress improved the sink limitation by reducing the grain filling rate and dry matter translocation to grain at the initial stage of rapid grain filling this also in accordance with our findings which showed that the proportions of both stem and leaf dry matter at anthesis decreased with the increasing water stress but the spike proportion increased this study found that dry matter translocation dmt reduced with the increase of fertilization rates however both the post anthesis dry matter accumulation postdm and the contribution of post anthesis dry matter accumulation to total dry matter at maturity cdma increased with increasing fertilization rates the dmt dmte caadm and caag increased with the increasing water stress and w1 and w2 obtained significantly greater values than w3 p 0 05 similar results were also found by zhang et al 2019 who concluded that the reduced irrigation rate before the end of anthesis stage significantly decreased dry matter accumulation and photosynthetic rate at anthesis but enhanced the translocation of photosynthates to the spikes changing the tillage methods of the wheat maize rotation system affected the root water status of winter wheat which was conducive to promoting the contribution of post anthesis dry matter to the grain and thus increased yield latifmanesh et al 2018 compared with no irrigation supplementary irrigation reduced translocation efficiency of post anthesis dry matter and also increased the accumulation of post anthesis dry matter and the cdma of high yielding wheat was greater than 70 feng et al 2017 differently the cdma of high yielding wheat during the four seasons in this study was around 67 which was relatively lower it may be caused by the differences of climatic conditions soil nutrients supply capacity and varieties in various regions besides zheng et al 2021 indicated that the nitrogen application rate of 180 kg ha 1 produced greater post anthesis dry matter assimilation and its contribution to the grain the present study found that the cdma increased with increasing fertilization rates while the average cdma over the four seasons under f1 f2 and f3 were 67 1 64 8 and 53 3 respectively table 5 5 conclusions the logistic equation could well describe the accumulation process of aboveground dry matter of winter wheat at various irrigation amounts and fertilization rates water stress advanced the thermal time required from sowing to the maximum aboveground dry matter rate while the maximum aboveground dry matter rate and average accumulated rate of aboveground dry matter increased with increasing irrigation and fertilization regimes the proportions of stem and spike dry matter declined with the increasing fertilization rates grain yield increased with increasing fertilization rates but there was insignificant difference between f1 and f2 dry matter translocation declined with increasing fertilization rates whilst the post anthesis dry matter accumulation increased with increasing fertilization rates when wheat yield reached 4 5 6 0 mg ha 1 6 0 7 5 mg ha 1 and 7 5 9 0 mg ha 1 the post anthesis dry matter accumulation of 1 3 3 0 mg ha 1 3 0 4 7 mg ha 1 and 4 7 6 3 mg ha 1 needed to be obtained respectively comprehensively considering dry matter accumulation partitioning and translocation as well as grain yield and its components the mild deficit irrigation w2 with n p2o5 k2o fertilization rate of 125 84 108 kg ha 1 is highly recommended for drip fertigated winter wheat production in northwest

9377,the excessive irrigation and fertilization are common in wheat triticum aestivum l production in northwest china which not only results in resources waste and environmental pollution but also not necessarily guarantee high wheat yield due to the plant overgrowth it is thus crucial to explore a suitable irrigation and fertilization strategy that benefits high yield wheat cultivation by regulating post anthesis dry matter accumulation and translocation a consecutive four season field experiment 2014 2018 was undertaken on drip fertigated winter wheat with three irrigation levels based on the soil moisture content of moistening layers w1 normal irrigation w2 mild deficit irrigation w3 severe deficit irrigation and three fertilization n p2o5 k2o rates f1 175 117 150 kg ha 1 f2 125 84 108 kg ha 1 f3 75 50 65 kg ha 1 the results showed that the logistic growth equation could well describe the accumulation process of aboveground dry matter with r 2 ranging 0 989 0 999 p 0 01 water stress advanced the thermal time required from sowing to the maximum aboveground dry matter rate while the maximum aboveground dry matter rate and average accumulated rate of aboveground dry matter increased with the increase of irrigation and fertilization regimes dry matter translocation showed a negative relationship with fertilization rate however both the post anthesis dry matter accumulation and its contribution to total dry matter at maturity cdma increased with the increasing fertilization rate with the increase of water and fertilizer supply dry matter translocation efficiency decreased but cdma showed the opposite trend the post anthesis dry matter accumulation was positively related to winter wheat grain yield when the grain yield reached above 7 5 mg ha 1 in northwest china the post anthesis accumulated dry matter should be more than 4 7 mg ha 1 it was concluded that the mild deficit irrigation along with n p2o5 k2o fertilization of 125 84 108 kg ha 1 enhanced the productivity of winter wheat by increasing the post anthesis dry matter translocation and accumulation keywords drip fertigation grain yield growing degree days logistic equation dry matter accumulation and translocation 1 introduction due to the burgeoning population on the globe more staple food is urgently needed wheat triticum aestivum l is widely planted in the world and is an important food sources for humans contributing approximately 20 to the global calorific consumption liu et al 2020a b china as the largest wheat producer and consumer around the world produces 133 6 million tons wheat with a planting area of 23 7 million ha in 2019 fao 2019 however the scarce water resources resulting from the low precipitation and frequent drought especially over the growing period of winter wheat is a major factor that limits the wheat production in northwest china lu et al 2022 si et al 2020 water deficiency negatively influences crop growth and yield formation because drought stress results in many plant physiological and biochemical reactions jiang et al 2020 sidhua et al 2021 liu et al 2016 irrigation especially drip irrigation is conductive to saving water and improving crop photosynthesis and promoting dry matter accumulation grain filling and yield formation cao et al 2021 li et al 2021 madani et al 2010 yan et al 2022 yang et al 2020 found that compared to border irrigation drip irrigation reduced spring wheat evapotranspiration soil evaporation and transpiration by an average of 3 5 mm 18 5 mm and 22 mm per year respectively water deficit is beneficial for the mobilization and translocation of water before the anthesis stage of wheat however water stress adversely affects the photosynthesis and accelerates the flag leaves senescence especially after the anthesis stage wu et al 2014 therefore there is an urgent need to investigate how water supply can improve the grain yield of wheat by regulating dry matter distribution reasonably fertilizer supply through providing the soil and plants with the macronutrients nitrogen phosphorus and potassium also directly or indirectly influences the dry matter distribution and assimilate production arduini et al 2006 gaju et al 2014 lollato et al 2019 yan et al 2020 nitrogen exerts important impact on the normal growth of crops and the partition of dry matter to reproductive organs wang et al 2017 2021 the excessive fertilization however not only leads to serious ecological pollution for instance soil nitrogen leaching greenhouse gases emission and surface water eutrophication but also causes high economic inputs guo et al 2010 a large number of studies have found that the interaction between water and fertilizer management practices affects crop growth yield and resources use hamzei 2018 it is thus crucial to seek the proper irrigation and fertilization patterns of wheat for developing water saving agriculture and reducing the negative impact of the soil macronutrients surplus the grain yield of wheat mainly relies on its components like grain number per spike spike length and spike number per square meter qin et al 2015 grain dry matter after harvest is also a crucial standard for evaluating wheat productivity weichert et al 2017 the accumulation partitioning and translocation of dry matter in plant organs vary with soil chemical characteristics influenced by irrigation and fertilization practices ferrise et al 2010 yan et al 2019 however there is a competitive relationship between the wheat vegetative and reproductive growth especially the stem and spike previous studies found that at the rapid grain filling stage after defoliation of wheat the dry matter of stem reduced for providing grains with assimilates madani et al 2010 blindly reducing the non grain dry matter for increasing dry weight of grains may restrict photosynthesis capacity and restrain retranslocation of stored carbohydrates to grains and spikes also require assimilate supply foulkes et al 2011 rivera amado et al 2019 vegetative organs of wheat are the main sources of grain dry matter during grain filling and it strongly influences the grain yield formation when the photo assimilation accounts for 50 67 of total grain dry matter huang et al 2020 hence the optimization of grain partitioning not only needs to improve dry matter partitioning of wheat spikes at anthesis but also requires to guarantee the post anthesis growth of non grain components for maintaining the photosynthetic capacity and soluble carbohydrate translocation in wheat plants ba et al 2020 parry et al 2011 rivera amado et al 2019 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 besides another way for increasing spike growth at anthesis is to extend the relative duration of phenological stage of spike growth gonz√°lez et al 2011 both the delayed harvest period and prolonged grain filling period were beneficial to the dry matter accumulation markoviƒá et al 2020 consequently the accumulation partitioning and translocation of dry matter in each organ during the growth period of wheat plays an essential impact in the final grain yield formation in pursuit of high grain yield of wheat the response of grain formation to biomass production needs to be further explored temperature is one of main limiting factors for dry matter accumulation in wheat li et al 2001 markoviƒá et al 2020 the simulation of crop dynamics under effective accumulated temperature is helpful to explicitly explore crop growth characteristics it is common to use simple and accurate mathematical models to express the relationships between crop growth and temperatures e g logistic gompertz weibull and richards equations richard 1959 verhulst 1838 winsor 1932 weibull 1951 among these the logistic model is the most frequently used equation that successfully simulates the dynamic crop growth including both grain and crop dry matter jia et al 2014 previous results found that the logistic equation performed well in simulating the characteristic parameters of wheat growth curves ding et al 2019 the logistic growth functions could well describe the aboveground biomass accumulation of wheat with the adjusted r 2 of 0 89 0 99 p 0 001 xiao et al 2019 however little information is still known whether the logistic function can simulate the aboveground dry matter of winter wheat at various irrigation and fertilization levels in northwest china the objectives of the present study were to 1 explore the variations of dry matter accumulation partitioning and translocation of each organ wheat yield and its components under various irrigation amounts and fertilization rates and 2 investigate the response of grain yield formation to dry matter accumulation this study can provide important information for high yielding and high efficient winter wheat production in northwest china 2 material and methods 2 1 study site field experiments were performed over

aboveground dry matter is the carbohydrate accumulated by plants during photosynthesis which is also closely related to the final production the changes of aboveground dry matter of winter wheat with accumulated temperature after sowing under different water and fertilizer supplies during the four consecutive growing seasons of 2014 2018 are shown in fig 1 generally the aboveground dry matter of winter wheat showed a slight increase at the early stages a rapid growth at the middle stages and then maintained stable or declined gradually after reaching the maximum value the logistic equation

fertilization rate highly significantly affected t max v max d and v p 0 01 which also meant both of them greatly affected the accumulation time and rate of aboveground dry matter however the hydrological year only showed extremely significant effect on t max and d p 0 01 which implied that the hydrological year only affected the accumulation time of aboveground dry matter greatly the

post anthesis accumulation and dry matter translocation y 0 156x 3 139 r 2 0 26 p 0 001 fig 4b 4 discussion 4 1 effects of various drip fertigation regimes on dry matter accumulation of winter wheat dry matter accumulation strongly depends on water and fertilization conditions as well as weather conditions biomass was significantly associated with grain yield of wheat regardless of species which has been confirmed in previous studies agegnehu et al 2014 the achievement of high yield strongly depends on the improved spike dry matter at anthesis and grain number per spike duan et al 2018 similarly the results of this study indicated that wheat yield had positively liner relationships with the effective growing degree days average accumulated rate of dry matter and post anthesis dry matter accumulation the logistic equation well fitted the process of aboveground dry matter accumulation under different water and fertilizer supplies in this study the logistic model has also been successfully used to capture the trends of dry matter accumulation of wheat liu et al 2020a b xiao et al 2019 based on the fitting of the richard equation song et al 2016 found that irrigation at overwintering and jointing stages can postpone the total period of dry matter accumulation of winter wheat while nitrogen application significantly improved the average and maximum rates of dry matter accumulation and the hydrological year affected the rapid growth period and the time to reach the maximal rate of dry matter accumulation however based on a three year field experiment zhao et al 2013 found that there was insignificant correlation between nitrogen application and population dry matter accumulation rate by fitting the logistic equation the reasons for the differences in the results of the present study may be related to the nitrogen application rate and soil nutrients supply capacity previous studies have found that the distribution and translocation of dry matter were affected by many factors for example varieties climatic conditions planting patterns and field management practices arduini et al 2006 fang et al 2010 liu et al 2020a b weichert et al 2017 where water and fertilizer supply are the main human factors affecting dry matter distribution and post anthesis dry matter translocation ding et al 2016 in the present study irrigation and fertilization had highly significant effect on t max v max d and v p 0 01 which indicated that irrigation and fertilization influenced the period and rate of aboveground dry matter accumulation the hydrological year highly significantly influenced t max and d p 0 01 previous studies indicated that water deficit inhibited photosynthesis promoted early aging decreased the post anthesis assimilation and shortened grain filling period thereby causing lower grain yield jiang et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 compared with rain fed irrigation significantly shortened the period before the jointing stage and prolonged the period of grain filling of wheat villegas et al 2001 which was similar to the finding of the present study water stress advanced t max while v max and v showed decreasing trends with the increasing water stress mineral nutrition supply is a major factor influencing carbohydrate partitioning ding and xu 2011 xu et al 2021 reported that the maximal mean crop growth rate of wheat maize intercropping improved with topdressing n fertilizer which was consistent with the result of the present study that both v max and v increased with increasing fertilization rates 4 2 effects of various drip fertigation regimes on the partitioning and translocation efficiency of aboveground dry matter of winter wheat dry matter partitioning and translocation is essential to achieve high and stable wheat yield ding and xu 2011 gonz√°lez et al 2011 increasing dry matter is the premise for obtaining high yield and then distributing more nutrients to grains also plays a curial role xu et al 2021 the translocation and assimilation of vegetative organs after anthesis affected by irrigation fertilization and hydrological year is the main source of grain yield formation irrigation and fertilization can promote grain yield of wheat by influencing the canopy structure of wheat population and photosynthetic rate as well as regulating the proportion of sink to source feng et al 2017 liu et al 2020a b yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 this study indicated that the proportions of both stem and grain dry matter at maturity showed decreasing trends with increasing fertilization rates and the proportions of stem and grain dry matter under water stressed conditions were significantly greater than those under normal irrigation in order to enhance the grain filling capacity stem and spike reserves for support is a curial physiological characteristic in wheat madani et al 2010 ding and xu 2011 found that high yielding wheat accumulated more dry matter from booting to maturity obtained relatively greater proportions of stem and spike dry matter at anthesis and lower translocation of leaf dry matter madani et al 2010 pointed out that the source limitation enhanced stem and spike reserve contributions to grain filling processes while water stress improved the sink limitation by reducing the grain filling rate and dry matter translocation to grain at the initial stage of rapid grain filling this also in accordance with our findings which showed that the proportions of both stem and leaf dry matter at anthesis decreased with the increasing water stress but the spike proportion increased this study found that dry matter translocation dmt reduced with the increase of fertilization rates however both the post anthesis dry matter accumulation postdm and the contribution of post anthesis dry matter accumulation to total dry matter at maturity cdma increased with increasing fertilization rates the dmt dmte caadm and caag increased with the increasing water stress and w1 and w2 obtained significantly greater values than w3 p 0 05 similar results were also found by zhang et al 2019 who concluded that the reduced irrigation rate before the end of anthesis stage significantly decreased dry matter accumulation and photosynthetic rate at anthesis but enhanced the translocation of photosynthates to the spikes changing the tillage methods of the wheat maize rotation system affected the root water status of winter wheat which was conducive to promoting the contribution of post anthesis dry matter to the grain and thus increased yield latifmanesh et al 2018 compared with no irrigation supplementary irrigation reduced translocation efficiency of post anthesis dry matter and also increased the accumulation of post anthesis dry matter and the cdma of high yielding wheat was greater than 70 feng et al 2017 differently the cdma of high yielding wheat during the four seasons in this study was around 67 which was relatively lower it may be caused by the differences of climatic conditions soil nutrients supply capacity and varieties in various regions besides zheng et al 2021 indicated that the nitrogen application rate of 180 kg ha 1 produced greater post anthesis dry matter assimilation and its contribution to the grain the present study found that the cdma increased with increasing fertilization rates while the average cdma over the four seasons under f1 f2 and f3 were 67 1 64 8 and 53 3 respectively table 5 5 conclusions the logistic equation could well describe the accumulation process of aboveground dry matter of winter wheat at various irrigation amounts and fertilization rates water stress advanced the thermal time required from sowing to the maximum aboveground dry matter rate while the maximum aboveground dry matter rate and average accumulated rate of aboveground dry matter increased with increasing irrigation and fertilization regimes the proportions of stem and spike dry matter declined with the increasing fertilization rates grain yield increased with increasing fertilization rates but there was insignificant difference between f1 and f2 dry matter translocation declined with increasing fertilization rates whilst the post anthesis dry matter accumulation increased with increasing fertilization rates when wheat yield reached 4 5 6 0 mg ha 1 6 0 7 5 mg ha 1 and 7 5 9 0 mg ha 1 the post anthesis dry matter accumulation of 1 3 3 0 mg ha 1 3 0 4 7 mg ha 1 and 4 7 6 3 mg ha 1 needed to be obtained respectively comprehensively considering dry matter accumulation partitioning and translocation as well as grain yield and its components the mild deficit irrigation w2 with n p2o5 k2o fertilization rate of 125 84 108 kg ha 1 is highly recommended for drip fertigated winter wheat production in northwest

9378,the increasing pressure on water resources in agricultural areas requires the implementation of innovative tools and solutions to improve irrigation water management against that background this research presents the application of a remote sensing based methodology for estimating actual evapotranspiration eta based on two source energy balance model tseb and remote sensing water balance rswb coupling for sugarcane crop in brazil using the hybrid model spatial evapotranspiration modeling interface setmi estimated results through setmi and field data using the eddy covariance system ec considering two growing seasons were used to validate the energy balance components and eta in addition the basal crop coefficient as a function of the spectral reflectance kcbrf was developed through the soil adjusted vegetation index savi and observed et modeled energy balance components showed a strong correlation to the ground data from ec with et presenting r2 equal to 0 94 and a pearson correlation coefficient œÅ equal to 0 88 regarding kcbrf the kcb savi relationship for sugarcane presented a high correlation with an r2 value of 0 85 and an œÅ equal to 0 92 on average considering the whole season kcb was equal to 0 75 and 0 73 for the 4th ratoon and 5th ratoon respectively overall the average kc throughout the period was 0 73 and 0 70 for the 4th and 5th ratoons respectively and the maximum kc of about 1 23 for both growing seasons on average accumulated eta presented 1025 mm resulting in eta rates of 2 9 mm per day considering the two seasons crop water productivity wp obtained values similar between the seasons averaging 12 6 21 7 and 12 3 kg m 3 for wpp i wpi and wpet respectively the setmi hybrid model produced suitable estimated daily eta values over the two growing seasons through remote sensing based on the kcb savi relationship and good performance of tseb model during the evaluated growing periods confirming the applicability of the model under tropical conditions in brazil focusing on improving irrigation management in sugarcane crop keywords satellite image setmi irrigation management saccharum officinarum 1 introduction brazil expects to harvest about 10 million hectares of sugarcane for the 2020 2021 season which corresponds to 665 million metric tons establishing the world s largest producer of sugarcane the state of s√£o paulo is the main contributor with an estimated production of more than 360 million tons total the main products derived from sugarcane are biofuel and sugar with 30 billion liters of ethanol and almost 42 million tons of sugar estimated for the next harvest these numbers could be even higher given that most of the cultivated areas are under rainfed conditions which can negatively impact sugarcane productivity in brazil productivity is much lower than that achieved in irrigated areas approximately 69 t ha 1 due to water stress that can occur in critical stages of crop development conab 2021 due to the poor distribution of rain over the long sugarcane growing season one year each season the crop is exposed to rainy months and very dry months during its development as a result the expansion of the irrigated sugarcane area in brazil has increased rapidly due to gains in stalk yield ana 2020 many studies carried out in brazil have demonstrated that irrigation increases the productivity of sugarcane gon√ßalves et al 2019 2013 the optimization of water use in irrigated agriculture has an important role in the economy production of food and environmental security to guarantee the profitability of agricultural activity and the sustainability of water resources this is especially important in regions that face water scarcity as is the case of sugarcane areas in the state of s√£o paulo considering that the use of irrigation is becoming more prevalent for sugarcane production more efficient and low cost methods to estimate crop evapotranspiration are important to ensure the proper estimation of the irrigation depth including models that provide suitable monitoring of water in the root system and crop development in sugarcane irrigated areas evapotranspiration et estimation based on remote sensing methods using satellite data has been used widely due to low cost low impact techniques high temporal and spatial resolution sensors that can be used at field scales as well as global scales in agricultural systems both in brazil and worldwide recent works such as venancio et al 2019 foster et al 2019 gon√ßalves et al 2020 and campos et al 2018 demonstrated how remote sensing rs can be used for the monitoring and management of water resources in irrigated agriculture some rs based methodologies for estimating et are based on the energy balance approach using radiometric land surface temperature and meteorological variables to estimate et as a residual surface energy balance component seb and these models can be one source when et is estimated for soil and vegetation together as a single layer such as the well known sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 and metric allen and wright 1997 and two sources when et is estimated for soil and vegetation individually such as the two source energy balance tseb by norman et al 1995 and alex disalex model anderson et al 1997 mecikalski and norman et al 1999 2003 these models use orbital imagery and ground based meteorological data and depending on the model also can use field data to estimate the components of the energy balance net radiation sensitive heat and soil heat flux and as a result obtain latent heat flux or et there are other methods to estimate et based on the basal crop coefficient as a function of the spectral reflectance values kcbrf derived from vegetation indexes vi such as ndvi normalized difference vegetation index and savi soil adjusted vegetation index the kcbrf values are used in determining the actual crop et used to estimate the remote sensing based soil water balance rswb as described in fao 56 allen et al 1998 the kcbrf approach neale et al 1989 has been widely applied to several crops campos et al 2016 2017 2021 also new biophysical photosynthesis model based on rs such as stic rceep integrating land surface temperature tr based et or latent heat flux le into a remote sensing driven approach to coupling ecosystem evapotranspiration and photosynthesis rceep model advantages of stic rceep are prominent under dry conditions bai et al 2022 in this research the hybrid model known as spatial evapotranspiration modeling interface setmi geli and neale 2012 neale et al 2012 was applied the modeling approach is based on coupling the tseb and kcbrf approaches the tseb model provides estimates of actual crop et while the kcbrf from savi corresponding to the time of the satellite overpass approach allows for updating the basal crop coefficient as well as the interpolation and extrapolation of et between satellite image acquisition dates improving the maintenance of a soil water balance in the crop root zone additionally setmi considers three layers in the soil profile to estimate the rswb considering the soil heterogeneity pixel by pixel still it allows to upload of the climatic input data as tables or raster grid format also the variables such as the variables et extrapolation initial canopy temperature wind adjustment methods green fraction canopy height effective precipitation basal crop coefficient progression and interpolation can be estimated using more than one method to meet different user needs to run the tseb and rswb in the setmi also setmi has the ability to provide prescription irrigation maps from et estimated based on the kcbrf water balance allowing temporal interpolation and extrapolation of a spatial water balance between input image dates this approach has the potential to be used for real time irrigation scheduling as described in barker et al 2018 the kcb vi relationship for sugarcane under brazilian tropical climate has not been developed yet therefore for the proper estimation of et and rswb for sugarcane using the setmi hybrid model it is necessary to develop a specific kcb vi relationship for sugarcane in such conditions this research proposes to develop a kcb vi relationship through kcb measured in the field with an eddy covariance flux tower and the savi vegetation index from satellite imagery for sugarcane grown in northwest state of sao paulo brazil additionally after adjusting the model the objective of this research also was to evaluate the performance results of the estimated energy balance eb components and et using setmi against field data obtained from the turbulent flux data eddy covariance after establishing the kcb vi relationship and validating tseb from setmi the hybrid model was applied to estimate daily kcb kc and water balance in the root zone focusing on monitoring the crop growth and irrigation management over two sugarcane seasons in brazil 2 material

evapotranspiration modeling interface setmi setmi is the interface through which the hybrid eta estimation model by neale et al 2012 is currently operated the hybrid model is the combination of the eta model based on tseb norman et al 1995 with the rswb model that uses crop coefficients based on spectral reflectance in the tseb the soil and plant contributions to energy fluxes are considered separately rather than as a combined surface hence two sources following the general eq 1 1 rnc rns hc hs lec les g rn net radiation w m 2 h sensible heat flux w m 2 le latent heat flux w m 2 subscripts c and s indicate canopy and soil respectively instantaneous latent heat flux le computed using the tseb was scaled to a daily actual et value following ch√°vez et al 2008 using the ratio of

images are less frequent depending on the sensor used allen et al 1998 the inclusion of the hybrid model provides an error verification of the root zone soil water balance 0 60 0 80 m depth for sugarcane root system in this study based on field data producing a second more adequate eta estimate neale et al 2012 thus it is very important that the tseb and the water balance in the root zone based on the kcb vi relationship are effectively calibrated for the study region fig 2 shows briefly how the et adjustment is performed in the setmi hybrid model through tseb tseb two source model rswb remote sensing water balance swb soil water balance and rswb coupling the rswb applied in this study does not differ from previously published approaches for other crops campos et al 2016 the methodology is essentially the soil water balance proposed in fao 56 with additions to simulate the evaporation of the soil top layer according to the percentage of biomass residues on the soil surface and assimilates the temporal evolution of the kcb derived from the vegetation index the setmi hybrid approach considers the et obtained from the two source energy balance model to produce an assimilated value for adjusting the water balance in the root system geli and neale 2012 neale et al 2012 according eq 3 3 et wb a et wb b w x et tseb et wb b eta wb water balance et after including

details on rswb applying setmi the reader is advised to see barker 2017 scs runoff equation developed by the u s soil conservation service usda nrcs 2004 was used to estimate the effective precipitation peff available in the setmi model a kcb vi relationship was developed for sugarcane based on the climatic conditions of the region and the remote sensing approach for this purpose savi huete 1988 was estimated according to eq 4 using cloud free images corrected for surface reflectance with the oli sensor landsat 8 level 2 considering two sugarcane ratoons 2016 2017 and 2017 2018

whole field using a vector layer shapefile with a buffer of 20 m from the edge to avoid border effects kcb was measured using data from the ec system using eq 5 5 kc kcb ke et a et o kc crop coefficient kcb basal crop coefficient ke soil evaporation coefficient eta actual evapotranspiration mm per day eto reference evapotranspiration mm per day the kc values during the growing seasons were considered equal to the kcb values since the dates chosen to develop the kcb vi relationship were always four days or more after an irrigation or rain events allowing time for the soil surface to dry thus the effect of soil surface evaporation ke on the kcb values is insignificant especially when using subsurface drip irrigation when ke is near to zero while transpiration potentially occurs without any limitation for more details see campos et al 2017 in fact soil evaporation can hardly fall to zero even for dry ecosystems perez priego et al 2018 eto values were collected at the automated weather station near the study site thus the kcb vi relationship for sugarcane was developed and incorporated in setmi setmi applies a regression based model relating accumulated growing degree day base temperature equal to 18 ¬∫c to the daily savi for obtaining a daily kcb on days when remote sensing inputs are not available campos et al 2017 following the eq 6 also used for irrigation management by barker et al 2018 6 savi i min exp a 1 cgddi b 1 savi x exp exp a 2 cgddi b 2 savii estimated savi for the current day savix maximum savi taken here to be the peak computed value for a given pixel cgddi cumulative growing degree days for the current day a and b linear regression coefficients with the subscripts 1 and 2 representing the stages of growth increasing savi and decreasing savi respectively savi values for bare soil were set at 0 12 after harvesting beginning the new growing season and 0 45 at the end of the crop maturation for a final kcb equal to 0 7 as described in allen et al 1998 the occurrence of a kcb value greater than 0 for bare soil conditions has been demonstrated repeatedly in the literature and wright 1982 proposed the use of a residual kcb equal to 0 15 even in the absence of vegetation also found in the fao 56 allen et al 1998 and most of the empirical relationships published between kcb and vi bausch and neale 1987 campos et al 2010 hunsaker et al 2003 neale et al 1989 as empirically demonstrated by torres and calera 2010 this residual evaporation can be expected for bare soil for more than 30 days after the irrigation events or precipitation even in the total absence of plants transpiring in the field additionally after estimating eta crop water productivity wpp i crop water productivity of irrigation wpi and crop

were compared with the data measured in the field through the ec flux tower to measure the accuracy of the model rmse root mean squared error and bias indicators were applied according to eqs 10 and

average daily temperature over the growing seasons 2016 2018 fourth ratoon and 2017 2018 fifth ratoon recorded for the flux tower set up in the field overall the fourth and fifth growing seasons presented the same average temperature equal to 24 6 c greater than the historical average for the region 23 3 c accumulated precipitation was 988 mm and 974 mm in the fourth and fifth ratoon years respectively lower than the average historical amount of 1242 mm precipitation for both ratoons was very irregular over the growing seasons resulting in only 46 days and 53 days with precipitation over 5 mm respectively distributed from october to february rainy season sugarcane in brazil is purposefully planted in june and july to be harvested after one year during the dry season to increase the brix percentage in the stalk resulting in higher sugar content and ethanol production irrigation is required mainly after planting even though precipitation is higher from october to february it is common for dry spells to occur during the rainy season so based on this analysis irrigation is essential to maintain proper soil water content in the root zone for reaching high yields using data from the two growing seasons the eb components and eta ratio estimated from the setmi model based on tseb and the eta estimated by the ec system is shown in fig 4 according to mukaka 2012 the eb components values indicated acceptable performance mainly for rn and le with r2 over 0 90 and bias equal to 15 58 and 2 06 respectively for g and h r2 values also were above 0 80 and rmse showed low values with bias close to zero commonly g values have little influence on eb because their values are considered very low less than 5 of rn in this study so as shown in fig 4 the modeled results are consistent with ground flux measurements as a result eta presented a high correlation between the values of the ec and modeled by the tseb overestimating the eta values by less than 2 with r2 of 0 94 and bias equal to 0 14 similar results also were observed by yang et al 2018 and campos et al 2017 the setmi hybrid model requires a specific kcbrf based on simple linear correlation using kcb values obtained from field measurements combined with savi values from remote sensing so it was built for sugarcane under tropical conditions the kcb savi relationship obtained is shown in fig 5 the resulting linear equation shown in fig 5 indicates a robust correlation between the savi and the data measured in the field with an r¬≤ value of 0 85 and a œÅ of 0 92 this approach has already been used for other crops such as corn and soybean in the united states campos et al 2017 vineyards in spain campos et al 2010 and wheat in morocco duchemin et al 2006 daily savi values were estimated using gdd to obtain their values over growing seasons shown in fig 6 the maximum savi value observed was 0 60 and 0 59 for the 4th and 5th ratoons respectively after this point because of the maturation stage the savi values decrease until harvesting due to reduction in green leaf area index which is expected in this stage as shown in gon√ßalves et al 2017 and silva et al 2012 after harvest the savi values decrease to close to bare soil values around 0 12 using savi gdd to record daily savi represented crop development very well for the entire growing seasons following daily savi values over seasons and following the kcb savi relationship implemented based on fig 5 the setmi model was able to accurately estimate the kcb over growing seasons as shown in fig 7 the initial kcb was about 0 15 increasing until reach the maximum value of 0 97 for the 4th ratoon and 0 95 for 5th on average results regarding the entire season kcb averaged were equal to 0 62 and 0 58 for the 4th and 5th ratoons respectively fig 7 conversely the ke values for both seasons were high at the beginning of the seasons and decreased with the crop development due to the higher leaf area index because the drip tapes of the irrigation system are buried at 0 40 m and the region shows high precipitation rates likely all the evaporation water was from precipitation before reaching full cover during the development stage there were many rainy days with more than 10 mm in both ratoons these kcb and ke values for sugarcane are similar to allen et al 1998 and silva et al 2012 the kc low spikes in fig 8 are due to soil water depletion in the root zone of the sugarcane leading to a crop stress ks coefficient value below 1 represented in fig 8 caused by the soil water depletion dr above the readily water available raw causing water stress in plants fig 9 a severe drought occurred during the development stage of the crop and the irrigation system was not able to apply the required water demand which resulted in water stress in the plants for the 4th growing season both seasons showed some level of water stress after the crop reached the peak kc full cover stage when the irrigation depth required was very high due to the lack of precipitation combined with high evapotranspiration rates during the period being this region northwest of the state of s√£o paulo known as the region with the highest evapotranspiration rate in the state hernandez et al 2003 the water stress was observed mainly during the final stages of growth when the irrigation events are reduced to guarantee the accumulation of sugar in the stalks for irrigation purposes however the period of greatest susceptibility to water deficits is the stage of rapid crop development when the plants already have a high leaf area index and need a greater amount of water for gas exchange with the atmosphere pires et al 2008 da silva and costa 2004 overall the average kc throughout the period was 0 73 and 0 70 for the 4th and 5th ratoons respectively and maximum kc of about 1 23 for both growing seasons similar to kc values to allen et al 1998 and doorenbos and kassam 1979 fig 8 in fig 9 it is noted that the increase of the total available water taw over the growing seasons following the root zone growth until reach the maximum value equal of about 78 mm around 1000 gdd it also is observed that at the end of the season about 30 days before harvesting irrigation cut off the dr value was close to taw corresponding to the period with maximum accumulated sugar in the stalks which is required for sugarcane production the taw increases as the root system increase over time however when harvesting occurs the sugarcane loses the ability to produce elaborate sap photosynthesis is interrupted in this way it also loses the ability to nourish the root system so part of the roots dies and taw decreases after harvest and increases again over time with roots system recovering the negative dr values are due to heavy rains over 25 mm causing percolation the eta values estimated by the setmi hybrid model followed the same tendency of eto values corroborating with allen et al 1998 who describes that eta values are directly influenced by the eto values fig 10 the total eta was 1054 mm and 1168 mm respectively for the 4th and 5th growing seasons on average eto and eta presented values of 3 8 mm per day and 2 9 mm per day for the 4th season and 3 9 mm per day and 3 2 mm per day for the 5th respectively the greater discrepancy between eta and eto was observed at the beginning of the seasons when the plants are still young presenting low kc values after 700 gdd with greater leaf area index development and consequently greater kc values the eto and eta were closer over both growing seasons accumulated actual evapotranspiration etac and field data were used to estimate wpp i wpi and wpet as shown in table 2 overall all the wp values were very similar between the growing seasons because of the yield irrigation precipitation and eto were very close between ratoons except wpet when the 4th ratoon was about 16 greater than the 5th ratoon mainly because the lower values of eta these results were slightly lower than leal et al 2017 in southeastern brazil and greater than silva et al 2011 in northeastern brazil according to teixeira et al 2011 wp in a study in the state of s√£o paulo ranged from 2 8 to 6 0 kg m 3 much lower than our findings in this research likely due to the fact that in most of brazil the sugarcane is not irrigated regarding the yield both ratoons showed values greater than the brazilian average 69 t ha 1 conab 2021 4 conclusions this research was carried out in the largest sugarcane producing region of brazil using the setmi hybrid model to estimate evapotranspiration and rootzone water balance of a growing sugarcane field over two growing seasons the modeled eb components using the setmi hybrid model agreed well with the eddy covariance system values the kcb savi relationship for sugarcane presented a strong correlation with an r2 value of 0 85 and an œÅ of 0 92 as result the setmi hybrid model can be applied to the soil water balance for monitoring the irrigation water management for sugarcane under brazilian soil and climate conditions the hybrid model produced suitable daily estimated kcb values for the two growing seasons through the kcb savi relationship with suitable remote sensing based soil water balance monitoring the development of the crop and estimating the eta during the evaluated growing periods setmi model is an attempt to take advantage of the ability of kcbrf methods to compute daily eta on dates without remote sensing inputs and taking advantage of the tseb which is not affected by the modeled water balance the hybrid model using the kcb savi relationship for irrigated sugarcane could be tested under rainfed condition and different ratoons cycles for future researches declaration of competing

9378,the increasing pressure on water resources in agricultural areas requires the implementation of innovative tools and solutions to improve irrigation water management against that background this research presents the application of a remote sensing based methodology for estimating actual evapotranspiration eta based on two source energy balance model tseb and remote sensing water balance rswb coupling for sugarcane crop in brazil using the hybrid model spatial evapotranspiration modeling interface setmi estimated results through setmi and field data using the eddy covariance system ec considering two growing seasons were used to validate the energy balance components and eta in addition the basal crop coefficient as a function of the spectral reflectance kcbrf was developed through the soil adjusted vegetation index savi and observed et modeled energy balance components showed a strong correlation to the ground data from ec with et presenting r2 equal to 0 94 and a pearson correlation coefficient œÅ equal to 0 88 regarding kcbrf the kcb savi relationship for sugarcane presented a high correlation with an r2 value of 0 85 and an œÅ equal to 0 92 on average considering the whole season kcb was equal to 0 75 and 0 73 for the 4th ratoon and 5th ratoon respectively overall the average kc throughout the period was 0 73 and 0 70 for the 4th and 5th ratoons respectively and the maximum kc of about 1 23 for both growing seasons on average accumulated eta presented 1025 mm resulting in eta rates of 2 9 mm per day considering the two seasons crop water productivity wp obtained values similar between the seasons averaging 12 6 21 7 and 12 3 kg m 3 for wpp i wpi and wpet respectively the setmi hybrid model produced suitable estimated daily eta values over the two growing seasons through remote sensing based on the kcb savi relationship and good performance of tseb model during the evaluated growing periods confirming the applicability of the model under tropical conditions in brazil focusing on improving irrigation management in sugarcane crop keywords satellite image setmi irrigation management saccharum officinarum 1 introduction brazil expects to harvest about 10 million hectares of sugarcane for the 2020 2021 season which corresponds to 665 million metric tons establishing the world s largest producer of sugarcane the state of s√£o paulo is the main contributor with an estimated production of more than 360 million tons total the main products derived from sugarcane are biofuel and sugar with 30 billion liters of ethanol and almost 42 million tons of sugar estimated for the next harvest these numbers could be even higher given that most of the cultivated areas are under rainfed conditions which can negatively impact sugarcane productivity in brazil productivity is much lower than that achieved in irrigated areas approximately 69 t ha 1 due to water stress that can occur in critical stages of crop development conab 2021 due to the poor distribution of rain over the long sugarcane growing season one year each season the crop is exposed to rainy months and very dry months during its development as a result the expansion of the irrigated sugarcane area in brazil has increased rapidly due to gains in stalk yield ana 2020 many studies carried out in brazil have demonstrated that irrigation increases the productivity of sugarcane gon√ßalves et al 2019 2013 the optimization of water use in irrigated agriculture has an important role in the economy production of food and environmental security to guarantee the profitability of agricultural activity and the sustainability of water resources this is especially important in regions that face water scarcity as is the case of sugarcane areas in the state of s√£o paulo considering that the use of irrigation is becoming more prevalent for sugarcane production more efficient and low cost methods to estimate crop evapotranspiration are important to ensure the proper estimation of the irrigation depth including models that provide suitable monitoring of water in the root system and crop development in sugarcane irrigated areas evapotranspiration et estimation based on remote sensing methods using satellite data has been used widely due to low cost low impact techniques high temporal and spatial resolution sensors that can be used at field scales as well as global scales in agricultural systems both in brazil and worldwide recent works such as venancio et al 2019 foster et al 2019 gon√ßalves et al 2020 and campos et al 2018 demonstrated how remote sensing rs can be used for the monitoring and management of water resources in irrigated agriculture some rs based methodologies for estimating et are based on the energy balance approach using radiometric land surface temperature and meteorological variables to estimate et as a residual surface energy balance component seb and these models can be one source when et is estimated for soil and vegetation together as a single layer such as the well known sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 and metric allen and wright 1997 and two sources when et is estimated for soil and vegetation individually such as the two source energy balance tseb by norman et al 1995 and alex disalex model anderson et al 1997 mecikalski and norman et al 1999 2003 these models use orbital imagery and ground based meteorological data and depending on the model also can use field data to estimate the components of the energy balance net radiation sensitive heat and soil heat flux and as a result obtain latent heat flux or et there are other methods to estimate et based on the basal crop coefficient as a function of the spectral reflectance values kcbrf derived from vegetation indexes vi such as ndvi normalized difference vegetation index and savi soil adjusted vegetation index the kcbrf values are used in determining the actual crop et used to estimate the remote sensing based soil water balance rswb as described in fao 56 allen et al 1998 the kcbrf approach neale et al 1989 has been widely applied to several crops campos et al 2016 2017 2021 also new biophysical photosynthesis model based on rs such as stic rceep integrating land surface temperature tr based et or latent heat flux le into a remote sensing driven approach to coupling ecosystem evapotranspiration and photosynthesis rceep model advantages of stic rceep are prominent under dry conditions bai et al 2022 in this research the hybrid model known as spatial evapotranspiration modeling interface setmi geli and neale 2012 neale et al 2012 was applied the modeling approach is based on coupling the tseb and kcbrf approaches the tseb model provides estimates of actual crop et while the kcbrf from savi corresponding to the time of the satellite overpass approach allows for updating the basal crop coefficient as well as the interpolation and extrapolation of et between satellite image acquisition dates improving the maintenance of a soil water balance in the crop root zone additionally setmi considers three layers in the soil profile to estimate the rswb considering the soil heterogeneity pixel by pixel still it allows to upload of the climatic input data as tables or raster grid format also the variables such as the variables et extrapolation initial canopy temperature wind adjustment methods green fraction canopy height effective precipitation basal crop coefficient progression and interpolation can be estimated using more than one method to meet different user needs to run the tseb and rswb in the setmi also setmi has the ability to provide prescription irrigation maps from et estimated based on the kcbrf water balance allowing temporal interpolation and extrapolation of a spatial water balance between input image dates this approach has the potential to be used for real time irrigation scheduling as described in barker et al 2018 the kcb vi relationship for sugarcane under brazilian tropical climate has not been developed yet therefore for the proper estimation of et and rswb for sugarcane using the setmi hybrid model it is necessary to develop a specific kcb vi relationship for sugarcane in such conditions this research proposes to develop a kcb vi relationship through kcb measured in the field with an eddy covariance flux tower and the savi vegetation index from satellite imagery for sugarcane grown in northwest state of sao paulo brazil additionally after adjusting the model the objective of this research also was to evaluate the performance results of the estimated energy balance eb components and et using setmi against field data obtained from the turbulent flux data eddy covariance after establishing the kcb vi relationship and validating tseb from setmi the hybrid model was applied to estimate daily kcb kc and water balance in the root zone focusing on monitoring the crop growth and irrigation management over two sugarcane seasons in brazil 2 material

bowen ratio with the flux tower data was used to adjust Œªe and h by forcing the closure following the procedure suggested by twine et al 2000 the flux data obtained showed an energy balance closure on a daily scale of about 71 and 82 for the 4th and 5th ratoon on average 77 more details in bispo 2020 in some cases this allows a considerable amount of available energy rn g not counted in the

latent heat flux h sensitive heat flux and g heat flux in the soil are reported as 5 10 15 20 15 20 and 20 30 respectively according to weaver 1990 and field et al 1994 after closure the Œªe values that represent the energy per unit area and per unit time were converted into evapotranspired depth unit for each time interval resulting in actual evapotranspiration eta 2 3 spatial evapotranspiration modeling interface setmi setmi is the interface through which the hybrid eta estimation model by neale et al 2012 is currently operated the hybrid model is the combination of the eta model based on tseb norman et al 1995 with the rswb model that uses crop coefficients based on spectral reflectance in the tseb the soil and plant contributions to energy fluxes are considered separately rather than as a combined surface hence two sources following the general eq 1 1 rnc rns hc hs lec les g rn net radiation w m 2 h sensible heat flux w m 2 le latent heat flux w m 2 subscripts c and s indicate canopy and soil respectively instantaneous latent heat flux le computed using the tseb was scaled to a daily actual et value following ch√°vez et al 2008 using the ratio of

latent heat of vaporation w m 2 ham 2005 subscripts d and i are for daily and instantaneous values respectively kcbrf allows the soil water balance to be calculated with a daily time interval when images are less frequent depending on the sensor used allen et al 1998 the inclusion of the hybrid model provides an error verification of the root zone soil water balance 0 60 0 80 m depth for sugarcane root system in this study based on field data producing a second more adequate eta estimate neale et al 2012 thus it is very important that the tseb and the water balance in the root zone based on the kcb vi relationship are effectively calibrated for the study region fig 2 shows briefly how the et adjustment is performed in the setmi hybrid model through tseb tseb two source model rswb remote sensing water balance swb soil water balance and rswb coupling the rswb applied in this study does not differ from previously published approaches for other crops campos et al 2016 the methodology is essentially the soil water balance proposed in fao 56 with additions to simulate the evaporation of the soil top layer according to the percentage of biomass residues on the soil surface and assimilates the temporal evolution of the kcb derived from the vegetation index the setmi hybrid approach considers the et obtained from the two source energy balance model to produce an

whole field using a vector layer shapefile with a buffer of 20 m from the edge to avoid border effects kcb was measured using data from the ec system using eq 5 5 kc kcb ke et a et o kc crop coefficient kcb basal crop coefficient ke soil evaporation coefficient eta actual evapotranspiration mm per day eto reference evapotranspiration mm per day the kc values during the growing seasons were considered equal to the kcb values since the dates chosen to develop the kcb vi relationship were always four days or more after an irrigation or rain events allowing time for the soil surface to dry thus the effect of soil surface evaporation ke on the kcb values is insignificant especially when using subsurface drip irrigation when ke is near to zero while transpiration potentially occurs without any limitation for more details see campos et al 2017 in fact soil evaporation can hardly fall to zero even for dry ecosystems perez priego et al 2018 eto values were collected at the automated weather station near the study site thus the kcb vi relationship for sugarcane was developed and incorporated in setmi setmi applies a regression based model relating accumulated growing degree day base temperature equal to 18 ¬∫c to the daily savi for obtaining a daily kcb on days when remote sensing inputs are not available campos et al 2017 following the eq 6 also used for

value for a given pixel cgddi cumulative growing degree days for the current day a and b linear regression coefficients with the subscripts 1 and 2 representing the stages of growth increasing savi and decreasing savi respectively savi values for bare soil were set at 0 12 after harvesting beginning the new growing season and 0 45 at the end of the crop maturation for a final kcb equal to 0 7 as described in allen et al 1998 the occurrence of a kcb value greater than 0 for bare soil conditions has been demonstrated repeatedly in the literature and wright 1982 proposed the use of a residual kcb equal to 0 15 even in the absence of vegetation also found in the fao 56 allen et al 1998 and most of the empirical relationships published between kcb and vi bausch and neale 1987 campos et al 2010 hunsaker et al 2003 neale et al 1989 as empirically demonstrated by torres and calera 2010 this residual evaporation can be expected for bare soil for more than 30 days after the irrigation events or precipitation even in the total absence of plants transpiring in the field additionally after estimating eta crop water productivity wpp i crop water productivity of irrigation wpi and crop

average daily temperature over the growing seasons 2016 2018 fourth ratoon and 2017 2018 fifth ratoon recorded for the flux tower set up in the field overall the fourth and fifth growing seasons presented the same average temperature equal to 24 6 c greater than the historical average for the region 23 3 c accumulated precipitation was 988 mm and 974 mm in the fourth and fifth ratoon years respectively lower than the average historical amount of 1242 mm precipitation for both ratoons was very irregular over the growing seasons resulting in only 46 days and 53 days with precipitation over 5 mm respectively distributed from october to february rainy season sugarcane in brazil is purposefully planted in june and july to be harvested after one year during the dry season to increase the brix percentage in the stalk resulting in higher sugar content and ethanol production irrigation is required mainly after planting even though precipitation is higher from october to february it is common for dry spells to occur during the rainy season so based on this analysis irrigation is essential to maintain proper soil water content in the root zone for reaching high yields using data from the two growing seasons the eb components and eta ratio estimated from the setmi model based on tseb and the eta estimated by the ec system is shown in fig 4 according to mukaka 2012 the eb components values indicated acceptable performance mainly for rn and le with r2 over 0 90 and bias equal to 15 58 and 2 06 respectively for g and h r2 values also were above 0 80 and rmse showed low values with bias close to zero commonly g values have little influence on eb because their values are considered very low less than 5 of rn in this study so as shown in fig 4 the modeled results are consistent with ground flux measurements as a result eta presented a high correlation between the values of the ec and modeled by the tseb overestimating the eta values by less than 2 with r2 of 0 94 and bias equal to 0 14 similar results also were observed by yang et al 2018 and campos et al 2017 the setmi hybrid model requires a specific kcbrf based on simple linear correlation using kcb values obtained from field measurements combined with savi values from remote sensing so it was built for sugarcane under tropical conditions the kcb savi relationship obtained is shown in fig 5 the resulting linear equation shown in fig 5 indicates a robust correlation between the savi and the data measured in the field with an r¬≤ value of 0 85 and a œÅ of 0 92 this approach has already been used for other crops such as corn and soybean in the united states campos et al 2017 vineyards in spain campos et al 2010 and wheat in morocco duchemin et al 2006 daily savi values were estimated using gdd to obtain their values over growing seasons shown in fig 6 the maximum savi value observed was 0 60 and 0 59 for the 4th and 5th ratoons respectively after this point because of the maturation stage the savi values decrease until harvesting due to reduction in green leaf area index which is expected in this stage as shown in gon√ßalves et al 2017 and silva et al 2012 after harvest the savi values decrease to close to bare soil values around 0 12 using savi gdd to record daily savi represented crop development very well for the entire growing seasons following daily savi values over seasons and following the kcb savi relationship implemented based on fig 5 the setmi model was able to accurately estimate the kcb over growing seasons as shown in fig 7 the initial kcb was about 0 15 increasing until reach the maximum value of 0 97 for the 4th ratoon and 0 95 for 5th on average results regarding the entire season kcb averaged were equal to 0 62 and 0 58 for the 4th and 5th ratoons respectively fig 7 conversely the ke values for both seasons were high at the beginning of the seasons and decreased with the crop development due to the higher leaf area index because the drip tapes of the irrigation system are buried at 0 40 m and the region shows high precipitation rates likely all the evaporation water was from precipitation before reaching full cover during the development stage there were many rainy days with more than 10 mm in both ratoons these kcb and ke values for sugarcane are similar to allen et al 1998 and silva et al 2012 the kc low spikes in fig 8 are due to soil water depletion in the root zone of the sugarcane leading to a crop stress ks coefficient value below 1 represented in fig 8 caused by the soil water depletion dr above the readily water available raw causing water stress in plants fig 9 a severe drought occurred during the development stage of the crop and the irrigation system was not able to apply the required water demand which resulted in water stress in the plants for the 4th growing season both seasons showed some level of water stress after the crop reached the peak kc full cover stage when the irrigation depth required was very high due to the lack of precipitation combined with high evapotranspiration rates during the period being this region northwest of the state of s√£o paulo known as the region with the highest evapotranspiration rate in the state hernandez et al 2003 the water stress was observed mainly during the final stages of growth when the irrigation events are reduced to guarantee the accumulation of sugar in the stalks for irrigation purposes however the period of greatest susceptibility to water deficits is the stage of rapid crop development when the plants already have a high leaf area index and need a greater amount of water for gas exchange with the atmosphere pires et al 2008 da silva and costa 2004 overall the average kc throughout the period was 0 73 and 0 70 for the 4th and 5th ratoons respectively and maximum kc of about 1 23 for both growing seasons similar to kc values to allen et al 1998 and doorenbos and kassam 1979 fig 8 in fig 9 it is noted that the increase of the total available water taw over the growing seasons following the root zone growth until reach the maximum value equal of about 78 mm around 1000 gdd it also is observed that at the end of the season about 30 days before harvesting irrigation cut off the dr value was close to taw corresponding to the period with maximum accumulated sugar in the stalks which is required for sugarcane production the taw increases as the root system increase over time however when harvesting occurs the sugarcane loses the ability to produce elaborate sap photosynthesis is interrupted in this way it also loses the ability to nourish the root system so part of the roots dies and taw decreases after harvest and increases again over time with roots system recovering the negative dr values are due to heavy rains over 25 mm causing percolation the eta values estimated by the setmi hybrid model followed the same tendency of eto values corroborating with allen et al 1998 who describes that eta values are directly influenced by the eto values fig 10 the total eta was 1054 mm and 1168 mm respectively for the 4th and 5th growing seasons on average eto and eta presented values of 3 8 mm per day and 2 9 mm per day for the 4th season and 3 9 mm per day and 3 2 mm per day for the 5th respectively the greater discrepancy between eta and eto was observed at the beginning of the seasons when the plants are still young presenting low kc values after 700 gdd with greater leaf area index development and consequently greater kc values the eto and eta were closer over both growing seasons accumulated actual evapotranspiration etac and field data were used to estimate wpp i wpi and wpet as shown in table 2 overall all the wp values were very similar between the growing seasons because of the yield irrigation precipitation and eto were very close between ratoons except wpet when the 4th ratoon was about 16 greater than the 5th ratoon mainly because the lower values of eta these results were slightly lower than leal et al 2017 in southeastern brazil and greater than silva et al 2011 in northeastern brazil according to teixeira et al 2011 wp in a study in the state of s√£o paulo ranged from 2 8 to 6 0 kg m 3 much lower than our findings in this research likely due to the fact that in most of brazil the sugarcane is not irrigated regarding the yield both ratoons showed values greater than the brazilian average 69 t ha 1 conab 2021 4 conclusions this research was carried out in the largest sugarcane producing region of brazil using the setmi hybrid model to estimate evapotranspiration and rootzone water balance of a growing sugarcane field over two growing seasons the modeled eb components using the setmi hybrid model agreed well with the eddy covariance system values the kcb savi relationship for sugarcane presented a strong correlation with an r2 value of 0 85 and an œÅ of 0 92 as result the setmi hybrid model can be applied to the soil water balance for monitoring the irrigation water management for sugarcane under brazilian soil and climate conditions the hybrid model produced suitable daily estimated kcb values for the two growing seasons through the kcb savi relationship with suitable remote sensing based soil water balance monitoring the development of the crop and estimating the eta during the evaluated growing periods setmi model is an attempt to take advantage of the ability of kcbrf methods to compute daily eta on dates without remote sensing inputs and taking advantage of the tseb which is not affected by the modeled water balance the hybrid model using the kcb savi relationship for irrigated sugarcane could be tested under rainfed condition and different ratoons cycles for future researches declaration of competing

9379,the 2018 drought in sweden prompted questions about climate adaptation and mitigation measures especially in the agricultural sector which suffered the most this study applies a water food energy nexus modelling framework to evaluate drought impacts on irrigation and agriculture in sweden using 2018 and 2019 as case studies a previous water food energy nexus model was updated to facilitate an investigation of the benefits of data driven irrigation scheduling as compared to existing irrigation guidelines moreover the benefits of assimilating earth observation data in the crop model have been explored the assimilation of leaf area index data from the copernicus global land service improves the crop yield estimation as compared to default crop model parameters the results show that the irrigation water productivities of the proposed model are measurably improved compared to conventional and static irrigation guidelines for both 2018 and 2019 this is mostly due to the advantage of the proposed model in providing evapotranspiration in cultural condition et c driven guidelines by using spatially explicit data generated by mesoscale models from the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute during the drought year 2018 the developed model showed no irrigation water savings as compared to irrigation scenarios based on conventional irrigation guidelines nevertheless the crop yield increase from the proposed irrigation management system varied between 10 and 60 as compared to conventional irrigation scenarios during a normal year the proposed irrigation management system leads to significant water savings as compared to conventional irrigation guidelines the modelling results show that temperature stress during the 2018 drought also played a key role in reducing crop yields with yield reductions of up to 30 from a water food energy nexus this motivates the implementation of new technologies to reduce water and temperature stress to mitigate likely negative effects of climate change and extremes by using an open source package for google earth a demonstrator of cost effective visualization platform is developed for helping farmers and water and energy management agencies to better understand the connections between water and energy use and food production this can be significant especially during the occurrence of extreme events but also to adapt to the negative effects on agricultural production of climate changes keywords water food energy nexus drought irrigation data visualization 1 introduction in 2018 sweden experienced an unprecedented drought that severely affected the agricultural water and energy sectors during the period from june to july 2018 some regions experienced a significant reduction in precipitation as compared to a normal year krikken et al 2019 showed a precipitation anomaly for july 2018 ranging from 0 mm to 100 mm as compared to 1981 2010 climatology in july 2018 some locations such as kastl√∂sa in √∂land and komstorp in blekinge did not receive any precipitation while others such as varberg and √∂land s southern cape received 0 2 and 0 8 mm respectively smhi 2020a this caused a drastic reduction in crop yields including for key crops such as wheat potatoes and other forage crops the lack of forage crops negatively affected dairy farms and related industry analysis of the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei for the period 1950 2020 indicates that 2018 was one of the worst droughts in more than 50 years for swedish farmers spei global drought monitor 2020 as a result farmers had to start irrigating or installing irrigation systems however the scarcity of rainfall also severely affected the water resources available for agricultural production some counties such as sk√•ne issued restrictions on irrigation to preserve the scarce water resources putting further stress on farmers especially those who had water intensive crops such as vegetables and potatoes the local 2020 in some cases especially for those growers who did not have the possibility of irrigation potatoes were unharvested due to the poor yield and potatoes size statistics sweden 2022a compared to southern european countries such as greece italy or spain where irrigation is a more well established practice swedish farmers have generally lacked adequate means and incentives to determine water use requirements for crops to schedule irrigation applications to match crop water requirements to evaluate the response of crop yields to different water management practices and to evaluate current on farm water efficiency levels the combination of these factors led to the worst crop harvest since the 1950s for sweden bioenergy international 2020 the extreme drought also affected the energy sector higher volumes of water pumped for irrigation required higher electricity demand in the agricultural sector low precipitation levels affected hydropower generation due to low refilling volumes the state owned power company vattenfall ab closed the 900 mw number 2 nuclear reactor at its ringhals power plant since the water required for the cooling process reached high temperatures that could threaten the safety and function of the reactor renew economy 2020 this acute drought event in sweden clearly highlighted the water food energy wfe nexus interrelationships and how they can be exacerbated during extreme events moreover the climate change scenarios produced by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi predict that the annual mean temperature in sweden will grow steadily from now until the year 2100 and beyond belusic et al 2019 the precipitation patterns from climate models show high variability indicating that drought events and heat waves will likely happen more frequently with socio economic consequences in several sectors as highlighted by belusic et al 2019 studies on drought and drought effects on water balance calculations in scandinavia are limited sweden needs to account for increasing drought frequency and severity as part of ongoing planning efforts to mitigate the potential effects of climate change and extreme weather phenomena in 2018 the swedish government presented a national crisis package valued at more than sek 1 2 billion sek 1 usd 0 1 primarily to cover the fodder shortage and other losses of income that farmers experienced due to the drought sek 760 million were invested in 2019 to develop measures to alleviate the situation for the drought affected agricultural sector government offices of sweden 2020 recently grusson et al 2021a analyzed the impacts of climate change on the swedish agriculture highlighting the increasing need for irrigation especially during the beginning of the growing season due to the higher probability of dry springs grusson et al 2021b also highlighted that future climate change scenarios predict an increase in precipitation in sweden nevertheless the predicted increase in precipitation especially in the south of sweden will not lead to increased soil moisture for supporting crop production but to an increased run off since the precipitations events will increase in intensity the smhi provides a water shortage risk service through an overview of groundwater levels surface water levels and statistical summaries of precipitation amounts however this service does not incorporate any dynamic satellite information regarding soil moisture and vegetation characteristics currently only general irrigation guidelines based on the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 are provided in addition existing guidelines sometimes suggest different values for instance bergstr√∂m and barkefors 2004 suggested irrigating potatoes with 100 mm season on average maximum 200 mm season the swedish board of agriculture 2007 mentioned that water requirements for potatoes should be between 300 and 350 mm assuming average precipitation of between 170 and 250 mm during the same period the report from the swedish board of agriculture 2007 also provided static guidelines for the irrigation of potatoes for different locations e g visby 57 6348 n 18 2948 e with 130 mm season recommended and ume√• 63 8258 n 20 2630 e with 75 mm season recommended no irrigation management services are provided in sweden unlike in countries or regions that historically have been more prone to drought in addition the input data for irrigation and for nutrient management depend on spatio temporal data such as climatological and soil type data and this heterogeneity requires spatially explicit information to produce accurate guidelines for this reason researchers and institutions have been active in developing decision support systems based on simulation and optimization models or satellite data observations or hybrid approaches to provide guidelines on optimal irrigation and nutrient applications and thus to inform smart farming management the nasa satellite irrigation management support sims system melton et al 2012 pereira et al 2020 2021 integrates earth observation data from landsat and modis with meteorological observations to generate daily maps of evapotranspiration et and eight day maps of crop coefficients over california the newly launched openet 2021 has implemented six satellite based et models on the google earth engine platform gorelick et al 2017 to develop daily monthly and annual et database for the western us easily available at field scales 30 m 30 m per pixel via a web based ui and application programming interface api the openet models intercomparison and accuracy assessment has been carried out through different phases by relying on 70 first phase and 69 second phase data from flux towers across the united states of america melton et al 2021 wang et al 2019 developed a web based irrigation decision support system for canal irrigation management the model is based upon two modules the first module is for real time irrigation forecasting and scheduling the second module is for planning the canals water delivery volumes in italy irrinet is a decision support system for on farm irrigation scheduling mannini et al 2013 that gives farmers day by day information on how much and when to irrigate crops the system implements a real time irrigation scheduling through climatic and meteorological data gathered daily another example of decision support system in italy is fertirrigere battilani 2004 a model based decision support system used in italy that proved to reduce the nitrogen application on horticultural products by 46 compared to conventional practices with no notable effects on yield and quality mahmoud and gan 2019 developed a model to enhance the irrigation water management in central saudi arabia by assessing the spatio temporal variation of actual evapotranspiration through remote sensing techniques and meteorological data zhang et al 2012 developed the zhaokou irrigation management system consisting of a precipitation forecasting module a crop water demand forecasting module and a crop coefficient index the established system improved water efficiency providing a theoretical basis for water resources scheduling and channels rational control galindo et al 2017 presented a methodology for optimal water and energy management in the irrigation system using a two layer management scheme the upper layer is an optimal control strategy to plan how to serve the required water within a five day prediction horizon to minimize pumping electricity costs the lower layer is a scheduling algorithm that decides how to schedule the different pumps to supply the desired flow minimize cost and maximize efficiency in romania a field scale irrigation planning and management system was set up and tested futurewater 2020 irrigation guidelines are provided by integrating soil moisture content ground data with hydrological model calculations in greece agriculture and especially irrigation plays a key role in terms of water management and the irma system 2021 calculates site specific crop water requirements and irrigation scheduling at high spatial resolution malamos et al 2015 the decision support system integrates historical and forecast agrometeorological data crop data and soil data to provide timely guidelines for irrigation a comprehensive review of irrigation and fertilization decision support systems is provided in gallardo et al 2020 the wfe nexus concept was introduced during the 2008 world economic forum to discuss the important interlinkages among the water food and energy sectors highlighted by the global food security crisis of 2008 dominic 2011 the agricultural and food production sectors are at the center of the nexus concept because both sectors require significant amounts of water and energy for irrigation and food production 70 of the global water withdrawals and 30 of the world s total energy consumption are allocated to this sector food and agriculture organization fao 2017 since research on the nexus began several modelling tools have been developed nevertheless most of the modelling approaches have only looked at interactions between two out of the three sectors which is not optimal for improving the efficiency of resources kaddoura and el khatib 2017 moreover very few models are at the stage of implementing the wfe nexus approach liu et al 2017 dai et al 2018 shannak et al 2018 endo et al 2019 or supporting political decisions bazilian et al 2011 furthermore as highlighted by lawford 2019 there is a general data gap in both spatial and temporal dimensions concerning the observation of key parameters for wfe nexus analysis most of the current available irrigation management systems lack a wfe perspective that integrates information concerning irrigation water requirements crop response to irrigation and energy consumption this study aims to lay the foundations to develop an operational wfe nexus irrigation management system for sweden by including all three areas of the nexus this is attained by using the spatially explicit climatic data generated by smhi specific objectives of this study are to further develop the model presented in zhang et al 2018 for nebraska and in campana et al 2018 for sweden by implementing the penman monteith equation for the calculation of reference evapotranspiration and related improvement and validation using remote sensing data and tower flux data analyze the irrigation water productivity of existing irrigation guidelines in sweden and compare the results with the guidelines provided by the developed model analyze wfe nexus aspects related to irrigation systems in sweden develop a demonstrator for a future operational service primarily for farmers interested in crop conditions and irrigation guidelines but also for energy and water management related agencies to our best knowledge there is no irrigation management system in sweden as compared to other countries in asia or europe or united states of america moreover although the 2018 drought has triggered research activities on irrigation from our literature review few studies have been carried out in sweden on irrigation and especially for combating and adapting to climate changes this was also clearly highlighted in grusson et al 2021a the novelty of this study lies mainly in three points develop a demonstrator of irrigation management system called swedish irrigation management system swedims 2022 combined with the gridded meteorological products developed by smhi for retrieving climatological data develop a model based management system that can be used to provide information not only for evapotranspiration but also to crop grow when combined with a crop model and with earth observations develop a model not only for providing irrigation management guidelines but also extending the model functionalities to work as a wfe nexus model within the irrigation agricultural sector in sweden although the model presented in this study is applied to sweden using gridded data generated by two mesoscale models str√•ng 2020 and mesan smhi 2020b from the smhi it has general validity and can be extended to other regions using different gridded products for climatological variables the paper is organized as follows the problem statement and the objective of this study are introduced in section 1 which also provides a literature review of irrigation management systems data and methods are presented in section 2 the main results of this study i e model validation irrigation water productivity for three irrigation guidelines scenarios water food energy nexus relationships in the irrigation sector and visualization are presented in section 3 the conclusions of this study are summarized in section 4 2 data and methods 2 1 data the gridded meteorological data used to generate the results are mainly taken from the mesoscale models str√•ng 2020 and mesan smhi 2020b that are developed by smhi in the study carried out by grusson barron 2021c mesan which covers a large part of northern europe provided a better representation of the agro climatological variables used to depict dry and wet days and spells as compared to other gridded products we have used 2018 as a case study due to the serious drought that affected the entire country that year and 2019 as a normal year the crop model used in this study refers to the model developed by williams et al 1989 a more detailed description of the wfe nexus model can be found in zhang et al 2018 and campana et al 2018 the crop mask was built upon data provided by the swedish board of agriculture 2020 the groundwater

agriculture organization 2016 the leaf area index lai used for improving the lai sub model is from copernicus global land service 2020 the 2018 flux tower data were retrieved from the integrated carbon observation system icos sweden icos 2019 only one flux tower located at the agricultural research station of lanna 58 20 n 13 06 e 75 m a s l was used for validation since it was the only

using a water balance approach allen et al 1998 to calculate the water balance we considered that in 2018 oat was grown at the icos agricultural research station of lanna weslien 2020 the crop model

to harvesting n is the number of days from planting to harvesting be is the biomass energy ratio kg ha mj m2 par tot i is the total intercepted daily photosynthetically active radiation par mj m2 lai i is the daily leaf area index m2 m2 and Œ≥ reg i is the daily crop growth regulating factor that is the lowest values among the daily water temperature aeration and nutrient stresses a summary of the key model parameters for oats is given in table 1 to improve the model accuracy we assimilated remote sensing data for lai into the crop model from the lai data significant information can also be deducted such as the approximate crop planting date and the parameters of the leaf area development curve three scenarios have been considered in the first scenario s1 lai the lai is calculated as in zhang et al 2018 by using the default values as in williams et al 1989 in the second scenario s2 lai the lai values for the closest coordinates at lanna research station are retrieved from the copernicus global land service cgls 2020 and fed directly into the model in the last scenario s3 lai the data assimilation is performed by minimizing the rmse i e the rmse is the function f x to be minimized with x decisional variables between the data generated by the developed model and the data from cgls the approach implemented in this study is similar to the approach used by novelli et al 2019 and wagner et al 2020 the optimization model set up is as follows 6 min x f x f x rmse 1 n i 1 n lai sim i lai cgls i 2 where n is the number of observations lai sim i is the simulated lai for the day of the year corresponding to the i th satellite derived observation from cgls and lai cgls i is the lai value from cgls the optimization is performed through a genetic algorithm ga one of the most popular meta heuristic optimization methods mimicking biological evolution konak et al 2006 and using as algorithm a variant of non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2000 ga is available in the matlab global optimization toolbox the main configuration parameters i e population size maximum number of generations crossover fraction and function tolerance were set based on matlab global optimization toolbox suggestions the decisional variables x of the optimization were the key parameters that define the lai curve the planting date the growing season the points that define optimal lai development curve the lai decline factor and the fraction of the growing season at which the lai starts to decline the implementation of more advanced data assimilation algorithms jin et al 2018 such as kalman filter kf or ensemble kalman filter enkf is not included in this work because that is beyond its scope since this study has mainly focused on the comparison between irrigation guidelines as described in more detail in section 2 3 the data assimilation is not applied in the calculation of the irrigation productivity while performing gridded simulations 2 3 irrigation management scenarios although there is motivation to improve farm irrigation management to increase production profit and water use efficiency it must be pointed out that currently in sweden only general irrigation guidelines are provided for instance by bergstr√∂m and barkefors 2004 combined with local experiences or tools developed for other agro ecologies outside of sweden there is thus a need for tools and services to be designed for swedish crop and climate conditions barron 2020 in this study we focused on two counties in the south of sweden blekinge and sk√•ne they belong to statistical region se22 which has the highest water consumption for irrigation as shown in fig 1 blekinge and sk√•ne have also the highest percentages of irrigated areas among croplands the latter having markedly the higher of the two as shown in fig 2 food and agriculture organization 2016 we used potato as a reference crop as in campana et al 2018 since it is the most irrigated crop in sweden brundell et al 2008 the total areas cultivated with potatoes in blekinge and sk√•ne in 2018 were 2050 and 10 820 ha respectively statistics sweden 2018 for model cross validation the main crop model parameters were taken mostly from jennings et al 2020 and summarized in table 2 the potato yield is accounted as 80 of the total biomass as in zhou et al 2016 johnson et al 2016 analyzed the differences between irrigation following standard practices and irrigation based on decision support models that incorporate information on et such as the nasa sims model melton et al 2012 pereira et al 2020 2021 based on two years of field data collected for head lettuce and broccoli using a randomized block design the authors found that standard practices led to an increase in water consumption between 26 and 40 for lettuce and between 39 and 51 for broccoli as compared to et based irrigation management strategies based on data from sims crop yields and qualities were very similar among the treatments and no statistically significant differences in crop yield or quality differences were observed inspired by the results achieved by johnson et al 2016 we developed three scenarios to analyze the impact of an irrigation management service as compared to conventional irrigation guidelines on the irrigation water productivity iwp kg m3 and water savings the iwp is defined as the ratio between the difference in crop yield with and without irrigation and the water applied through irrigation as in bos 1985 and in stepanovic et al 2021 three scenarios were defined for the irrigation requirements in the first scenario s1 irrigation et the irrigation demand follows the guidelines generated by the model developed in this study according to bergstr√∂m and barkefors 2004 70 of the potato area is irrigated with an average of 100 mm season up to 200 mm season with three to four irrigation events slightly different values were presented in the report from the swedish board of agriculture 2007 where the seasonal water requirement for potato was between 300 and 350 mm assuming a rainfall of 170 250 mm during the irrigation season based on those two static guidelines we have thus considered two further scenarios s2 irrigation static 100 consists of three irrigation events for a total of 100 mm season while s3 irrigation static 150 consisted in applying 150 mm in four events a summary of the scenarios is provided in table 3 the results among irrigation guidelines are compared in terms of iwp kg m3 the irrigation follows an operational strategy similar to that of solar irrigation systems which provide an optimal dynamic match between water demand and supply campana et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 as compared to the previous studies campana et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 where we assumed constant soil moisture was to be maintained in this study irrigation is performed only when the water stress coefficient k s as defined by allen et al 1998 goes below 1 0 unlike in previous studies campana et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 no optimization is performed or investigated in this study 2 4 the water energy nexus the energy consumption of irrigation systems depends mainly on irrigation water volumes hydraulic head and pumping system several other aspects such as irrigation strategy irrigation system and fuel affect those factors eq 7 summarizes all these parameters to allow a comprehensive calculation of the energy requirements for irrigation e irr kwh 7 e irr cf 1 cf 2 et c p e Œ∑ irr 1 lr a sh d h irr Œª Œ∂ Œ∑ m Œ∑ p where cf1 is a conversion factor equal to 0 0027 that takes into consideration the density of water 1000 kg m3 gravity acceleration 9 8 m s2 and the conversion between joule and kwh 1 3 6 106 cf2 converts mm into m et c is the

pump efficiency the drawdown depends on the specific borehole performance and it is site specific as it varies with the geological properties of the location e g permeability storage capacity an overview of the parameters affecting the energy consumption of irrigation system is given in fig 3 from a wfe nexus perspective eq 7 encapsulates the relationships among water energy food and soil for irrigation systems the soil aspect of eq 7 is related to the irrigation scheduling which typically depends on field capacity and the soil wilting point the irrigation frequency ifreq 1 day is calculated as the ratio between the irrigation water requirements mm day and the irrigation height mm 8 i f r e q et c p e Œ∑ irr 1 lr f Œ∏ fc Œ∏ wp d where f is the fraction of the total available water that can be used by the plant without stress Œ∏ fc is the soil field capacity mm m Œ∏ wp is the soil wilting point mm m and d is the crop root depth m the main efficiencies involved in calculating the energy requirements for irrigation and their respective variations are summarized in table 4 by taking into consideration all the aspects described in this section in section 3 we have analyzed the energy consumption for irrigation for the two investigated swedish counties two scenarios are defined that represent the worst and best scenarios in terms of energy consumption in irrigation scenario 1 s1 energy represents the worst scenarios in terms of energy consumption it refers to the adoption of a sprinkler irrigation fed by a diesel powered pump that uses groundwater as the water source scenario 2 s2 energy refers to an electrically powered micro irrigation system that pumps water from a nearby surface water source s1 has higher energy consumption than s2 because of the higher hydraulic head depth of water sources and required pressure for the irrigation system higher water consumption lower efficiency of the irrigation system and lower pumping system efficiency power source and pump efficiency the parameters of those two investigated scenarios are summarized in table 5 2 5 development of the visualization platform the current version of the developed visualization platform relies on google earth pro 2021 swedims 2021 the model retrieves data from the smhi models str√•ng 2020 and mesan smhi 2020b which are further processed with the modelling chain presented in this study the gridded data are uploaded to the web database swedims 2021 once the gridded data are stored a parallel code develops a kmz file to visualize the spatial data for the entire country the generated kmz file also allows the retrieval of time series image data as well as ms excel files for more than 300 locations across the country the kmz file was developed using the open source package google earth toolbox developed by scott lee davis 2020 3 results and discussions 3 1 model validation and limitations the comparison of et o and crop yield using penman monteith versus the hargreaves and samani equations is depicted in fig 4 scatter plot of et o on the left and difference in crop yield on the right as it shows the hargreaves and samani equation slightly underestimates et o as compared to penman monteith as also highlighted in the study conducted by awal et al 2020 nevertheless the absolute difference in crop yield estimation is 0 11 t ha i e less than 2 5 this result can have practical consequences in the implementation of the et o model since penman monteith requires significantly more input data as compared to the hargreaves and samani model the validation of the simulated et a is presented in fig 5 using et a derived from the flux tower the scatter plot shows an r2 of 0 80 and rmse of 1 38 between the derived and simulated daily et a during the crop growing season using penman monteith for the calculation of et o the r2 is 0 78 while the rmse is 1 17 when the hargreaves and samani equation is implemented this shows that the comparison between measured and modelled data agrees well with zhang et al 2016 who reported an r2 of 0 549 between flux tower derived et to modis et product the relationship between the soil water content based on the daily values calculated from swedims and the values measured at the icos station of lanna for different depths is presented in fig 6 the calculated soil water content refers to the value within the crop root depth max 1 m and is based on the water balance for the grid cell of 2 5 km 2 5 km resolution of the gridded input data of str√•ng and mesan containing the agricultural station good agreement is observed between the measured and simulated values especially with the soil water content at 0 3 m depth it must be pointed out that in the simulations of the soil water content capillarity was not included moreover it is worth noting two important aspects first the calculation of the soil water content was performed by assuming that the soil water content at the beginning of the simulations was at field capacity second the field capacity is extracted by a gridded product global soil data task group 2000 that cannot accurately represent the heterogeneity of soil properties at field level the results of the crop yield validation at the agricultural research station of lanna are depicted in fig 7 the crop yield simulated with the model used in this study was compared with the crop yield retrieved from the station s principal investigator weslien 2020 and statistics sweden 2018 the harvest at the station was approximately 5 t ha as reported by weslien 2020 the oat yield from statistics sweden 2018 refers to the 2018 county level oat yield in v√§stra g√∂taland county which the lanna research station belongs to the simulation results in fig 7 show very good agreement especially with the county level average yield considering that the current version of the model runs at a resolution of 2 5 km 2 5 km and may not provide accurate crop yield estimations at the field level due to the heterogeneity of the required input parameters in particular the model is sensitive to parameters such as planting date lai and soil moisture as fig 7 shows the yield generated from the model using lai data assimilation with optimization s3 lai as carried out by novelli et al 2019 and wagner et al 2020 provides the most accurate results as compared to the actual measured yield the percentage errors as compared to the measured crop yield and the county level statistics are 2 and 10 6 respectively those results agree with results presented by wagner et al 2020 that demonstrated the superiority of the optimization method as compared to simple updating the authors also demonstrated that the optimization approach could lead to similar or even improved results as compared to more advanced data assimilation algorithms such as extended kalman filter updating the lai curve after optimization of the shape key parameters and the lai data from cgls are depicted in fig 8 the crop yield simulations using the default crop parameters as in williams et al 1989 show similar results as providing simple updates of lai values from cgls fig 7 similar accurate results could be obtained by updating the planting date using the values reported in morel et al 2021 the lai data from cgls comes with a five day delay in an operational system this could lead to some inaccuracies in estimating water use for irrigation and crop yield i e the potential biomass accumulation this aspect is not investigated in this study but will be assessed in future experimental studies balkoviƒç et al 2013 reported similar yields for oat in their comprehensive epic multi crop simulation across europe foltescu 2000 also reported similar yields by running the wofost crop model using mesan climatological parameters as input the et a and soil moisture models validation has been performed only at one location and for one crop for 2018 the icos network that provides open source data had only one flux tower on agricultural land in sweden https www icos sweden se lanna in 2018 currently that flux tower has been closed at the end of 2020 the current operating stations can be found at https www icos sweden se stations other flux towers belonging to the icos network are installed on other type of ecosystems such as wetland and forest to make up for the lack of data our research group is establishing an experimental facility where we compare crop yields in open field conditions as well under agrivoltaic systems this is connected to the project evaluation of the first agrivoltaic system in sweden m√§lardalen university 2022 in future studies we will use the data gathered by the monitoring system including distributed soil moisture and temperature sensors and micro lysimeters and crop yield experiments to further validate the model presented in this study 3 2 irrigation water productivity and crop model validation the results of the iwp kg m3 for the investigated irrigation scenarios are summarized in fig 9 for 2018 and in fig 10 for 2019 the irrigation guidelines provided by the model developed in this study show the highest values of iwp in most of the considered grids for both 2018 and 2019 the scenarios s2 irrigation static 100 and s3 irrigation static 150 derived from bergstr√∂m and barkefors 2004 and from the swedish board of agriculture 2007 show lower iwp values both in 2018 and 2019 as compared to scenarios s2 and s3 irrigation the guidelines provided by the developed spatially explicit model show higher water volumes for irrigation i e negative water savings in fig 11 but maintain higher iwp values in most of the grids as fig 9 shows in 2018 the proposed irrigation management system could lead to water savings mostly of between 75 and 40 as compared to s2 irrigation static 100 and of between 55 and 10 as compared to s3 irrigation static 150 as depicted in fig 11 left nevertheless by analyzing the crop yield increase of scenario s1 irrigation et as compared to scenarios s2 irrigation static 100 and s3 irrigation static 150 see fig 11 right it can be easily noted that crop yield increase from the proposed irrigation management system vary between 10 and 60 as compared to conventional irrigation guidelines most of the input data for irrigation management vary temporally and spatially making spatially explicit guidelines fundamental meanwhile with intensifying climate changes and more frequent extreme weather events in recent years such as the severe drought of 2018 it becomes more difficult to apply typical meteorological year guidelines based on past experiences melton et al 2012 by analyzing the results concerning water savings and crop yield increase for 2019 a more typical meteorological year as compared to 2018 depicted in fig 12 we see that most of the water savings range between 20 and 80 as compared to scenario s2 irrigation static 100 and between 20 and 100 as compared to scenario s3 irrigation static 150 even in 2019 by assuming static guidelines the crop yield increase of scenario s1 irrigation et ranges between 5 30 as compared to the scenarios based upon conventional irrigation guidelines those modelling results align with the results from johnson et al 2016 a further model run for scenario s1 irrigation et was performed using a threshold k s value of 0 6 i e irrigation is performed only when the water stress coefficient reaches a value of 0 6 the results are summarized in fig 13 as can be seen scenario s1 irrigation et and scenario s3 irrigation static 150 suggest similar applied irrigation volumes e g the irrigation volumes for s1 irrigation et are mostly distributed between 100 and 160 mm nevertheless the resulting crop yields for scenario s1 irrigation et are significantly higher than for scenario s3 irrigation due to better irrigation scheduling this further support the superiority of spatially explicitly et c driven guidelines as compared to conventional non spatially and non temporally driven irrigation guidelines et c driven irrigation was also acknowledged by ko and piccinni 2009 as one of the efficient irrigation schemes for achieving higher water use efficiency for growing corn in texas similar hanson and putnam 2000 pointed out that water consumption in irrigation for alfalfa in california can be reduced through improved irrigation scheduling by considering dynamic variation of et c and soil moisture the authors also investigated the effects of deficit irrigation and pointed out that further water savings in irrigation can be achieved by reducing or avoiding irrigation during those periods when the crop yield per water applied is minimal similar conclusions for maximizing alfalfa water use efficiency in the great plains and intermountain were achieved by lindenmayer et al 2011 in 2018 the crop yield reduction due to temperature stress was up to 30 as compared to the ideal case without temperature stress as depicted in fig 14 the results refer to two cases no irrigation and s1 irrigation et since the wfe nexus also represents a framework for innovations and technologies for sustainable natural resources management an important technology that could be integrated in the agricultural and irrigation sector to reduce the impacts of water and temperature stresses on crops is agrivoltaic i e the combination of photovoltaic systems and crop production in the same area agrivoltaic systems as well as photovoltaic water pumping systems for irrigation can simultaneously address the interactions among water energy and food due to shade cast on crops amaducci et al 2018 demonstrated that agrivoltaic systems with an optimal density of pv modules can increase crop yields due to their ability to maintain higher levels of soil moisture in italy similarly barron gafford et al 2019 showed that the combination of pv systems with farm activities could lead to reduced drought impact and higher food yield in arizona at high latitudes like in sweden the tradeoffs between water and temperature stresses reductions which can lead to increased crop yields and par reductions due to the shadings produced by the pv modules which can negatively affect crop yields are worth of investigations the models and frameworks developed in this study combined with the optimization model for agrivoltaic systems presented in campana et al 2021 can be a starting point to investigate the effects deployment of agrivoltaic systems to support the irrigation sector on large scale the validation of the potatoes crop model for the selected counties in sweden is presented in figs 15 16 for 2018 and 2019 respectively using county level statistics statistics sweden 2022b we have assumed a 20 dry matter weight to reconcile fresh matter and dry matter data both for 2018 and 2019 the statistics available for sk√•ne and blekinge concerning the average potato yield are comprised between the average crop yield simulated under no irrigation and irrigation scenarios the variation between crop yield under the no irrigation and irrigation scenarios is significantly reduced in 2019 as compared to 2018 due the absence of an extreme weather phenomena hitting the region those last results confirm the robustness of the model unfortunately in sweden only county level statistics are available and no statistics differentiate between irrigated and non irrigated crop yields as for instance in the united states of america usda 2022 more detailed statistics and methods like irrmapper ketchum et al 2020 a machine learning based model for mapping irrigation status at high spatial resolution could be used to further validate the simulated crop yield at county or sub county levels for irrigated and non irrigated areas the potential crop yields under irrigation regimes also agrees with the values reported in ekel√∂f et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 2018 and jennings et al 2020 3 3 energy consumption and further developments energy consumptions in the irrigation sector for the different scenarios as defined in table 5 are depicted in figs 17 and 18 the scenario s1 energy shows an energy consumption in the order of ten times higher than the best case scenario s2 energy this is due to the combination of efficiencies in the modelling chain water resources depth and other parameters see table 5 while these results might not significantly affect a single farmer due to the current low electricity prices in sweden eurostat 2021 it might substantially affect the regional energy systems in terms of matching electricity supply and demand this mismatch at a larger scale i e not at farm level but on a regional level might lead to spikes in the electricity prices due to higher demands that can afterwards affect farmers and more generally all the electricity buyers moreover this is likely to happen during extreme droughts events and or for long term negative climate changes that typically put pressure on energy systems in particular on hydropower and thermal energy conversion plants riksbanken 2018 from a wfe nexus perspective the results in figs 17 and 18 are important in broader energy and water contexts to better understand the wfe nexus with an integrated approach the model presented in this study will be further developed to analyze other key sectors such as the agricultural sector as a whole i e not only the irrigation sector as in this study industrial power commercial and residential sectors the developed model will be able to study spatially explicit water and energy demand and supply at high temporal resolution which will enable the identification of potential energy demand and supply mismatches especially during extreme events and or using climate change scenarios data the integration of such a model with a hydrological model will also allow to identify potential water supply and demand mismatches spatially and temporally and thus better allocate water resources 3 4 the irrigation management service interface a screenshot of the demonstrator for the irrigation management service interface is provided in fig 19 where the users can view the daily et o maps for all of sweden once all the data are retrieved from the server the maps can be visualized with a time dimension by using the time slider by specifying the field evapotranspiration cities the users can also view and download daily based time series of et o and precipitation data for the selected locations across the country fig 20 the locations for which it is possible to retrieve the et o and precipitation time series appear on the map the data on et o and precipitation can be used as a starting point for more accurate assessment of specific crop water requirements using the fao guidelines allen et al 1998 moreover by assimilating lai observations as described in sections 2 2 and 3 1 and other satellite derived parameters the current version of the model could be further expanded to specifically cover the most irrigated crops in the country providing timely guidelines for farmers by integrating et o maps with maps of irrigation areas and water resource depths and availabilities water and energy management agency managers could have a better view of potential water and energy consumption from the irrigation sector the developed interface demonstrator can provide large scale and cost effective irrigation management services and decision support in both developed and developing countries especially in those areas with significant water and food security issues 4 conclusions this study aimed to develop a demonstrator of operational water food energy nexus system for the irrigation sector in sweden focusing on the interrelationships between water and energy requirements for irrigation and corresponding crop yield response the 2018 drought that severely hit sweden is used as the case study the results are compared with 2019 a more typical meteorological year as compared to 2018 the main conclusions from this study are the following the use of the penman monteith equation instead of the hargreaves and samani equation for estimating the crop reference evapotranspiration shows slightly better results in the modelling chain for estimating oats yield 0 11 t ha difference at lanna in 2018 despite the higher performances of penman monteith equation it requires significantly more input data as compared to the hargreaves and samani s model this demonstrates that the implementation of hargreaves and samani equation could provide a good trade off between accuracy and complexity for an operational service by assimilating through optimization the leaf area index from copernicus global land service into the crop model the model presents the best results while comparing the simulated crop yield with the measured crop yield at the lanna icos station the irrigation water productivity using the developed model shows better results as compared to irrigation scenarios based on existing static and non spatially explicit guidelines both in 2018 and in 2019 during the drought year 2018 the developed model showed no irrigation water savings as compared to conventional irrigation guidelines nevertheless the crop yield increase from the proposed irrigation management system varied between 10 and 60 as compared to conventional irrigation guidelines in 2019 most of the water savings ranged between 20 i e increased irrigation water volume as compared to static guidelines and 80 with crop yield increases ranging between 5 i e decreased crop yield and 30 those modelling results align with previous studies on implementing large scale irrigation management services in the united states of america the modelling result shows a significant reduction in crop yield of up to 30 due to temperature stress as compared to the ideal case in which temperature stress is absent this connected to the high water stress in 2018 might justify the implementation of technologies that can mitigate the negative effects of weather extremes e g drought and climate changes on water food energy nexus interrelationships the developed demonstrator based on an open source package for google earth can be easily implemented to help farmers and water and energy management agencies to better understand the water energy and food interrelationships and make informed decisions especially during the occurrence of extreme events the developed demonstrator interface can provide large scale and cost effective irrigation management services and decision support in both developed and developing countries in future studies the proposed model will be extended to other key sectors such as the power and industrial sector

9379,the 2018 drought in sweden prompted questions about climate adaptation and mitigation measures especially in the agricultural sector which suffered the most this study applies a water food energy nexus modelling framework to evaluate drought impacts on irrigation and agriculture in sweden using 2018 and 2019 as case studies a previous water food energy nexus model was updated to facilitate an investigation of the benefits of data driven irrigation scheduling as compared to existing irrigation guidelines moreover the benefits of assimilating earth observation data in the crop model have been explored the assimilation of leaf area index data from the copernicus global land service improves the crop yield estimation as compared to default crop model parameters the results show that the irrigation water productivities of the proposed model are measurably improved compared to conventional and static irrigation guidelines for both 2018 and 2019 this is mostly due to the advantage of the proposed model in providing evapotranspiration in cultural condition et c driven guidelines by using spatially explicit data generated by mesoscale models from the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute during the drought year 2018 the developed model showed no irrigation water savings as compared to irrigation scenarios based on conventional irrigation guidelines nevertheless the crop yield increase from the proposed irrigation management system varied between 10 and 60 as compared to conventional irrigation scenarios during a normal year the proposed irrigation management system leads to significant water savings as compared to conventional irrigation guidelines the modelling results show that temperature stress during the 2018 drought also played a key role in reducing crop yields with yield reductions of up to 30 from a water food energy nexus this motivates the implementation of new technologies to reduce water and temperature stress to mitigate likely negative effects of climate change and extremes by using an open source package for google earth a demonstrator of cost effective visualization platform is developed for helping farmers and water and energy management agencies to better understand the connections between water and energy use and food production this can be significant especially during the occurrence of extreme events but also to adapt to the negative effects on agricultural production of climate changes keywords water food energy nexus drought irrigation data visualization 1 introduction in 2018 sweden experienced an unprecedented drought that severely affected the agricultural water and energy sectors during the period from june to july 2018 some regions experienced a significant reduction in precipitation as compared to a normal year krikken et al 2019 showed a precipitation anomaly for july 2018 ranging from 0 mm to 100 mm as compared to 1981 2010 climatology in july 2018 some locations such as kastl√∂sa in √∂land and komstorp in blekinge did not receive any precipitation while others such as varberg and √∂land s southern cape received 0 2 and 0 8 mm respectively smhi 2020a this caused a drastic reduction in crop yields including for key crops such as wheat potatoes and other forage crops the lack of forage crops negatively affected dairy farms and related industry analysis of the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei for the period 1950 2020 indicates that 2018 was one of the worst droughts in more than 50 years for swedish farmers spei global drought monitor 2020 as a result farmers had to start irrigating or installing irrigation systems however the scarcity of rainfall also severely affected the water resources available for agricultural production some counties such as sk√•ne issued restrictions on irrigation to preserve the scarce water resources putting further stress on farmers especially those who had water intensive crops such as vegetables and potatoes the local 2020 in some cases especially for those growers who did not have the possibility of irrigation potatoes were unharvested due to the poor yield and potatoes size statistics sweden 2022a compared to southern european countries such as greece italy or spain where irrigation is a more well established practice swedish farmers have generally lacked adequate means and incentives to determine water use requirements for crops to schedule irrigation applications to match crop water requirements to evaluate the response of crop yields to different water management practices and to evaluate current on farm water efficiency levels the combination of these factors led to the worst crop harvest since the 1950s for sweden bioenergy international 2020 the extreme drought also affected the energy sector higher volumes of water pumped for irrigation required higher electricity demand in the agricultural sector low precipitation levels affected hydropower generation due to low refilling volumes the state owned power company vattenfall ab closed the 900 mw number 2 nuclear reactor at its ringhals power plant since the water required for the cooling process reached high temperatures that could threaten the safety and function of the reactor renew economy 2020 this acute drought event in sweden clearly highlighted the water food energy wfe nexus interrelationships and how they can be exacerbated during extreme events moreover the climate change scenarios produced by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi predict that the annual mean temperature in sweden will grow steadily from now until the year 2100 and beyond belusic et al 2019 the precipitation patterns from climate models show high variability indicating that drought events and heat waves will likely happen more frequently with socio economic consequences in several sectors as highlighted by belusic et al 2019 studies on drought and drought effects on water balance calculations in scandinavia are limited sweden needs to account for increasing drought frequency and severity as part of ongoing planning efforts to mitigate the potential effects of climate change and extreme weather phenomena in 2018 the swedish government presented a national crisis package valued at more than sek 1 2 billion sek 1 usd 0 1 primarily to cover the fodder shortage and other losses of income that farmers experienced due to the drought sek 760 million were invested in 2019 to develop measures to alleviate the situation for the drought affected agricultural sector government offices of sweden 2020 recently grusson et al 2021a analyzed the impacts of climate change on the swedish agriculture highlighting the increasing need for irrigation especially during the beginning of the growing season due to the higher probability of dry springs grusson et al 2021b also highlighted that future climate change scenarios predict an increase in precipitation in sweden nevertheless the predicted increase in precipitation especially in the south of sweden will not lead to increased soil moisture for supporting crop production but to an increased run off since the precipitations events will increase in intensity the smhi provides a water shortage risk service through an overview of groundwater levels surface water levels and statistical summaries of precipitation amounts however this service does not incorporate any dynamic satellite information regarding soil moisture and vegetation characteristics currently only general irrigation guidelines based on the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 are provided in addition existing guidelines sometimes suggest different values for instance bergstr√∂m and barkefors 2004 suggested irrigating potatoes with 100 mm season on average maximum 200 mm season the swedish board of agriculture 2007 mentioned that water requirements for potatoes should be between 300 and 350 mm assuming average precipitation of between 170 and 250 mm during the same period the report from the swedish board of agriculture 2007 also provided static guidelines for the irrigation of potatoes for different locations e g visby 57 6348 n 18 2948 e with 130 mm season recommended and ume√• 63 8258 n 20 2630 e with 75 mm season recommended no irrigation management services are provided in sweden unlike in countries or regions that historically have been more prone to drought in addition the input data for irrigation and for nutrient management depend on spatio temporal data such as climatological and soil type data and this heterogeneity requires spatially explicit information to produce accurate guidelines for this reason researchers and institutions have been active in developing decision support systems based on simulation and optimization models or satellite data observations or hybrid approaches to provide guidelines on optimal irrigation and nutrient applications and thus to inform smart farming management the nasa satellite irrigation management support sims system melton et al 2012 pereira et al 2020 2021 integrates earth observation data from landsat and modis with meteorological observations to generate daily maps of evapotranspiration et and eight day maps of crop coefficients over california the newly launched openet 2021 has implemented six satellite based et models on the google earth engine platform gorelick et al 2017 to develop daily monthly and annual et database for the western us easily available at field scales 30 m 30 m per pixel via a web based ui and application programming interface api the openet models intercomparison and accuracy assessment has been carried out through different phases by relying on 70 first phase and 69 second phase data from flux towers across the united states of america melton et al 2021 wang et al 2019 developed a web based irrigation decision support system for canal irrigation management the model is based upon two modules the first module is for real time irrigation forecasting and scheduling the second module is for planning the canals water delivery volumes in italy irrinet is a decision support system for on farm irrigation scheduling mannini et al 2013 that gives farmers day by day information on how much and when to irrigate crops the system implements a real time irrigation scheduling through climatic and meteorological data gathered daily another example of decision support system in italy is fertirrigere battilani 2004 a model based decision support system used in italy that proved to reduce the nitrogen application on horticultural products by 46 compared to conventional practices with no notable effects on yield and quality mahmoud and gan 2019 developed a model to enhance the irrigation water management in central saudi arabia by assessing the spatio temporal variation of actual evapotranspiration through remote sensing techniques and meteorological data zhang et al 2012 developed the zhaokou irrigation management system consisting of a precipitation forecasting module a crop water demand forecasting module and a crop coefficient index the established system improved water efficiency providing a theoretical basis for water resources scheduling and channels rational control galindo et al 2017 presented a methodology for optimal water and energy management in the irrigation system using a two layer management scheme the upper layer is an optimal control strategy to plan how to serve the required water within a five day prediction horizon to minimize pumping electricity costs the lower layer is a scheduling algorithm that decides how to schedule the different pumps to supply the desired flow minimize cost and maximize efficiency in romania a field scale irrigation planning and management system was set up and tested futurewater 2020 irrigation guidelines are provided by integrating soil moisture content ground data with hydrological model calculations in greece agriculture and especially irrigation plays a key role in terms of water management and the irma system 2021 calculates site specific crop water requirements and irrigation scheduling at high spatial resolution malamos et al 2015 the decision support system integrates historical and forecast agrometeorological data crop data and soil data to provide timely guidelines for irrigation a comprehensive review of irrigation and fertilization decision support systems is provided in gallardo et al 2020 the wfe nexus concept was introduced during the 2008 world economic forum to discuss the important interlinkages among the water food and energy sectors highlighted by the global food security crisis of 2008 dominic 2011 the agricultural and food production sectors are at the center of the nexus concept because both sectors require significant amounts of water and energy for irrigation and food production 70 of the global water withdrawals and 30 of the world s total energy consumption are allocated to this sector food and agriculture organization fao 2017 since research on the nexus began several modelling tools have been developed nevertheless most of the modelling approaches have only looked at interactions between two out of the three sectors which is not optimal for improving the efficiency of resources kaddoura and el khatib 2017 moreover very few models are at the stage of implementing the wfe nexus approach liu et al 2017 dai et al 2018 shannak et al 2018 endo et al 2019 or supporting political decisions bazilian et al 2011 furthermore as highlighted by lawford 2019 there is a general data gap in both spatial and temporal dimensions concerning the observation of key parameters for wfe nexus analysis most of the current available irrigation management systems lack a wfe perspective that integrates information concerning irrigation water requirements crop response to irrigation and energy consumption this study aims to lay the foundations to develop an operational wfe nexus irrigation management system for sweden by including all three areas of the nexus this is attained by using the spatially explicit climatic data generated by smhi specific objectives of this study are to further develop the model presented in zhang et al 2018 for nebraska and in campana et al 2018 for sweden by implementing the penman monteith equation for the calculation of reference evapotranspiration and related improvement and validation using remote sensing data and tower flux data analyze the irrigation water productivity of existing irrigation guidelines in sweden and compare the results with the guidelines provided by the developed model analyze wfe nexus aspects related to irrigation systems in sweden develop a demonstrator for a future operational service primarily for farmers interested in crop conditions and irrigation guidelines but also for energy and water management related agencies to our best knowledge there is no irrigation management system in sweden as compared to other countries in asia or europe or united states of america moreover although the 2018 drought has triggered research activities on irrigation from our literature review few studies have been carried out in sweden on irrigation and especially for combating and adapting to climate changes this was also clearly highlighted in grusson et al 2021a the novelty of this study lies mainly in three points develop a demonstrator of irrigation management system called swedish irrigation management system swedims 2022 combined with the gridded meteorological products developed by smhi for retrieving climatological data develop a model based management system that can be used to provide information not only for evapotranspiration but also to crop grow when combined with a crop model and with earth observations develop a model not only for providing irrigation management guidelines but also extending the model functionalities to work as a wfe nexus model within the irrigation agricultural sector in sweden although the model presented in this study is applied to sweden using gridded data generated by two mesoscale models str√•ng 2020 and mesan smhi 2020b from the smhi it has general validity and can be extended to other regions using different gridded products for climatological variables the paper is organized as follows the problem statement and the objective of this study are introduced in section 1 which also provides a literature review of irrigation management systems data and methods are presented in section 2 the main results of this study i e model validation irrigation water productivity for three irrigation guidelines scenarios water food energy nexus relationships in the irrigation sector and visualization are presented in section 3 the conclusions of this study are summarized in section 4 2 data and methods 2 1 data the gridded meteorological data used to generate the results are mainly taken from the mesoscale models str√•ng 2020 and mesan smhi 2020b that are developed by smhi in the study carried out by grusson barron 2021c mesan which covers a large part of northern europe provided a better representation of the agro climatological variables used to depict dry and wet days and spells as compared to other gridded products we have used 2018 as a case study due to the serious drought that affected the entire country that year and 2019 as a normal year the crop model used in this study refers to the model developed by williams et al 1989 a more detailed description of the wfe nexus model can be found in zhang et al 2018 and campana et al 2018 the crop mask was built upon data provided by the swedish board of agriculture 2020 the groundwater depth dataset refers to the product developed by fan et al 2013 the soil field capacity and wilting point are from the global soil data task group 2000 the irrigation areas refer to food and agriculture organization 2016 the leaf area index lai used for improving the lai sub model is from copernicus global land service 2020 the 2018 flux tower data were retrieved from the integrated carbon observation system icos sweden icos 2019 only one flux tower located at the agricultural research station of lanna 58 20 n 13 06 e 75 m a s l was used for validation since it was the only available flux tower installed on an agricultural field in sweden the data refers to one single year and crop a detailed description of the station and related measured variables can be found in icos 2021 agricultural statistics were provided through personal communication with the station principal investigator weslien 2020 2 2 model updates and validation as compared to the model presented in campana et al 2018 where the daily reference evapotranspiration et o mm day was calculated using the hargreaves and samani equation hargreaves and samani 1982 in this study et o has been calculated using the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 1 et o 0 408 r n g Œ≥ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a Œ≥ 1 0 34 u 2 where Œ¥ is the saturation slope of the vapor pressure curve at t a kpa c r n is the net radiation mj m2 day g is the soil heat flux density mj m2 day Œ≥ is the psychrometric constant kpa c t is the daily mean air temperature c e s is saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is the average daily actual vapor pressure kpa and u 2 is the daily average wind speed m s zotarelli et al 2010 have presented a detailed guideline for the step by step calculation of et o in this study the actual et et a estimates generated using the model and meteorological datasets described in section 2 1 have been validated using the data measured from the flux tower installed at the icos agricultural research station of lanna icos 2019 the measurements refer to latent heat flux and soil water content in 2018 the flux tower s et a is calculated with the following equation from gu et al 2017 2 et a les Œª œÅ a where le is the latent heat flux w m2 s is the time s Œª is the latent heat of vaporization j kg and œÅ a is the air density kg m3 Œª is calculated as follows moorhead et al 2019 3 Œª 2 501 0 0236 t s 10 6 where t s is the surface temperature c the surface temperature has been assumed to be equal to air temperature as in jungqvist et al 2014 in swedims et a is calculated using a water balance approach allen et al 1998 to calculate the water balance we considered that in 2018 oat was grown at the icos agricultural research station of lanna weslien 2020 the crop model was thus set up for oats to calculate both water balance and crop yield the et in cultural conditions et c a key component in the water balance was calculated with an iterative approach that minimizes the root mean square error rmse between the et c curve based on the fao guidelines for oat development stages and corresponding cultural factors allen et al 1998 and the et c curve described by the following equation dejonge et al 2012 4 et c e t o a b 1 e clai eq 4 depends on the lai m2 m2 that is computed in the model through iterations zhang et al 2018 the main engine of the crop model is eq 5 williams et al 1989 5 y a hia i 1 n 0 001 be par tot i 1 e 0 65 lai i Œ≥ reg i where y a is the actual crop yield t ha hia is the adjusted harvest index at maturity i is the i th day from planting

i is the daily leaf area index m2 m2 and Œ≥ reg i is the daily crop growth regulating factor that is the lowest values among the daily water temperature aeration and nutrient stresses a summary of the key model parameters for oats is given in table 1 to improve the model accuracy we assimilated remote sensing data for lai into the crop model from the lai data significant information can also be deducted such as the approximate crop planting date and the parameters of the leaf area development curve three scenarios have been considered in the first scenario s1 lai the lai is calculated as in zhang et al 2018 by using the default values as in williams et al 1989 in the second scenario s2 lai the lai values for the closest coordinates at lanna research station are retrieved from the copernicus global land service cgls 2020 and fed directly into the model in the last scenario s3 lai the data assimilation is performed by minimizing the rmse i e the rmse is the function f x to be minimized with x decisional variables between the data generated by the developed model and the data from cgls the approach implemented in this study is similar to the approach used by novelli et al 2019 and wagner et al 2020 the optimization model set up is as follows 6 min x f x f x rmse 1 n i 1 n lai sim i lai cgls i 2 where n is the number of observations lai sim i is the simulated lai for the day of the year corresponding to the i th satellite derived observation from cgls and lai cgls i is the lai value from cgls the optimization is performed through a genetic algorithm ga one of the most popular meta heuristic optimization methods mimicking biological evolution konak et al 2006 and using as algorithm a variant of non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2000 ga is available in the matlab global optimization toolbox the main configuration parameters i e population size maximum number of generations crossover fraction and function tolerance were set based on matlab global optimization toolbox suggestions the decisional variables x of the optimization were the key parameters that define the lai curve the planting date the growing season the points that define optimal lai development curve the lai decline factor and the fraction of the growing season at which the lai starts to decline the implementation of more advanced data assimilation algorithms jin et al 2018 such as kalman filter kf or ensemble kalman filter enkf is not included in this work because that is beyond its scope since this study has mainly focused on the comparison between irrigation guidelines as described in more detail in section 2 3 the data assimilation is not applied in the calculation of the irrigation productivity while performing gridded simulations 2 3 irrigation management scenarios although there is motivation to improve farm irrigation management to increase production profit and water use efficiency it must be pointed out that currently in sweden only general irrigation guidelines are provided for instance by bergstr√∂m and barkefors 2004 combined with local experiences or tools developed for other agro ecologies outside of sweden there is thus a need for tools and services to be designed for swedish crop and climate conditions barron 2020 in this study we focused on two counties in the south of sweden blekinge and sk√•ne they belong to statistical region se22 which has the highest water consumption for irrigation as shown in fig 1 blekinge and sk√•ne have also the highest percentages of irrigated areas among croplands the latter having markedly the higher of the two as shown in fig 2 food and agriculture organization 2016 we used potato as a reference crop as in campana et al 2018 since it is the most irrigated crop in sweden brundell et al 2008 the total areas cultivated with potatoes in blekinge and sk√•ne in 2018 were 2050 and 10 820 ha respectively statistics sweden 2018 for model cross validation the main crop model parameters were taken mostly from jennings et al 2020 and summarized in table 2 the potato yield is accounted as 80 of the total biomass as in zhou et al 2016 johnson et al 2016 analyzed the differences between irrigation following standard practices and irrigation based on decision support models that incorporate information on et such as the nasa sims model melton et al 2012 pereira et al 2020 2021 based on two years of field data collected for head lettuce and broccoli using a randomized block design the authors found that standard practices led to an increase in water consumption between 26 and 40 for lettuce and between 39 and 51 for broccoli as compared to et based irrigation management strategies based on data from sims crop yields and qualities were very similar among the treatments and no statistically significant differences in crop yield or quality differences were observed inspired by the results achieved by johnson et al 2016 we developed three scenarios to analyze the impact of an irrigation management service as compared to conventional irrigation guidelines on the irrigation water productivity iwp kg m3 and water savings the iwp is defined as the ratio between the difference in crop yield with and without irrigation and the water applied through irrigation as in bos 1985 and in stepanovic et al 2021 three scenarios were defined for the irrigation requirements in the first scenario s1 irrigation et the irrigation demand follows the guidelines generated by the model developed in this study according to bergstr√∂m and barkefors 2004 70 of the potato area is irrigated with an average of 100 mm season up to 200 mm season with three to four irrigation events slightly different values were presented in the report from the swedish board of agriculture 2007 where the seasonal water requirement for potato was between 300 and 350 mm assuming a rainfall of 170 250 mm during the irrigation season based on those two static guidelines we have thus considered two further scenarios s2 irrigation static 100 consists of three irrigation events for a total of 100 mm season while s3 irrigation static 150 consisted in applying 150 mm in four events a summary of the scenarios is provided in table 3 the results among irrigation guidelines are compared in terms of iwp kg m3 the irrigation follows an operational strategy similar to that of solar irrigation systems which provide an optimal dynamic match between water demand and supply campana et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 as compared to the previous studies campana et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 where we assumed constant soil moisture was to be maintained in this study irrigation is performed only when the water stress coefficient k s as defined by allen et al 1998 goes below 1 0 unlike in previous studies campana et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 no optimization is performed or investigated in this study 2 4 the water energy nexus the energy consumption of irrigation systems depends mainly on irrigation water volumes hydraulic head and pumping system several other aspects such as irrigation strategy irrigation system and fuel affect those factors eq 7 summarizes all these parameters to allow a comprehensive calculation of the energy requirements for irrigation e irr kwh 7 e irr cf 1 cf 2 et c p e Œ∑ irr 1 lr a sh d h irr Œª Œ∂ Œ∑ m Œ∑ p where cf1 is a conversion factor equal to 0 0027 that takes into consideration the density of water 1000 kg m3 gravity acceleration 9 8 m s2 and the conversion between joule and kwh 1 3 6 106 cf2 converts mm into m et c is the

pump efficiency the drawdown depends on the specific borehole performance and it is site specific as it varies with the geological properties of the location e g permeability storage capacity an overview of the parameters affecting the energy consumption of irrigation system is given in fig 3 from a wfe nexus perspective eq 7 encapsulates the relationships among water energy food and soil for irrigation systems the soil aspect of eq 7 is related to the irrigation scheduling which typically depends on field capacity and the soil wilting point the irrigation frequency ifreq 1 day is calculated as the ratio between the irrigation water requirements mm day and the irrigation height mm 8 i f r e q et c p e Œ∑ irr 1 lr f Œ∏ fc Œ∏ wp d where f is the fraction of the total available water that can be used by the plant without stress Œ∏ fc is the soil field capacity mm m Œ∏ wp is the soil wilting point mm m and d is the crop root depth m the main efficiencies involved in calculating the energy requirements for irrigation and their respective variations are summarized in table 4 by taking into consideration all the aspects described in this section in section 3 we have analyzed the energy consumption for irrigation for the two investigated swedish counties two scenarios are defined that represent the worst and best scenarios in terms of energy consumption in irrigation scenario 1 s1 energy represents the worst scenarios in terms of energy consumption it refers to the adoption of a sprinkler irrigation fed by a diesel powered pump that uses groundwater as the water source scenario 2 s2 energy refers to an electrically powered micro irrigation system that pumps water from a nearby surface water source s1 has higher energy consumption than s2 because of the higher hydraulic head depth of water sources and required pressure for the irrigation system higher water consumption lower efficiency of the irrigation system and lower pumping system efficiency power source and pump efficiency the parameters of those two investigated scenarios are summarized in table 5 2 5 development of the visualization platform the current version of the developed visualization platform relies on google earth pro 2021 swedims 2021 the model retrieves data from the smhi models str√•ng 2020 and mesan smhi 2020b which are further processed with the modelling chain presented in this study the gridded data are uploaded to the web database swedims 2021 once the gridded data are stored a parallel code develops a kmz file to visualize the spatial data for the entire country the generated kmz file also allows the retrieval of time series image data as well as ms excel files for more than 300 locations across the country the kmz file was developed using the open source package google earth toolbox developed by scott lee davis 2020 3 results and discussions 3 1 model validation and limitations the comparison of et o and crop yield using penman monteith versus the hargreaves and samani equations is depicted in fig 4 scatter plot of et o on the left and difference in crop yield on the right as it shows the hargreaves and samani equation slightly underestimates et o as compared to penman monteith as also highlighted in the study conducted by awal et al 2020 nevertheless the absolute difference in crop yield estimation is 0 11 t ha i e less than 2 5 this result can have practical consequences in the implementation of the et o model since penman monteith requires significantly more input data as compared to the hargreaves and samani model the validation of the simulated et a is presented in fig 5 using et a derived from the flux tower the scatter plot shows an r2 of 0 80 and rmse of 1 38 between the derived and simulated daily et a during the crop growing season using penman monteith for the calculation of et o the r2 is 0 78 while the rmse is 1 17 when the hargreaves and samani equation is implemented this shows that the comparison between measured and modelled data agrees well with zhang et al 2016 who reported an r2 of 0 549 between flux tower derived et to modis et product the relationship between the soil water content based on the daily values calculated from swedims and the values measured at the icos station of lanna for different depths is presented in fig 6 the calculated soil water content refers to the value within the crop root depth max 1 m and is based on the water balance for the grid cell of 2 5 km 2 5 km resolution of the gridded input data of str√•ng and mesan containing the agricultural station good agreement is observed between the measured and simulated values especially with the soil water content at 0 3 m depth it must be pointed out that in the simulations of the soil water content capillarity was not included moreover it is worth noting two important aspects first the calculation of the soil water content was performed by assuming that the soil water content at the beginning of the simulations was at field capacity second the field capacity is extracted by a gridded product global soil data task group 2000 that cannot accurately represent the heterogeneity of soil properties at field level the results of the crop yield validation at the agricultural research station of lanna are depicted in fig 7 the crop yield simulated with the model used in this study was compared with the crop yield retrieved from the station s principal investigator weslien 2020 and statistics sweden 2018 the harvest at the station was approximately 5 t ha as reported by weslien 2020 the oat yield from statistics sweden 2018 refers to the 2018 county level oat yield in v√§stra g√∂taland county which the lanna research station belongs to the simulation results in fig 7 show very good agreement especially with the county level average yield considering that the current version of the model runs at a resolution of 2 5 km 2 5 km and may not provide accurate crop yield estimations at the field level due to the heterogeneity of the required input parameters in particular the model is sensitive to parameters such as planting date lai and soil moisture as fig 7 shows the yield generated from the model using lai data assimilation with optimization s3 lai as carried out by novelli et al 2019 and wagner et al 2020 provides the most accurate results as compared to the actual measured yield the percentage errors as compared to the measured crop yield and the county level statistics are 2 and 10 6 respectively those results agree with results presented by wagner et al 2020 that demonstrated the superiority of the optimization method as compared to simple updating the authors also demonstrated that the optimization approach could lead to similar or even improved results as compared to more advanced data assimilation algorithms such as extended kalman filter updating the lai curve after optimization of the shape key parameters and the lai data from cgls are depicted in fig 8 the crop yield simulations using the default crop parameters as in williams et al 1989 show similar results as providing simple updates of lai values from cgls fig 7 similar accurate results could be obtained by updating the planting date using the values reported in morel et al 2021 the lai data from cgls comes with a five day delay in an operational system this could lead to some inaccuracies in estimating water use for irrigation and crop yield i e the potential biomass accumulation this aspect is not investigated in this study but will be assessed in future experimental studies balkoviƒç et al 2013 reported similar yields for oat in their comprehensive epic multi crop simulation across europe foltescu 2000 also reported similar yields by running the wofost crop model using mesan climatological parameters as input the et a and soil moisture models validation has been performed only at one location and for one crop for 2018 the icos network that provides open source data had only one flux tower on agricultural land in sweden https www icos sweden se lanna in 2018 currently that flux tower has been closed at the end of 2020 the current operating stations can be found at https www icos sweden se stations other flux towers belonging to the icos network are installed on other type of ecosystems such as wetland and forest to make up for the lack of data our research group is establishing an experimental facility where we compare crop yields in open field conditions as well under agrivoltaic systems this is connected to the project evaluation of the first agrivoltaic system in sweden m√§lardalen university 2022 in future studies we will use the data gathered by the monitoring system including distributed soil moisture and temperature sensors and micro lysimeters and crop yield experiments to further validate the model presented in this study 3 2 irrigation water productivity and crop model validation the results of the iwp kg m3 for the investigated irrigation scenarios are summarized in fig 9 for 2018 and in fig 10 for 2019 the irrigation guidelines provided by the model developed in this study show the highest values of iwp in most of the considered grids for both 2018 and 2019 the scenarios s2 irrigation static 100 and s3 irrigation static 150 derived from bergstr√∂m and barkefors 2004 and from the swedish board of agriculture 2007 show lower iwp values both in 2018 and 2019 as compared to scenarios s2 and s3 irrigation the guidelines provided by the developed spatially explicit model show higher water volumes for irrigation i e negative water savings in fig 11 but maintain higher iwp values in most of the grids as fig 9 shows in 2018 the proposed irrigation management system could lead to water savings mostly of between 75 and 40 as compared to s2 irrigation static 100 and of between 55 and 10 as compared to s3 irrigation static 150 as depicted in fig 11 left nevertheless by analyzing the crop yield increase of scenario s1 irrigation et as compared to scenarios s2 irrigation static 100 and s3 irrigation static 150 see fig 11 right it can be easily noted that crop yield increase from the proposed irrigation management system vary between 10 and 60 as compared to conventional irrigation guidelines most of the input data for irrigation management vary temporally and spatially making spatially explicit guidelines fundamental meanwhile with intensifying climate changes and more frequent extreme weather events in recent years such as the severe drought of 2018 it becomes more difficult to apply typical meteorological year guidelines based on past experiences melton et al 2012 by analyzing the results concerning water savings and crop yield increase for 2019 a more typical meteorological year as compared to 2018 depicted in fig 12 we see that most of the water savings range between 20 and 80 as compared to scenario s2 irrigation static 100 and between 20 and 100 as compared to scenario s3 irrigation static 150 even in 2019 by assuming static guidelines the crop yield increase of scenario s1 irrigation et ranges between 5 30 as compared to the scenarios based upon conventional irrigation guidelines those modelling results align with the results from johnson et al 2016 a further model run for scenario s1 irrigation et was performed using a threshold k s value of 0 6 i e irrigation is performed only when the water stress coefficient reaches a value of 0 6 the results are summarized in fig 13 as can be seen scenario s1 irrigation et and scenario s3 irrigation static 150 suggest similar applied irrigation volumes e g the irrigation volumes for s1 irrigation et are mostly distributed between 100 and 160 mm nevertheless the resulting crop yields for scenario s1 irrigation et are significantly higher than for scenario s3 irrigation due to better irrigation scheduling this further support the superiority of spatially explicitly et c driven guidelines as compared to conventional non spatially and non temporally driven irrigation guidelines et c driven irrigation was also acknowledged by ko and piccinni 2009 as one of the efficient irrigation schemes for achieving higher water use efficiency for growing corn in texas similar hanson and putnam 2000 pointed out that water consumption in irrigation for alfalfa in california can be reduced through improved irrigation scheduling by considering dynamic variation of et c and soil moisture the authors also investigated the effects of deficit irrigation and pointed out that further water savings in irrigation can be achieved by reducing or avoiding irrigation during those periods when the crop yield per water applied is minimal similar conclusions for maximizing alfalfa water use efficiency in the great plains and intermountain were achieved by lindenmayer et al 2011 in 2018 the crop yield reduction due to temperature stress was up to 30 as compared to the ideal case without temperature stress as depicted in fig 14 the results refer to two cases no irrigation and s1 irrigation et since the wfe nexus also represents a framework for innovations and technologies for sustainable natural resources management an important technology that could be integrated in the agricultural and irrigation sector to reduce the impacts of water and temperature stresses on crops is agrivoltaic i e the combination of photovoltaic systems and crop production in the same area agrivoltaic systems as well as photovoltaic water pumping systems for irrigation can simultaneously address the interactions among water energy and food due to shade cast on crops amaducci et al 2018 demonstrated that agrivoltaic systems with an optimal density of pv modules can increase crop yields due to their ability to maintain higher levels of soil moisture in italy similarly barron gafford et al 2019 showed that the combination of pv systems with farm activities could lead to reduced drought impact and higher food yield in arizona at high latitudes like in sweden the tradeoffs between water and temperature stresses reductions which can lead to increased crop yields and par reductions due to the shadings produced by the pv modules which can negatively affect crop yields are worth of investigations the models and frameworks developed in this study combined with the optimization model for agrivoltaic systems presented in campana et al 2021 can be a starting point to investigate the effects deployment of agrivoltaic systems to support the irrigation sector on large scale the validation of the potatoes crop model for the selected counties in sweden is presented in figs 15 16 for 2018 and 2019 respectively using county level statistics statistics sweden 2022b we have assumed a 20 dry matter weight to reconcile fresh matter and dry matter data both for 2018 and 2019 the statistics available for sk√•ne and blekinge concerning the average potato yield are comprised between the average crop yield simulated under no irrigation and irrigation scenarios the variation between crop yield under the no irrigation and irrigation scenarios is significantly reduced in 2019 as compared to 2018 due the absence of an extreme weather phenomena hitting the region those last results confirm the robustness of the model unfortunately in sweden only county level statistics are available and no statistics differentiate between irrigated and non irrigated crop yields as for instance in the united states of america usda 2022 more detailed statistics and methods like irrmapper ketchum et al 2020 a machine learning based model for mapping irrigation status at high spatial resolution could be used to further validate the simulated crop yield at county or sub county levels for irrigated and non irrigated areas the potential crop yields under irrigation regimes also agrees with the values reported in ekel√∂f et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 2018 and jennings et al 2020 3 3 energy consumption and further developments energy consumptions in the irrigation sector for the different scenarios as defined in table 5 are depicted in figs 17 and 18 the scenario s1 energy shows an energy consumption in the order of ten times higher than the best case scenario s2 energy this is due to the combination of efficiencies in the modelling chain water resources depth and other parameters see table 5 while these results might not significantly affect a single farmer due to the current low electricity prices in sweden eurostat 2021 it might substantially affect the regional energy systems in terms of matching electricity supply and demand this mismatch at a larger scale i e not at farm level but on a regional level might lead to spikes in the electricity prices due to higher demands that can afterwards affect farmers and more generally all the electricity buyers moreover this is likely to happen during extreme droughts events and or for long term negative climate changes that typically put pressure on energy systems in particular on hydropower and thermal energy conversion plants riksbanken 2018 from a wfe nexus perspective the results in figs 17 and 18 are important in broader energy and water contexts to better understand the wfe nexus with an integrated approach the model presented in this study will be further developed to analyze other key sectors such as the agricultural sector as a whole i e not only the irrigation sector as in this study industrial power commercial and residential sectors the developed model will be able to study spatially explicit water and energy demand and supply at high temporal resolution which will enable the identification of potential energy demand and supply mismatches especially during extreme events and or using climate change scenarios data the integration of such a model with a hydrological model will also allow to identify potential water supply and demand mismatches spatially and temporally and thus better allocate water resources 3 4 the irrigation management service interface a screenshot of the demonstrator for the irrigation management service interface is provided in fig 19 where the users can view the daily et o maps for all of sweden once all the data are retrieved from the server the maps can be visualized with a time dimension by using the time slider by specifying the field evapotranspiration cities the users can also view and download daily based time series of et o and precipitation data for the selected locations across the country fig 20 the locations for which it is possible to retrieve the et o and precipitation time series appear on the map the data on et o and precipitation can be used as a starting point for more accurate assessment of specific crop water requirements using the fao guidelines allen et al 1998 moreover by assimilating lai observations as described in sections 2 2 and 3 1 and other satellite derived parameters the current version of the model could be further expanded to specifically cover the most irrigated crops in the country providing timely guidelines for farmers by integrating et o maps with maps of irrigation areas and water resource depths and availabilities water and energy management agency managers could have a better view of potential water and energy consumption from the irrigation sector the developed interface demonstrator can provide large scale and cost effective irrigation management services and decision support in both developed and developing countries especially in those areas with significant water and food security issues 4 conclusions this study aimed to develop a demonstrator of operational water food energy nexus system for the irrigation sector in sweden focusing on the interrelationships between water and energy requirements for irrigation and corresponding crop yield response the 2018 drought that severely hit sweden is used as the case study the results are compared with 2019 a more typical meteorological year as compared to 2018 the main conclusions from this study are the following the use of the penman monteith equation instead of the hargreaves and samani equation for estimating the crop reference evapotranspiration shows slightly better results in the modelling chain for estimating oats yield 0 11 t ha difference at lanna in 2018 despite the higher performances of penman monteith equation it requires significantly more input data as compared to the hargreaves and samani s model this demonstrates that the implementation of hargreaves and samani equation could provide a good trade off between accuracy and complexity for an operational service by assimilating through optimization the leaf area index from copernicus global land service into the crop model the model presents the best results while comparing the simulated crop yield with the measured crop yield at the lanna icos station the irrigation water productivity using the developed model shows better results as compared to irrigation scenarios based on existing static and non spatially explicit guidelines both in 2018 and in 2019 during the drought year 2018 the developed model showed no irrigation water savings as compared to conventional irrigation guidelines nevertheless the crop yield increase from the proposed irrigation management system varied between 10 and 60 as compared to conventional irrigation guidelines in 2019 most of the water savings ranged between 20 i e increased irrigation water volume as compared to static guidelines and 80 with crop yield increases ranging between 5 i e decreased crop yield and 30 those modelling results align with previous studies on implementing large scale irrigation management services in the united states of america the modelling result shows a significant reduction in crop yield of up to 30 due to temperature stress as compared to the ideal case in which temperature stress is absent this connected to the high water stress in 2018 might justify the implementation of technologies that can mitigate the negative effects of weather extremes e g drought and climate changes on water food energy nexus interrelationships the developed demonstrator based on an open source package for google earth can be easily implemented to help farmers and water and energy management agencies to better understand the water energy and food interrelationships and make informed decisions especially during the occurrence of extreme events the developed demonstrator interface can provide large scale and cost effective irrigation management services and decision support in both developed and developing countries in future studies the proposed model will be extended to other key sectors such as the power and industrial sector
