16965,methane bioconversion to value added liquid chemicals has been proposed as a promising solution to augment the petroleum dominated chemical market recent investigations have reported that various electron acceptors e g nitrite and nitrate are available to drive methane bioconversion to short chain fatty acids scfas however little is known about effects of the rate electron acceptor supplied on liquid chemical production from methane herein three independent membrane biofilm reactors mbfrs feeding with respective nitrate nitrite combined nitrate and nitrite were operated under high and low rate condition in succession to study whether feeding rate of electron acceptors could impact the methane bioconversion to scfas and the associated microbiological features long term operation showed that all tested electron acceptors with a high supply rate were favorable for methane bioconversion to scfas 990 9 mg l 1d 1 1695 7 mg l 1d 1 and 2425 7 mg l 1d 1 while under a low electron acceptor feeding rate the scfa production rate decreased to 8 9 mg l 1d 1 16 8 mg l 1d 1 and 260 1 mg l 1d 1 respectively microbial community characterization showed that the biofilm was predominated by methanosarcina methanobacterium propionispora and clostridium on the basis of the known metabolism characteristics of these microorganisms it was assumed that these methanogens and fermenters contributed jointly to methane bioconversion to scfas the findings could be helpful to understand the role of electron acceptor rate in methane bioconversion to liquid chemicals graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane electron acceptor membrane biofilm reactor mbfr short chain fatty acids scfas gas to liquid 1 introduction increasing concerns over the excessive exploitation of nonrenewable crude oil reserves have aroused worldwide research on the development of alternative feedstocks for chemical production yang et al 2019 methane the main component of nature gas is particularly well suited as a feedstock for producing value added chemicals because of its easily available hydrocarbon chen et al 2019 large scale availability globally nature gas reserves was estimated at 7 2 103 trillion ft3 kuuskraa et al 2013 and low cost cantera et al 2018 traditional technology accomplishes methane utilization by reforming it to syngas and subsequent conversion to liquid chemicals through the fischer tropsch pathway dieterich et al 2020 however the requirement of high temperature 150 300 c and high pressure 100 kpa 5 mpa in the presence of expensive catalysts usually induces an increase in operational cost haynes and gonzalez 2014 wood et al 2012 making the technology not economically feasible for small distributed and squandered methane sources microbial methane oxidation is a promising process that could produce a diverse spectrum of valuable products such as short and long chain fatty acids e g formate and polymers cantera et al 2017 it has been demonstrated that aerobic methanotrophs could convert methane to valuable products garg et al 2018 gilman et al 2015 henard et al 2016 kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 by activating the strong ch bond with enzyme pmmo smmo particulate soluble methane monooxygenases conrado et al 2014 alsayed et al 2018 crowther et al 2008 until now although various strategies e g the addition of microbial supplements and nutrients and altering the nitrogen concentration have been proposed to facilitate its industrial potential kalyuzhnaya et al 2020 the routine of methane bioconversion to liquid chemicals through aerobic methane oxidation is suffering the relatively low energy and carbon efficiencies due to the loss of electrons to o2 and loss of carbon to co2 during the activation of ch bond haynes and gonzalez 2014 compared to aerobic methane oxidation anaerobic methane oxidation could overcome the carbon and energy efficiency barriers related to oxygen dependent processes and thus regarded as a viable solution for methane bioconversion bennett et al 2018 mueller et al 2015 from the view of thermodynamics anaerobic methane oxidation is not feasible in the absence of electron acceptor hence current studies have been focusing on evaluation of different electron acceptors for process intensification for example the potential of various electron acceptors fe iii nitrate nitrite sulfate and mn iv on a metabolically engineered methanogen methanosarcina acetivorans for methane and co2 conversion was investigated in soo et al 2016 in which an acetate production rate of 0 62 g l d was obtained with 10 mm fe iii in addition to pure cultures the enriched mixed culture dominated by nitrate dependent anaerobic methanotrophic archaeon candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens haroon et al 2013 which is able to convert methane to acetate via the entire reverse methanogenesis pathway however the acetate production rate was only 38 4 mg l 1d 1 when nitrate or nitrite was fed as the electron acceptor at a rate limiting condition cai et al 2019 which was too low to meet the economically viable requirement very recently the individual role of nitrate nitrite and oxygen in methane conversion to scfas was further explored in membrane biofilm reactors mbfrs results showed that all tested electron acceptors were beneficial for acetate production at a rate ranging from 1 1 to 114 6 mg d 1 m 2 of biofilm chen et al 2019 this previous study also highlighted it might be more flexible to employ the oxygen limiting condition to convert methane to scfas in mbfrs moreover it was observed that the variation of acetate production rate was attributed to completely different microbial communities shaped by the respective reactors fed with different electron acceptors chen et al 2019 although these previous studies cai et al 2019 chen et al 2019 have investigated the impacts of various electron acceptors on methane bioconversion to liquid chemicals it is little known about whether the feeding rate of electron acceptors plays a role in production rates of liquid chemicals from methane bioconversion this work aimed to evaluate effects of electron acceptor feeding rate on methane bioconversion to liquid chemicals specifically the impacts of nitrate nitrite combined nitrate and nitrite feeding rates on the production of scfas acetate propionate butyrate valerate and hexanoate were first evaluated by operating three independent mbfrs afterwards microbial communities in mbfrs fed with different electron acceptors and various feeding rates were revealed through high throughput 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing in addition the potential functional groups that contributed to methane bioconversion to scfa production were also characterized and discussed the findings could be facilitated to further development of methane based biotechnology for enhancing value added chemical production 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor set up and inoculation three laboratory scale mbfrs with a working volume of 50 ml for each were established to carry out methane bioconversion into scfas under different feeding rates of electron acceptors the schematic diagram of the mbfr system fig 1 is as described in our previous study chen et al 2018 briefly the reactor tube had one bundle of composite bubbleless hollow fiber membranes 200 μm inner diameter and 300 μm outer diameter sterapore 2000 series mitsubishi rayon ltd japan the bundle made up by 64 fibers gave a membrane surface area of 2 41 10 3 m2 and a membrane surface reactor volume ratio of 48 m2 m3 all fibers were connected to a gas cylinder 95 methane and 5 co2 mixed gas coregas australia from one end and the other end of each fiber was sealed with glue the methane pressure in the interior of hollow fibers was controlled at 1 25 atm by gas pressure regulator ross brown australia for methane diffusion a 100 ml overflow bottle with a liquid volume of 25 ml was connected with the reactor tube for recirculating gas and liquid sampling and ph monitoring the mbfrs were inoculated with 25 ml sludge taken from a nitrate nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo parent bioreactor which was dominated by candidatus m nitroreducens and candidatus m oxyfera haroon et al 2013 2 2 long term reactor operation after the inoculation the mbfrs were subsequently operated as sequencing batch mode at 12 h per cycle and each cycle consisted of feeding and decanting 3 min reacting 712 min and settling 5 min phases chen et al 2018 in the feeding phase of each cycle 25 ml of inorganic fresh medium was added to the mbfr leading to an hrt of 24 h the bulk liquid in the mbfr was then recirculated through a peristaltic pump masterflex usa at a flow velocity of 12 5 ml min 1 each mbfr was operated for 628 days at room temperature 22 2 c and divided into two phases during phase i day 0 day 474 the three mbfrs named r1 r2 and r3 were fed with nitrate nitrite combined nitrate and nitrite at a rate of 400 mg n l 1d 1 200 mg n l 1d 1 100 mg n l 1d 1 and 120 mg n l 1d 1 respectively in phase ii day 474 day 628 the electron acceptors were feeding at a relatively low rate of 80 mg n l 1d 1 40 mg n l 1d 1 20 mg n l 1d 1 and 24 mg n l 1d 1 respectively according to the electron acceptor supply rate we classified phase i and ii as a high feeding rate and a low feeding rate respectively the ph in the mbfr was regulated between 7 0 and 7 5 by dosing 1 mol l 1 hcl or 2 mol l 1 naoh solutions manually every day the inorganic fresh medium fed into the mbfrs were made from tap water and contained 0 075 g l kh2po4 0 3 g l cacl2 2h2o 0 23 g l mgcl2 7h2o 0 5 ml l acidic trace element solution and 0 2 ml l alkaline trace element solution ettwig et al 2010 were also amended into the mbfrs the fresh medium was degassed with nitrogen for 30 min to maintain anaerobic condition before pumped into the mbfr 2 3 analytical methods during the operation of the three bioreactors both influent and effluent samples were collected from the mbfrs with 2 5 ml syringes three times per week and filtered via disposable millipore filter units pore size 0 22 μm for chemical analyses the nitrate and nitrite concentrations were analyzed by a lachat quickchem 8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wi high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu japan equipped with a bio rad hplc column 300 mm å 7 8 mm and a rid detector was employed to determine the composition and concentrations of scfas application of agilent 7890a to determine the dissolved methane concentration and the detailed measurement procedure were in the literature luo et al 2018 the ph level in the reactor was determined with a ph meter oakton australia the methane conversion efficiency of the three mbfrs operated under different electron feeding rates was calculated based on the cod balance as described in chen et al 2019 2 4 dna extraction and high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing biofilm samples were collected under the steady state of each phase specifically on day 345 for r1 and r2 day 447 for r3 in phase i and day 586 for r1 r2 and r3 in phase ii for all the three mbfrs to identify the microbial community in the reactors and their contributions on the scfa performance total genomic dna was extracted from the biofilm samples using the fastdna spin kit for soil kit mp biomedicals according to the manufacturer s protocol dna concentrations were quantified by nanodrop spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific wilmington de usa the 16s rrna gene sequencing and data processing were performed as described by chen et al 2018 in brief the universal primers set 926f 1392r were used to amplify the v6 v8 regions of archaea and bacterial 16s rrna gene and then the purified amplicons were sequenced on an illumina miseq platform illumina usa at the australian centre for ecogenomics brisbane australia after filtering short and low quality reads the operational taxonomic units otus with 97 similarity cutoff were clustered by qiime v1 8 0 quantitative insights into microbial ecology the taxonomic classification was generated via alignment of representative otu sequences against greengenes database to an otu table raw 16s rrna sequencing data are available on ncbi sequence read archive sra database under accession number srr14028220 to srr14028226 3 results 3 1 short chain fatty acid production performance of the methane based mbfrs three methane based mbfrs were operated in two phases over a period of 600 days including phase i high electron acceptor feeding rate and phase ii low electron acceptor feeding rate upon the initial 220 day cultivation in phase i biofilms grew gradually on the surface of hollow fiber and all the three bioreactors accomplished scfa production under the operational conditions tested then the scfa production performance was positively correlated with the electron acceptor feeding rate in this study as illustrated in fig 2 during phase i r1 with no3 n feeding rate of 400 mg l 1d 1 achieved a total scfa production rate of 141 5 mg l 1d 1 on day 222 fig 2a after a fluctuating period the total scfa production rate began to increase and the value steadily increased to 990 9 mg l 1d 1 on day 439 during the operational process no nitrate or nitrite was detected in effluent fig s1a the similar scfa production tendency was also reflected on r3 fig 2c with 100 mg l 1d 1 no3 n and 120 mg l 1d 1 no2 n as electron acceptor a total scfa production rate of 583 6 mg l 1d 1 was detected at the beginning while this value increased to the maximum of 2425 7 mg l 1d 1 on day 355 and then decreased and kept stable at 1267 5 mg l 1d 1 meanwhile the nitrate and nitrite were consumed completely fig s1c compared to r1 and r3 the performance of r2 feeding with 200 mg l 1d 1 no2 n was relatively different as shown in fig 2b the total scfa production rate reached to 1461 9 mg l 1d 1 on day 264 then the r2 suffered a breakdown on the 285 355 days of operation which attributed to the leakage of recirculation tubing of the mbfr after the problem fixed the scfa production rate recovered gradually and reached to 1695 7 mg l 1d 1 on day 397 interestingly the nitrite consumption was not affected by the accident and the effluent nitrite was always below the detection limit fig s1b the carbon utilization efficiency was estimated to be 96 4 161 5 and 154 8 table 1 in r1 r2 and r3 respectively the over 100 carbon conversion efficiency indicates the scfas might be also derived from other carbon matters which will be further discussed in the discussion section after running more than 470 days the operation of r1 r3 was switched to phase ii with decreasing the electron acceptor feeding rate to 80 mg no3 n l 1d 1 40 mg no2 n l 1d 1 20 mg no3 n l 1d 1 and 24 mg no2 n l 1d 1 respectively obviously the total scfa production rates of all the three mbfrs were sharply decreased in phase ii specifically the average scfa production rates were decreased to 8 9 mg l 1d 1 and 16 8 mg l 1d 1 for r1 and r2 respectively fig 2a b in comparation to r1 and r2 the scfa production rate within r3 reached to a much higher level of 260 1 mg l 1d 1 fig 2c meanwhile the supplied electron acceptor was all consumed in three mbfrs in which neither nitrate or nitrite was detected in effluent fig s1a c the performance of the three mbfrs collectively indicated that the scfa production was directly related to the electron acceptor feeding rate accordingly the carbon conversion efficiency at phase ii was decreased to 8 5 48 1 and 87 4 in r1 r2 and r3 respectively table 1 in addition it is worth noting that acetic acid and propionic acid as the two dominant components accounted for average 77 2 and 8 5 78 2 and 11 5 72 0 and 23 3 of the total scfas in r1 r2 and r3 respectively regardless of high or low electron acceptor feeding rate moreover c4 c6 acids were observed in both phases and the production rate increased with the rise of acetic and propionic acids therefore giving a maximum value of 72 8 mg l 1d 1 203 1 mg l 1d 1 and 128 4 mg l 1d 1 respectively at high nitrate nitrite and combined nitrate and nitrite feeding rate in phase i fig 3 a c 3 2 shift of microbial communities in the mbfrs in response to different conditions biofilm samples of each reactor were collected from the inoculum day 0 phase i day 345 for r1 and r2 day 447 for r3 and phase ii day 586 for r1 r2 and r3 for characterizing microbial community compositions using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing fig 3a shows the relative proportions of phylotypes evolved in the consortium of biofilm at phylum level planctomycetes euryarchaeota and the nc10 phylum dominated in the inoculum when electron accepter was fed at a high feeding rate in phase i phylotype affiliated to proteobacteria dominated in the biofilms while the abundance of planctomycetes and the nc10 reduced to undetectable level meanwhile phylotypes closely related to euryarchaeota were enriched in r1 while bacteroidetes were enriched in r2 and r3 respectively in phase ii proteobacteria kept the first dominant phylotype in the three mbfrs but the relative abundance increased apparently compared to that in phase i based on the pca analysis fig s2 the biofilm samples of r1 exhibited distinctions of microbial community structure compared with that of r2 and r3 nevertheless the individual microbial community structure of r1 r2 and r3 under different operational phases was more similar to each other these results suggest that the feeding of different electron acceptors exhibited a greater effect on shaping microbial communities rather than the electron acceptor feeding rate the relative abundance of the most abundant genera in the three mbfrs under different phases is given in fig 4 b candidatus methanoperedens and candidatus methylomirabilis which are known for coupling methane oxidation with nitrate or nitrite reduction ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 respectively accounted for 21 0 and 11 6 of the inoculum while both of them became undetectable in the biofilms the absence of these n damo microorganisms in the biofilms indicated that they might not be involved in both methane oxidation or nitrate nitrite reduction in three mbfrs instead of anaerobic methanotrophs methanogens were detected in the three mbfrs during both phases specifically in r1 the total abundance of methanosarcina and methanobacterium reached 21 8 in phase i and decreased to 12 7 in phase ii yet they were not detected in the inoculum the similar phenomenon was also reflected in r2 and r3 the predominant methanogen genera were still methanosarcina and methanobacterium in r2 with an abundance of 2 5 and 3 6 in phase i which decreased to 0 2 and 0 9 in phase ii respectively meanwhile the proportion of methanogens in r3 was decreased from 4 5 to 0 08 the abundance variation of these methane related archaea was in accordance with the production performance of scfas indicating that these microorganisms may participate in activate methane oxidation for scfa production in addition to methanogens various fermenters with relatively high abundance were detected in all the mbfrs in r1 propionispora dysgonomonas and propionicimonas which were capable of fermenting organics to produce scfas cai et al 2021 lazaro et al 2012 sugawara et al 2011 accounted for 2 5 6 4 of the total sequences in phase i and decreased to 1 3 5 5 in phase ii in accordance with the scfa production profiles moreover fermenters with the dominant genera dysgonomonas and propionispora in r2 accounted for up to 18 1 of the total reads in phase i and decreased to 14 3 in phase ii which also provides a possible explanation for the observation of acetic and propionic acid production trajectory in this mbfr with the highest scfa production rate obtained in r3 diverse microorganisms capable of producing acids such as propionispora dysgonomonas and propionicimonas accounted for 24 3 of the whole community in total in phase i and decreased to 17 4 in phase ii in addition it is interesting to note that clostridium which has been reported as the typical bacteria to ferment organic compounds to produce acetate chua et al 2013 jeon et al 2010 was not detected in either the inoculum or r1 and r2 while increased to 11 3 in phase i and then fade out in phase ii in r3 the evolution of acid producing bacteria in relation to the scfa production performance suggested that scfas might be produced by fermenters furthermore several genera that are known as denitrifiers were detected in the biofilms for example dechloromonas azospira comamonas and pseudomonas with an abundance of 1 6 4 7 were detected in r1 during phase i the relative abundance of dechloromonas and azospira increased from 4 8 and 3 6 to 8 8 and 7 7 respectively from phase i to phase ii pseudomonas which is not detected in the inoculum while it increased to 2 6 in phase i and remained at 2 3 in phase ii compared to r1 the replacement of electron acceptor from nitrate to nitrite influenced the variety of denitrifiers pseudomonas of 1 3 could be still detected in r2 while dechloromonas and azospira were not the predominant genera anymore in terms of 1 6 and 0 5 relative abundance differently the relative abundance of desulfovibrionaceae and comamonas increased to 6 8 and 1 6 in phase ii in r2 when r3 was feeding with a mixture of high nitrate and nitrite rate at the beginning microbial community structure of biofilm samples was in general similar with r2 except that the abundance of pseudomonas increased significantly p 0 05 from 4 2 phase i to 18 0 phase ii 4 discussion 4 1 roles of potential functional microorganisms in methane driven scfa production a key step in microbial methane conversion is methane activation coupling with electron accepting pathway it has been previously reported that methane bioconversion to scfas could be achieved in the mbfr when nitrate nitrite or oxygen served as electron acceptors chen et al 2019 2018 however the effects of electron acceptor feeding rate on methane bioconversion to scfas have not been systematically investigated so far this study revealed that the electron acceptor feeding rate could affect the performance of scfas produced from methane the highest scfa production rate was 990 9 mg l 1d 1 1695 7 mg l 1d 1 and 2425 7 mg l 1d 1 respectively which was obtained in phase i with a high electron acceptor feeding rate these rates were substantially higher than those obtained 8 9 mg l 1d 1 16 8 mg l 1d 1 and 260 1 mg l 1d 1 under low electron acceptor supply condition in phase ii the results collectively suggest that methane bioconversion to scfas can be manipulated by the electron acceptor feeding rate theoretically when methane is sufficiently supplied more scfas should be produced with more electron acceptors provided this is consistent with our experimental results where a higher scfa production rate was obtained at higher electron acceptor feeding rate it should be noted that this study only tested two different electron acceptor feeding rates high rate in phase i and low rate in phase ii the appropriate electron acceptor feeding rate for methane bioconversion to scfas still needs to be optimized and validated from a thermodynamic perspective in the reaction of methane oxidation with nitrite nitrate as the electron acceptor co2 is a more favourable end product according to a more negative gibbs free energy g0 3ch4 8no2 8h 3co2 4n2 10h2o g0 928 kj mol ch4 4no3 co2 4no2 2h2o g0 503 kj mol however the reactions in the mbfrs might occur under a more complex condition which might be favourable for scfas being as the terminal products during methane oxidation although g0 was smaller for methane bioconversion to scfas e g 10ch4 8no3 8h 5ch3cooh 4n2 14h2o g0 392 9 kj mol 6ch4 8no2 8h 3ch3cooh 4n2 10h2o g0 498 6 kj mol in addition the syntrophic microorganisms in the mbfrs are capable of sharing the residual energy efficiently of each partial reaction therefore enabling to support an energetically less favorable reactions taupp et al 2010 in comparison with previous research that the process of methane bioconversion to scfas was accomplished via either the n damo process or aerobic partial methane oxidation cai et al 2019 chen et al 2019 kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 soo et al 2016 no known n damo microorganisms or aerobic methanotrophs were found in the biofilms indicating a different scfa production pathway from those reported previously the known methane related microorganisms detected in the mbfrs feeding with different electron acceptors were methanosarcina and methanobacterium which are known as methanogens that are capable of producing methane from h2 co2 or organic compounds however methanobacterium and methanosarcina also harbor reverse methanogenesis pathway enabling the oxidation of trace amounts of methane in the absence of external electron acceptors yan et al 2018 which was recognized as trace methane oxidation tmo moran et al 2007 timmers et al 2017 taking into account of the positive correlation between the abundance of methanogens and the scfa production in all the three mbfrs it is speculated that methanogens might have been involved in stimulating methane oxidation on the other hand we cannot completely rule out the possibility that these methane related microorganisms might be anaerobic methane oxidation anme microbes given the difficulty to distinguish methanogens and anme in terms of 16s rrna gene evans et al 2019 further experiments should be conducted to determine how methane oxidation pathways in methanogens are activated similar to what has been reported in chen et al 2018 firmicutes and bacteroidetes members propionispora dysgonomonas propionicimonas and clostridium which are the predominant acid producing bacteria were detected in all the three mbfrs the relative abundance of these fermenters increased with the increasing scfa production rate in particular the relative abundance of clostridium was very high 11 3 in r3 where the highest scfa production rate was obtained these results suggest that the variation of scfa production should be attributed to the presence of fermenters in the mbfr a few previous studies focusing on the biological scfa production process have also documented that these fermenters harbor putative capability for scfa production for example they could produce acetic and propionic acids from organic carbons such as polysaccharides and proteins under anaerobic condition lee et al 2014 ma et al 2019 rao et al 2018 however there was no evidence showing that fermenters are capable of utilize methane as the carbon source so far therefore substrate for these fermenters was probably generated by microorganisms via direct or indirect methane utilization with the presence of available electron acceptors i e nitrate and nitrite and organics i e scfas in the mbfrs the abundance of heterotrophic denitrifiers dechloromonas azospira and pseudomonas detected in r1 exhibited a negative correlation with the nitrate feeding rate and the scfa production rate similar phenomena were also observed in r2 and r3 which were fed with nitrite or combined nitrate and nitrite as electron acceptor respectively when both scfas and nitrate nitrite co existed in the mbfr heterotrophic denitrifiers could easily be enriched to consume scfas thus playing a negative role in scfa production however previous studies also reported that heterotrophic denitrifiers e g pseudomonas azospira and comamonas could generate intracellular e g glycogen and polyhydroxyalkanoates or extracellular compounds e g extracellular polymeric substances liu et al 2019 myszka and czaczyk 2009 su et al 2020 ye et al 2011 which could be utilized as potential substrates for fermenters further studies are required to confirm the roles of heterotrophic denitrifiers in scfa production in these mbfrs moreover it should be noteworthy that the carbon efficiencies in phase i were 96 161 5 and 154 8 in r1 r2 and r3 respectively more than 100 of carbon efficiency was also observed by chen et al 2019 this indicates that other carbon sources might participate in scfa production or the scfa production was accomplished via indirect methane utilization based on the long term scfa production performance and microbial community structure analysis it is speculated that synergistic interactions among multiple microorganisms might be responsible for methane bioconversion to scfa production methanogens are the microorganisms that most likely to trigger methane in the mbfr and may be involved in the production of scfas meanwhile fermenters seem to be the main contributor to scfas but it remains unknow about whether the carbon source was derived from intermediates produced by methanogens or other microorganisms in order to illustrate the roles of respective microorganisms in methane bioconversion and unravel the underlying mechanism of methane conversion to scfas further verification by direct methane consumption measurement qualitative and quantitative analysis on reserved carbon isotope labeling of 13c ch4 metagenomics and metatranscriptomics of biofilm samples should be conducted in the future 4 2 implications of the study recently there has been increasing interest in the field of microbial methane conversion to value added liquid chemicals as pointed out by kalyuzhnaya et al 2020 a well balanced microbial consortium is crucial for efficient valuable product generation additions of carbon sources nutrients electron acceptors additives and altering the partial pressure of methane are proposed as effective options for facilitating microbial interactions and improving liquid chemical productions pieja et al 2017 under aerobic conditions inhibitors such as edta nacl and mgcl2 were added to achieve methane partial oxidation for chemical production from aerobic methanotrophs with o2 as electron acceptor han et al 2013 hur et al 2017 hwang et al 2015 although anaerobic methane oxidation could be catalyzed by anaerobic methanotrophs with the reduction of electron acceptors e g sulfate nitrate nitrite and metal oxides fe iii and mn iv cai et al 2018 ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 leu et al 2020 scheller et al 2016 there is lack of experimental evidence that these microorganisms could produce chemicals from methane directly for example chen et al 2019 investigated the individual role of nitrate nitrite and oxygen in the mbfr inoculated with consortium dominated by candidatus m nitroreducens and candidatus m oxyfera for methane bioconversion to scfas microbial characterization revealed that acetate might be produced by candidatus methanoperedens and candidatus methylomirabilis at stressful conditions such as nitrate nitrite nitrate and nitrite limitation chen et al 2019 cai et al 2019 further confirmed that candidatus m nitroreducens dominated mixed culture was capable of produce acetate via intracellular storage compounds that generated from methane under nitrate nitrite limiting conditions indicating an alternative methane bioconversion to liquid chemicals approach by controlling the electron acceptors feeding rate this present study and chen et al 2019 reported methanogens and acid producing microorganisms might have participated cooperatively to produce scfas the selection of electron acceptors or their feeding rate can play a critical role in regulating scfa production moreover the detection of c4 c6 acids were produced which are well known as valuable commodity and important building blocks suggesting a potential to increase the additional value of methane 5 conclusions this present study evaluated the effects of electron acceptor feeding rate on scfa production in methane based mbfrs and revealed the interactions of functional microorganisms and their contributions to methane bioconversion to scfas the key conclusions of this research are drawn as follows 1 with the high feeding rate of nitrate nitrite combined nitrate and nitrite as electron acceptor the scfa production rate reached the highest of 990 9 mg l 1d 1 1695 7 mg l 1d 1 and 2425 7 mg l 1d 1 respectively by contrast decreasing the electron acceptor feeding rate to a low level would result in deceasing scfa production rate to 8 9 mg l 1d 1 16 8 mg l 1d 1 and 260 1 mg l 1d 1 respectively 2 the characterization of microbial communities in response to different electron feeding rates revealed that methanogens and fermenters participated cooperatively to scfa production the detailed pathways about methane bioconversion to scfas should be revealed in the future 3 the findings obtained in this work might deepen our understanding regarding the impacts of electron acceptor feeding rate on methane bioconversion to scfas and could be helpful to develop strategies to enhance value added chemical production from methane declaration

16965,methane bioconversion to value added liquid chemicals has been proposed as a promising solution to augment the petroleum dominated chemical market recent investigations have reported that various electron acceptors e g nitrite and nitrate are available to drive methane bioconversion to short chain fatty acids scfas however little is known about effects of the rate electron acceptor supplied on liquid chemical production from methane herein three independent membrane biofilm reactors mbfrs feeding with respective nitrate nitrite combined nitrate and nitrite were operated under high and low rate condition in succession to study whether feeding rate of electron acceptors could impact the methane bioconversion to scfas and the associated microbiological features long term operation showed that all tested electron acceptors with a high supply rate were favorable for methane bioconversion to scfas 990 9 mg l 1d 1 1695 7 mg l 1d 1 and 2425 7 mg l 1d 1 while under a low electron acceptor feeding rate the scfa production rate decreased to 8 9 mg l 1d 1 16 8 mg l 1d 1 and 260 1 mg l 1d 1 respectively microbial community characterization showed that the biofilm was predominated by methanosarcina methanobacterium propionispora and clostridium on the basis of the known metabolism characteristics of these microorganisms it was assumed that these methanogens and fermenters contributed jointly to methane bioconversion to scfas the findings could be helpful to understand the role of electron acceptor rate in methane bioconversion to liquid chemicals graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane electron acceptor membrane biofilm reactor mbfr short chain fatty acids scfas gas to liquid 1 introduction increasing concerns over the excessive exploitation of nonrenewable crude oil reserves have aroused worldwide research on the development of alternative feedstocks for chemical production yang et al 2019 methane the main component of nature gas is particularly well suited as a feedstock for producing value added chemicals because of its easily available hydrocarbon chen et al 2019 large scale availability globally nature gas reserves was estimated at 7 2 103 trillion ft3 kuuskraa et al 2013 and low cost cantera et al 2018 traditional technology accomplishes methane utilization by reforming it to syngas and subsequent conversion to liquid chemicals through the fischer tropsch pathway dieterich et al 2020 however the requirement of high temperature 150 300 c and high pressure 100 kpa 5 mpa in the presence of expensive catalysts usually induces an increase in operational cost haynes and gonzalez 2014 wood et al 2012 making the technology not economically feasible for small distributed and squandered methane sources microbial methane oxidation is a promising process that could produce a diverse spectrum of valuable products such as short and long chain fatty acids e g formate and polymers cantera et al 2017 it has been demonstrated that aerobic methanotrophs could convert methane to valuable products garg et al 2018 gilman et al 2015 henard et al 2016 kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 by activating the strong ch bond with enzyme pmmo smmo particulate soluble methane monooxygenases conrado et al 2014 alsayed et al 2018 crowther et al 2008 until now although various strategies e g the addition of microbial supplements and nutrients and altering the nitrogen concentration have been proposed to facilitate its industrial potential kalyuzhnaya et al 2020 the routine of methane bioconversion to liquid chemicals through aerobic methane oxidation is suffering the relatively low energy and carbon efficiencies due to the loss of electrons to o2 and loss of carbon to co2 during the activation of ch bond haynes and gonzalez 2014 compared to aerobic methane oxidation anaerobic methane oxidation could overcome the carbon and energy efficiency barriers related to oxygen dependent processes and thus regarded as a viable solution for methane bioconversion bennett et al 2018 mueller et al 2015 from the view of thermodynamics anaerobic methane oxidation is not feasible in the absence of electron acceptor hence current studies have been focusing on evaluation of different electron acceptors for process intensification for example the potential of various electron acceptors fe iii nitrate nitrite sulfate and mn iv on a metabolically engineered methanogen methanosarcina acetivorans for methane and co2 conversion was investigated in soo et al 2016 in which an acetate production rate of 0 62 g l d was obtained with 10 mm fe iii in addition to pure cultures the enriched mixed culture dominated by nitrate dependent anaerobic methanotrophic archaeon candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens haroon et al 2013 which is able to convert methane to acetate via the entire reverse methanogenesis pathway however the acetate production rate was only 38 4 mg l 1d 1 when nitrate or nitrite was fed as the electron acceptor at a rate limiting condition cai et al 2019 which was too low to meet the economically viable requirement very recently the individual role of nitrate nitrite and oxygen in methane conversion to scfas was further explored in membrane biofilm reactors mbfrs results showed that all tested electron acceptors were beneficial for acetate production at a rate ranging from 1 1 to 114 6 mg d 1 m 2 of biofilm chen et al 2019 this previous study also highlighted it might be more flexible to employ the oxygen limiting condition to convert methane to scfas in mbfrs moreover it was observed that the variation of acetate production rate was attributed to completely different microbial communities shaped by the respective reactors fed with different electron acceptors chen et al 2019 although these previous studies cai et al 2019 chen et al 2019 have investigated the impacts of various electron acceptors on methane bioconversion to liquid chemicals it is little known about whether the feeding rate of electron acceptors plays a role in production rates of liquid chemicals from methane bioconversion this work aimed to evaluate effects of electron acceptor feeding rate on methane bioconversion to liquid chemicals specifically the impacts of nitrate nitrite combined nitrate and nitrite feeding rates on the production of scfas acetate propionate butyrate valerate and hexanoate were first evaluated by operating three independent mbfrs afterwards microbial communities in mbfrs fed with different electron acceptors and various feeding rates were revealed through high throughput 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing in addition the potential functional groups that contributed to methane bioconversion to scfa production were also characterized and discussed the findings could be facilitated to further development of methane based biotechnology for enhancing value added chemical production 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor set up and inoculation three laboratory scale mbfrs with a working volume of 50 ml for each were established to carry out methane bioconversion into scfas under different feeding rates of electron acceptors the schematic diagram of the mbfr system fig 1 is as described in our previous study chen et al 2018 briefly the reactor tube had one bundle of composite bubbleless hollow fiber membranes 200 μm inner diameter and 300 μm outer diameter sterapore 2000 series mitsubishi rayon ltd japan the bundle made up by 64 fibers gave a membrane surface area of 2 41 10 3 m2 and a membrane surface reactor volume ratio of 48 m2 m3 all fibers were connected to a gas cylinder 95 methane and 5 co2 mixed gas coregas australia from one end and the other end of each fiber was sealed with glue the methane pressure in the interior of hollow fibers was controlled at 1 25 atm by gas pressure regulator ross brown australia for methane diffusion a 100 ml overflow bottle with a liquid volume of 25 ml was connected with the reactor tube for recirculating gas and liquid sampling and ph monitoring the mbfrs were inoculated with 25 ml sludge taken from a nitrate nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo parent bioreactor which was dominated by candidatus m nitroreducens and candidatus m oxyfera haroon et al 2013 2 2 long term reactor operation after the inoculation the mbfrs were subsequently operated as sequencing batch mode at 12 h per cycle and each cycle consisted of feeding and decanting 3 min reacting 712 min and settling 5 min phases chen et al 2018 in the feeding phase of each cycle 25 ml of inorganic fresh medium was added to the mbfr leading to an hrt of 24 h the bulk liquid in the mbfr was then recirculated through a peristaltic pump masterflex usa at a flow velocity of 12 5 ml min 1 each mbfr was operated for 628 days at room temperature 22 2 c and divided into two phases during phase i day 0 day 474 the three mbfrs named r1 r2 and r3 were fed with nitrate nitrite combined nitrate and nitrite at a rate of 400 mg n l 1d 1 200 mg n l 1d 1 100 mg n l 1d 1 and 120 mg n l 1d 1 respectively in phase ii day 474 day 628 the electron acceptors were feeding at a relatively low rate of 80 mg n l 1d 1 40 mg n l 1d 1 20 mg n l 1d 1 and 24 mg n l 1d 1 respectively according to the electron acceptor supply rate we classified phase i and ii as a high feeding rate and a low feeding rate respectively the ph in the mbfr was regulated between 7 0 and 7 5 by dosing 1 mol l 1 hcl or 2 mol l 1 naoh solutions manually every day the inorganic fresh medium fed into the mbfrs were made from tap water and contained 0 075 g l kh2po4 0 3 g l cacl2 2h2o 0 23 g l mgcl2 7h2o 0 5 ml l acidic trace element solution and 0 2 ml l alkaline trace element solution ettwig et al 2010 were also amended into the mbfrs the fresh medium was degassed with nitrogen for 30 min to maintain anaerobic condition before pumped into the mbfr 2 3 analytical methods during the operation of the three bioreactors both influent and effluent samples were collected from the mbfrs with 2 5 ml syringes three times per week and filtered via disposable millipore filter units pore size 0 22 μm for chemical analyses the nitrate and nitrite concentrations were analyzed by a lachat quickchem 8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wi high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu japan equipped with a bio rad hplc column 300 mm å 7 8 mm and a rid detector was employed to determine the composition and concentrations of scfas application of agilent 7890a to determine the dissolved methane concentration and the detailed measurement procedure were in the literature luo et al 2018 the ph level in the reactor was determined with a ph meter oakton australia the methane conversion efficiency of the three mbfrs operated under different electron feeding rates was calculated based on the cod balance as described in chen et al 2019 2 4 dna extraction and high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing biofilm samples were collected under the steady state of each phase specifically on day 345 for r1 and r2 day 447 for r3 in phase i and day 586 for r1 r2 and r3 in phase ii for all the three mbfrs to identify the microbial community in the reactors and their contributions on the scfa performance total genomic dna was extracted from the biofilm samples using the fastdna spin kit for soil kit mp biomedicals according to the manufacturer s protocol dna concentrations were quantified by nanodrop spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific wilmington de usa the 16s rrna gene sequencing and data processing were performed as described by chen et al 2018 in brief the universal primers set 926f 1392r were used to amplify the v6 v8 regions of archaea and bacterial 16s rrna gene and then the purified amplicons were sequenced on an illumina miseq platform illumina usa at the australian centre for ecogenomics brisbane australia after filtering short and low quality reads the operational taxonomic units otus with 97 similarity cutoff were clustered by qiime v1 8 0 quantitative insights into microbial ecology the taxonomic classification was generated via alignment of representative otu sequences against greengenes database to an otu table raw 16s rrna sequencing data are available on ncbi sequence read archive sra database under accession number srr14028220 to srr14028226 3 results 3 1 short chain fatty acid production performance of the methane based mbfrs three methane based mbfrs were operated in two phases over a period of 600 days including phase i high electron acceptor feeding rate and phase ii low electron acceptor feeding rate upon the initial 220 day cultivation in phase i biofilms grew gradually on the surface of hollow fiber and all the three bioreactors accomplished scfa production under the operational conditions tested then the scfa production performance was positively correlated with the electron acceptor feeding rate in this study as illustrated in fig 2 during phase i r1 with no3 n feeding rate of 400 mg l 1d 1 achieved a total scfa production rate of 141 5 mg l 1d 1 on day 222 fig 2a after a fluctuating period the total scfa production rate began to increase and the value steadily increased to 990 9 mg l 1d 1 on day 439 during the operational process no nitrate or nitrite was detected in effluent fig s1a the similar scfa production tendency was also reflected on r3 fig 2c with 100 mg l 1d 1 no3 n and 120 mg l 1d 1 no2 n as electron acceptor a total scfa production rate of 583 6 mg l 1d 1 was detected at the beginning while this value increased to the maximum of 2425 7 mg l 1d 1 on day 355 and then decreased and kept stable at 1267 5 mg l 1d 1 meanwhile the nitrate and nitrite were consumed completely fig s1c compared to r1 and r3 the performance of r2 feeding with 200 mg l 1d 1 no2 n was relatively different as shown in fig 2b the total scfa production rate reached to 1461 9 mg l 1d 1 on day 264 then the r2 suffered a breakdown on the 285 355 days of operation which attributed to the leakage of recirculation tubing of the mbfr after the problem fixed the scfa production rate recovered gradually and reached to 1695 7 mg l 1d 1 on day 397 interestingly the nitrite consumption was not affected by the accident and the effluent nitrite was always below the detection limit fig s1b the carbon utilization efficiency was estimated to be 96 4 161 5 and 154 8 table 1 in r1 r2 and r3 respectively the over 100 carbon conversion efficiency indicates the scfas might be also derived from other carbon matters which will be further discussed in the discussion section after running more than 470 days the operation of r1 r3 was switched to phase ii with decreasing the electron acceptor feeding rate to 80 mg no3 n l 1d 1 40 mg no2 n l 1d 1 20 mg no3 n l 1d 1 and 24 mg no2 n l 1d 1 respectively obviously the total scfa production rates of all the three mbfrs were sharply decreased in phase ii specifically the average scfa production rates were decreased to 8 9 mg l 1d 1 and 16 8 mg l 1d 1 for r1 and r2 respectively fig 2a b in comparation to r1 and r2 the scfa production rate within r3 reached to a much higher level of 260 1 mg l 1d 1 fig 2c meanwhile the supplied electron acceptor was all consumed in three mbfrs in which neither nitrate or nitrite was detected in effluent fig s1a c the performance of the three mbfrs collectively indicated that the scfa production was directly related to the electron acceptor feeding rate accordingly the carbon conversion efficiency at phase ii was decreased to 8 5 48 1 and 87 4 in r1 r2 and r3 respectively table 1 in addition it is worth noting that acetic acid and propionic acid as the two dominant components accounted for average 77 2 and 8 5 78 2 and 11 5 72 0 and 23 3 of the total scfas in r1 r2 and r3 respectively regardless of high or low electron acceptor feeding rate moreover c4 c6 acids were observed in both phases and the production rate increased with the rise of acetic and propionic acids therefore giving a maximum value of 72 8 mg l 1d 1 203 1 mg l 1d 1 and 128 4 mg l 1d 1 respectively at high nitrate nitrite and combined nitrate and nitrite feeding rate in phase i fig 3 a c 3 2 shift of microbial communities in the mbfrs in response to different conditions biofilm samples of each reactor were collected from the inoculum day 0 phase i day 345 for r1 and r2 day 447 for r3 and phase ii day 586 for r1 r2 and r3 for characterizing microbial community compositions using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing fig 3a shows the relative proportions of phylotypes evolved in the consortium of biofilm at phylum level planctomycetes euryarchaeota and the nc10 phylum dominated in the inoculum when electron accepter was fed at a high feeding rate in phase i phylotype affiliated to proteobacteria dominated in the biofilms while the abundance of planctomycetes and the nc10 reduced to undetectable level meanwhile phylotypes closely related to euryarchaeota were enriched in r1 while bacteroidetes were enriched in r2 and r3 respectively in phase ii proteobacteria kept the first dominant phylotype in the three mbfrs but the relative abundance increased apparently compared to that in phase i based on the pca analysis fig s2 the biofilm samples of r1 exhibited distinctions of microbial community structure compared with that of r2 and r3 nevertheless the individual microbial community structure of r1 r2 and r3 under different operational phases was more similar to each other these results suggest that the feeding of different electron acceptors exhibited a greater effect on shaping microbial communities rather than the electron acceptor feeding rate the relative abundance of the most abundant genera in the three mbfrs under different phases is given in fig 4 b candidatus methanoperedens and candidatus methylomirabilis which are known for coupling methane oxidation with nitrate or nitrite reduction ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 respectively accounted for 21 0 and 11 6 of the inoculum while both of them became undetectable in the biofilms the absence of these n damo microorganisms in the biofilms indicated that they might not be involved in both methane oxidation or nitrate nitrite reduction in three mbfrs instead of anaerobic methanotrophs methanogens were detected in the three mbfrs during both phases specifically in r1 the total abundance of methanosarcina and methanobacterium reached 21 8 in phase i and decreased to 12 7 in phase ii yet they were not detected in the inoculum the similar phenomenon was also reflected in r2 and r3 the predominant methanogen genera were still methanosarcina and methanobacterium in r2 with an abundance of 2 5 and 3 6 in phase i which decreased to 0 2 and 0 9 in phase ii respectively meanwhile the proportion of methanogens in r3 was decreased from 4 5 to 0 08 the abundance variation of these methane related archaea was in accordance with the production performance of scfas indicating that these microorganisms may participate in activate methane oxidation for scfa production in addition to methanogens various fermenters with relatively high abundance were detected in all the mbfrs in r1 propionispora dysgonomonas and propionicimonas which were capable of fermenting organics to produce scfas cai et al 2021 lazaro et al 2012 sugawara et al 2011 accounted for 2 5 6 4 of the total sequences in phase i and decreased to 1 3 5 5 in phase ii in accordance with the scfa production profiles moreover fermenters with the dominant genera dysgonomonas and propionispora in r2 accounted for up to 18 1 of the total reads in phase i and decreased to 14 3 in phase ii which also provides a possible explanation for the observation of acetic and propionic acid production trajectory in this mbfr with the highest scfa production rate obtained in r3 diverse microorganisms capable of producing acids such as propionispora dysgonomonas and propionicimonas accounted for 24 3 of the whole community in total in phase i and decreased to 17 4 in phase ii in addition it is interesting to note that clostridium which has been reported as the typical bacteria to ferment organic compounds to produce acetate chua et al 2013 jeon et al 2010 was not detected in either the inoculum or r1 and r2 while increased to 11 3 in phase i and then fade out in phase ii in r3 the evolution of acid producing bacteria in relation to the scfa production performance suggested that scfas might be produced by fermenters furthermore several genera that are known as denitrifiers were detected in the biofilms for example dechloromonas azospira comamonas and pseudomonas with an abundance of 1 6 4 7 were detected in r1 during phase i the relative abundance of dechloromonas and azospira increased from 4 8 and 3 6 to 8 8 and 7 7 respectively from phase i to phase ii pseudomonas which is not detected in the inoculum while it increased to 2 6 in phase i and remained at 2 3 in phase ii compared to r1 the replacement of electron acceptor from nitrate to nitrite influenced the variety of denitrifiers pseudomonas of 1 3 could be still detected in r2 while dechloromonas and azospira were not the predominant genera anymore in terms of 1 6 and 0 5 relative abundance differently the relative abundance of desulfovibrionaceae and comamonas increased to 6 8 and 1 6 in phase ii in r2 when r3 was feeding with a mixture of high nitrate and nitrite rate at the beginning microbial community structure of biofilm samples was in general similar with r2 except that the abundance of pseudomonas increased significantly p 0 05 from 4 2 phase i to 18 0 phase ii 4 discussion 4 1 roles of potential functional microorganisms in methane driven scfa production a key step in microbial methane conversion is methane activation coupling with electron accepting pathway it has been previously reported that methane bioconversion to scfas could be achieved in the mbfr when nitrate nitrite or oxygen served as electron acceptors chen et al 2019 2018 however the effects of electron acceptor feeding rate on methane bioconversion to scfas have not been systematically investigated so far this study revealed that the electron acceptor feeding rate could affect the performance of scfas produced from methane the highest scfa production rate was 990 9 mg l 1d 1 1695 7 mg l 1d 1 and 2425 7 mg l 1d 1 respectively which was obtained in phase i with a high electron acceptor feeding rate these rates were substantially higher than those obtained 8 9 mg l 1d 1 16 8 mg l 1d 1 and 260 1 mg l 1d 1 under low electron acceptor supply condition in phase ii the results collectively suggest that methane bioconversion to scfas can be manipulated by the electron acceptor feeding rate theoretically when methane is sufficiently supplied more scfas should be produced with more electron acceptors provided this is consistent with our experimental results where a higher scfa production rate was obtained at higher electron acceptor feeding rate it should be noted that this study only tested two different electron acceptor feeding rates high rate in phase i and low rate in phase ii the appropriate electron acceptor feeding rate for methane bioconversion to scfas still needs to be optimized and validated from a thermodynamic perspective in the reaction of methane oxidation with nitrite nitrate as the electron acceptor co2 is a more favourable end product according to a more negative gibbs free energy g0 3ch4 8no2 8h 3co2 4n2 10h2o g0 928 kj mol ch4 4no3 co2 4no2 2h2o g0 503 kj mol however the reactions in the mbfrs might occur under a more complex condition which might be favourable for scfas being as the terminal products during methane oxidation although g0 was smaller for methane bioconversion to scfas e g 10ch4 8no3 8h 5ch3cooh 4n2 14h2o g0 392 9 kj mol 6ch4 8no2 8h 3ch3cooh 4n2 10h2o g0 498 6 kj mol in addition the syntrophic microorganisms in the mbfrs are capable of sharing the residual energy efficiently of each partial reaction therefore enabling to support an energetically less favorable reactions taupp et al 2010 in comparison with previous research that the process of methane bioconversion to scfas was accomplished via either the n damo process or aerobic partial methane oxidation cai et al 2019 chen et al 2019 kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 soo et al 2016 no known n damo microorganisms or aerobic methanotrophs were found in the biofilms indicating a different scfa production pathway from those reported previously the known methane related microorganisms detected in the mbfrs feeding with different electron acceptors were methanosarcina and methanobacterium which are known as methanogens that are capable of producing methane from h2 co2 or organic compounds however methanobacterium and methanosarcina also harbor reverse methanogenesis pathway enabling the oxidation of trace amounts of methane in the absence of external electron acceptors yan et al 2018 which was recognized as trace methane oxidation tmo moran et al 2007 timmers et al 2017 taking into account of the positive correlation between the abundance of methanogens and the scfa production in all the three mbfrs it is speculated that methanogens might have been involved in stimulating methane oxidation on the other hand we cannot completely rule out the possibility that these methane related microorganisms might be anaerobic methane oxidation anme microbes given the difficulty to distinguish methanogens and anme in terms of 16s rrna gene evans et al 2019 further experiments should be conducted to determine how methane oxidation pathways in methanogens are activated similar to what has been reported in chen et al 2018 firmicutes and bacteroidetes members propionispora dysgonomonas propionicimonas and clostridium which are the predominant acid producing bacteria were detected in all the three mbfrs the relative abundance of these fermenters increased with the increasing scfa production rate in particular the relative abundance of clostridium was very high 11 3 in r3 where the highest scfa production rate was obtained these results suggest that the variation of scfa production should be attributed to the presence of fermenters in the mbfr a few previous studies focusing on the biological scfa production process have also documented that these fermenters harbor putative capability for scfa production for example they could produce acetic and propionic acids from organic carbons such as polysaccharides and proteins under anaerobic condition lee et al 2014 ma et al 2019 rao et al 2018 however there was no evidence showing that fermenters are capable of utilize methane as the carbon source so far therefore substrate for these fermenters was probably generated by microorganisms via direct or indirect methane utilization with the presence of available electron acceptors i e nitrate and nitrite and organics i e scfas in the mbfrs the abundance of heterotrophic denitrifiers dechloromonas azospira and pseudomonas detected in r1 exhibited a negative correlation with the nitrate feeding rate and the scfa production rate similar phenomena were also observed in r2 and r3 which were fed with nitrite or combined nitrate and nitrite as electron acceptor respectively when both scfas and nitrate nitrite co existed in the mbfr heterotrophic denitrifiers could easily be enriched to consume scfas thus playing a negative role in scfa production however previous studies also reported that heterotrophic denitrifiers e g pseudomonas azospira and comamonas could generate intracellular e g glycogen and polyhydroxyalkanoates or extracellular compounds e g extracellular polymeric substances liu et al 2019 myszka and czaczyk 2009 su et al 2020 ye et al 2011 which could be utilized as potential substrates for fermenters further studies are required to confirm the roles of heterotrophic denitrifiers in scfa production in these mbfrs moreover it should be noteworthy that the carbon efficiencies in phase i were 96 161 5 and 154 8 in r1 r2 and r3 respectively more than 100 of carbon efficiency was also observed by chen et al 2019 this indicates that other carbon sources might participate in scfa production or the scfa production was accomplished via indirect methane utilization based on the long term scfa production performance and microbial community structure analysis it is speculated that synergistic interactions among multiple microorganisms might be responsible for methane bioconversion to scfa production methanogens are the microorganisms that most likely to trigger methane in the mbfr and may be involved in the production of scfas meanwhile fermenters seem to be the main contributor to scfas but it remains unknow about whether the carbon source was derived from intermediates produced by methanogens or other microorganisms in order to illustrate the roles of respective microorganisms in methane bioconversion and unravel the underlying mechanism of methane conversion to scfas further verification by direct methane consumption measurement qualitative and quantitative analysis on reserved carbon isotope labeling of 13c ch4 metagenomics and metatranscriptomics of biofilm samples should be conducted in the future 4 2 implications of the study recently there has been increasing interest in the field of microbial methane conversion to value added liquid chemicals as pointed out by kalyuzhnaya et al 2020 a well balanced microbial consortium is crucial for efficient valuable product generation additions of carbon sources nutrients electron acceptors additives and altering the partial pressure of methane are proposed as effective options for facilitating microbial interactions and improving liquid chemical productions pieja et al 2017 under aerobic conditions inhibitors such as edta nacl and mgcl2 were added to achieve methane partial oxidation for chemical production from aerobic methanotrophs with o2 as electron acceptor han et al 2013 hur et al 2017 hwang et al 2015 although anaerobic methane oxidation could be catalyzed by anaerobic methanotrophs with the reduction of electron acceptors e g sulfate nitrate nitrite and metal oxides fe iii and mn iv cai et al 2018 ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 leu et al 2020 scheller et al 2016 there is lack of experimental evidence that these microorganisms could produce chemicals from methane directly for example chen et al 2019 investigated the individual role of nitrate nitrite and oxygen in the mbfr inoculated with consortium dominated by candidatus m nitroreducens and candidatus m oxyfera for methane bioconversion to scfas microbial characterization revealed that acetate might be produced by candidatus methanoperedens and candidatus methylomirabilis at stressful conditions such as nitrate nitrite nitrate and nitrite limitation chen et al 2019 cai et al 2019 further confirmed that candidatus m nitroreducens dominated mixed culture was capable of produce acetate via intracellular storage compounds that generated from methane under nitrate nitrite limiting conditions indicating an alternative methane bioconversion to liquid chemicals approach by controlling the electron acceptors feeding rate this present study and chen et al 2019 reported methanogens and acid producing microorganisms might have participated cooperatively to produce scfas the selection of electron acceptors or their feeding rate can play a critical role in regulating scfa production moreover the detection of c4 c6 acids were produced which are well known as valuable commodity and important building blocks suggesting a potential to increase the additional value of methane 5 conclusions this present study evaluated the effects of electron acceptor feeding rate on scfa production in methane based mbfrs and revealed the interactions of functional microorganisms and their contributions to methane bioconversion to scfas the key conclusions of this research are drawn as follows 1 with the high feeding rate of nitrate nitrite combined nitrate and nitrite as electron acceptor the scfa production rate reached the highest of 990 9 mg l 1d 1 1695 7 mg l 1d 1 and 2425 7 mg l 1d 1 respectively by contrast decreasing the electron acceptor feeding rate to a low level would result in deceasing scfa production rate to 8 9 mg l 1d 1 16 8 mg l 1d 1 and 260 1 mg l 1d 1 respectively 2 the characterization of microbial communities in response to different electron feeding rates revealed that methanogens and fermenters participated cooperatively to scfa production the detailed pathways about methane bioconversion to scfas should be revealed in the future 3 the findings obtained in this work might deepen our understanding regarding the impacts of electron acceptor feeding rate on methane bioconversion to scfas and could be helpful to develop strategies to enhance value added chemical production from methane declaration

16966,this work proved an efficient method to significantly increase methane production from anaerobic digestion of was this method is to reflux proper of digestion liquid into waste activated sludge pretreatment unit ph 9 5 for 24 h the yield of maximum methane improved between 174 2 7 3 and 282 5 14 1 ml g vss with the reflux ratio of digestion liquid increasing from 0 to 20 it was observed that the biodegradable organics in the digestion liquid did not affect the biological processes related to anaerobic digestion but increased methane production through reutilization the ammonium in the digestion liquid was the main contributor to the increase in methane production via promoting sludge solubilization but refractory organics were the major inhibitors to anaerobic digestion it should be emphasized that the metal ions present in the digestion liquid were beneficial rather than harmful to the biological processes in the anaerobic digestion which may be connected with the fact that certain metal ions were involved in the expression and activation of key enzymes in addition it was found that anaerobes in digestion liquid were another potential contributor to the enhanced anaerobic digestion graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords digestion liquid anaerobic digestion alkaline pretreatment free ammonia 1 introduction activated sludge process is currently

before anaerobic digestion proper pretreatments are adopted to improve the biochemical methane potential and hydrolysis rate of was so far numerous was pretreatment methods have been proposed such as thermal alkaline and chemicals d wang et al 2019 li et al 2013 tanaka et al 1997 valo et al 2010 for example tanaka et al 1997 showed that pretreatment of sludge at 180 c for 60 min increased methane production by about 90 and vss degradation rate by 30 as compared with the blank wang et al 2019a indicated that calcium peroxide pretreatment can reduce the inhibition of refractory organics such as humus and lignocellulose and increase methane production by 1 5 times after being decomposed with 0 1 mol l naoh the content of soluble organic matter in was was significantly increased and the biogas production was increased by 33 in comparison with the control li et al 2013 although the above strategies are effective they require a large amount of energy or reagents which increases their cost in actual management free ammonia fa the non ionized form of ammonium can enter cells through passive diffusion causing cell depression or even death fux et al 2006 vadivelu et al 2007 wei et al 2017 showed that when the fa concentration was 420 680 mg nh3 n l the biochemical methane potential and hydrolysis rate increase from 160 l ch4 kg vs and 0 22 d 1 to 195 l ch4 kg vs and 0 53 d 1 mechanism studies revealed that the primary cause for the increase in methane production was that fa pretreatment enhanced the degradation of was and improved the biodegradability of was wang et al 2018 in addition compared with the free nitrous acid pretreatment technology that requires an additional nitrification reactor to be constructed in the side stream to biologically convert ammonium into nitrite the fa based technology does not require any additional reactors because fa can be obtained in situ from the digestion liquid with abundant ammonium wei et al 2017 therefore fa technology has economic advantages that cannot be ignored which gained great attraction and expectations in practical applications there have been some achievements that have boosted the fa technology to a certain extent calli et al 2005 belmonte et al 2011 liu et al 2019b wang et al 2018 wei et al 2017 but the fa based technology in all the previous researches originated from the chemical solution prepared by nh4cl rather than the actual digestion liquid as we all know in addition to ammonium the real digestion liquid also contains various substances some of them are biodegradable such as acetic protein and carbohydrates while others are non biodegradable and may inhibit microorganisms such as humic acid lignin and metal ion mudhoo and kumar 2013 sawatdeenarunat et al 2015 xiao et al 2018 as a result the implementation of fa based technology in the real project is full of indeterminacy specifically the residuary proteins carbohydrates fatty acids and other substances in the digestion liquid may be reused by microorganisms in the digestion system to increase methane production however the presence of refractory organics or metal ions was shown to reduce the activity of anaerobic bacteria appels et al 2010 li et al 2014 and their coexistence may lead to the increased inhibition which make against to anaerobic digestion up to now it is doubtful whether reflux of actual digestion liquid can increase methane production hence this study aims to determine whether an appropriate amount of digestion liquid reflux can promote the energy recovery of was anaerobic digestion first of all the influence of the digestion liquid with different reflux ratios v v 0 5 10 15 20 and 25 was investigated afterwards the facts of how digestion liquid affects methane production were clarified by studying its performance in the solubilization of sludge the biodegradability of organics released and other anaerobic digestion processes finally in order to identify the contribution of the main substances to the enhanced methane production a series of anaerobic digestion batch tests were also carried out as far as we know this is the first work to demonstrate the feasibility of actual digestion liquor promoting methane production from was anaerobic digestion and reveal the mechanism of how digestion liquid affects methane production 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw was inocula and digestion liquid the sludge used for the digestion substrate in this study was the was harvested from the second settling tank of a wwtp in changsha china after the sludge was collected it was placed in a refrigerator at 4 c and allowed to stand for 24 h after being discard part of the supernatant the concentrated sludge was sieved with a 20 mesh sieve for use the inocula were collected from a long term anaerobic digester that operated in our lab sludge digestion for producing digestion liquid was conducted at ph 9 5 according to the procedure described previously wang et al 2018 after digestion the liquid phase was separated the phosphorus was removed as struvite with the detailed operation being described in supporting information text s1 the main characteristics of the was inocula and supernatant digestion liquid are listed in table 1 2 2 digestion liquid pretreatment on was the 2 7 l of was prepared above was divided equally into six bottles then 0 to 150 ml digestion liquid was added to these bottles to achieve the preselected ratio of 0 5 10 15 20 or 25 of digestion liquid to substrate i e raw was milli q water was then injected so that each bottle of digestion substrate was 600 ml in order to form fa and increase methane production all the bottles were pretreated with alkaline ph 9 5 for 24 h as in our previous report wang et al 2018 2 3 batch biochemical methane potential evaluation at the end of pretreatment all the bottles were purged with 200 ml of above inocula and adjusted the ph to neutral 7 0 0 1 each bottle was flushed with nitrogen gas for 2 min to remove oxygen then rubber stoppers were used to seal the bottles which were finally placed in a constant temperature incubator at 35 1 c with 120 rpm in addition a blank reactor was set up to eliminate the influence of the inoculum on methane production which only contained the same volume of inocula and milli q water the methane production was determined by multiplying the bio gas volume by the methane concentration in the biogas and it was a cumulative value according to the previous method wang et al 2019b logan et al 2002 the first order kinetic model was applied to fit the methane production gained above to evaluate the methane production potential and kinetics of was with the details being showed in supporting information text s2 2 4 methane production from the reflux digestion liquid in order to eliminate the interference of organics in the reflux digestion liquid on methane production the following experiments were carried out six reactors similar to the above were used in this experiment the procedure of this test was the same as the section of batch biochemical methane potential evaluation except that milli q water instead of the alkali treated was was used 2 5 effect of major components in the digestion liquid on methane production as mentioned above the components of digestion liquid are very complex which can be divided into biodegradable organics refractory organics ammonium metal ions and microorganisms according to their chemical and biological properties so as to investigate the effects of these substances on methane production the following trials were carried out to assess their impacts on the performance of anaerobic digestion these trials were labeled as test a test b test c test d and test e with the operational procedures being detailed in supporting information text s3 2 6 effect of digestion liquid and its main components on anaerobic digestion processes there are some bio processes such as hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methonogenesis in was anaerobic digestion that are closely related to methane production madsen et al 2011 the digestion liquid will inevitably enter the digestion system and contact with the inocula therefore the purpose of the following batch tests was to evaluate the influence of digestion liquid and its main components on each bio process of anaerobic digestion in this batch tests 30 repeated batch reactors were operated these reactors were divided into five tests i e test ⅰ test ⅱ test ⅲ test ⅳ and test ⅴ the operation procedure was introduced in supporting information text s4 2 7 analytical methods hydrogen and methane were analyzed using a gas chromatograph gc112a china with a thermal conductivity detector and a 4 mm 2 m gdx 102 stainless column liu et al 2021 soluble proteins and carbohydrates were determined by lowry folin method and phenol sulfuric acid method scfa was quantified with an agilent 6890 n with db maxetr column according to the method detailed in the literature d wang et al 2019 the determinations of cod tss nh4 n and vss were performed on the basis of the standard method apha 1998 the determination methods for humus and lignocellulosic were the same as described in the previous literature wang et al 2019a van et al 1991 the changes of liquid in pretreated was were characterized by using an excitation emission matrix luminescence spectroscopy f 4600 fl spectrophotometer hitachi japan and the specific operational procedure can be found in text s5 supporting information the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry peaa700 switzerland was used to determine the concentration of metal ions in digestion liquid with the operations and instrument settings being described in text s6 supporting information 2 8 statistical analysis the analysis of variance was used to assess the significance of experimental results p 0 05 was indicated statistically significant while p 0 05 was considered statistically insignificant 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of digestion liquid pretreatment on biochemical methane production fig 1 shows the measured methane production during the entire biochemical methane production assay period i e 35 days in all the tests the digester with a reflux ratio of 0 was set as the control in the digester without digestion liquid methane production did not increase significantly after 25 days so the best digestion time was 25 days and the maximum cumulative methane yield at this time was 172 1 8 8 ml g vss although the cumulative methane production trends of all the digesters with digestion liquid were similar it can be clearly found that the reflux of digestion liquid greatly affected methane production for example when the reflux ratios of digestion liquid were 5 10 15 20 and 25 the maximal cumulative methane yield were 232 2 7 6 249 7 5 4 263 8 9 2 282 5 14 1 and 243 5 12 2 ml g vss respectively the results proved that it was feasible to increase methane production through proper reflux of digestion liquid from the values of r2 shown in fig 1 it can be illustrated the satisfactory fit of methane production to the first order kinetic model in all the scenarios compared with the control without digestion liquid reflux a higher biochemical methane potential b0 can be achieved at any digestion liquid reflux ratio in this test specifically when the reflux ratios were between 20 and 25 the maximum increase of b0 was 63 from 187 to 304 ml g vss the measured methane production in fig 1 also clearly reflected this trend however the reflux of the digestion liquid caused the determined hydrolysis rate k to be suppressed which was reduced by approximately 21 from 0 14 to 0 11 d 1 this was contrary to the conclusion of previous studies that pretreatment of fa prepared by chemical increased k wei et al 2017 the reason of this conflict may be attributed to the effect of substances other than ammonium in the digestion liquid on anaerobic digestion which would be discussed in the following text 3 2 methane production from the reflux digestion liquid since there are some biodegradable organics remaining in the digestion liquid these organics may be bio converted into methane it was found that when the volume of digestion liquid served as the sole substrate increased from 30 to 150 ml the maximal methane production increased from 8 9 0 6 to 35 0 5 ml fig 2 assuming that the total cod in the digestion liquid was completely converted to methane the theoretical methane yields from 30 60 90 120 and 150 ml digestion liquid were 10 20 1 30 1 40 2 and 50 2 ml respectively fig 2 which only accounted for 1 4 6 of the corresponding measured methane production in fig 1 this indicated that the main factor for digestion liquid enhancing methane production was not the extra cod in digestion liquid 3 3 mechanism of how digestion liquid enhances methane production as the final product of was anaerobic digestion methane production is related to several biological processes therefore it is necessary to clarify the influence of digestion liquid on these processes sludge disintegration provide substrates such as proteins and carbohydrates for anaerobes to produce methane the data shown in fig 3 a indicated that the presence of digestion liquid promoted the disintegration of sludge for example when the reflux ratio of digestion liquid increased from 0 to 25 the soluble cod proteins concentration after pretreatment was 1654 0 51 0 mg l 472 0 22 3 mg l in the digester in the control i e without digestion liquid whereas the corresponding datum was 2453 7 81 8 mg l 1076 0 24 7 mg l in the digester with 25 reflux ratio similar observations were also made at other reflux ratios fig 3b shows eem spectra of sludge liquid after 24 h alkaline pretreatment which was often used to characterize the biodegradability of the released organics two main peaks i e peak a and peak b were found in the fluorescence spectra peak a and peak b detected at excitation emission wavelengths of 275 330 335 nm and 220 325 330 nm were considered to aromatic proteins and tryptophan protein like substances respectively baker and andy 2001 compared with the control refluxing digestion liquid caused a red shift of the emission wavelength and enhanced the fluorescence intensity fig 3b which once again suggested that refluxing digestion liquid promoted was to release more soluble substrates sheng and yu 2006 it was observed from fig 3c that the refluxed digestion liquid inhibited rather than promoted the bio processes related to anaerobic digestion for example the specific degradation rates mg g vss h in the control without refluxed digestion liquid were 28 9 1 3 in bsa 23 1 1 2 in glucose 20 0 0 7 in propionate 0 34 0 02 in hydrogen and 30 6 1 5 in acetate whereas these values decreased to 23 0 0 8 22 6 0 8 19 0 1 1 0 13 0 01 and 14 1 0 7 with 20 reflux ratio of digestion liquid respectively the results suggested that refluxing digestion liquid had no effect on acidogenesis and acetogenesis but inhibited hydrolysis and methanogenesis moreover methanogenesis was inhibited severer by digestion liquor than other processes 3 4 effect of major components in the digestion liquid on methane production digestion liquid includes several complicated substances and their characteristics are quite different these components were divided into five categories i e ammonium biodegradable organics refractory organics metal ions and anaerobes and their impacts on methane production were further discussed there have been sufficient efforts to prove that fa improved the performance of anaerobic digestion wei et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in the ammonium digester the level of fa 131 mg nh3 n l produced from the added ammonium synthetic medium increased methane production by 19 fig 4 a as expected the ammonium in the digestion liquid was a beneficial element to improve was anaerobic digestion further exploration revealed that the main reason for this was that fa improved was solubilization rather than other biological processes fig 4b and table 2 all the results were well supported from previous report wang et al 2018 it can be seen from fig 4 that compared with the control the soluble cod and methane production in the biodegradable organics digester increased from 1654 82 7 to 1794 90 2 mg l and 177 2 8 9 to 183 6 12 3 ml g vss respectively however further analysis showed that these increases were similar to the theoretical conversion of organics in the added synthetic medium in other words the increment of scod and methane production in the reactor containing biodegradable was likely to be the reconversion biodegradable organics in the added synthetic medium table s2 the phenomena outlined in table 2 also support this speculation the degradation rate of any model substrate in the biodegradable organics reactor was not significantly different p 0 05 from the control the results demonstrated the biodegradable organics in the digestion liquid will not affect all the processes of was anaerobic digestion from fig 4a it can be seen an interesting observation that the metal ions in the digestion liquid obviously enhanced rather than inhibited the methane production the presence of the metal ions significantly facilitated the biological processes related to anaerobic digestion especially acetoclastic methanogenesis fig 4b and table 2 for instance the degradation rate of the acetoclastic methanogenesis substrate in the metal ion digester was 54 37 3 26 mg g vss d which was 36 2 higher than that in the control 39 93 4 76 mg g vss d it was known that metal ions usually instruct the expression of enzymes and the presence of metal ions at appropriate amounts may stimulate enzyme activities for example the methyl com reductase containing nickel produced by strictly anaerobic archaea e g methanogens is one key enzyme that catalyzes the exergonic conversion of methyl com and coenzyme b into methane and the heterodisulfide of coenzyme b and coenzyme m in final reaction of methanogenesis pathway ermler et al 1997 facchin et al 2013 there are three subunits i e α β and γ in methyl coenzyme m reductase which arrange as hexamer of αβγ 2 composition this multisubunit complex contains two cofactor f430 as a prosthetic group which is responsible for methylation and demethylation in the catalytic cycle in methanogenesis and must be activated with ni as the centrally coordinated ion fig 5 a livingston et al 1984 pfaltz et al 1982 in addition due to its plasticity in coordination and redox chemistry ni is often involved in enzymes related to the use and or production of gasses such as carbon monoxide dehydrogenase acyl coenzyme a synthetase and nickel acireductone dioxygenase ragsdale 2009 on the contrary the methane yield in the refractory organics reactor decreased the methane yield from the refractory organics reactor reduced from 177 2 8 9 to 131 1 9 6 ml g vss resulting in a reduction of 26 fig 4a further analyses showed that the refractory organics in the digestion liquid did not promote the decomposition of was fig 4b but significantly restrained biological processes especially methanogenesis table 2 for example the degradation rates of hydrogen and acetate in the reactor with refractory organics were 5 68 1 20 and 15 26 1 01 mg g vss d while these degradation rates in the control were 12 65 2 75 and 39 93 4 76 mg g vss d based on the previous analysis method wang et al 2019a it can be concluded that this level of refractory organics inhibited the activities of microorganisms related to hydrogentrophic methanogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis by 55 1 and 61 8 respectively according to the literature some special functional microbes e g microbes responsible for humic acid reduction compete with methanogens for the available substrates in anaerobic digestion processes specifically as shown in the fig 5b the cc and c s bonds of acetyl coa are cleaved by the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase acetyl coa synthase complex which can also oxidize the carbonyl group with transfer two electrons to the small protein electron carrier ferredoxin in the biotransformation of acetyl coa to 5 methyl thmpt of acetoclastic methanogenesis process ferry 2010 fischer and thauer 1990 however the quinone groups of humic acid which may come from the lignin or microbial metabolites can serve as a terminal electron accepting moiety this can encourage humic acid to compete for electrons thereby hindering ferredoxin regeneration liu et al 2015 cervantes et al 2000 which may be the reason for the low methane production in the refractory organics digester in the test to assess the effect of anaerobes in digestion liquid on methane production the digestion liquid treated with filter is considered sterile compared with the digestion liquid digester the methane production of the reactor containing the filtered digestion liquid decreased by 30 1 it is easy to understand that the refluxing digestion liquid will increase the abundance of microorganisms in the digestion system so the anaerobes involved in the digestion liquid were another contributor to promote methane production 3 5 implications fa based technology is increasingly recognized economically and practically for achieving was reduction and energy recovery with the lowest cost through promoting a closed loop concept in wwtps in this conception fa is regarded as a free chemical which produced in suit from the waste i e digestion liquid of wwtps fig 6 all the previous achievements regarding fa however were based on chemical e g nh4cl rather than real digestion liquid possibly because this was a cutting edge approach this means that the practical application of the fa based technology was fraught with full indetermination due to the complex composition of real digestion liquid this study was the first attempt to promote the anaerobic digestion of was by using actual digestion liquid as a source of fa accelerating the fa based technology being adopted in real world applications the results showed that both sludge reduction and methane production in the digester can be achieved in a more economical way with refluxing the digestion liquid to the pretreatment unit based on the results obtained in this work it is calculated that this strategy can save 0 3 million cost in sludge transport and disposal and get 0 8 million benefit in energy production from methane annually in a wwtp q 105 m3 day as compared with the alkaline ph 9 5 i e 0 reflux ratio in this work pretreatment method only table s3 particularly it was demonstrated that refractory organics in digestion liquid e g humic acid would severely suppress anaerobic digestion and these organics could not be transformed or removed in traditional digestion processes in order to achieve a higher methane production some extra methods should be taken to eliminate the inhibition of refractory organics before anaerobic digestion for example calcium peroxide can achieve a significant reduction in the contents of refractory organics and perform well in promoting was solubilization wang et al 2019a the surprising discovery obtained in this work was that the metal ions in the digestion liquid had great potential for increasing methane production table 2 which may be related to the expression of key enzyme activities fig 5a the discovery of this phenomenon alleviates the scruple that the metal ions in the actual digestion liquid are harmful to anaerobic digestion however whether this conclusion obtained from the batch test had broad applicability needs to be fully verified by running long term reactors in the future moreover the main aim of this work is to assess the feasibility of refluxing digestion liquid to promote methane production and to reveal the underlying mechanism therefore parameters such as reflux ratios pretreatment time ph inoculation method are not optimized in addition although the influence of single factors in the digestion liquid on was anaerobic digestion and their related mechanisms have been discussed in this work the synergistic effect between two or three factors such as metal ions ammonium anaerobes biodegradable organics recalcitrant organics was not investigated here thus mathematical model and response surface method need to be used in the future to explore the synergistic effect among these various components in the digestion liquid before this strategy being implemented in full scale applications 4 conclusion the purpose of this work was to evaluate whether the refluxed digestion liquid can promote methane production from anaerobic digestion of was the main conclusions are 1 as the reflux ratio of digestion liquid increased from 0 to 20 the maximum cumulative methane production from anaerobic digestion of alkaline pretreated sludge increased from 174 2 7 3 to 282 5 14 1 ml g vss 2 refluxing digestion liquid reduced the microbial activity associated with anaerobic digestion but it promoted was disintegration and improved the biodegradability of the released organics 3 ammonium in the digestion liquid was the main booster to enhance methane production in the form of fa 4 it was found that the presence of metal ions e g ni was beneficial to bio processes of anaerobic digestion which may be related to the activation of the key enzymes such as methyl coenzyme m reductase and co dehydrogenase 5 the refractory organics in digestion liquid were detrimental to anaerobic digestion through suppressing the bioprocesses especially methanogenesis declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

16966,this work proved an efficient method to significantly increase methane production from anaerobic digestion of was this method is to reflux proper of digestion liquid into waste activated sludge pretreatment unit ph 9 5 for 24 h the yield of maximum methane improved between 174 2 7 3 and 282 5 14 1 ml g vss with the reflux ratio of digestion liquid increasing from 0 to 20 it was observed that the biodegradable organics in the digestion liquid did not affect the biological processes related to anaerobic digestion but increased methane production through reutilization the ammonium in the digestion liquid was the main contributor to the increase in methane production via promoting sludge solubilization but refractory organics were the major inhibitors to anaerobic digestion it should be emphasized that the metal ions present in the digestion liquid were beneficial rather than harmful to the biological processes in the anaerobic digestion which may be connected with the fact that certain metal ions were involved in the expression and activation of key enzymes in addition it was found that anaerobes in digestion liquid were another potential contributor to the enhanced

detailed in the literature d wang et al 2019 the determinations of cod tss nh4 n and vss were performed on the basis of the standard method apha 1998 the determination methods for humus and lignocellulosic were the same as described in the previous literature wang et al 2019a van et al 1991 the changes of liquid in pretreated was were characterized by using an excitation emission matrix luminescence spectroscopy f 4600 fl spectrophotometer hitachi japan and the specific operational procedure can be found in text s5 supporting information the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry peaa700 switzerland was used to determine the concentration of metal ions in digestion liquid with the operations and instrument settings being described in text s6 supporting information 2 8 statistical analysis the analysis of variance was used to assess the significance of experimental results p 0 05 was indicated statistically significant while p 0 05 was considered statistically insignificant 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of digestion liquid pretreatment on biochemical methane production fig 1 shows the measured methane production during the entire biochemical methane production assay period i e 35 days in all the tests the digester with a reflux ratio of 0 was set as the control in the digester without digestion liquid methane production did not increase significantly after 25 days so the best digestion time was 25 days and the maximum cumulative methane yield at this time was 172 1 8 8 ml g vss although the cumulative methane production trends of all the digesters with digestion liquid were similar it can be clearly found that the reflux of digestion liquid greatly affected methane production for example when the reflux ratios of digestion liquid were 5 10 15 20 and 25 the maximal cumulative methane yield were 232 2 7 6 249 7 5 4 263 8 9 2 282 5 14 1 and 243 5 12 2 ml g vss respectively the results proved that it was feasible to increase methane production through proper reflux of digestion liquid from the values of r2 shown in fig 1 it can be illustrated the satisfactory fit of methane production to the first order kinetic model in all the scenarios compared with the control without digestion liquid reflux a higher biochemical methane potential b0 can be achieved at any digestion liquid reflux ratio in this test specifically when the reflux ratios were between 20 and 25 the maximum increase of b0 was 63 from 187 to 304 ml g vss the measured methane production in fig 1 also clearly reflected this trend however the reflux of the digestion liquid caused the determined hydrolysis rate k to be suppressed which was reduced by approximately 21 from 0 14 to 0 11 d 1 this was contrary to the conclusion of previous studies that pretreatment of fa prepared by chemical increased k wei et al 2017 the reason of this conflict may be attributed to the effect of substances other than ammonium in the digestion liquid on anaerobic digestion which would be discussed in the following text 3 2 methane production from the reflux digestion liquid since there are some biodegradable organics remaining in the digestion liquid these organics may be bio converted into methane it was found that when the volume of digestion liquid served as the sole substrate increased from 30 to 150 ml the maximal methane production increased from 8 9 0 6 to 35 0 5 ml fig 2 assuming that the total cod in the digestion liquid was completely converted to methane the theoretical methane yields from 30 60 90 120 and 150 ml digestion liquid were 10 20 1 30 1 40 2 and 50 2 ml respectively fig 2 which only accounted for 1 4 6 of the corresponding measured methane production in fig 1 this indicated that the main factor for digestion liquid enhancing methane production was not the extra cod in digestion liquid 3 3 mechanism of how digestion liquid enhances methane production as the final product of was anaerobic digestion methane production is related to several biological processes therefore it is necessary to clarify the influence of digestion liquid on these processes sludge disintegration provide substrates such as proteins and carbohydrates for anaerobes to produce methane the data shown in fig 3 a indicated that the presence of digestion liquid promoted the disintegration of sludge for example when the reflux ratio of digestion liquid increased from 0 to 25 the soluble cod proteins concentration after pretreatment was 1654 0 51 0 mg l 472 0 22 3 mg l in the digester in the control i e without digestion liquid whereas the corresponding datum was 2453 7 81 8 mg l 1076 0 24 7 mg l in the digester with 25 reflux ratio similar observations were also made at other reflux ratios fig 3b shows eem spectra of sludge liquid after 24 h alkaline pretreatment which was often used to characterize the biodegradability of the released organics two main peaks i e peak a and peak b were found in the fluorescence spectra peak a and peak b detected at excitation emission wavelengths of 275 330 335 nm and 220 325 330 nm were considered to aromatic proteins and tryptophan protein like substances respectively baker and andy 2001 compared with the control refluxing digestion liquid caused a red shift of the emission wavelength and enhanced the fluorescence intensity fig 3b which once again suggested that refluxing digestion liquid promoted was to release more soluble substrates sheng and yu 2006 it was observed from fig 3c that the refluxed digestion liquid inhibited rather than promoted the bio processes related to anaerobic digestion for example the specific degradation rates mg g vss h in the control without refluxed digestion liquid were 28 9 1 3 in bsa 23 1 1 2 in glucose 20 0 0 7 in propionate 0 34 0 02 in hydrogen and 30 6 1 5 in acetate whereas these values decreased to 23 0 0 8 22 6 0 8 19 0 1 1 0 13 0 01 and 14 1 0 7 with 20 reflux ratio of digestion liquid respectively the results suggested that refluxing digestion liquid had no effect on acidogenesis and acetogenesis but inhibited hydrolysis and methanogenesis moreover methanogenesis was inhibited severer by digestion liquor than other processes 3 4 effect of major components in the digestion liquid on methane production digestion liquid includes several complicated substances and their characteristics are quite different these components were divided into five categories i e ammonium biodegradable organics refractory organics metal ions and anaerobes and their impacts on methane production were further discussed there have been sufficient efforts to prove that fa improved the performance of anaerobic digestion wei et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in the ammonium digester the level of fa 131 mg nh3 n l produced from the added ammonium synthetic medium increased methane production by 19 fig 4 a as expected the ammonium in the digestion liquid was a beneficial element to improve was anaerobic digestion further exploration revealed that the main reason for this was that fa improved was solubilization rather than other biological processes fig 4b and table 2 all the results were well supported from previous report wang et al 2018 it can be seen from fig 4 that compared with the control the soluble cod and methane production in the biodegradable organics digester increased from 1654 82 7 to 1794 90 2 mg l and 177 2 8 9 to 183 6 12 3 ml g vss respectively however further analysis showed that these increases were similar to the theoretical conversion of organics in the added synthetic medium in other words the increment of scod and methane production in the reactor containing biodegradable was likely to be the reconversion biodegradable organics in the added synthetic medium table s2 the phenomena outlined in table 2 also support this speculation the degradation rate of any model substrate in the biodegradable organics reactor was not significantly different p 0 05 from the control the results demonstrated the biodegradable organics in the digestion liquid will not affect all the processes of was anaerobic digestion from fig 4a it can be seen an interesting observation that the metal ions in the digestion liquid obviously enhanced rather than inhibited the methane production the presence of the metal ions significantly facilitated the biological processes related to anaerobic digestion especially acetoclastic methanogenesis fig 4b and table 2 for instance the degradation rate of the acetoclastic methanogenesis substrate in the metal ion digester was 54 37 3 26 mg g vss d which was 36 2 higher than that in the control 39 93 4 76 mg g vss d it was known that metal ions usually instruct the expression of enzymes and the presence of metal ions at appropriate amounts may stimulate enzyme activities for example the methyl com reductase containing nickel produced by strictly anaerobic archaea e g methanogens is one key enzyme that catalyzes the exergonic conversion of methyl com and coenzyme b into methane and the heterodisulfide of coenzyme b and coenzyme m in final reaction of methanogenesis pathway ermler et al 1997 facchin et al 2013 there are three subunits i e α β and γ in methyl coenzyme m reductase which arrange as hexamer of αβγ 2 composition this multisubunit complex contains two cofactor f430 as a prosthetic group which is responsible for methylation and demethylation in the catalytic cycle in methanogenesis and must be activated with ni as the centrally coordinated ion fig 5 a livingston et al 1984 pfaltz et al 1982 in addition due to its plasticity in coordination and redox chemistry ni is often involved in enzymes related to the use and or production of gasses such as carbon monoxide dehydrogenase acyl coenzyme a synthetase and nickel acireductone dioxygenase ragsdale 2009 on the contrary the methane yield in the refractory organics reactor decreased the methane yield from the refractory organics reactor reduced from 177 2 8 9 to 131 1 9 6 ml g vss resulting in a reduction of 26 fig 4a further analyses showed that the refractory organics in the digestion liquid did not promote the decomposition of was fig 4b but significantly restrained biological processes especially methanogenesis table 2 for example the degradation rates of hydrogen and acetate in the reactor with refractory organics were 5 68 1 20 and 15 26 1 01 mg g vss d while these degradation rates in the control were 12 65 2 75 and 39 93 4 76 mg g vss d based on the previous analysis method wang et al 2019a it can be concluded that this level of refractory organics inhibited the activities of microorganisms related to hydrogentrophic methanogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis by 55 1 and 61 8 respectively according to the literature some special functional microbes e g microbes responsible for humic acid reduction compete with methanogens for the available substrates in anaerobic digestion processes specifically as shown in the fig 5b the cc and c s bonds of acetyl coa are cleaved by the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase acetyl coa synthase complex which can also oxidize the carbonyl group with transfer two electrons to the small protein electron carrier ferredoxin in the biotransformation of acetyl coa to 5 methyl thmpt of acetoclastic methanogenesis process ferry 2010 fischer and thauer 1990 however the quinone groups of humic acid which may come from the lignin or microbial metabolites can serve as a terminal electron accepting moiety this can encourage humic acid to compete for electrons thereby hindering ferredoxin regeneration liu et al 2015 cervantes et al 2000 which may be the reason for the low methane production in the refractory organics digester in the test to assess the effect of anaerobes in digestion liquid on methane production the digestion liquid treated with filter is considered sterile compared with the digestion liquid digester the methane production of the reactor containing the filtered digestion liquid decreased by 30 1 it is easy to understand that the refluxing digestion liquid will increase the abundance of microorganisms in the digestion system so the anaerobes involved in the digestion liquid were another contributor to promote methane production 3 5 implications fa based technology is increasingly recognized economically and practically for achieving was reduction and energy recovery with the lowest cost through promoting a closed loop concept in wwtps in this conception fa is regarded as a free chemical which produced in suit from the waste i e digestion liquid of wwtps fig 6 all the previous achievements regarding fa however were based on chemical e g nh4cl rather than real digestion liquid possibly because this was a cutting edge approach this means that the practical application of the fa based technology was fraught with full indetermination due to the complex composition of real digestion liquid this study was the first attempt to promote the anaerobic digestion of was by using actual digestion liquid as a source of fa accelerating the fa based technology being adopted in real world applications the results showed that both sludge reduction and methane production in the digester can be achieved in a more economical way with refluxing the digestion liquid to the pretreatment unit based on the results obtained in this work it is calculated that this strategy can save 0 3 million cost in sludge transport and disposal and get 0 8 million benefit in energy production from methane annually in a wwtp q 105 m3 day as compared with the alkaline ph 9 5 i e 0 reflux ratio in this work pretreatment method only table s3 particularly it was demonstrated that refractory organics in digestion liquid e g humic acid would severely suppress anaerobic digestion and these organics could not be transformed or removed in traditional digestion processes in order to achieve a higher methane production some extra methods should be taken to eliminate the inhibition of refractory organics before anaerobic digestion for example calcium peroxide can achieve a significant reduction in the contents of refractory organics and perform well in promoting was solubilization wang et al 2019a the surprising discovery obtained in this work was that the metal ions in the digestion liquid had great potential for increasing methane production table 2 which may be related to the expression of key enzyme activities fig 5a the discovery of this phenomenon alleviates the scruple that the metal ions in the actual digestion liquid are harmful to anaerobic digestion however whether this conclusion obtained from the batch test had broad applicability needs to be fully verified by running long term reactors in the future moreover the main aim of this work is to assess the feasibility of refluxing digestion liquid to promote methane production and to reveal the underlying mechanism therefore parameters such as reflux ratios pretreatment time ph inoculation method are not optimized in addition although the influence of single factors in the digestion liquid on was anaerobic digestion and their related mechanisms have been discussed in this work the synergistic effect between two or three factors such as metal ions ammonium anaerobes biodegradable organics recalcitrant organics was not investigated here thus mathematical model and response surface method need to be used in the future to explore the synergistic effect among these various components in the digestion liquid before this strategy being implemented in full scale applications 4 conclusion the purpose of this work was to evaluate whether the refluxed digestion liquid can promote methane production from anaerobic digestion of was the main conclusions are 1 as the reflux ratio of digestion liquid increased from 0 to 20 the maximum cumulative methane production from anaerobic digestion of alkaline pretreated sludge increased from 174 2 7 3 to 282 5 14 1 ml g vss 2 refluxing digestion liquid reduced the microbial activity associated with anaerobic digestion but it promoted was disintegration and improved the biodegradability of the released organics 3 ammonium in the digestion liquid was the main booster to enhance methane production in the form of fa 4 it was found that the presence of metal ions e g ni was beneficial to bio processes of anaerobic digestion which may be related to the activation of the key enzymes such as methyl coenzyme m reductase and co dehydrogenase 5 the refractory organics in digestion liquid were detrimental to anaerobic digestion through suppressing the bioprocesses especially methanogenesis declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

16967,tetracycline antibiotics tcs are a group of the top selling and widely used antibiotics that have been frequently detected in various environments the interaction between tcs and goethite α feooh one of the most common crystalline oxide minerals in aqueous environment and soil is unclear apart from adsorption this study firstly demonstrated that transformation of tetracycline ttc occurred in the presence of goethite the transformation kinetics and mechanism of ttc with goethite were investigated to gain a better understanding of the fate of tcs in the natural environment the results showed that the transformation of tcs by goethite explicitly exhibited two stage kinetics wherein an initial period of fast transformation was followed by a continuous slow transformation hydroxyl groups on goethite were identified as major reactive sites among which singly coordinated hydroxyls feoh were more reactive than doubly coordinated hydroxyls fe2oh towards the transformation of ttc on the basis of transformation rates speciation of ttc and functional groups on goethite surface a kinetic model was established successfully describing the transformation of ttc by goethite under conditions of varying reactant concentration and ph the transformation of ttc by goethite mainly resulted in a n n dedimethylation product that did not show antimicrobial properties towards escherichia coli this study indicates that fe iii hydro oxides in soils and sediments may play an important role in the natural attenuation of tetracycline antibiotics and their bioactivity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords tetracycline goethite kinetic model n n dedimethylation product toxicity 1 introduction tetracycline antibiotics tcs including tetracycline ttc oxytetracycline otc and chlorotetracycline ctc are one of the primary antibiotic groups used as veterinary drugs human medicines or feed additives in animal farms throughout the world daghrir and drogui 2013 for example tcs are the top antimicrobial drugs consumed in the u s and the european union economou and gousia 2015 sarmah et al 2006 the majority up to 75 of the parent compounds is excreted into the environment owing to the poor degradability in human or animal bodies karpov et al 2018 wang et al 2018 tcs have been widely detected in various environmental compartments including surface water gao et al 2012 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 groundwater hu et al 2010 soil and sediments daghrir and drogui 2013 the intense and long term usage of tcs can induce pharmaceutical resistance among environmental microbial populations which may pose threats to ecosystems and human health iakovides et al 2019 indeed tc resistomes are among the most detected and abundant antibiotic resistance genes in natural environment han et al 2018 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 owing to multiple o and n containing functional groups in tcs they have strong tendency to complex with metal ions wang et al 2016 2015 and are prone to adsorption and transformation by minerals in soil or river sediments chen et al 2011 figueroa et al 2004 figueroa and mackay 2005 gu and karthikeyan 2005 karpov et al 2018 tolls 2001 thus the interaction between tcs and metal species may greatly affect tcs environmental fate and ecological impacts although the transformation of tcs by several minerals such as al2o3 mno2 or montmorillonite under favorable environmental conditions has been reported in previous studies chen and huang 2010 2011 karpov et al 2018 tcs transformation by iron oxides the most abundant redox active minerals in the environments kumar et al 2018 has not been investigated one of the most prevalent iron oxides is goethite α feooh which can be found in both humid and semiarid regions and appears as the weathering product of many iron containing rocks liu et al 2014 due to its large surface area and special surface active sites goethite can strongly adsorb varieties of organic contaminants and subsequently catalyze their transformation examples may include the transformation of fluoroquinolones zhang and huang 2007 dimethoxyhydroquinone krumina et al 2017 bisphenol a bpa lin et al 2012 and amoxicillin benacherine et al 2017 although a few efforts have been made to understand the adsorption behavior of tcs on goethite wu et al 2019 zhao et al 2011 2014 information about structural transformation of tcs by goethite has been scarce which impedes assessment of the overall environmental fate and eco impact of tcs contaminants therefore this study aimed to elucidate the transformation kinetics and mechanisms of tcs by goethite the kinetics features influencing factors reactive sites transformation products and product toxicity towards e coli were firstly investigated based on these results a plausible reaction mechanism was proposed structurally related amines were also studied to further confirm this mechanism we further evaluated 1576 commercially available fda approved drugs for their potential to be transformed by goethite overall the results of this study will facilitate a more accurate assessment of the environmental behavior of tcs and dimethylaniline chemicals in soils and sediments 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagents the sources of chemicals and reagents are provided in si text s1 2 2 synthesis and characterization of goethite the synthesis of goethite is described in si text s2 the morphologies were characterized by a jem 2100f jeol japan transmission electron microscope tem si figure s1 a x ray diffraction xrd analysis si figure s1 b was performed using a d max 2500 rigaku japan diffractometer with cu kα radiation λ 0 154 nm and scanning angle of 2θ from 5 to 90 at a scanning rate of 5 min 1 the specific surface area was 62 9 m2 g 1 determined by multipoint n2 bet analysis using an asap 2460 micromeritics u s surface area analyzer 2 3 experimental setup all experiments were conducted in 30 ml screw cap amber glass bottles placed in a constant temperature chamber 25 c in the dark reaction solutions were maintained at constant ph with 10 mm buffer acetic acid sodium acetate for ph 4 5 4 morpholinepropanesulfonic acid mops and its sodium salt for ph 6 8 and 2 cyclohexylamino ethanesulfonic acid ches and its sodium salt for ph 9 10 nacl 10 mm was added to maintain a constant ionic strength the reaction was initiated by adding a known amount of ttc stock to the goethite suspension a typical concentration of 40 μm ttc and 5 g l 1 goethite were applied except when stated otherwise reaction aliquots were periodically collected to monitor the adsorption and transformation of ttc to monitor ttc in the aqueous phase aliquot of sample was taken and rapidly pushed through a membrane filter holder that housed a 0 22 μm pes membrane anpel using a 1 ml plastic syringe negligible adsorption of ttc to the membrane was confirmed through passing knowing concentration the reaction in the filtrate was immediately quenched by adding 0 1 m hcl to reach a ph of 2 0 as little ttc metal complexation occurred at this ph and the ttc was stable in hcl solutions for long periods chen and huang 2009 wang et al 2016 to desorb ttc from the goethite surface 0 1 m hcl was added to another part of the samples chen and huang 2010 the acidified samples were shaken on a constant temperature shaker at 200 rpm for 5 min and then rapidly pushed through a 0 22 μm membrane all samples were stored in 2 ml amber vials at 4 c and analyzed within 48 h for each testing parameter duplicate experiments were conducted naf was utilized to identify the reactive surface hydroxyl species for the transformation of ttc as fluoride can substitute the surface hydroxyl groups of goethite ding et al 2012 hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2000 sheng et al 2019b the solutions of naf 2 50 mm were spiked into goethite suspension 30 min prior to ttc within which the adsorption equilibrium of fluoride had been reached si figure s2 structurally related amines n methylaniline and n n dimethylaniline were investigated as model compounds other pharmaceuticals that contain alkyl amino moiety including pyrilamine diphenhydramine tetracaine chlorpromazine amitriptyline and repaglinide were also studied methanol and hcl were used as extracting solutions to desorb amines and pharmaceuticals respectively 2 4

chromatography ic system 2 5 products identification higher initial reactant concentrations 100 μm for ttc and 25 g l 1 for goethite were used to facilitate the identification of products from the

escherichia coli e coli atcc 8739 optical density absorbance at 600 nm was used as an indicator of bacterial growth detailed methods are described in si text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation of ttc by goethite in the absence of goethite ttc was stable under experimental conditions and no significant loss was detected within 72 h conversely the obvious transformation of ttc occurred in the presence of goethite as shown in fig 1 a prior to transformation experiments different extracting agents had been compared among which hcl desorption had the best recovery efficiency above 92 si figure s3 and could be used to represent all the untransformed parent compounds in the aqueous phase and goethite surface an immediate drop in ttc concentrations in the aqueous phase fig 1 a suggested a fast adsorption process as the reaction proceeded the ttc concentration in the aqueous phase gradually decreased and was always lower than the corresponding ttc concentration measured with hcl desorption this indicated that both adsorption the difference between line desorbed by hcl and line in aqueous and transformation line desorbed by hcl of ttc occurred in the presence of goethite additionally several transformation products detected by uplc ms ms also strongly suggested the occurrence of ttc transformation see section 3 7 the initial drop in the ttc concentration in the aqueous phase and the constant adsorbed amount 1 2 1 6 μmol g 1 throughout the reaction period indicated that the sorption process of ttc onto goethite was sufficiently faster than the ttc transformation note that the transformation of ttc appeared to have two different stages of kinetics a relatively faster stage in the first several hours followed by a slower stage which might suggest two separate transformation mechanisms dominated each stage the elimination of ttc was therefore first ambitiously treated as two first order kinetics processes the pseudo first order rate constants of ttc transformation which were approximated by applying linear regression to each stage of the ln c c0 versus time plot fig 1 a with r2 0 94 were 0 0532 0 0110 and 0 0122 0 0008 h 1 for the first and second stage respectively a similar shape of ln c c0 versus time curve was also observed for the ttc concentration in the aqueous phase fig 1 a such kinetic behaviors were also observed with other tcs otc and ctc si figure s4 the two stage kinetic behaviors were then further explained after mechanistic investigation 3 2 mechanism for ttc transformation due to the complex nature of goethite and tcs several mechanisms might be involved in the transformation of tcs therefore different possible hypotheses were proposed and experimentally investigated including the involvement of soluble forms of iron reactive oxygen species ros and surface hydroxyl groups hypothesis i soluble fe3 contributed to ttc transformation as ttc has a strong tendency to complex with fe3 k of 109 9 albert and rees 1956 wang et al 2016 soluble fe3 dissolved from goethite may oxidize ttc through electron transfer within ttc fe3 complexes wang et al 2015 it was critical to verify whether the dissolved iron species in aqueous phase contributed to the overall transformation of ttc goethite was soaked in buffer for ten hours after which ttc was added into the filtrate no obvious transformation of ttc was observed in the filtrate of goethite fig 1 b suggesting that the soluble fe3 dissolved from goethite particles if any had a negligible effect on the ttc transformation the presence of ttc may increase the soluble iron concentrations released from goethite thus contributing to the transformation of ttc as previously demonstrated in aluminum and iron hydrous oxide system gu and karthikeyan 2005 to test the possibility of such a reaction pathway goethite was soaked in a buffer in the presence of ttc and the mixture was filtered after a contact time of 6 h the result showed that ttc was almost unchanged in the filtrate indicating that transformation of ttc in the aqueous phase was negligible even though ttc may have promoted the dissolution of goethite fig 1 b hypothesis ii fe2 oxygen or ros were responsible for ttc transformation wang et al 2016 have proposed the transformation mechanism of ttc in redox cycling of fe3 and fe2 where fe2 ttc complex was oxidized to fe3 and ttc radicals by oxygen and ros i e oh and o2 in this study a similar transformation of ttc may occur in the redox cycling of goethite and fe2 in such a mechanism oxygen and ros should be critical factors for the transformation of ttc however the addition of fe2 which is capable of consuming varieties of ros at fast rates 5 0 108 and 1 0 107 m 1 s 1 for oh and o2 respectively king et al 1995 did not decrease the transformation rates of ttc by goethite si figure s5 furthermore the presence of ros scavengers t butyl alcohol tba or superoxide dismutase sod also showed little effect on this reaction si figure s6 indicating oh or o2 did not contribute to ttc transformation to verify the role of o2 an identical experiment was conducted by n2 purging comparable transformation rates p 0 1 were observed in n2 versus air si figure s6 indicating the reaction was independent of o2 hypothesis iii surface hydroxyl groups dominated the transformation of ttc surface hydroxyl groups on goethite have been reported as major reactive sites for the transformation of multiple antibiotics sheng et al 2019a zhang and huang 2007 three kinds of hydroxyl groups singly coordinated hydroxyl feoh doubly coordinated hydroxyl fe2oh and triply coordinated hydroxyl fe3oh exist on the surface of goethite in different densities boily and felmy 2008 ding et al 2012 rustad and boily 2010 song and boily 2012 they were expected to possess different reactivities for ttc transformation as the differences in metal coordination number can strongly affect the ability of these groups to coordinate with metal ions and protons song and boily 2011 to identify the reactive hydroxyl species for the transformation of ttc a solution of naf was spiked into the reaction system to selectively substitute different types of surface hydroxyl groups with fluoride it has been reported that fluoride ions preferentially exchange with feoh with higher affinity and exchange with fe2oh with lower affinity while fe3oh remain intact ding et al 2012 hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2000 sheng et al 2019b the addition of naf significantly inhibited the ttc transformation in both reaction stages fig 2 a suggesting that feoh and fe2oh might be the dominant reactive sites for this reaction instead of fe3oh the adsorption of ttc which was studied by monitoring ttc concentration in the aqueous phase was also largely inhibited by naf si figure s7 indicating that fluoride could compete for the adsorption sites of ttc and inhibit further reactions 3 3 mechanism for two stage reaction kinetics we first ruled out the passivation effect of goethite si figure s8 goethite was aged by soaking in acetate buffer for 72 h prior to addition of ttc no difference was observed between buffer aged goethite and fresh goethite for the transformation of ttc suggesting the passivation effect of goethite under the experimental condition was negligible hypothesis i accumulation of transformation products inhibited the transformation of ttc some transformation products ttcp of ttc may strongly adsorb on the surface of goethite the accumulation of which could contribute to the decrease of surface reactive sites for ttc leading to apparent two stage kinetics herein the transformation products were detected with uplc ms ms detailed in a later section to identify whether they remained on the surface of goethite the comparison between ttcp in aqueous or ttcp desorbed with hcl suggested that no more than 20 of the major transformation products of ttc were adsorbed on goethite si figure s9 a while the majority of parent ttc was adsorbed in the identical system furthermore the competitive effect of ttcp on the adsorption of ttc was also studied by a separate experiment a mixture of ttc and ttcp was firstly obtained from the reaction system of ttc and goethite equal goethite was subsequently added into ttc solution or the mixture of ttc and ttcp respectively the result showed that the transformation products had little competitive effect on the adsorption of ttc si figure s9 b hence the effect of transformation products on the transformation rate of ttc was also negligible hypothesis ii different hydroxyl groups dominated each stage to identify the reactive hydroxyl species in the different reaction stages naf at different concentrations 2 50 mm was added to the reaction systems at the beginning of the reaction or after reacting for 6 h respectively note that the same concentration of naf exhibited different extents of inhibition in different reaction stages with a larger inhibitory extent in the first stage ks1 in fig 2 a and a smaller inhibitory extent in the second stage ks2 in fig 2 a given that fluoride ions exhibited higher adsorption affinity for feoh than fe2oh ding et al 2012 hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2000 the larger inhibitory extent in the first stage was more likely ascribed to the decrease in feoh while the smaller inhibitory in the second stage was due to the decrease in fe2oh indeed fluoride at 2 mm only resulted in a decrease of ks1 but leaving ks2 unaffected fig 2 a these results indicated that feoh dominated the first reaction stage while fe2oh were dominant in the second reaction stage hence the two stage reaction kinetics mainly ascribed to distinct reactivity between feoh and fe2oh 3 4 transformation kinetics at different reactant concentrations kinetic experiments were conducted with varying ttc concentrations 20 200 μm and a fixed goethite concentration 5 g l 1 or with varying goethite concentrations 1 20 g l 1 and a fixed ttc concentration 40 μm as expected the reaction at each reactant concentration fig 3 showed two apparent stages of first order kinetics ks1 and ks2 in h 1 were obtained si tables s1 and s2 corresponding to the first order rate constants of first and second stages respectively the turning point ts1 was determined to ensure maximal r2 for both ks1 and ks2 good fitting r2 0 92 was obtained for all experimental conditions except for the second stage at the highest goethite concentration 20 g l 1 in which the majority of ttc 80 was transformed in the first stage the first order rate constant in the first stage ks1 slightly decreased as ttc concentration increased si figure s10 a suggesting that the number of reactive sites for the first stage was limited at a fixed goethite concentration 5 g l 1 considering the first order kinetics the consumption rate of available reactive sites should be proportional to ks1 ttc which increased as ttc increasing si table s1 the reaction duration for the first stage ts1 decreased likely due to the fast consumption rate of reactive sites at higher ttc concentrations the first order rate constant at the second stage ks2 also decreased as the ttc concentration increased which may be ascribed to larger competition between ttc molecules si figure s10 a as goethite concentration increased both ks1 and ks2 increased proportionally except for ks2 at the highest concentration si figure s10 b the ts1 also increased as the goethite concentration increased it is reasonable that higher concentrations of goethite could provide more reactive sites for both reaction stages 3 5 effect of ph the speciation of ttc and surface charge of goethite can both be affected by solution ph therefore we investigated reactions under different ph 4 0 10 0 the immediate drop of ttc in aqueous phase has been observed in all studied ph conditions figure s11 indicating the reaction is a transformation governing process moreover the adsorption of ttc onto goethite showed little fluctuation with the change of ph figure s12 a hence we treated the adsorption of ttc as a very quick equilibrium process and mainly focused on the change of the transformation rate constants ks1 and ks2 fig 2 b the doubly coordinated oxygen exists as the uncharged surface species fe2oh0 independent of the solution ph kobs for the second reaction stage ks2 in which fe2oh0 is the major reactive site showed little fluctuation with the change in ph therefore different ttc species differed slightly in the interaction with fe2oh0 and ttc was considered as one species for the second reaction stage in contrast ks1 showed significant ph dependence due to the speciation shift for both feoh and ttc fig 2 b the affinity for pronation of feoh 1 2 feoh 1 2 h feoh2 1 2 is approximately equal to the pzc value of goethite hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2000 the reported range of which is 6 5 9 1 cheng et al 2019 hsu et al 2018 wu et al 2019 zhao et al 2011 ttc species may have net charges that are positive h3ttc ph 3 3 neutral h2ttc0 3 3 ph 7 68 one negative httc 7 68 ph 9 68 or two negative ttc2 ph 9 68 charges figure s12 b zhao et al 2014 the two maximum trend of ks1 indicates that at least two complexation modes between feoh and ttc were involved the fitting result suggests that the coexistence and reaction of the two complexation species including feoh2 1 2 h2ttc0 and feoh 1 2 httc could obtain similar trends to that of experimental data fig 2 b 3 6 overall reaction mechanism and kinetic model based on the analysis above a plausible reaction mechanism is proposed as follows once ttc was spiked in goethite suspension the sorption process started immediately and it was sufficiently faster than transformation in the first reaction stage ttc was adsorbed and transformed primarily by feoh with a minor contribution from fe2oh feoh reacted with ttc via two complexation species feoh2 1 2 h2ttc0 and feoh 1 2 httc depending on the solution ph while fe2oh reacted with all species of ttc independent of solution ph therefore an overall kinetic model was proposed as described in table 1 reactions 1 6 and the ph dependent species for each substance are described as reactions 7 10 a schematic diagram of the overall reaction is shown in fig 4 although the site densities of feoh or fe2oh were both reported at around 3 sites nm 2 hiemstra and van riemsdijk 1996 song and boily 2012 the effective feoh or fe2oh towards the transformation of ttc may be quite low due to the steric hindrance effect the corresponding concentrations of effective feoh or fe2oh were assumed to be proportional to the concentration of goethite si figure s13 and were both obtained in the proposed model described below subsequently the effective feoh was gradually exhausted as the reaction proceeded reactions 1 4 ceased and fe2oh became the only reactive site in the second reaction stage only reaction 5 6 proceeded all model parameters were estimated by iterations in matlab a detailed description of data fitting is provided in si text s5 briefly a set of parameters in the proposed model were first obtained at a certain concentration of ttc and goethite 40 μm for ttc and 5 g l 1 for goethite under different ph conditions si figure s11 with all r2 above 0 90 as shown in si table s3 subsequently the obtained parameters were validated to fit the experimental data of ttc under other conditions si figure s14 the overall good consistency si table s4 r2 0 92 suggests that the proposed model can provide a satisfactory explanation for this reaction sensitivity analysis was also conducted to evaluate the effect of each parameter on the model and identify the critical parameters the results show that r2 for both ttct and ttcaq changed significantly when any parameter increased or decreased by order of magnitude si table s5 and s6 indicating that the model process is strongly influenced by any parameter i e k1 k2 k3 k1 k2 and k3 therefore all these reactions are necessary for the proposed model fluoride was also introduced in the proposed model to provide a quantitative interpretation of its inhibiting effect fluoride ions were assumed to exchange hydroxyl groups with feoh and fe2oh following reactions 11 and 12 table 1 respectively the equilibrium constants kf1 and kf2 for the two reactions were also estimated by iterations and were comparable to the reported values hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2000 the model results under different naf concentrations 2 50 mm also showed good consistency with the experimental data si figure s15 and si table s7 r2 0 91 3 7 transformation products and toxicity multiple new peaks that represent the products of ttc after reacting with goethite were observed in uplc ms ms the change in the peak area for major transformation products tps is shown in fig 5 a the most prominent product detected by uplc ms ms was tp m z 417 differing by 28 da of mass with ttc si figure s16 a and b si figure s17 this was generated via n n dedimethylation on the c4 tertiary amine site of ttc due to the low bond energy between the carbon and nitrogen bond cn chen et al 2017 kumar ray et al 2019 the n n dedimethylation of tcs has been reported in many water treatment processes as well as mno2 mediated process chen et al 2017 ji et al 2016 kumar ray et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 the n dealkylation of other antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones and macrolides by iron iii or manganese iv oxides has also been previously reported feitosa felizzola et al 2009 zhang and huang 2007 2005 although the log k value of the dimethylamino group of aqueous ttc is 9 68 it is likely that after being adsorbed the positively charged goethite surfaces would facilitate the deprotonation of the dimethylamino group of ttc zhao et al 2014 after the deprotonation of this basic functional group the n demethylation product tp m z 431 and n n dedimethylation product tp m z 417 were successively generated chen et al 2017 the reaction of n demethylation might be rapid so we did not detect any n demethylation tp m z 431 product tp m z 399 si figure s16 c is likely to be the further dehydration product of tp m z 417 the toxicity of ttc and its transformation products was evaluated by the growth inhibition of e coli by ttc or reaction samples the growth inhibition towards e coli by ttc standard solutions line in fig 5 b and reaction samples were evaluated more details are described in si text s4 with the assumption that products and parent ttc did not have synergistic effects on e coli the observed inhibition of samples fig 5 b subtracted by the inhibition of the remaining ttc was used to represent the inhibition exerted by the products the inhibition of e coli significantly decreased during the reaction and almost coincided with the standard curve of ttc at the same transformation rate the results show that the transformation products of ttc throughout the reaction with goethite did not retain their toxicity towards e coli tetracyclines are known to show a broad spectrum of activity against bacterial pathogens and act through the inhibition of translation by binding to ribosomes during polypeptide elongation griffin et al 2010 lukezic et al 2019 as reported by lukezic et al 2019 the c4 dimethylaminon group is an essential group for the activity of tetracyclines and it contributes strongly to the binding of tetracycline to the ribosome therefore the results of the toxicity evaluation show that the loss of the c4 dimethylaminon group ttc to tp m z 417 may lead to a decrease in toxicity toward e coli 3 8 validation and expansion for model compounds considering that the dealkylation on amino groups is the major transformation pathway for ttc induced by goethite which has also been demonstrated for fluoroquinolones zhang and huang 2007 it is of interest to verify whether such mechanism applies to other pharmaceuticals that possess alkylamino group hence two structurally related amines n methylaniline and n n dimethylaniline were investigated as model compounds for validation and expansion of the proposed demethylation mechanism as expected n methylaniline and n n dimethylaniline were both transformed by goethite si figure s18 a the major transformation product aniline was detected in both systems si figure s18 b indicating n demethylation or n n dedimethylation occurred for n methylaniline and n n dimethylaniline respectively these results strongly imply the great possibility of dealkylation of other structurally related pharmaceuticals induced by goethite however several pharmaceuticals that contain alkyl amino moiety including pyrilamine diphenhydramine tetracaine chlorpromazine and amitriptyline showed no obvious transformation in the identical system si figure s19 a and b in contrast more than 40 of repaglinide in which the alkyl amino directly connected to a benzene ring si figure s19 a was transformed by goethite within 20 days si figure s19 c therefore the combined results may indicate the importance of conjugated pi electron moiety on the dealkylation process by goethite furthermore we analyzed 1576 commercially available fda approved drugs among which 102 drugs have a tertiary nitrogen which connects to aromatic moiety si table s8 these drugs are highly expected to undergo n dealkylation transformation and elimination of ecotoxicity similar to tcs 4 conclusions this study demonstrates that the interactions of tetracycline antibiotics with goethite are strong over a wide range of environmentally relevant conditions aside from strong and rapid adsorption goethite can transform tcs independent of dissolved oxygen the transformation kinetics and pathway of tcs as well as the corresponding ecotoxicity change are investigated for the first time based on the two stage kinetic behavior a reaction mechanism involving two different surface hydroxyl groups on goethite is proposed and a kinetic model is successfully developed the high consistency between the kinetic model and experimental data within the ph range of typical agricultural soil suggests the strong implication for pollution predication and risk assessment previous studies have illustrated the transformation pathway of tcs in the fe ii fe iii ion redox cycle in aquatic environments apart from ferrous and ferric ions goethite and other fe iii oxyhydroxides are more ubiquitous species in soil sediments and other environmental segments this study strongly emphasizes that tcs the most widely used antibiotics and their antimicrobial effects may be continuously eliminated by goethite after entering multiple environmental compartments furthermore this new environmental transformation may also apply to over one hundred fda approved drugs indeed it should be noted that although the proposed model in this study can provide an effective explanation and predication for the environmental fate and risk of tcs more studies

16967,tetracycline antibiotics tcs are a group of the top selling and widely used antibiotics that have been frequently detected in various environments the interaction between tcs and goethite α feooh one of the most common crystalline oxide minerals in aqueous environment and soil is unclear apart from adsorption this study firstly demonstrated that transformation of tetracycline ttc occurred in the presence of goethite the transformation kinetics and mechanism of ttc with goethite were investigated to gain a better understanding of the fate of tcs in the natural environment the results showed that the transformation of tcs by goethite explicitly exhibited two stage kinetics wherein an initial period of fast transformation was followed by a continuous slow transformation hydroxyl groups on goethite were identified as major reactive sites among which singly coordinated hydroxyls feoh were more reactive than doubly coordinated hydroxyls fe2oh towards the transformation of ttc on the basis of transformation rates speciation of ttc and functional groups on goethite surface a kinetic model was established successfully describing the transformation of ttc by goethite under conditions of varying reactant concentration and ph the transformation of ttc by goethite mainly resulted in a n n dedimethylation product that did not show antimicrobial properties towards escherichia coli this study indicates that fe iii hydro oxides in soils and sediments may play an important role in the natural attenuation of tetracycline antibiotics and their bioactivity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords tetracycline goethite kinetic model n n dedimethylation product toxicity 1 introduction tetracycline antibiotics tcs including tetracycline ttc oxytetracycline otc and chlorotetracycline ctc are one of the primary antibiotic groups used as veterinary drugs human medicines or feed additives in animal farms throughout the world daghrir and drogui 2013 for example tcs are the top antimicrobial drugs consumed in the u s and the european union economou and gousia 2015 sarmah et al 2006 the majority up to 75 of the parent compounds is excreted into the environment owing to the poor degradability in human or animal bodies karpov et al 2018 wang et al 2018 tcs have been widely detected in various environmental compartments including surface water gao et al 2012 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 groundwater hu et al 2010 soil and sediments daghrir and drogui 2013 the intense and long term usage of tcs can induce pharmaceutical resistance among environmental microbial populations which may pose threats to ecosystems and human health iakovides et al 2019 indeed tc resistomes are among the most detected and abundant antibiotic resistance genes in natural environment han et al 2018 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 owing to multiple o and n containing functional groups in tcs they have strong tendency to complex with metal ions wang et al 2016 2015 and are prone to adsorption and transformation by minerals in soil or river sediments chen et al 2011 figueroa et al 2004 figueroa and mackay 2005 gu and karthikeyan 2005 karpov et al 2018 tolls 2001 thus the interaction between tcs and metal species may greatly affect tcs environmental fate and ecological impacts although the transformation of tcs by several minerals such as al2o3 mno2 or montmorillonite under favorable environmental conditions has been reported in previous studies chen and huang 2010 2011 karpov et al 2018 tcs transformation by iron oxides the most abundant redox active minerals in the environments kumar et al 2018 has not been investigated one of the most prevalent iron oxides is goethite α feooh which can be found in both humid and semiarid regions and appears as the weathering product of many iron containing rocks liu et al 2014 due to its large surface area and special surface active sites goethite can strongly adsorb varieties of organic contaminants and subsequently catalyze their transformation examples may include the transformation of fluoroquinolones zhang and huang 2007 dimethoxyhydroquinone krumina et al 2017 bisphenol a bpa lin et al 2012 and amoxicillin benacherine et al 2017 although a few efforts have been made to understand the adsorption behavior of tcs on goethite wu et al 2019 zhao et al 2011 2014 information about structural transformation of tcs by goethite has been scarce which impedes assessment of the overall environmental fate and eco impact of tcs contaminants therefore this study aimed to elucidate the transformation kinetics and mechanisms of tcs by goethite the kinetics features influencing factors reactive sites transformation products and product toxicity towards e coli were firstly investigated based on these results a plausible reaction mechanism was proposed structurally related amines were also studied to further confirm this mechanism we further evaluated 1576 commercially available fda approved drugs for their potential to be transformed by goethite overall the results of this study will facilitate a more accurate assessment of the environmental behavior of tcs and dimethylaniline chemicals in soils and sediments 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagents the sources of chemicals and reagents are provided in si text s1 2 2 synthesis and characterization of goethite the synthesis of goethite is described in si text s2 the morphologies were characterized by a jem 2100f jeol japan transmission electron microscope tem si figure s1 a x ray diffraction xrd analysis si figure s1 b was performed using a d max 2500 rigaku japan diffractometer with cu kα radiation λ 0 154 nm and scanning angle of 2θ from 5 to 90 at a scanning rate of 5 min 1 the specific surface area was 62 9 m2 g 1 determined by multipoint n2 bet analysis using an asap 2460 micromeritics u s surface area analyzer 2 3 experimental setup all experiments were conducted in 30 ml screw cap amber glass bottles placed in a constant temperature chamber 25 c in the dark reaction solutions were maintained at constant ph with 10 mm buffer acetic acid sodium acetate for ph 4 5 4 morpholinepropanesulfonic acid mops and its sodium salt for ph 6 8 and 2 cyclohexylamino ethanesulfonic acid ches and its sodium salt for ph 9 10 nacl 10 mm was added to maintain a constant ionic strength the reaction was initiated by adding a known amount of ttc stock to the goethite suspension a typical concentration of 40 μm ttc and 5 g l 1 goethite were applied except when stated otherwise reaction aliquots were periodically collected to monitor the adsorption and transformation of ttc to monitor ttc in the aqueous phase aliquot of sample was taken and rapidly pushed through a membrane filter holder that housed a 0 22 μm pes membrane anpel using a 1 ml plastic syringe negligible adsorption of ttc to the membrane was confirmed through passing knowing concentration the reaction in the filtrate was immediately quenched by adding 0 1 m hcl to reach a ph of 2 0 as little ttc metal complexation occurred at this ph and the ttc was stable in hcl solutions for long periods chen and huang 2009 wang et al 2016 to desorb ttc from the goethite surface 0 1 m hcl was added to another part of the samples chen and huang 2010 the acidified samples were shaken on a constant temperature shaker at 200 rpm for 5 min and then rapidly pushed through a 0 22 μm membrane all samples were stored in 2 ml amber vials at 4 c and analyzed within 48 h for each testing parameter duplicate experiments were conducted naf was utilized to identify the reactive surface hydroxyl species for the transformation of ttc as fluoride can substitute the surface hydroxyl groups of goethite ding et al 2012 hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2000 sheng et al 2019b the solutions of naf 2 50 mm were spiked into goethite suspension 30 min prior to ttc within which the adsorption equilibrium of fluoride had been reached si figure s2 structurally related amines n methylaniline and n n dimethylaniline were investigated as model compounds other pharmaceuticals that contain alkyl amino moiety including pyrilamine diphenhydramine tetracaine chlorpromazine amitriptyline and repaglinide were also studied methanol and hcl were used as extracting solutions to desorb amines and pharmaceuticals respectively 2 4 analytical methods tcs and structurally related amines were monitored using a prominence i lc 2030 shimadzu japan reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography hplc system at a flow rate of 1

amines whereas mobile phase b was pure methanol gradient elution was performed to separate studied compounds and background matrices fluoride was monitored with a dionex ics 600 thermo usa ion chromatography ic system 2 5 products identification higher initial reactant concentrations 100 μm for ttc and 25 g l 1 for goethite were used to facilitate the identification of products from the goethite mediated transformation of ttc 0 1 m hcl to reach a ph of 2 0 was used to extract the transformation products and the remaining ttc the extraction mixtures were analyzed using a uplc ms ms

the operation conditions for mass spectrometry analysis are described in si text s3 2 6 toxicity analysis the antimicrobial properties of ttc and its transformation products were tested using escherichia coli e coli atcc 8739 optical density absorbance at 600 nm was used as an indicator of bacterial growth detailed methods are described in si text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation of ttc by goethite in the absence of goethite ttc was stable under experimental conditions and no significant loss was detected within 72 h conversely the obvious transformation of ttc occurred in the presence of goethite as shown in fig 1 a prior to transformation experiments different extracting agents had been compared among which hcl desorption had the best recovery efficiency above 92 si figure s3 and could be used to represent all the untransformed parent compounds in the aqueous phase and goethite surface an immediate drop in ttc concentrations in the aqueous phase fig 1 a suggested a fast adsorption process as the reaction proceeded the ttc concentration in the aqueous phase gradually decreased and was always lower than the corresponding ttc concentration measured with hcl desorption this indicated that both adsorption the difference between line desorbed by hcl and line in aqueous and transformation line desorbed by hcl of ttc occurred in the presence of goethite additionally several transformation products detected by uplc ms ms also strongly suggested the occurrence of ttc transformation see section 3 7 the initial drop in the ttc concentration in the aqueous phase and the constant adsorbed amount 1 2 1 6 μmol g 1 throughout the reaction period indicated that the sorption process of ttc onto goethite was sufficiently faster than the ttc transformation note that the transformation of ttc appeared to have two different stages of kinetics a relatively faster stage in the first several hours followed by a slower stage which might suggest two separate transformation mechanisms dominated each stage the elimination of ttc was therefore first ambitiously treated as two first order kinetics processes the pseudo first order rate constants of ttc transformation which were approximated by applying linear regression to each stage of the ln c c0 versus time plot fig 1 a with r2 0 94 were 0 0532 0 0110 and 0 0122 0 0008 h 1 for the first and second stage respectively a similar shape of ln c c0 versus time curve was also observed for the ttc concentration in the aqueous phase fig 1 a such kinetic behaviors were also observed with other tcs otc and ctc si figure s4 the two stage kinetic behaviors were then further explained after mechanistic investigation 3 2 mechanism for ttc transformation due to the complex nature of goethite and tcs several mechanisms might be involved in the transformation of tcs therefore different possible hypotheses were proposed and experimentally investigated including the involvement of soluble forms of iron reactive oxygen species ros and surface hydroxyl groups hypothesis i soluble fe3 contributed to ttc transformation as ttc has a strong tendency to complex with fe3 k of 109 9 albert and rees 1956 wang et al 2016 soluble fe3 dissolved from goethite may oxidize ttc through electron transfer within ttc fe3 complexes wang et al 2015 it was critical to verify whether the dissolved iron species in aqueous phase contributed to the overall transformation of ttc goethite was soaked in buffer for ten hours after which ttc was added into the filtrate no obvious transformation of ttc was observed in the filtrate of goethite fig 1 b suggesting that the soluble fe3 dissolved from goethite particles if any had a negligible effect on the ttc transformation the presence of ttc may increase the soluble iron concentrations released from goethite thus contributing to the transformation of ttc as previously demonstrated in aluminum and iron hydrous oxide system gu and karthikeyan 2005 to test the possibility of such a reaction pathway goethite was soaked in a buffer in the presence of ttc and the mixture was filtered after a contact time of 6 h the result showed that ttc was almost unchanged in the filtrate indicating that transformation of ttc in the aqueous phase was negligible even though ttc may have promoted the dissolution of goethite fig 1 b hypothesis ii fe2 oxygen or ros were responsible for ttc transformation wang et al 2016 have proposed the transformation mechanism of ttc in redox cycling of fe3 and fe2 where fe2 ttc complex was oxidized to fe3 and ttc radicals by oxygen and ros i e oh and o2 in this study a similar transformation of ttc may occur in the redox cycling of goethite and fe2 in such a mechanism oxygen and ros should be critical factors for the transformation of ttc however the addition of fe2 which is capable of consuming varieties of ros at fast rates 5 0 108 and 1 0 107 m 1 s 1 for oh and o2 respectively king et al 1995 did not decrease the transformation rates of ttc by goethite si figure s5 furthermore the presence of ros scavengers t butyl alcohol tba or superoxide dismutase sod also showed little effect on this reaction si figure s6 indicating oh or o2 did not contribute to ttc transformation to verify the role of o2 an identical experiment was conducted by n2 purging comparable transformation rates p 0 1 were observed in n2 versus air si figure s6 indicating the reaction was independent of o2 hypothesis iii surface hydroxyl groups dominated the transformation of ttc surface hydroxyl groups on goethite have been reported as major reactive sites for the transformation of multiple antibiotics sheng et al 2019a zhang and huang 2007 three kinds of hydroxyl groups singly coordinated hydroxyl feoh doubly coordinated hydroxyl fe2oh and triply coordinated hydroxyl fe3oh exist on the surface of goethite in different densities boily and felmy 2008 ding et al 2012 rustad and boily 2010 song and boily 2012 they were expected to possess different reactivities for ttc transformation as the differences in metal coordination number can strongly affect the ability of these groups to coordinate with metal ions and protons song and boily 2011 to identify the reactive hydroxyl species for the transformation of ttc a solution of naf was spiked into the reaction system to selectively substitute different types of surface hydroxyl groups with fluoride it has been reported that fluoride ions preferentially exchange with feoh with higher affinity and exchange with fe2oh with lower affinity while fe3oh remain intact ding et al 2012 hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2000 sheng et al 2019b the addition of naf significantly inhibited the ttc transformation in both reaction stages fig 2 a suggesting that feoh and fe2oh might be the dominant reactive sites for this reaction instead of fe3oh the adsorption of ttc which was studied by monitoring ttc concentration in the aqueous phase was also largely inhibited by naf si figure s7 indicating that fluoride could compete for the adsorption sites of ttc and inhibit further reactions 3 3 mechanism for two stage reaction kinetics we first ruled out the passivation effect of goethite si figure s8 goethite was aged by soaking in acetate buffer for 72 h prior to addition of ttc no difference was observed between buffer aged goethite and fresh goethite for the transformation of ttc suggesting the passivation effect of goethite under the experimental condition was negligible hypothesis i accumulation of transformation products inhibited the transformation of ttc some transformation products ttcp of ttc may strongly adsorb on the surface of goethite the accumulation of which could contribute to the decrease of surface reactive sites for ttc leading to apparent two stage kinetics herein the transformation products were detected with uplc ms ms detailed in a later section to identify whether they remained on the surface of goethite the comparison between ttcp in aqueous or ttcp desorbed with hcl suggested that no more than 20 of the major transformation products of ttc were adsorbed on goethite si figure s9 a while the majority of parent ttc was adsorbed in the identical system furthermore the competitive effect of ttcp on the adsorption of ttc was also studied by a separate experiment a mixture of ttc and ttcp was firstly obtained from the reaction system of ttc and goethite equal goethite was subsequently added into ttc solution or the mixture of ttc and ttcp respectively the result showed that the transformation products had little competitive effect on the adsorption of ttc si figure s9 b hence the effect of transformation products on the transformation rate of ttc was also negligible hypothesis ii different hydroxyl groups dominated each stage to identify the reactive hydroxyl species in the different reaction stages naf at different concentrations 2 50 mm was added to the reaction systems at the beginning of the reaction or after reacting for 6 h respectively note that the same concentration of naf exhibited different extents of inhibition in different reaction stages with a larger inhibitory extent in the first stage ks1 in fig 2 a and a smaller inhibitory extent in the second stage ks2 in fig 2 a given that fluoride ions exhibited higher adsorption affinity for feoh than fe2oh ding et al 2012 hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2000 the larger inhibitory extent in the first stage was more likely ascribed to the decrease in feoh while the smaller inhibitory in the second stage was due to the decrease in fe2oh indeed fluoride at 2 mm only resulted in a decrease of ks1 but leaving ks2 unaffected fig 2 a these results indicated that feoh dominated the first reaction stage while fe2oh were dominant in the second reaction stage hence the two stage reaction kinetics mainly ascribed to distinct reactivity between feoh and fe2oh 3 4 transformation kinetics at different reactant concentrations kinetic experiments were conducted with varying ttc concentrations 20 200 μm and a fixed goethite concentration 5 g l 1 or with varying goethite concentrations 1 20 g l 1 and a fixed ttc concentration 40 μm as expected the reaction at each reactant concentration fig 3 showed two apparent stages of first order kinetics ks1 and ks2 in h 1 were obtained si tables s1 and s2 corresponding to the first order rate constants of first and second stages respectively the turning point ts1 was determined to ensure maximal r2 for both ks1 and ks2 good fitting r2 0 92 was obtained for all experimental conditions except for the second stage at the highest goethite concentration 20 g l 1 in which the majority of ttc 80 was transformed in the first stage the first order rate constant in the first stage ks1 slightly decreased as ttc concentration increased si figure s10 a suggesting that the number of reactive sites for the first stage was limited at a fixed goethite concentration 5 g l 1 considering the first order kinetics the consumption rate of available reactive sites should be proportional to ks1 ttc which increased as ttc increasing si table s1 the reaction duration for the first stage ts1 decreased likely due to the fast consumption rate of reactive sites at higher ttc concentrations the first order rate constant at the second stage ks2 also decreased as the ttc concentration increased which may be ascribed to larger competition between ttc molecules si figure s10 a as goethite concentration increased both ks1 and ks2 increased proportionally except for ks2 at the highest concentration si figure s10 b the ts1 also increased as the goethite concentration increased it is reasonable that higher concentrations of goethite could provide more reactive sites for both reaction stages 3 5 effect of ph the speciation of ttc and surface charge of goethite can both be affected by solution ph therefore we investigated reactions under different ph 4 0 10 0 the immediate drop of ttc in aqueous phase has been observed in all studied ph conditions figure s11 indicating the reaction is a transformation governing process moreover the adsorption of ttc onto goethite showed little fluctuation with the change of ph figure s12 a hence we treated the adsorption of ttc as a very quick equilibrium process and mainly focused on the change of the transformation rate constants ks1 and ks2 fig 2 b the doubly coordinated oxygen exists as the uncharged surface species fe2oh0 independent of the solution ph kobs for the second reaction stage ks2 in which fe2oh0 is the major reactive site showed little fluctuation with the change in ph therefore different ttc species differed slightly in the interaction with fe2oh0 and ttc was considered as one species for the second reaction stage in contrast ks1 showed significant ph dependence due to the speciation shift for both feoh and ttc fig 2 b the affinity for pronation of feoh 1 2 feoh 1 2 h feoh2 1 2 is approximately equal to the pzc value of goethite hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2000 the reported range of which is 6 5 9 1 cheng et al 2019 hsu et al 2018 wu et al 2019 zhao et al 2011 ttc species may have net charges that are positive h3ttc ph 3 3 neutral h2ttc0 3 3 ph 7 68 one negative httc 7 68 ph 9 68 or two negative ttc2 ph 9 68 charges figure s12 b zhao et al 2014 the two maximum trend of ks1 indicates that at least two complexation modes between feoh and ttc were involved the fitting result suggests that the coexistence and reaction of the two complexation species including feoh2 1 2 h2ttc0 and feoh 1 2 httc could obtain similar trends to that of experimental data fig 2 b 3 6 overall reaction mechanism and kinetic model based on the analysis above a plausible reaction mechanism is proposed as follows once ttc was spiked in goethite suspension the sorption process started immediately and it was sufficiently faster than transformation in the first reaction stage ttc was adsorbed and transformed primarily by feoh with a minor contribution from fe2oh feoh reacted with ttc via two complexation species feoh2 1 2 h2ttc0 and feoh 1 2 httc depending on the solution ph while fe2oh reacted with all species of ttc independent of solution ph therefore an overall kinetic model was proposed as described in table 1 reactions 1 6 and the ph dependent species for each substance are described as reactions 7 10 a schematic diagram of the overall reaction is shown in fig 4 although the site densities of feoh or fe2oh were both reported at around 3 sites nm 2 hiemstra and van riemsdijk 1996 song and boily 2012 the effective feoh or fe2oh towards the transformation of ttc may be quite low due to the steric hindrance effect the corresponding concentrations of effective feoh or fe2oh were assumed to be proportional to the concentration of goethite si figure s13 and were both obtained in the proposed model described below subsequently the effective feoh was gradually exhausted as the reaction proceeded reactions 1 4 ceased and fe2oh became the only reactive site in the second reaction stage only reaction 5 6 proceeded all model parameters were estimated by iterations in matlab a detailed description of data fitting is provided in si text s5 briefly a set of parameters in the proposed model were first obtained at a certain concentration of ttc and goethite 40 μm for ttc and 5 g l 1 for goethite under different ph conditions si figure s11 with all r2 above 0 90 as shown in si table s3 subsequently the obtained parameters were validated to fit the experimental data of ttc under other conditions si figure s14 the overall good consistency si table s4 r2 0 92 suggests that the proposed model can provide a satisfactory explanation for this reaction sensitivity analysis was also conducted to evaluate the effect of each parameter on the model and identify the critical parameters the results show that r2 for both ttct and ttcaq changed significantly when any parameter increased or decreased by order of magnitude si table s5 and s6 indicating that the model process is strongly influenced by any parameter i e k1 k2 k3 k1 k2 and k3 therefore all these reactions are necessary for the proposed model fluoride was also introduced in the proposed model to provide a quantitative interpretation of its inhibiting effect fluoride ions were assumed to exchange hydroxyl groups with feoh and fe2oh following reactions 11 and 12 table 1 respectively the equilibrium constants kf1 and kf2 for the two reactions were also estimated by iterations and were comparable to the reported values hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2000 the model results under different naf concentrations 2 50 mm also showed good consistency with the experimental data si figure s15 and si table s7 r2 0 91 3 7 transformation products and toxicity multiple new peaks that represent the products of ttc after reacting with goethite were observed in uplc ms ms the change in the peak area for major transformation products tps is shown in fig 5 a the most prominent product detected by uplc ms ms was tp m z 417 differing by 28 da of mass with ttc si figure s16 a and b si figure s17 this was generated via n n dedimethylation on the c4 tertiary amine site of ttc due to the low bond energy between the carbon and nitrogen bond cn chen et al 2017 kumar ray et al 2019 the n n dedimethylation of tcs has been reported in many water treatment processes as well as mno2 mediated process chen et al 2017 ji et al 2016 kumar ray et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 the n dealkylation of other antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones and macrolides by iron iii or manganese iv oxides has also been previously reported feitosa felizzola et al 2009 zhang and huang 2007 2005 although the log k value of the dimethylamino group of aqueous ttc is 9 68 it is likely that after being adsorbed the positively charged goethite surfaces would facilitate the deprotonation of the dimethylamino group of ttc zhao et al 2014 after the deprotonation of this basic functional group the n demethylation product tp m z 431 and n n dedimethylation product tp m z 417 were successively generated chen et al 2017 the reaction of n demethylation might be rapid so we did not detect any n demethylation tp m z 431 product tp m z 399 si figure s16 c is likely to be the further dehydration product of tp m z 417 the toxicity of ttc and its transformation products was evaluated by the growth inhibition of e coli by ttc or reaction samples the growth inhibition towards e coli by ttc standard solutions line in fig 5 b and reaction samples were evaluated more details are described in si text s4 with the assumption that products and parent ttc did not have synergistic effects on e coli the observed inhibition of samples fig 5 b subtracted by the inhibition of the remaining ttc was used to represent the inhibition exerted by the products the inhibition of e coli significantly decreased during the reaction and almost coincided with the standard curve of ttc at the same transformation rate the results show that the transformation products of ttc throughout the reaction with goethite did not retain their toxicity towards e coli tetracyclines are known to show a broad spectrum of activity against bacterial pathogens and act through the inhibition of translation by binding to ribosomes during polypeptide elongation griffin et al 2010 lukezic et al 2019 as reported by lukezic et al 2019 the c4 dimethylaminon group is an essential group for the activity of tetracyclines and it contributes strongly to the binding of tetracycline to the ribosome therefore the results of the toxicity evaluation show that the loss of the c4 dimethylaminon group ttc to tp m z 417 may lead to a decrease in toxicity toward e coli 3 8 validation and expansion for model compounds considering that the dealkylation on amino groups is the major transformation pathway for ttc induced by goethite which has also been demonstrated for fluoroquinolones zhang and huang 2007 it is of interest to verify whether such mechanism applies to other pharmaceuticals that possess alkylamino group hence two structurally related amines n methylaniline and n n dimethylaniline were investigated as model compounds for validation and expansion of the proposed demethylation mechanism as expected n methylaniline and n n dimethylaniline were both transformed by goethite si figure s18 a the major transformation product aniline was detected in both systems si figure s18 b indicating n demethylation or n n dedimethylation occurred for n methylaniline and n n dimethylaniline respectively these results strongly imply the great possibility of dealkylation of other structurally related pharmaceuticals induced by goethite however several pharmaceuticals that contain alkyl amino moiety including pyrilamine diphenhydramine tetracaine chlorpromazine and amitriptyline showed no obvious transformation in the identical system si figure s19 a and b in contrast more than 40 of repaglinide in which the alkyl amino directly connected to a benzene ring si figure s19 a was transformed by goethite within 20 days si figure s19 c therefore the combined results may indicate the importance of conjugated pi electron moiety on the dealkylation process by goethite furthermore we analyzed 1576 commercially available fda approved drugs among which 102 drugs have a tertiary nitrogen which connects to aromatic moiety si table s8 these drugs are highly expected to undergo n dealkylation transformation and elimination of ecotoxicity similar to tcs 4 conclusions this study demonstrates that the interactions of tetracycline antibiotics with goethite are strong over a wide range of environmentally relevant conditions aside from strong and rapid adsorption goethite can transform tcs independent of dissolved oxygen the transformation kinetics and pathway of tcs as well as the corresponding ecotoxicity change are investigated for the first time based on the two stage kinetic behavior a reaction mechanism involving two different surface hydroxyl groups on goethite is proposed and a kinetic model is successfully developed the high consistency between the kinetic model and experimental data within the ph range of typical agricultural soil suggests the strong implication for pollution predication and risk assessment previous studies have illustrated the transformation pathway of tcs in the fe ii fe iii ion redox cycle in aquatic environments apart from ferrous and ferric ions goethite and other fe iii oxyhydroxides are more ubiquitous species in soil sediments and other environmental segments this study strongly emphasizes that tcs the most widely used antibiotics and their antimicrobial effects may be continuously eliminated by goethite after entering multiple environmental compartments furthermore this new environmental transformation may also apply to over one hundred fda approved drugs indeed it should be noted that although the proposed model in this study can provide an effective explanation and predication for the environmental fate and risk of tcs more studies

16968,despite receiving a considerable amount of attention in the past quantitative and systematic estimation of the source contributions for different organic carbons ocs in complex river systems is still challenging in this study we tested an integrated framework using field data of bulk elements and lipid biomarkers and hydrological modeling hydrological simulation program fortran hspf for the quantitative estimation of oc loads along different land use types of a watershed geumho river watershed in south korea based on the specific source assignments identified from the lipid biomarker patterns in particulate organic carbon poc such as short long chains of alkanes fatty acids and alcohols and coprostanol cholesterol spatial variations of the diagnostic lipids could be used as an indicator to discriminate between the contributions of natural algae bacteria and terrestrial plants and anthropogenic sources fecal based on the integration of hspf modeling it was also found that various poc loads might be partially controlled by different water discharges within watersheds with the increase in poc fluxes the increase in fecal loads was also noticed as reflected by the predominant lipid especially coprostanol normalized by water discharges as a straightforward approach we developed a set of indices including fecal index 1 ratios of coprostanol fatty acids and alkanes which strengthened the sensitivity for fecal contamination compared with the conventional hspf results the variations of these proposed indices were more influenced by the broadened watershed

aquatic systems leading to severe environmental problems such as eutrophication algal blooms and hypoxia vitousek et al 1997 smith et al 1999 naeher et al 2012 in this context quantitative assessments of oc inputs can provide a wealth of information on the management of increased oc transfer that might trigger water quality degradation and threaten water security in addition the precise

comprehensive watershed model that describes land and soil contaminant runoff processes with in stream hydraulic and sediment chemical interactions staley et al 2006 king 2010 although these models exhibit a particularly high level of accuracy in water flow simulations they still contain some uncertainties for the precise identification of oc sources due to their overdependence on vast empirical

quantitative oc loading involved in anthropogenic activities and 3 the capability of oc management for the purposes of policy setting and environmental protection to verify the effectiveness of our hypothesis we performed a case study in the complex river system where various land use types are present surrounding geumho river south korea the main objectives of this study were to 1 identify particulate organic carbon poc sources in a complex river system using the geochemical approach and 2 provide quantitative information on poc loadings from point non point sources in a river system

measured fig 2 supplementary information fig s2 the total concentrations of alkanes varied from 0 1 to 5 4 mg g poc with low molecular weight lmw alkanes alkaneslmw c26 being predominant at all sampling sites fig 2 supplementary information table s1 and at upstream sites i e w1 and k4 in particular the total concentrations of fatty acids ranged from 1 2 to 14 9 mg g poc indicating a

1 0 mg s for bacteria and 0 1 to 5 5 mg s for fecal fig 4 4 discussion 4 1 geochemical approach for source identification of oc spatial variations in toc expressed as the sum of poc and doc have been generally used as typical examples that reflect the discriminative contributions of source information for various oc origins such as terrestrial plants algae bacteria and other contaminations within aquatic carbon pools hossler and bauer 2013 in this study the variations between poc and doc showed no significant correlations along sample sites r2 0 1 moreover chl a variations showed a positive correlation with the poc profiles r2 0 80 p 0 01 see supplementary information fig s1 which was consistent with the negative correlation shown for the doc profiles r2 0 11 p 0 20 see supplementary information fig s1 these trends may suggest the discriminative origins of poc and doc probably as a result of the influence of various land uses hydrology and degradation aitkenhead peterson and mcdowell 2000 sickman et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 marwick et al 2015 δ13cpoc values as a discrimination indicator for different oc origins showed no substantial variations fig 2 these results may be regarded as the mixed contributions of different oc sources derived from various end members e g c3 terrestrial plants 35 to 21 freshwater algae and heterotrophic bacteria 39 to 6 and organic fertilizer and sludge 25 to 23 in the aquatic carbon pool meyers 1997 faure and mensing 2005 ogrinc et al 2008 lee et al 2014 derrien et al 2018 meanwhile with respect to the presence of various land use types located along the geumho river table 1 the predominant sources of doc seem to be influenced by forest and wwtp as non point and point sources respectively aitkenhead peterson and mcdowell 2000 aitkenhead peterson et al 2009 in this situation their sources may contain natural terrestrial aquatic plants algae and microbes and anthropogenic ocs fertilizer and sewage industrial wastewater as well as other additional sources such as fresh plants soil leached water and groundwater baker 2008 hudson et al 2007 carstea et al 2016 doc sources had a negligible correlation with chl a concentrations implying that the substantial inputs of doc sources may be partially related to external sources i e anthropogenic activities near wwtps agriculture and urban industrial complexes thus to distinguish the intrinsic source characterization in bulk oc sources we further investigated the spatial distributions of molecular biomarkers that provide the source specificity and conservative behavior of mixed oc the representative lipid molecules i e alkanes fatty acids alcohols and sterols provide useful information for identifying the origin of various oc sources in complex aquatic systems bourbonniere and meyers 1996 chikaraishi and naraoka 2007 derrien et al 2017 for the upstream sites especially w1 short chain alkanes and fatty acids were more dominant than the long chain alkanes fig 2 generally c16 c19 and c20 c25 alkanes are mainly derived from algae bacteria and submerged floating aquatic macrophytes respectively cranwell et al 1987 ficken et al 2000 pisani et al 2013 while long chain alkanes c27 c35 and even long chain alcohols c24 c28 mainly originate from terrestrial higher plants ficken et al 2000 van dongen et al 2008 silva et al 2012 fang et al 2014 furthermore c14 c18 fatty acids are ubiquitous and present in various oc sources including vascular plants algae and bacteria kattner et al 1983 goñi and hedges 1995 zegouagh et al 1996 the increase in these lipids at the w1 site may reflect the predominance of algae bacteria and aquatic plants in particular as fatty acids are inherently more susceptible to degradation than alkanes due to the presence of methyl groups brassell et al 1984 the predominance of total fatty acids may be regarded as the significant contribution of fresh oc sources furthermore alcohol distributions are characterized by a maxima at c28 alcohol or c26 alcohol along sampling sites indicating the presence of free alcohols rather than more refractory bound alcohols yunker et al 1995 the substantial amounts of lipid compounds such as saturated fatty acids and alcohols relative to alkanes may be reflected in the low proportion of oc decay van dongen et al 2008 therefore these results suggest the increased contribution of fresh autochthonous sources within poc samples of upstream in addition considering doc concentrations were also higher at upstream c1 and c2 of geumho river than downstream these increments may be influenced from ongoing and rapid degradation of both autochthonous allochthonous oc in such condition poc derived lipid biomarkers can be affected by biotic and abiotic processes resulting in oxidation reduction saturation e g hydrogenation and other chemical transformations bianchi and canuel 2011 although such properties could provide a partial history of the breakdown of oc as fossil biomarkers volkman 2006 this also indicate that the original function of source discrimination may be deteriorated thus with respect to the application of lipid biomarkers it is why we focus on source identification of poc in geumho river because specific biomarker information could not derived from doc as previous reported the abundances of branch chain e g i c15 0 and ai c15 0 and odd chain fatty acids e g c17 0 were more dominant in both streams i e w1 k3 and k11 fig 2 these compounds are typically regarded as the biosynthetic evidence of various bacterial communities meziane and tsuchiya 2000 zimmerman and canuel 2001 maazouzi et al 2007 waterson and canuel 2008 furthermore the mono unsaturated fatty acids e g c16 1ω5 and c18 1ω7 were predominant at some sampling sites i e c2 w1 k3 k7 k10 k11 and k12 reflecting the major contributions of specific bacterial communities within aquatic systems meziane and tsuchiya 2000 christodoulou et al 2009 given the presence of wwtps urban industrial complexes and forests the predominant bacterial signatures seem to be associated with the supply of increased nutrients discharged from wwtps and surface runoff carey and migliaccio 2009 naeher et al 2012 since the biological relationships between nutrients and microbes have been well assessed from specific fatty acid abundances their isotopic compositions may be supplemented to constrain carbon assimilation of specific microbes in the near future in this regard the information of isotopic fractionation caused by intrinsic metabolic pathways e g oxidation reduction hydrogenation and chemical transformation can be important to precisely identify the chemical link between substrates and specific microbes the concentration of total sterols showed their predominance near downstream sites w2 from the wwtps compared to upstream w1 indicating different correlations r2 0 49 p 0 20 and r2 0 16 p 0 60 respectively from the concentrations of total fatty acids these trends may be regarded as discriminative source contributions between autochthonous and allochthonous poc notably the presence of anthropogenic derived sterol such as coprostanol has been considered as an indicator of substantial fecal contamination leeming et al 1996 jardé et al 2007 martins et al 2014 derrien et al 2017 in fact given that human feces contain predominant coprostanols produced by the activities of anaerobic bacteria in human guts their presence may be considered as evidence of fecal contamination in aquatic systems derrien et al 2017 the concentrations of coprostanol at sampling sites k10 to k12 near downstream were more higher than those of sampling sites k3 and k4 near upstream wwtp this spatial difference may mainly result from the intensive human activities near the downstream wwtp compared with the ratio of coprostanol and cholesterol as typical fecal indices 0 5 quemeneur and marty 1994 fattore et al 1996 leeming et al 1996 the increasing trends may potentially reflect the fecal discharge derived from human activities near urban industrial complexes 4 2 integrated approach for estimating the quantitative contribution of poc sources 4 2 1 water discharge and poc sources based on nmds analysis significance 0 15 variable vectors of relative lipid abundance normalized via discharged water volumes showed distinct patterns among representative sampling sites i e k1 c2 w1 k3 k5 c4 c5 w2 k10 k11 and k12 that contained the dominant land use types fig 3 first of all the downstream sites k10 to k12 including the wwtp w2 were related to coprostanol and c25 c35 alkanes reflecting the contribution of feces and terrestrial aquatic plants eglinton and hamilton 1967 ficken et al 2000 derrien et al 2017 second the upstream sites c2 and k5 near another wwtp were characterized by the dominance of c18 1ω7 c20 and c22 alkanes indicating the source of bacteria and algae mead et al 2005 christodoulou et al 2009 third the other upstream sites k1 k3 c4 and c5 which were grouped by c17 alkanes were indicative of aquatic algal inputs meyers and ishiwatari 1993 finally the wwtp w1 was associated with the c18 alkane derived from algal origins meyers and ishiwatari 1993 according to the four groups categorized through discriminative molecular fingerprints the spatial variation of poc sources appears to be influenced by abiotic and biotic components such as hydrodynamic conditions light temperature water discharge and bacterial degradation in the river system wilson and xenopoulos 2009 williams et al 2010 lu et al 2014 among these as various poc sources are commonly derived from drainage basins their abundances typically co vary with water discharge duan et al 2007 cai et al 2016 the enhanced supply of nutrients into the mainstream especially in aquatic environments may lead to excessive internal and or external production under varied water discharges smith 2003 le et al 2014 actually in case of our study sites including 12 mainstream 5 tributary and 2 wwtps various ocs derived from point non point sources are heterogeneously transporting into mainstream indicating typical characteristics of natural river system kim and nam 2009 in addition we confirmed discriminative water discharges at each sampling site from upstream to downstream by investigating water quality e g water discharge nutrient toc and biological oxygen demand occurred during sampling periods these typical characteristics related to varied water discharges may exclude spatial autocorrelation between the sampling sites thus considering that the overall poc variations may be controlled by the net effect of the external driver i e water discharge in the river system the varied water discharge seems to play an important role in exporting discriminative poc loads up and downstream of the geumho river to validate our inference we integrated the water discharge based on the time series results of the hspf model as a possible environmental factor the concentrations of poc and molecular biomarkers were normalized through the water discharges investigated at mainstream sites k1 k3 k5 k10 k11 and k12 fig 4 in addition to the spatial variation of water discharges 0 1 16 5 m3 s and land use types the increased poc fluxes 62 6 g s appear to be associated with active human activities at the sites from k10 to k12 fig 4 similarly the water discharge normalized molecular profiles in the forest agriculture and urban industrial complex showed remarkable variations between the upstream and downstream sites fig 4 particularly after passing through the w2 site the increase in each profile from k10 to k12 may result from the wwtp effluents as rivers and streams near populated areas typically contain elevated levels of many solutes marti et al 2004 carey and milgliaccio 2009 the distinct increments of poc fluxes may be accompanied by substantial inputs of various origins i e terrestrial aquatic plants algae bacteria and feces considering the high level of human activities downstream in this regard the wwtp as the point source for nutrient enrichment e g phosphorus and or nitrogen can be a significant contributor to nutrient loads in rivers and streams haggard et al 2005 ekka et al 2006 migliaccio et al 2007 in fact wwtp effluents may excessively stimulate the contribution of autochthonous pocs i e algae and bacteria under increased water discharge haggard et al 2005 moreover considering the contribution of allochthonous pocs i e feces may be often assigned to higher proportions near the wwtp carey and migliaccio 2009 these fecal sources near the downstream wwtp appear to be substantially exported to the large watershed of the geumho river thus we suggest that water discharge may be an important parameter for the quantitative estimation of various poc inputs in the complex river system which includes active human interventions 4 2 2 quantitative estimation of poc inputs in complex river system based on the indices applicable for the integrated approaches such as field sampling molecular biomarkers and water discharge this study aimed to estimate quantitative poc inputs in the geumho river as a case study for complex river systems fig 5 first the source identification of poc discriminating autochthonous and allochthonous origins was confirmed by diagnostic lipids i e alkanes fatty acids and coprostanol with respect to the spatial variation of these compounds the increase in various poc sources e g algae bacteria and feces may have been mainly influenced by human activities such as agriculture urban industry complexes and wwtps second according to variations in water discharge from upstream to downstream the substantial input of each poc source was estimated using the lipid based organic sources finally the spatial variations of these poc inputs were compared with those of the hspf based toc flux fig 5 indicating some bias for substantial poc inputs derived from land use types in the near downstream regions compared with lipid based organic sources the hspf based toc flux may be additionally reflected in the export of doc sources involved in erosion from forested areas as well as the wwtp effluent in addition the quantitative difference between both approaches may result from the hydrological impact of external factors such as the broadening of the extent of the watersheds downstream thus to estimate the precise quantities of poc loading occurring near active human interventions downstream a more straightforward approach is required for the diagnosis of anthropogenic poc inputs in aquatic system the use of steroids the ratio of coprostanol and cholesterol leeming et al 1996 have been often proposed as an typical index for fecal contamination related to wastewater discharge leeming et al 1996 chan et al 1998 carreira et al 2004 reeves and patton 2005 wu et al 2009 however in the geumho river with complex poc inputs this index showed moderate sensitivity r2 0 55 for increased urban industrial inputs supplementary information fig s4 it is notable that cholesterol as a non specific source is a dominant sterol derived from various living organisms in previous studies volkman 1986 and bouloubassi et al 1997 highlighted the concern of their ubiquity which might lead to potentially equivocal source assignments for instance cholesterols are known to be a dominant component of algae and bacteria while they are also produced from terrestrial plants volkman 1986 bouloubassi et al 1997 alternatively the combination of coprostanol and other lipids i e fatty acids c16 0 c18 1ω7 and alkanes c27 c29 c31 revealed an enhanced sensitivity for increased urban industrial inputs supplementary information fig s4 the ratio of coprostanol and other lipids fecal index 1 ranged from 0 1 to 0 4 notably the regression trends between fecal index 1 and urban industrial inputs showed more significant correlations r2 0 88 p 0 01 than those of other indices fecal index r2 0 55 p 0 10 and fecal index 2 r2 0 05 p 0 70 we infer that the source appointment of specific oc biomarkers e g algae terrestrial plants and fecal can be considered as more precise indicator for tracing anthropogenic ocs thus the ratios of coprostanol and other specific lipids can be suggested as an alternative index herein fecal index 1 to provide a higher sensitivity for fecal contamination fecal index 1 as an alternative approach showed substantial variations along the main streams fig 6 and supplementary information fig s4 compared with the relative proportions of hspf based oc sources the higher values of fecal index 1 at k10 may be closely associated with the increased fecal inputs under the dominant urban industrial complex near the downstream site of the wwtp meanwhile despite the dominance of the urban industrial complex near the upstream wwtp k3 the substantial contribution of fecal inputs might be underestimated under low poc fluxes considering the variations of watershed extents along the geumho river the poc loading may lead to an overestimation or underestimation with varying water discharges therefore our integrated approach including fecal index 1 can be more effective for the precise estimation of poc loadings in complex river systems moreover to effectively control anthropogenic sources derived from human activities local hydrological conditions may be considered as a critical component for management decisions in complex river systems from the upstream to downstream regions along with the variations in water discharge in downstream flow this fecal index 1 as a complementary fecal fingerprint may provide an effective diagnosis for source identification under a situation of increasing poc flux with increasing downstream distance meanwhile considering lipid compositions presented in doc may be characterized with poor sensitivities by degradation effects volkman 2006 the trace of doc ongoing may be well constrained by using spectroscopic indices e g hix fi bix suva derrien et al 2017 in near future we are going to intregrate this valuable information on mixed contribution of poc and doc by comparing the spatial distributions of doc sources to date there is no noticeable method for effectively tracing the origins of specific poc sources in surface waters worldwide notably there are some limitations associated with simplifying assumptions and omitted parameters as it is difficult to directly compare poc inputs between different river systems for instance the possibility of incorporating all conspicuous factors e g rainfall irrigation and groundwater interactions should be explored in future analysis with more sampling collections although this approach may lead to difficulties when applied to more complicated and larger river systems our main achievement can be highlighted as the useful approach to quantitatively estimating poc sources in complex river system which is characterized with various land use types in addition real time sampling over long periods would be beneficial to capture the spatial temporal variability based on our proposed framework thus our approach can be applied for more accurate forecasts about the temporal and spatial distributions of various poc sources which could assist with the potential government policies based on environmental goals for sustainable riverine management and development 5 conclusions we estimated the quantitative contribution of poc input in a complex river system by integrating stable carbon isotopes molecular biomarkers and hydrological modeling fig 7 here the case study of the geumho river highlights that this initial framework is an effective approach to assess the quantitative contribution of natural and anthropogenic poc sources along various land use types based on this integrated approach our results indicate that high levels of human activities have significant impacts downstream and play an important role in the increase in poc loads within the geumho river nevertheless the results of oc export estimations obtained through this framework are still subject to uncertainty arising from several sources in particular the manual field sampling may introduce some uncertainty because of the spatial heterogeneity of oc and sediment within the river system this may directly influence the variation of oc abundances resulting in uncertainty in the total oc exports multiple repeated sampling collections and standard measurements could minimize this uncertainty with respect to the transferability of fecal index 1 as suggested by this study further consideration through seasonal sampling collections may be necessary to more strengthen our current step in addition the hydrological model contains empirical formulas and complicated parameters to enable simplification these simplifications in rainy simulations could introduce some uncertainty in the water flow simulation results and eventually influence the total oc export calculation however to improve the hydrological simulation process the performance for independent calibration for rainy processes may dramatically decrease the uncertainty of the model simulations in spite of these limitations we highlight that the general framework and methodology presented here may be applicable and suitable for other larger aquatic systems with more complicated interactions thus future applications should incorporate agricultural aquacultural forestry and even isotope models into the presented framework this developed approach will make important contribution to precisely estimating poc sources in complex river system which is characterized with mixed contribution

16968,despite receiving a considerable amount of attention in the past quantitative and systematic estimation of the source contributions for different organic carbons ocs in complex river systems is still challenging in this study we tested an integrated framework using field data of bulk elements and lipid biomarkers and hydrological modeling hydrological simulation program fortran hspf for the quantitative estimation of oc loads along different land use types of a watershed geumho river watershed in south korea based on the specific source assignments identified from the lipid biomarker patterns in particulate organic carbon poc such as short long chains of alkanes fatty acids and alcohols and coprostanol cholesterol spatial variations of the diagnostic lipids could be used as an indicator to discriminate between the contributions of natural algae bacteria and terrestrial plants and anthropogenic sources fecal based on the integration of hspf modeling it was also found that various poc loads might be partially controlled by different water discharges within watersheds with the increase in poc fluxes the increase in fecal loads was also noticed as reflected by the predominant lipid especially coprostanol normalized by water discharges as a straightforward approach we developed a set of indices including fecal index 1 ratios of coprostanol fatty acids and alkanes which strengthened the sensitivity for fecal contamination compared with the conventional hspf results the variations of these proposed indices were more influenced by the broadened watershed extents with increasing downstream distance which provided a more accurate estimation of the quantitative contributions of poc loadings in the complex river system graphical abstract image graphical

of oc inputs can provide a wealth of information on the management of increased oc transfer that might trigger water quality degradation and threaten water security in addition the precise

comprehensive watershed model that describes land and soil contaminant runoff processes with in stream hydraulic and sediment chemical interactions staley et al 2006 king 2010 although these models exhibit a particularly high level of accuracy in water flow simulations they still contain some uncertainties for the precise identification of oc sources due to their overdependence on vast empirical

quantitative oc loading involved in anthropogenic activities and 3 the capability of oc management for the purposes of policy setting and environmental protection to verify the effectiveness of our hypothesis we performed a case study in the complex river system where various land use types are present surrounding geumho river south korea the main objectives of this study were to 1 identify

indicating a significant increase at the downstream sites k10 k11 and k12 fig 4 the influx of various pocs ranged from 0 1 to 3 2 mg s for terrestrial aquatic plants 3 4 to 55 9 mg s for algae 0 1 to 1 0 mg s for bacteria and 0 1 to 5 5 mg s for fecal fig 4 4 discussion 4 1 geochemical approach for source identification of oc spatial variations in toc expressed as the sum of poc and doc have been generally used as typical examples that reflect the discriminative contributions of source information for various oc origins such as terrestrial plants algae bacteria and other contaminations within aquatic carbon pools hossler and bauer 2013 in this study the variations between poc and doc showed no significant correlations along sample sites r2 0 1 moreover chl a variations showed a positive correlation with the poc profiles r2 0 80 p 0 01 see supplementary information fig s1 which was consistent with the negative correlation shown for the doc profiles r2 0 11 p 0 20 see supplementary information fig s1 these trends may suggest the discriminative origins of poc and doc probably as a result of the influence of various land uses hydrology and degradation aitkenhead peterson and mcdowell 2000 sickman et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 marwick et al 2015 δ13cpoc values as a discrimination indicator for different oc origins showed no substantial variations fig 2 these results may be regarded as the mixed contributions of different oc sources derived from various end members e g c3 terrestrial plants 35 to 21 freshwater algae and heterotrophic bacteria 39 to 6 and organic fertilizer and sludge 25 to 23 in the aquatic carbon pool meyers 1997 faure and mensing 2005 ogrinc et al 2008 lee et al 2014 derrien et al 2018 meanwhile with respect to the presence of various land use types located along the geumho river table 1 the predominant sources of doc seem to be influenced by forest and wwtp as non point and point sources respectively aitkenhead peterson and mcdowell 2000 aitkenhead peterson et al 2009 in this situation their sources may contain natural terrestrial aquatic plants algae and microbes and anthropogenic ocs fertilizer and sewage industrial wastewater as well as other additional sources such as fresh plants soil leached water and groundwater baker 2008 hudson et al 2007 carstea et al 2016 doc sources had a negligible correlation with chl a concentrations implying that the substantial inputs of doc sources may be partially related to external sources i e anthropogenic activities near wwtps agriculture and urban industrial complexes thus to distinguish the intrinsic source characterization in bulk oc sources we further investigated the spatial distributions of molecular biomarkers that provide the source specificity and conservative behavior of mixed oc the representative lipid molecules i e alkanes fatty acids alcohols and sterols provide useful information for identifying the origin of various oc sources in complex aquatic systems bourbonniere and meyers 1996 chikaraishi and naraoka 2007 derrien et al 2017 for the upstream sites especially w1 short chain alkanes and fatty acids were more dominant than the long chain alkanes fig 2 generally c16 c19 and c20 c25 alkanes are mainly derived from algae bacteria and submerged floating aquatic macrophytes respectively cranwell et al 1987 ficken et al 2000 pisani et al 2013 while long chain alkanes c27 c35 and even long chain alcohols c24 c28 mainly originate from terrestrial higher plants ficken et al 2000 van dongen et al 2008 silva et al 2012 fang et al 2014 furthermore c14 c18 fatty acids are ubiquitous and present in various oc sources including vascular plants algae and bacteria kattner et al 1983 goñi and hedges 1995 zegouagh et al 1996 the increase in these lipids at the w1 site may reflect the predominance of algae bacteria and aquatic plants in particular as fatty acids are inherently more susceptible to degradation than alkanes due to the presence of methyl groups brassell et al 1984 the predominance of total fatty acids may be regarded as the significant contribution of fresh oc sources furthermore alcohol distributions are characterized by a maxima at c28 alcohol or c26 alcohol along sampling sites indicating the presence of free alcohols rather than more refractory bound alcohols yunker et al 1995 the substantial amounts of lipid compounds such as saturated fatty acids and alcohols relative to alkanes may be reflected in the low proportion of oc decay van dongen et al 2008 therefore these results suggest the increased contribution of fresh autochthonous sources within poc samples of upstream in addition considering doc concentrations were also higher at upstream c1 and c2 of geumho river than downstream these increments may be influenced from ongoing and rapid degradation of both autochthonous allochthonous oc in such condition poc derived lipid biomarkers can be affected by biotic and abiotic processes resulting in oxidation reduction saturation e g hydrogenation and other chemical transformations bianchi and canuel 2011 although such properties could provide a partial history of the breakdown of oc as fossil biomarkers volkman 2006 this also indicate that the original function of source discrimination may be deteriorated thus with respect to the application of lipid biomarkers it is why we focus on source identification of poc in geumho river because specific biomarker information could not derived from doc as previous reported the abundances of branch chain e g i c15 0 and ai c15 0 and odd chain fatty acids e g c17 0 were more dominant in both streams i e w1 k3 and k11 fig 2 these compounds are typically regarded as the biosynthetic evidence of various bacterial communities meziane and tsuchiya 2000 zimmerman and canuel 2001 maazouzi et al 2007 waterson and canuel 2008 furthermore the mono unsaturated fatty acids e g c16 1ω5 and c18 1ω7 were predominant at some sampling sites i e c2 w1 k3 k7 k10 k11 and k12 reflecting the major contributions of specific bacterial communities within aquatic systems meziane and tsuchiya 2000 christodoulou et al 2009 given the presence of wwtps urban industrial complexes and forests the predominant bacterial signatures seem to be associated with the supply of increased nutrients discharged from wwtps and surface runoff carey and migliaccio 2009 naeher et al 2012 since the biological relationships between nutrients and microbes have been well assessed from specific fatty acid abundances their isotopic compositions may be supplemented to constrain carbon assimilation of specific microbes in the near future in this regard the information of isotopic fractionation caused by intrinsic metabolic pathways e g oxidation reduction hydrogenation and chemical transformation can be important to precisely identify the chemical link between substrates and specific microbes the concentration of total sterols showed their predominance near downstream sites w2 from the wwtps compared to upstream w1 indicating different correlations r2 0 49 p 0 20 and r2 0 16 p 0 60 respectively from the concentrations of total fatty acids these trends may be regarded as discriminative source contributions between autochthonous and allochthonous poc notably the presence of anthropogenic derived sterol such as coprostanol has been considered as an indicator of substantial fecal contamination leeming et al 1996 jardé et al 2007 martins et al 2014 derrien et al 2017 in fact given that human feces contain predominant coprostanols produced by the activities of anaerobic bacteria in human guts their presence may be considered as evidence of fecal contamination in aquatic systems derrien et al 2017 the concentrations of coprostanol at sampling sites k10 to k12 near downstream were more higher than those of sampling sites k3 and k4 near upstream wwtp this spatial difference may mainly result from the intensive human activities near the downstream wwtp compared with the ratio of coprostanol and cholesterol as typical fecal indices 0 5 quemeneur and marty 1994 fattore et al 1996 leeming et al 1996 the increasing trends may potentially reflect the fecal discharge derived from human activities near urban industrial complexes 4 2 integrated approach for estimating the quantitative contribution of poc sources 4 2 1 water discharge and poc sources based on nmds analysis significance 0 15 variable vectors of relative lipid abundance normalized via discharged water volumes showed distinct patterns among representative sampling sites i e k1 c2 w1 k3 k5 c4 c5 w2 k10 k11 and k12 that contained the dominant land use types fig 3 first of all the downstream sites k10 to k12 including the wwtp w2 were related to coprostanol and c25 c35 alkanes reflecting the contribution of feces and terrestrial aquatic plants eglinton and hamilton 1967 ficken et al 2000 derrien et al 2017 second the upstream sites c2 and k5 near another wwtp were characterized by the dominance of c18 1ω7 c20 and c22 alkanes indicating the source of bacteria and algae mead et al 2005 christodoulou et al 2009 third the other upstream sites k1 k3 c4 and c5 which were grouped by c17 alkanes were indicative of aquatic algal inputs meyers and ishiwatari 1993 finally the wwtp w1 was associated with the c18 alkane derived from algal origins meyers and ishiwatari 1993 according to the four groups categorized through discriminative molecular fingerprints the spatial variation of poc sources appears to be influenced by abiotic and biotic components such as hydrodynamic conditions light temperature water discharge and bacterial degradation in the river system wilson and xenopoulos 2009 williams et al 2010 lu et al 2014 among these as various poc sources are commonly derived from drainage basins their abundances typically co vary with water discharge duan et al 2007 cai et al 2016 the enhanced supply of nutrients into the mainstream especially in aquatic environments may lead to excessive internal and or external production under varied water discharges smith 2003 le et al 2014 actually in case of our study sites including 12 mainstream 5 tributary and 2 wwtps various ocs derived from point non point sources are heterogeneously transporting into mainstream indicating typical characteristics of natural river system kim and nam 2009 in addition we confirmed discriminative water discharges at each sampling site from upstream to downstream by investigating water quality e g water discharge nutrient toc and biological oxygen demand occurred during sampling periods these typical characteristics related to varied water discharges may exclude spatial autocorrelation between the sampling sites thus considering that the overall poc variations may be controlled by the net effect of the external driver i e water discharge in the river system the varied water discharge seems to play an important role in exporting discriminative poc loads up and downstream of the geumho river to validate our inference we integrated the water discharge based on the time series results of the hspf model as a possible environmental factor the concentrations of poc and molecular biomarkers were normalized through the water discharges investigated at mainstream sites k1 k3 k5 k10 k11 and k12 fig 4 in addition to the spatial variation of water discharges 0 1 16 5 m3 s and land use types the increased poc fluxes 62 6 g s appear to be associated with active human activities at the sites from k10 to k12 fig 4 similarly the water discharge normalized molecular profiles in the forest agriculture and urban industrial complex showed remarkable variations between the upstream and downstream sites fig 4 particularly after passing through the w2 site the increase in each profile from k10 to k12 may result from the wwtp effluents as rivers and streams near populated areas typically contain elevated levels of many solutes marti et al 2004 carey and milgliaccio 2009 the distinct increments of poc fluxes may be accompanied by substantial inputs of various origins i e terrestrial aquatic plants algae bacteria and feces considering the high level of human activities downstream in this regard the wwtp as the point source for nutrient enrichment e g phosphorus and or nitrogen can be a significant contributor to nutrient loads in rivers and streams haggard et al 2005 ekka et al 2006 migliaccio et al 2007 in fact wwtp effluents may excessively stimulate the contribution of autochthonous pocs i e algae and bacteria under increased water discharge haggard et al 2005 moreover considering the contribution of allochthonous pocs i e feces may be often assigned to higher proportions near the wwtp carey and migliaccio 2009 these fecal sources near the downstream wwtp appear to be substantially exported to the large watershed of the geumho river thus we suggest that water discharge may be an important parameter for the quantitative estimation of various poc inputs in the complex river system which includes active human interventions 4 2 2 quantitative estimation of poc inputs in complex river system based on the indices applicable for the integrated approaches such as field sampling molecular biomarkers and water discharge this study aimed to estimate quantitative poc inputs in the geumho river as a case study for complex river systems fig 5 first the source identification of poc discriminating autochthonous and allochthonous origins was confirmed by diagnostic lipids i e alkanes fatty acids and coprostanol with respect to the spatial variation of these compounds the increase in various poc sources e g algae bacteria and feces may have been mainly influenced by human activities such as agriculture urban industry complexes and wwtps second according to variations in water discharge from upstream to downstream the substantial input of each poc source was estimated using the lipid based organic sources finally the spatial variations of these poc inputs were compared with those of the hspf based toc flux fig 5 indicating some bias for substantial poc inputs derived from land use types in the near downstream regions compared with lipid based organic sources the hspf based toc flux may be additionally reflected in the export of doc sources involved in erosion from forested areas as well as the wwtp effluent in addition the quantitative difference between both approaches may result from the hydrological impact of external factors such as the broadening of the extent of the watersheds downstream thus to estimate the precise quantities of poc loading occurring near active human interventions downstream a more straightforward approach is required for the diagnosis of anthropogenic poc inputs in aquatic system the use of steroids the ratio of coprostanol and cholesterol leeming et al 1996 have been often proposed as an typical index for fecal contamination related to wastewater discharge leeming et al 1996 chan et al 1998 carreira et al 2004 reeves and patton 2005 wu et al 2009 however in the geumho river with complex poc inputs this index showed moderate sensitivity r2 0 55 for increased urban industrial inputs supplementary information fig s4 it is notable that cholesterol as a non specific source is a dominant sterol derived from various living organisms in previous studies volkman 1986 and bouloubassi et al 1997 highlighted the concern of their ubiquity which might lead to potentially equivocal source assignments for instance cholesterols are known to be a dominant component of algae and bacteria while they are also produced from terrestrial plants volkman 1986 bouloubassi et al 1997 alternatively the combination of coprostanol and other lipids i e fatty acids c16 0 c18 1ω7 and alkanes c27 c29 c31 revealed an enhanced sensitivity for increased urban industrial inputs supplementary information fig s4 the ratio of coprostanol and other lipids fecal index 1 ranged from 0 1 to 0 4 notably the regression trends between fecal index 1 and urban industrial inputs showed more significant correlations r2 0 88 p 0 01 than those of other indices fecal index r2 0 55 p 0 10 and fecal index 2 r2 0 05 p 0 70 we infer that the source appointment of specific oc biomarkers e g algae terrestrial plants and fecal can be considered as more precise indicator for tracing anthropogenic ocs thus the ratios of coprostanol and other specific lipids can be suggested as an alternative index herein fecal index 1 to provide a higher sensitivity for fecal contamination fecal index 1 as an alternative approach showed substantial variations along the main streams fig 6 and supplementary information fig s4 compared with the relative proportions of hspf based oc sources the higher values of fecal index 1 at k10 may be closely associated with the increased fecal inputs under the dominant urban industrial complex near the downstream site of the wwtp meanwhile despite the dominance of the urban industrial complex near the upstream wwtp k3 the substantial contribution of fecal inputs might be underestimated under low poc fluxes considering the variations of watershed extents along the geumho river the poc loading may lead to an overestimation or underestimation with varying water discharges therefore our integrated approach including fecal index 1 can be more effective for the precise estimation of poc loadings in complex river systems moreover to effectively control anthropogenic sources derived from human activities local hydrological conditions may be considered as a critical component for management decisions in complex river systems from the upstream to downstream regions along with the variations in water discharge in downstream flow this fecal index 1 as a complementary fecal fingerprint may provide an effective diagnosis for source identification under a situation of increasing poc flux with increasing downstream distance meanwhile considering lipid compositions presented in doc may be characterized with poor sensitivities by degradation effects volkman 2006 the trace of doc ongoing may be well constrained by using spectroscopic indices e g hix fi bix suva derrien et al 2017 in near future we are going to intregrate this valuable information on mixed contribution of poc and doc by comparing the spatial distributions of doc sources to date there is no noticeable method for effectively tracing the origins of specific poc sources in surface waters worldwide notably there are some limitations associated with simplifying assumptions and omitted parameters as it is difficult to directly compare poc inputs between different river systems for instance the possibility of incorporating all conspicuous factors e g rainfall irrigation and groundwater interactions should be explored in future analysis with more sampling collections although this approach may lead to difficulties when applied to more complicated and larger river systems our main achievement can be highlighted as the useful approach to quantitatively estimating poc sources in complex river system which is characterized with various land use types in addition real time sampling over long periods would be beneficial to capture the spatial temporal variability based on our proposed framework thus our approach can be applied for more accurate forecasts about the temporal and spatial distributions of various poc sources which could assist with the potential government policies based on environmental goals for sustainable riverine management and development 5 conclusions we estimated the quantitative contribution of poc input in a complex river system by integrating stable carbon isotopes molecular biomarkers and hydrological modeling fig 7 here the case study of the geumho river highlights that this initial framework is an effective approach to assess the quantitative contribution of natural and anthropogenic poc sources along various land use types based on this integrated approach our results indicate that high levels of human activities have significant impacts downstream and play an important role in the increase in poc loads within the geumho river nevertheless the results of oc export estimations obtained through this framework are still subject to uncertainty arising from several sources in particular the manual field sampling may introduce some uncertainty because of the spatial heterogeneity of oc and sediment within the river system this may directly influence the variation of oc abundances resulting in uncertainty in the total oc exports multiple repeated sampling collections and standard measurements could minimize this uncertainty with respect to the transferability of fecal index 1 as suggested by this study further consideration through seasonal sampling collections may be necessary to more strengthen our current step in addition the hydrological model contains empirical formulas and complicated parameters to enable simplification these simplifications in rainy simulations could introduce some uncertainty in the water flow simulation results and eventually influence the total oc export calculation however to improve the hydrological simulation process the performance for independent calibration for rainy processes may dramatically decrease the uncertainty of the model simulations in spite of these limitations we highlight that the general framework and methodology presented here may be applicable and suitable for other larger aquatic systems with more complicated interactions thus future applications should incorporate agricultural aquacultural forestry and even isotope models into the presented framework this developed approach will make important contribution to precisely estimating poc sources in complex river system which is characterized with mixed contribution

16969,impacts from urban wastewater treatment plants wwtp to receiving riverine surface water bodies swbs depend on the load of contaminants discharged as well as on their dilution capacity yet climate change impacts on such dilution capacity and ultimately on the swbs ecological status remain unclear here we assess swbs dilution capacity across the european continent to identify most vulnerable areas using information from centralized european databases swbs future dilution factor values are estimated based on representative concentration pathway scenarios impacts on rivers flow and likely changes in european swbs ecological status foretold results show that dilution factor in europe increases by 5 4 in average yet climate change effects are found to lead to a consistent dilution factor decrease for 11 of the 40074 european swbs receiving wwtp discharge for the early century this share reaches 17 for the midcentury period we estimate that up to 42 of the swbs receiving wwtp discharges and currently reaching a good ecological status show a 0 7 probability to have their ecological status downgraded due to climate change sites more vulnerable are located in the mediterranean countries our findings highlight that climate change mitigation is essential for maintaining good ecological status in european swbs graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction assessing the impacts of our society on freshwater ecosystems is key to their current and future preservation united nations 2012 grigs et al 2013 birk et al 2020 treated urban wastewater discharged to rivers conveys contaminants which might impact receiving freshwater ecosystems and compromise downstream water uses the aftermath on receiving freshwater ecosystems depends on the load of contaminants in the discharged treated wastewater as well as on the dilution capacity of the receiving ecosystem in that regard wastewater sanitation infrastructures thacker et al 2019 and wastewater management strategies tortajada 2020 are crucial to meet several of the sustainable development goals i e 6 clean water and sanitation 11 sustainable cities and communities or 13 climate action and targets set by the un agenda 2030 united nations 2015 united nations 2018 rivers capacity to dilute wastewater treatment plants wwtp discharges i e the dilution factor df is the ratio between the river flow and the wwtp discharge and has been estimated up to national and subcontinental scales i e u s a china to assess wwtp impacts on receiving freshwater resources rice westerhoff 2017 wang et al 2017 nguyen et al 2018 however the df has not been assessed in the european river networks except for germany link et al 2017 here we assessed the df at the european hydrographic network scale using the urban wwtp database from the european environmental agency waterbase uwwtd eea 2020 and the eu river surface water bodies swbs yearly average flow estimates from copernicus datastore platform e hype hydrological model results donnelly et al 2016 ecmwf 2020 our goals were to assess the differences in the df across the continent to identify the most vulnerable areas in the eu to wwtp discharges i to assess to which extent the df is correlated with the ecological status as indicator of the impact on receiving ecosystems ii and to predict how the df might change under different climate change scenarios thus identifying not only the current vulnerable areas but also the future vulnerable areas iii we focused on ecological status rather than on chemical status or the specific concentration of selected contaminants because the ecological status reflects the impact of multiple stressors including contaminants from wwtp on freshwater ecosystems and is a key environmental goal of the eu water framework directive eu 2000 our hypotheses were that the amount of discharged wastewater rather than the river flow would explain the vulnerable areas in europe i that the swbs ecological status classification would thus be connected to the df levels ii and that the mediterranean areas of europe would be the most sensitive to climate change with the highest reduction in the df iii the rationale of the hypothesis i is that we expect the variability in river flows to be lower than the variability in the wwtp discharge across europe keller et al 2014 regarding the hypothesis ii the rationale is that treated wwtp discharges are known to impact freshwater ecological status in several ways from the indirect effects in the community by changes associated with the excessive algal growth by discharged nutrients carey and migliaccio 2009 yang et al 2019 to the direct effects of contaminants of emerging concern loss et al 2013 nguyen et al 2018 finally the rationale for hypothesis iii is that river flows in the mediterranean region are already experiencing decreases and are predicted to further decrease in the coming decades schneider et al 2013 2 materials and methods df is here calculated not as the df of a given wwtp in a given river point or segment but as the sum of the wwtp discharges in a given river network upstream of the considered river surface water body swbs df is computed using such conservative approach for each receiving stream as follow 1 1 d f q r q w w t p q w w t p where q r is the river flow and q w w t p is the cumulated wwtp discharge resulting from the sum of the discharges in the river network upstream from the discharge point both in m3 s 1 and based on yearly averages estimates thus the df was calculated for each swbs estimating the pan european q w w t p in the river network produced using the waterdatabase uwwtd from the european environmental agency eea 2020 and using eu river swbs yearly average flow estimates from copernicus datastore platform e hype hydrological model results donnelly et al 2016 ecmwf 2020 2 1 european wastewater data the yearly volume of wastewater treated by the european wastewater treatment plans wwtp larger than 2000 population equivalents p e was obtained from the urban wastewater treatment directive dataset uwwtd eea 2020 this data is reported by the eu member states in the framework of the 2nd river basin management plan 2016 2021 under the umbrella of the eu water framework directive eu 2000 the validation and reconciliation of the waterdatabase uwwtd was a necessary step over a total of 28276 wwtp included in the database 24892 discharge their effluents into freshwater units referred as river or inland catchments swbs the database provides the annual treated volume which is here considered as the discharged volume for only 9708 wwtp specifically discharge data was only available for about 90 of the wwtp from 9 european countries supplementary information fig si1a to estimate the treated volume of the remaining wwtp the number of habitants connected to a wwtp was first estimated using the declared p e provided for all wwtp in the database knowing that in eu one habitant releases in average 1 23 p e vigiak et al 2020 then for each wwtp the treated volume was estimated by multiplying the number of habitants connected to the wwtp by the member state average habitant water consumption lastly a linear regression was conducted between the reported annual treated volume from the wwtp providing these values using 8821 values when outliers are removed and p e of the wwtp outliers removed before the linear regression were the 0 99 and 0 01 percentiles of the estimated and provided discharge ratio as well as poland values where reported treated volumes are multiple folds higher than the rest of eu member states the equation obtained from the regression has a r2 of 0 81 supplementary information fig si1b and was then used to estimate the flow out of p e for the remaining wwtp 2 2 european river flow data the river flow data used for computation of the pan european df is based on the dataset produced by the e hypev3 1 2 hydrological model rice westerhoff 2017 data products of this multi basin conceptual model are available through the copernicus climate change service portal ecmwf 2020 e hype is a semi distributed hydrological modelling approach which divides the 8 8 million of km2 of european river basins districts in 35408 sub catchments lindström et al 2010 hundecha et al 2016 gauged sub catchments are divided in hydrological responses units hru based on their flow signatures correlated to catchment physiography characteristics e hype classifies hru into 75 categories where predictions in ungauged basins is performed based on similarities with a stepwise regionalization scheme in the calibration process this hydrological modelling approach considers most of the standard natural hydrological surface and sub surface processes such as evapotranspiration soil moisture discharge generation groundwater fluctuation main human activities directly impacting the hydrological cycle such as irrigation or discharge control processes are also included in e hype modelling though considered as represented less accurately donnelly et al 2016 grizzetti et al 2017 thus e hype produces flow routing over the gauged and ungauged catchments of eu river basin units for pan european df computation the yearly average river flow was used as well as the monthly 50th percentile 2 3 climate change data and scenarios the yearly volume of wastewater treated is assumed to remain unchanged in future scenarios this manuscript focuses on the influence of climate change and other factors influencing the treated volume such as population growth in urban areas increasing emission trend factor and socio political variables habitant per capita consumption and water reuse policies potential decreasing emission trend factors are left aside for future research the temporal range of the analysis is limited to the next 50 years up to 2070 which is in the range of wwtp urban water infrastructures lifespan climate impact indicator cii products from copernicus climate change service portal include the above mentioned river flow for europe ecmwf 2020 grizzetti et al 2017 river flow change estimates are provided for three different 30 year periods 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 following different emission scenarios rcps 2 6 4 5 8 5 these river flow changes are simulated and provided using combinations of multiple global climate regional climate and hydrological models ecmwf 2020 ipcc 2013 our study uses the 50th quantile monthly discharge estimates for the2011 2040 and 2041 2070 periods provided by the hydrological model e hypev3 1 2 simulation results these discharge estimates are provided for the three rcps 2 6 4 5 8 5 respectively using 2 5 and 4 and global climate change models regional climate change models input forcing combinations grizzetti et al 2017 for the e hype hydrological modelling in copernicus thus the 50th quantile monthly discharge estimates were used to compute the df while averaging the df result for each rcp scenario 2 4 dilution factor computation process the cumulated urban wastewater effluent discharge q w w t p and the river flow q r were first computed under the format of raster grids before applying eq 1 to obtain the df for europe the process to spatially cumulate along the course of the european streams the discharge contributions of each wwtp was based on a gis approach using flow direction fd grids location of the wwtp discharge points and estimated wwtp discharge here the fd grid is a combination of the hydrosheds fd grid lehner et al 2008 of 500m resolution and above 60 n of the hydro1k fd grid usgs 2020 of 1km resolution those two fd grids were originally generated using a standard d8 methodology garbrecht martz 1997 based on digital elevation models dem dem have been pretreated to ensure the hydraulic continuity of the streams by the data providers lehner et al 2008 usgs 2020 these two fd grids are identical to the data sources used in the e hype hydrological model donnelly et al 2016 which produced the river flow data we used in our approach for the pan european df computation here to cumulate the wwtp discharge each of the discharge points was used to generate a drainage line base on the combined fd grids each drainage line respectively had the weight of the estimated wwtp discharge value in m3 s 1 the sum of all the individual drainage line grid provided the cumulative wwtp discharge gridded for europe the river flow grid results from the conversion of the river flow data estimated at each of the 35408 sub catchments by the e hypev3 1 2 hydrological model conversion to a raster grid combination of the cumulative wwtp discharge grid with river flow grid using eq 1 allowed to compute the df grids european swbs are provided as vectors polylines layer by the european environmental agency eea 2020 here the process to supply a df value in a conservative manner for the swbs was to extract using a 250m spatial buffer for each swb polyline the minimal df value of the df grid shortcoming of spatial buffering selection routine exist coming from the fact that several swbs can potentially be selected in dense hydrographic regions where upstream swbs could be over selected 2 5 df and ecological status logistic regressions the ecological status is an assessment of the quality of the structure and functioning of swbs it shows the influence of pressures i e pollution and habitat degradation on the identified quality elements following the implementation of the water framework directive wfd the ecological status is determined for each of the swbs of rivers lakes transitional waters and coastal waters based on biological quality elements and supported by physico chemical and hydromorphological quality elements ec 2015a the assessed ecological status for each swb is reported by member states at each reporting cycle every 6 years and stored by the european environmental agency ec 2015b eea 2012 ordinal logistic regression was here used to perform a generalized linear model mccullagh and nelder 1983 predicting the probability of swbs to belong to the different ecological status classes based on df values this method establishes a probabilistic classification of swbs using the df value as predictor fig 2b computed df datasets and the swbs ecological status classification reported in 2016 for the second river basin management cycle 2016 2021 dataset where used the temporal extent of the analysis does not refer to a specific year but is centered on the full 2016 2021 period following the same principle binomial logistic regression was used to perform a generalized linear model assessing the

16969,impacts from urban wastewater treatment plants wwtp to receiving riverine surface water bodies swbs depend on the load of contaminants discharged as well as on their dilution capacity yet climate change impacts on such dilution capacity and ultimately on the swbs ecological status remain unclear here we assess swbs dilution capacity across the european continent to identify most vulnerable areas using information from centralized european databases swbs future dilution factor values are estimated based on representative concentration pathway scenarios impacts on rivers flow and likely changes in european swbs ecological status foretold results show that dilution factor in europe increases by 5 4 in average yet climate change effects are found to lead to a consistent dilution factor decrease for 11 of the 40074 european swbs receiving wwtp discharge for the early century this share reaches 17 for the midcentury period we estimate that up to 42 of the swbs receiving wwtp discharges and currently reaching a good ecological status show a 0 7 probability to have their ecological status downgraded due to climate change sites more vulnerable are located in the mediterranean countries our findings highlight that climate change mitigation is essential for maintaining good ecological status in european swbs graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction assessing the impacts of our society on freshwater ecosystems is key to their current and future preservation united nations 2012 grigs et al 2013 birk et al 2020 treated urban wastewater discharged to rivers conveys contaminants which might impact receiving freshwater ecosystems and compromise downstream water uses the aftermath on receiving freshwater ecosystems depends on the load of contaminants in the discharged treated wastewater as well as on the dilution capacity of the receiving ecosystem in that regard wastewater sanitation infrastructures thacker et al 2019 and wastewater management strategies tortajada 2020 are crucial to meet several of the sustainable development goals i e 6 clean water and sanitation 11 sustainable cities and communities or 13 climate action and targets set by the un agenda 2030 united nations 2015 united nations 2018 rivers capacity to dilute wastewater treatment plants wwtp discharges i e the dilution factor df is the ratio between the river flow and the wwtp discharge and has been estimated up to national and subcontinental scales i e u s a china to assess wwtp impacts on receiving freshwater resources rice westerhoff 2017 wang et al 2017 nguyen et al 2018 however the df has not been assessed in the european river networks except for germany link et al 2017 here we assessed the df at the european hydrographic network scale using the urban wwtp database from the european environmental agency waterbase uwwtd eea 2020 and the eu river surface water bodies swbs yearly average flow estimates from copernicus datastore platform e hype hydrological model results donnelly et al 2016 ecmwf 2020 our goals were to assess the differences in the df across the continent to identify the most vulnerable areas in the eu to wwtp discharges i to assess to which extent the df is correlated with the ecological status as indicator of the impact on receiving ecosystems ii and to predict how the df might change under different climate change scenarios thus identifying not only the current vulnerable areas but also the future vulnerable areas iii we focused on ecological status rather than on chemical status or the specific concentration of selected contaminants because the ecological status reflects the impact of multiple stressors including contaminants from wwtp on freshwater ecosystems and is a key environmental goal of the eu water framework directive eu 2000 our hypotheses were that the amount of discharged wastewater rather than the river flow would explain the vulnerable areas in europe i that the swbs ecological status classification would thus be connected to the df levels ii and that the mediterranean areas of europe would be the most sensitive to climate change with the highest reduction in the df iii the rationale of the hypothesis i is that we expect the variability in river flows to be lower than the variability in the wwtp discharge across europe keller et al 2014 regarding the hypothesis ii the rationale is that treated wwtp discharges are known to impact freshwater ecological status in several ways from the indirect effects in the community by changes associated with the excessive algal growth by discharged nutrients carey and migliaccio 2009 yang et al 2019 to the direct effects of contaminants of emerging concern loss et al 2013 nguyen et al 2018 finally the rationale for hypothesis iii is that river flows in the mediterranean region are already experiencing decreases and are predicted to further decrease in the coming decades schneider et al 2013 2 materials and methods df is here calculated not as the df of a given wwtp in a given river point or segment but as the sum of the wwtp discharges in a given river network upstream of the considered river surface water body swbs df is computed using such conservative approach for each receiving stream as follow 1 1 d f q r q w w t p q w w t p where q r is the river flow and q w w t p is the cumulated wwtp discharge resulting from the sum of the discharges in the river network upstream from the discharge point both in m3 s 1 and based on yearly averages estimates thus the df was calculated for each swbs estimating the pan european q w w t p in the river network produced using the waterdatabase uwwtd from the european environmental agency eea 2020 and using eu river swbs yearly average flow estimates from copernicus datastore platform e hype hydrological model results donnelly et al 2016 ecmwf 2020 2 1 european wastewater data the yearly volume of wastewater treated by the european wastewater treatment plans wwtp larger than 2000 population equivalents p e was obtained from the urban wastewater treatment directive dataset uwwtd eea 2020 this data is reported by the eu member states in the framework of the 2nd river basin management plan 2016 2021 under the umbrella of the eu water framework directive eu 2000 the validation and reconciliation of the waterdatabase uwwtd was a necessary step over a total of 28276 wwtp included in the database 24892 discharge their effluents into freshwater units referred as river or inland catchments swbs the database provides the annual treated volume which is here considered as the discharged volume for only 9708 wwtp specifically discharge data was only available for about 90 of the wwtp from 9 european countries supplementary information fig si1a to estimate the treated volume of the remaining wwtp the number of habitants connected to a wwtp was first estimated using the declared p e provided for all wwtp in the database knowing that in eu one habitant releases in average 1 23 p e vigiak et al 2020 then for each wwtp the treated volume was estimated by multiplying the number of habitants connected to the wwtp by the member state average habitant water consumption lastly a linear regression was conducted between the reported annual treated volume from the wwtp providing these values using 8821 values when outliers are removed and p e of the wwtp outliers removed before the linear regression were the 0 99 and 0 01 percentiles of the estimated and provided discharge ratio as well as poland values where reported treated volumes are multiple folds higher than the rest of eu member states the equation obtained from the regression has a r2 of 0 81 supplementary information fig si1b and was then used to estimate the flow out of p e for the remaining wwtp 2 2 european river flow data the river flow data used for computation of the pan european df is based on the dataset produced by the e hypev3 1 2 hydrological model rice westerhoff 2017 data products of this multi basin conceptual model are available through the copernicus climate change service portal ecmwf 2020 e hype is a semi distributed hydrological modelling approach which divides the 8 8 million of km2 of european river basins districts in 35408 sub catchments lindström et al 2010 hundecha et al 2016 gauged sub catchments are divided in hydrological responses units hru based on their flow signatures correlated to catchment physiography characteristics e hype classifies hru into 75 categories where predictions in ungauged basins is performed based on similarities with a stepwise regionalization scheme in the calibration process this hydrological modelling approach considers most of the standard natural hydrological surface and sub surface processes such as evapotranspiration soil moisture discharge generation groundwater fluctuation main human activities directly impacting the hydrological cycle such as irrigation or discharge control processes are also included in e hype modelling though considered as represented less accurately donnelly et al 2016 grizzetti et al 2017 thus e hype produces flow routing over the gauged and ungauged catchments of eu river basin units for pan european df computation the yearly average river flow was used as well as the monthly 50th percentile 2 3 climate change data and scenarios the yearly volume of wastewater treated is assumed to remain unchanged in future scenarios this manuscript focuses on the influence of climate change and other factors influencing the treated volume such as population growth in urban areas increasing emission trend factor and socio political variables habitant per capita consumption and water reuse policies potential decreasing emission trend factors are left aside for future research the temporal range of the analysis is limited to the next 50 years up to 2070 which is in the range of wwtp urban water infrastructures lifespan climate impact indicator cii products from copernicus climate change service portal include the above mentioned river flow for europe ecmwf 2020 grizzetti et al 2017 river

and provided using combinations of multiple global climate regional climate and hydrological models ecmwf 2020 ipcc 2013 our study uses the 50th quantile monthly discharge estimates for the2011 2040 and 2041 2070 periods provided by the hydrological model e hypev3 1 2 simulation results these discharge estimates are provided for the three rcps 2 6 4 5 8 5 respectively using 2 5 and 4 and global climate change models regional climate change models input forcing combinations grizzetti et al 2017 for the e hype hydrological modelling in copernicus thus the 50th quantile monthly discharge estimates were used to compute the df while averaging the df result for each rcp scenario 2 4 dilution factor computation process the cumulated urban wastewater effluent discharge q w w t p and the river flow q r were first computed under the format of raster grids before applying eq 1 to obtain the df for europe the process to spatially cumulate along the course of the european streams the discharge contributions of each wwtp was based on a gis approach using flow direction fd grids location of the wwtp discharge points and estimated wwtp discharge here the fd grid is a combination of the hydrosheds fd grid lehner et al 2008 of 500m resolution and above 60 n of the hydro1k fd grid usgs 2020 of 1km resolution those two fd grids were originally generated using a standard d8 methodology garbrecht martz 1997 based on digital elevation models dem dem have been pretreated to ensure the hydraulic continuity of the streams by the data providers lehner et al 2008 usgs 2020 these two fd grids are identical to the data sources used in the e hype hydrological model donnelly et al 2016 which produced the river flow data we used in our approach for the pan european df computation here to cumulate the wwtp discharge each of the discharge points was used to generate a drainage line base on the combined fd grids each drainage line respectively had the weight of the estimated wwtp discharge value in m3 s 1 the sum of all the individual drainage line grid provided the cumulative wwtp discharge gridded for europe the river flow grid results from the conversion of the river flow data estimated at each of the 35408 sub catchments by the e hypev3 1 2 hydrological model conversion to a raster grid combination of the cumulative wwtp discharge grid with river flow grid using eq 1 allowed to compute the df grids european swbs are provided as vectors polylines layer by the european environmental agency eea 2020 here the process to supply a df value in a conservative manner for the swbs was to extract using a 250m spatial buffer for each swb polyline the minimal df value of the df grid shortcoming of spatial buffering selection routine exist coming from the fact that several swbs can potentially be selected in dense hydrographic regions where upstream swbs could be over selected 2 5 df and ecological status logistic regressions the ecological status is an assessment of the quality of the structure and functioning of swbs it shows the influence of pressures i e pollution and habitat degradation on the identified quality elements following the implementation of the water framework directive wfd the ecological status is determined for each of the swbs of rivers lakes transitional waters and coastal waters based on biological quality elements and supported by physico chemical and hydromorphological quality elements ec 2015a the assessed ecological status for each swb is reported by member states at each reporting cycle every 6 years and stored by the european environmental agency ec 2015b eea 2012 ordinal logistic regression was here used to perform a generalized linear model mccullagh and nelder 1983 predicting the probability of swbs to belong to the different ecological status classes based on df values this method establishes a probabilistic classification of swbs using the df value as predictor fig 2b computed df datasets and the swbs ecological status classification reported in 2016 for the second river basin management cycle 2016 2021 dataset where used the temporal extent of the analysis does not refer to a specific year but is centered on the full 2016 2021 period following the same principle binomial logistic regression was used to perform a generalized linear model assessing the

a slight increasing future trend for df an effect that diminishes for higher rcp and the later the considered period assessment of high rcps 4 5 8 5 impacts on the df allow to estimate that in 40 of the 9390 european swbs receiving wwtps discharge with a good ecological status will have a higher than 0 7 probability not to reach this good status anymore data availability all data used in this
