4320,a cosmic ray neutron probe crnp is a promising tool for obtaining reliable intermediate scale soil moisture although there are sound ways of correcting neutron counts and calibrating soil moisture it is difficult to obtain all the data required for corrections and calibration in a complex environment in this study three major correcting variables i e absolute humidity air pressure incoming neutron flux intensity were evaluated to determine their impacts on the neutron counts in the seolmacheon experimental site smc located in mountainous terrain efficiency of correction factors for atmospheric water vapor fwv air pressure fp and incoming neutron flux intensity fi was independently assessed through comparisons between the variables and a inversely calculated n0 n0 inv particular attention was given to the expected biases and errors in estimated soil moisture smcrnp with and without each correction factor especially at the early stage of the calibration period air pressure had the greatest impact on neutron count at the smc site followed by absolute humidity the dependency of neutron count on air pressure absolute humidity was found from the inverse relationship with n0 inv that is not corrected for air pressure absolute humidity with correlation coefficient 0 88 0 78 when fp fwv was applied the dependency of neutron count on the corresponding variable was significantly reduced with a correlation coefficient 0 06 0 07 on the other hand the effect of applying fi was contrary slightly degrading the result when neutron count was not corrected for air pressure absolute humidity the performance of smcrnp decreased with a correlation coefficient of 0 74 0 90 and root mean square error rmse of 0 030 m3 m3 0 026 m3 m3 at best the best result was obtained when both of them were corrected r 0 95 rmse 0 014 m3 m3 as data accumulates error metrics in terms of bias and variability converged at approximately one periodic cycle implying at least one seasonal cycle is necessary for recalibration however in a case where a variable with large intra seasonal variability e g air pressure in this study is missing it is recommended to adopt a multi point n0 method the procedures suggested in this study allow independent evaluations of the factors for which neutron count is corrected thus providing a basis for judging which factors are appropriate and which are not in addition n0 can be more efficiently tuned according to the characteristics of the errors in smcrnp based on these analyses crnp stations will be able to selectively apply favorable correction factors under various kinds of local characteristics making it easier to achieve target accuracy and precision keywords mountain hydrology cosmic ray neutron probe soil moisture network correction efficiency calibration framework 1 introduction accurate estimation of soil moisture is essential for understanding the partitioning and exchange of energy and water fluxes among hydrological processes that include infiltration evapotranspiration and runoff choi and jacobs 2007 das and mohanty 2006 entekhabi et al 1996 western and blöschl 1999 knowledge of the soil moisture state has potential for hydrologic applications in predicting floods landslides droughts and heatwaves brocca et al 2017 brocca et al 2012 pendergrass et al 2020 wehrli et al 2019 in addition information on soil moisture state is crucial for calibration and validation of the land surface model data assimilation and weather forecasting franz et al 2015 for these reasons a lot of research has been conducted to measure the variability of soil moisture at a large scale crow et al 2012 entekhabi et al 2010a jackson et al 2010 wagner et al 1999 large scale soil moisture measurements mainly use remote sensing data such as satellites which usually have a large spatial resolution of more than 10 km bartalis et al 2007 kerr et al 2001 brocca et al 2011 in recent years the synthetic aperture radar sar has been actively utilized to provide local scale soil moisture within 1 km bauer marschallingere et al 2019 lievens et al 2017 however scale gap issues remain between point sensor networks and remote sensing products from satellites crow et al 2012 because of the absence of field scale soil moisture data that represents an area cosmic ray neutron probe crnp is a promising means of measuring soil moisture at an intermediate scale to bridge the gap between sensor networks and remote sensing products desilets et al 2010 zreda et al 2008 in the last decade crnps have proved to be effective for measuring soil moisture at intermediate scales and validating remote sensing products kim et al 2018 nguyen et al 2021 ochsner et al 2013 crnps take advantage of the fact that fast neutrons occurring from natural nucleonic cosmic rays show a negative correlation with the hydrogen pool around the crnp hydrogen atoms are prevalent in natural soils as soil moisture and this implies it may be feasible to infer soil moisture signals from the fast neutron intensity the most outstanding property of crnp is that it can cover a radius of around 300 m at a high temporal resolution without invasive installation desilets and zreda 2013 kohli et al 2015 these features have prompted many experimental sites and soil moisture networks around the world to adopt crnp stations and a crnp rover system andreasen et al 2017b baatz et al 2014 fersch et al 2020 hawdon et al 2014 schron et al 2018 zreda et al 2012 since soil moisture cannot be directly measured with the crnp desilets et al 2010 developed a non linear theoretical calibration function using only one calibration parameter so called the n0 method based on the monte carlo neutron particle extended mcnpx transport simulation pelowitz 2005 to derive soil water content from the measured neutron flux investigations of neutron transport through air and soil by monte carlo simulations led to major advancements towards a precise interpretation of measurements based on the n0 method many studies evaluated the performance of crnp by comparing networks of point sensors installed to cover an extent similar to the crnp footprints bogena et al 2013 franz et al 2016 jakobi et al 2018 the possibility of using crnp measurements for monitoring soil moisture has also been successfully verified under various conditions including deserts franz et al 2012 semiarid regions schreiner mcgraw et al 2016 temperate humid regions baatz et al 2014 agricultural areas baroni et al 2018 franz et al 2015 mcjannet et al 2017 and forested areas heidbuchel et al 2016 nguyen et al 2017 the neutron intensity sensed by crnp is affected by various environmental factors as well as soil moisture if the covered area is not a wide flat and homogeneous region various environmental factors will make soil moisture estimation difficult due to complex interactions therefore it is necessary to separate the effect of each factor on neutron moderation before calibration in complex terrain however simple arithmetic separation addition and subtraction is impossible because the environmental factors affect neutron intensity simultaneously and numerous collisions cause energy loss for this reason various correction methods have been suggested to decrease the impact of other factors on neutron counts observed from crnp within the calibration process the main consideration in the typical calibration process is the reduction of neutron count by the higher air pressure atmospheric water vapor and the lower incoming neutron flux intensity hawdon et al 2014 rosolem et al 2013 zreda et al 2008 it is clear that they have a major influence on neutron regulation but the factors that actually affect them are more diverse as an example heidbuchel et al 2016 have also found that soil organic matter and root biomass can improve the calibration results in a forested site more complex regions are affected by more factors but ironically it is too difficult to acquire data to consider all of these factors to eliminate the effects of various unknown factors iwema et al 2015 suggested a multi point calibration based on the percentile of the wetness condition similar kinds of multi point calibrations using quartiles of variables affecting neutrons will always exhibit better performance than conventional results however it is recommended to avoid such situation as much as possible to make the calibration process simpler and produce stable data within this context the main objective of this study is to analyze the impacts of main correcting variables separately and propose a framework for crnp calibration under complex environment data from an experimental site located in a mountainous area was used to evaluate the impact and efficiency of each factor independently risks in estimating soil moisture at the early stage with and without the corrections were also assessed for each case with different availability of the factors the expected biases and errors were analyzed and a process for recalibration was proposed soil moisture estimated from crnp smcrnp was tested for its validity using weighted average soil moisture captured from in situ sensors smin situ 2 materials and methods 2 1 seolmacheon experimental site smc a crnp was installed at the study area the seolmacheon experimental site smc in northern south korea 37 94 n 126 95 e in august 2018 the site is located in the monsoon influenced hot summer humid continental climate zone dwa in köppen geiger classification peel et al 2007 with a mean annual temperature of 10 9 c and mean annual precipitation of 1 459 mm the crnp is located in a densely vegetated forest with complex terrain fig 1 the experimental site covers approximately 70 000 m2 in a spherical form centered around the crnp and is characterized dominantly by loamy sand with a rock bed a capacitance sensor based soil moisture network was installed around the crnp nine capacitance sensors in four specific locations 1 5 7 8 in fig 1 were installed together with the crnp in august 2018 and seven more sensors were installed in march 2019 to better represent the site s topographical hydrological characteristics in this study the data from april 2019 to october 2020 were used since there was a significant difference between the representability before and after the new installation in 2019 not shown which will be further addressed in a future study data from november to march when soil freezes were also removed due to the failures of the sensors in measuring soil moisture correctly furthermore the whole time series of soil moisture measurements during study period was inspected for quality control following standards in dorigo et al 2013 the locations of the sensors were chosen based first on the distances from the crnp approximately 0 100 and 150 m in radius and by considering the crnp s effective footprint 600 m in diameter at sea level desilets and zreda 2013 the specific points were decided by the geological property where the sub ground rock foundation is located at least 1 m below ground providing a clear profile of soil moisture and the wetting drying process the exact locations of the crnp and surrounding capacitance sensors are provided in table 1 in addition to the crnp and capacitance sensors meteorological data relative humidity atmospheric temperature atmospheric pressure precipitation were collected from an automatic weather station aws installed on a flux tower park et al 2015 2 2 weighting of in situ sensors measurements of soil moisture at four different depths 10 20 30 and 40 cm from the surface at each capacitance sensor yield 64 observations in total to make these observations valid for comparison with crnp soil moisture they were vertically and horizontally averaged with weighting to account for the individual contributions depending on each measurement s depth and distance from crnp bogena et al 2013 zreda et al 2008 and kohli et al 2015 demonstrated that the neutron signal detected by crnp varies with measuring depth and is the most sensitive to the surface layers franz et al 2012 proposed a weighting function using a linear relationship between penetration depth and soil moisture θ schron et al 2017 further developed this vertical weighting function wd to take the distance r from the crnp air pressure p and vegetation height hveg into account 1 w d r θ p h veg e 2 d d where d stands for the depth in meter of the individual measurement and d the penetration depth in meter defined as 2 d d 86 r θ ρ bulk here the penetration depth is corrected for air pressure and vegetation height in scaled distance r in m to represent the effective depth above which 86 of neutrons are expected to have traveled the soil kohli et al 2015 in this study total measurements were vertically weighted averaged according to eq 1 and 2 for more detailed descriptions of the process and the parameters used see schron et al 2017 generally in situ measurements within a footprint are simply averaged when evaluating remotely sensed products since the remotely sensed products themselves are representative of the area of interest however when it comes to crnp a simple averaging method could neglect the significant differences between neutron signals from different distances we therefore applied the horizontal weighting function wr from kohli et al 2015 and schron et al 2017 3 w r h θ p h veg f 1 e f 2 r f 3 e f 4 r 1 e f 0 r f 1 e f 2 r f 3 e f 4 r f 5 e f 6 r f 7 e f 8

calculation processes are provided in schron et al 2017 2 3 correction of neutron count the neutron signal sensed by crnp varies with surrounding atmospheric water vapor pressure and incoming flux of neutrons and has been corrected for those variables so that it contains variabilities affected solely by soil moisture hawdon et al 2014 rosolem et al 2013 zreda et al 2012 the measured neutron counts nraw is corrected into ncorr by following 4 n corr n raw f wv f p f i where fwv fp fi are the correction factors unitless of water vapor atmospheric pressure and incoming neutron flux intensity respectively water vapor in the surrounding atmosphere attenuates the neutron signal in way that is similar to that of soil moisture that is the hydrogen atoms in vapor moderate fast neutrons rosolem et al 2013 modelled this relationship to derive a correction factor fwv in a linear form 5 f wv 1 0 0054 ρ ρ ref where ρ and ρref are measured and the reference absolute humidity in g m3 respectively absolute humidity was calculated from relative humidity and temperature measured from the aws atmospheric pressure is known to have the biggest influence on the variability of neutron counts zreda et al 2012 the correction factor fp is calculated by 6 f p exp p p ref l where p refers to the measured atmospheric pressure in mbar and pref is the reference l is the mass attenuation length that ranges from 128 to 142 mbar according to the site s latitude desilets and zreda 2003 for our study area we used a value of 140 845 mbar following nguyen et al 2017 the incoming neutron flux intensity was corrected following the method proposed in hawdon et al 2014 in which the different geomagnetic cutoff rigidities between our site and the jungfraujoch neutron monitoring station were considered the correction factor fi is derived from 7 f i i m i ref 1 0 075 r csmc r cjung 1 1 where im and iref are the measured and the reference incoming neutron flux intensity in count per second cps respectively rcsmc is the cutoff rigidity in gv for our site and rcjung is the cutoff rigidity at the jungfraujoch station rcjung was 4 49 gv and rcsmc was 11 22gv which is the cutoff rigidity at the daejeon neutron monitoring station south korea the time series of incoming neutron flux intensities and the cutoff rigidities were available at the neutron monitor database nmdb http www nmdb eu 2 4 calibration of the crnp corrected neutron counts were converted to volumetric soil moisture through a shape defining function proposed by desilets et al 2010 8 θ ρ bd a 0 n corr n 0 a 1 a 2 where ρbd is the soil bulk density averaged from every in situ location 1 17 g cm3 and the ai s are shape fitting parameters simulated by mcnpx a0 0 0808 a1 0 372 a2 0 115 n0 is the neutron intensity under the driest soil condition in the experimental site environment it is the only constant that is subject to calibration the corrected neutron counts and averaged in situ soil moisture data are first 24 h block averaged to reduce noises attributed to crnp evans et al 2016 n0 is then fitted into a constant value that minimizes the root mean square error rmse between in situ soil moisture and soil moisture from crnp calculated as θ in eq 8 jakobi et al 2018 2 5 inversely calculated n0 rearranging eq 8 with respect to n0 we get 9 n 0 i n v n corr a 0 θ ρ bd a 2 a 1 since we are assuming ncorr is a function of soil moisture humidity pressure and neutron intensity n corr θ ρ p i m subtraction of one correction factor in eq 4 yields a unique dependency between n0 inv and the subtracted variable hereafter vtarget this is possible because inversely calculating n0 eliminates the effect of soil moisture by converting the orthogonal coordinate space between ncorr soil moisture and vtarget along the characteristic curve see figs 5 9 for example we analyzed the efficiency and direction of each correction by comparing the relationship between vtarget and n0 inv which is calculated from eq 9 with ncorr not corrected for humidity pressure and neutron intensity see section 3 2 the mean and standard deviation of n0 inv gives direct insight into the finally fitted n0 and the error range of smcrnp to analyze such a relationship we simulated smcrnp with sets of n0 inv manipulated to have different standard deviations by using the following equation 10 n 0 i n v r e s c a l e d n 0 i n v n 0 i n v σ original σ t arg e t n 0 i n v where σtarget is the standard deviation of interest smcrnp was derived by 1 calculating ncorr from eq 9 and 2 fitting n0 to minimize the rmse between smin situ and smcrnp 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance metric based on inversely calculated n0 the distribution of n0 inv is directly related to the estimated smcrnp performance fig 2 shows the scatter between smin situ and nraw ncorr with the calibration curves drawn at data points that have the largest and smallest n0 scatter colored red it also compares the histograms of n0 inv at the smc site soil moisture ranges from 0 09 to 0 30 m3 m3 and nraw from 1233 to 1700 cph while ncorr ranges from 1250 to 1672 cph smin situ and nraw are negatively correlated along the calibration curve and this relationship is clearer with ncorr the degree of such a relationship can be directly understood from the histogram of n0 inv after correction the distance between the maximum and minimum calibration curves decreases and the range of n0 inv decreases accordingly from 419 12 to 242 58 cph furthermore the standard deviation of n0 inv decreases from 87 18 to 48 47 cph which indicates that the performed corrections reduce the uncertainty in determining the final n0 and thus reduce the anticipated error in smcrnp since the purpose of the crnp calibration is to produce continuous and stable soil moisture estimation using a fixed calibration parameter n0 andreasen et al 2017a vather et al 2019 the distribution of n0 inv is a good criterion for assessing whether the corrections are properly or sufficiently performed everything else being the same the standard deviations of the n0 inv and rmse of smcrnp are linearly related to see how the performance of smcrnp in terms of correlation correlation coefficient r and error rmse changes depending on the standard deviation of n0 inv we rescaled n0 inv in fig 2b to have a standard deviation from 40 to 100 cph and simulated smcrnp with the final n0 fitted to minimize rmse during the study period fig 3 as the standard deviation increases the correlation coefficient decreases exponentially from 0 96 to 0 81 and the rmse increases linearly from 0 012 m3 m3 to 0 029 m3 m3 due to the larger range of soil moisture these two lines are site specific but this result could provide guidance for researchers who set target metrics according to their applications entekhabi et al 2010b fig 4 depicts smin situ at the smc site black line and smcrnp calculated with n0 inv having a standard deviation of 40 red line and 100 blue line smcrnp significantly underestimates smin situ in the lower range of soil moisture 0 2 m3 m3 and overestimates it in the higher range of soil moisture when the standard deviation of n0 inv is large additionally large variances during drying especially in apr to jul 2019 and oct 2020 led to a significant reduction of correlation on the other hand the small standard deviation of n0 inv both decreases the degree of under overestimation and reduces variances these results emphasize the importance of employing proper corrections and analyzing each correction factor s efficiency in reducing the standard deviation of n0 inv which are addressed in the following sections 3 2 evaluation of correction factors as mentioned earlier n0 inv excludes the effect of soil moisture on the neutron count therefore n0 inv is only dependent on the correcting variables specifically when ncorr in eq 9 is substituted with nraw n0 inv is dependent on absolute humidity air pressure and incoming neutron flux intensity when substituted with np i neutron count corrected for air pressure and incoming neutron flux intensity n0 inv is dependent only on absolute humidity and so forth likewise we assume n0 inv calculated with ncorr does not have a relationship with any variable since water vapor in the atmosphere has a stopping ability that moderates fast neutrons fwv corrects for lower neutron counts in more humid conditions rosolem et al 2013 fig 5 shows scatter between absolute humidity and n0 inv drawn with nraw np i and ncorr the absolute humidity and n0 inv appear to be scattered irregularly in fig 5a because there are mixed dependencies with the three correcting variables however after applying fp and fi there appears to be a clear inverse relationship with a correlation coefficient of 0 78 in fig 5b the correlation clearly shows that the variation of the absolute humidity at the smc site affects the calibration process the standard deviation 78 77 cph and the range 1992 to 2366 cph of n0 inv indicates that the uncertainty in determining n0 will become larger without the correction of the absolute humidity after applying fwv the correlation coefficient decreases to 0 07 reducing the relationship significantly fig 5c the standard deviation of n0 inv decreased to 48 47 cph and the range decreased by 36 2045 to 2287 cph the smaller standard deviation and range decreases the bias of smcrnp by n0 determined with low uncertainty during the calibration process in other words a reduction in the standard deviation of n0 inv after applying a correction factor has the effect of reducing the uncertainty of smcrnp therefore we concluded that the fwv proposed by rosolem et al 2013 works properly at the smc site high air pressure directly reduces the intensity of neutron nuclei cascades during their interaction with the atmosphere since the neutron intensity decreases by approximately a factor of two for each additional 100 hpa zreda et al 2008 air pressure usually has the greatest impact on the neutron counts in regions with large pressure differences at the smc site the air pressure varies between 963 hpa and 995 hpa and has a relatively clear relationship with n0 inv drawn with nraw fig 6 a with a correlation coefficient of 0 61 the correlation is more apparent r 0 88 with n0 inv drawn with nwv i neutron count corrected for absolute humidity and incoming neutron flux intensity fig 6b the standard deviation is 99 17 which is larger than that with absolute humidity the higher correlation and larger standard deviation imply that correcting for air pressure has a significant effect on the determination of n0 the wider range of the n0 inv 1896 to 2432 cph also indicates that the uncertainty in determining n0 will be even larger than when absolute humidity is not corrected for the effect of air pressure on neutron count significantly diminishes r 0 06 by applying fp fig 6c in addition range of n0 inv decreases by 55 after the application of fp the larger degree to which the uncertainty in estimating soil moisture is reduced makes the correction of atmospheric pressure the most critical correction at the smc site unlike the other two factors incoming neutron flux intensity has no evident relationship with n0 inv calculated using nwv p neutron count corrected for absolute humidity and air pressure fig 7 b the neutron flux intensity and n0 inv are even negatively correlated with a correlation coefficient value of 0 14 since the correction factor fi corrects neutron count in a direction that removes the positive correlation between the neutron flux intensity and neutron count one could expect that correcting the neutron flux intensity should degrade the calibration after applying fi as expected the range of n0 inv increased fig 7c the range of n0 inv before the correction was from 2051 to 2270 cph 10 larger than the range after correction which indicates that the uncertainty of the calibration is smaller than that observed after the correction this result suggests that it is not beneficial to apply fi at the smc site if there is no clear positive correlation between neutron flux intensity and n0 inv fig 8 shows the temporal variation of the three correcting variables corresponding correction factors and the combined correction factor at the smc site the effect of fp ranging from 0 9 to 1 1 was the greatest which is consistent to previous studies evans et al 2016 zreda et al 2012 since the correction factors show the same fluctuation as each variable the combined correction factor resembles the variation of the air pressure on the other hand fi shows the smallest variation ranging from 0 99 to 1 01 which is relatively negligible this is mainly due to the absence of an extreme variation in neutron flux hawdon et al 2014 in our study period this could also be the reason why there is no clear positive correlation in fig 7b there are clear signs of seasonal patterns in absolute humidity and air pressure because of the distinct seasonality of south korea fig 8 absolute humidity is the highest in the summer season with the asian monsoon while air pressure is the lowest in the same season resulting in the opposite seasonal pattern kim et al 2017 shin et al 2021 such opposite seasonal patterns yield a complementary relationship between the corrections of absolute humidity and air pressure which can be found in table 2 where the basic statistics of n0 inv and the correlation coefficient and rmse between smin situ and smcrnp for every case of corrections are provided when the neutron count is corrected only for the absolute humidity the standard deviation of n0 inv and the rmse of smcrnp increased because there remains a bias from the opposite seasonality of air pressure in addition the correlation coefficient also decreases since applying fwv makes the neutron count rely more on the variation of air pressure which has the largest effect when the neutron count is corrected only for the air pressure the correlation coefficient is improved because the intra seasonal variation from air pressure is eliminated however the improvement in the rmse is negligible because of the bias from remaining seasonality of the absolute humidity although the specific degree of improvements and degradations are site specific this kind of complex dependency to the correcting variables has been mentioned elsewhere kohli et al 2015 when both absolute humidity and air pressure are corrected for the best performance is obtained with correlation coefficient 0 95 and rmse of 0 014 m3 m3 which are comparable to the previous studies conducted under complex environment with vegetations bogena et al 2013 lv et al 2014 nguyen et al 2019 vather et al 2020 on the other hand correcting for the incoming neutron flux intensity always makes the result worse the results in this section emphasize the process of examining if there are clear correlations between the correcting variables and n0 inv in terms of the direction size and efficiency of each correction one should be particularly careful to avoid over correction that is situations in which the correcting power of a factor is too large and results in an inverse correlation this could lead to incorrect conclusions about the efficiency or appropriateness of other factors it is especially true at the smc site where the absolute humidity and air pressure show similar seasonal patterns in opposite direction since air pressure dominates the variation of the neutron count it is critical to apply fp appropriately to assess the other correction factors suitability 3 3 error characteristics due to limited data at early stage calibration shortly after installation of a crnp it is difficult to obtain sufficient data to determine when a parameter n0 is to be calibrated without knowledge of the annual pattern of the surrounding environmental condition no matter how adequately the in situ sensors for calculating the average soil moisture are set up it is not known whether the set up reflects the site s characteristics a common challenge in crnp calibration is how to determine an n0 that reflects the characteristics of the site the physical meaning of n0 is the neutron intensity under dry conditions and it is an important criterion for assuming the variations in neutron counts as primarily due to soil moisture desilets et al 2010 in the practical calibration process n0 determines the positioning of the calibration curve in this section we analyze the uncertainty that may occur in the early stage calibration process with limited data as mentioned in section 3 2 atmospheric water vapor is a factor that directly reduces neutron intensity fig 9a b show the distribution of the absolute humidity on soil moisture and neutron count space a layer of absolute humidity along the calibration curve is observed as higher absolute humidity is related to lower n0 fig 9a for this reason the calibration curves drawn at points with the maximum ahmax and minimum ahmin absolute humidity filled scatter points almost match the minimum and maximum n0 curves respectively without an atmospheric water vapor correction a risk exists in the calibration process due to the potentially layered data ahmax and ahmin are therefore the possible curves with the largest uncertainty in such situations from eq 5 and eq 9 using an absolute humidity greater than the reference absolute humidity results in an n0 that is smaller than the real site characteristics in other words the maximum absolute humidity underestimates soil moisture by calculating a lower n0 and places the calibration curve on the left while the minimum absolute humidity overestimates soil moisture by drawing the calibration curve on the right in particular smcrnp calibrated from the ahmin curve produced excessive errors under wet soil conditions fig 10 a this is because when calibrated under arid conditions reduction in the neutron counts is considered to be originated only from soil moisture neglecting the effect of water vapor conversely the ahmax curve determines all of the reasons for the increase in neutron counts as the effects of soil moisture and underestimates soil moisture when the absolute humidity decrease without a decrease in soil moisture these are consistent with the results in rosolem et al 2013 soil moisture was underestimated consistently especially during dry period when calibrated under moist atmospheric condition without correction for humidity and overestimated when calibrated under dry atmospheric condition therefore for regions with distinct seasonality and large annual variability it is recommended to use humidity meters together with crnp or at least use data from nearby stations to ensure the accuracy of smcrnp the layered distribution by absolute humidity disappears through a humidity correction fig 9b and significantly reduces the risk of error in soil moisture estimation air pressure formed a clearer and wider layer distribution in the soil moisture and neutron count space as previously shown in section 3 2 this had the greatest effect on calibration in this region fig 9c therefore the calibration is at risk for having the largest error if there is no atmospheric pressure correction similar to the previous case the calibration curves drawn at the maximum pa max and minimum pa min air pressure almost match with the minimum and maximum n0 curves respectively however since the annual variation pattern of air pressure in smc site is opposite to that of soil moisture the scatter between smcrnp and smin situ show a wider distribution than that in fig 10a resulting in significant errors in both cases calibrated with pa max and pa min curves fig 10b since air pressure tends to exhibit large variability over a relatively short period of time as well as annual seasonality we recommend using multi point n0 which is proposed by heidbuchel et al 2016 when the local air pressure characteristic is unknown even if the recalibration is performed frequently to prevent large errors the correlation coefficient is not expected to improve sufficiently the effect of incoming neutron flux intensity on this region is very small and unclear compared to other factors even when the effects of absolute humidity and air pressure are removed no layered distribution by incoming neutron flux intensity is observed and the width between the calibration curves is relatively narrow fig 9e besides two calibration curves having the maximum and minimum n0 were drawn with im values of 167 35 cps and 164 55 cps respectively contrary to expectations that higher im will give a larger n0 the smc site has rather shown the opposite trend therefore considering the im in smc site is not a priority even when all corrections can be performed continuously risks remain in the early stages of calibration a degree of uncertainty originates from the remaining gap between the maximum and minimum n0 curves fig 9b d f setting a calibration date at some point at the early stage could lead to a biased smcrnp fig 10d and the bias will remain permanently without a recalibration when the sensors used for measuring the correcting variables are unavailable within a crnp site it is desirable to determine the initial calibration point by investigating the annual variability of atmospheric water vapor and atmospheric pressure in the region of interest through a nearby weather station in particular identifying the seasonality of soil moisture and main factors can help understand the characteristics of errors in smcrnp data 3 4 determining calibration cycle with convergence of error although correcting for main variables allows successful estimation of soil moisture variation in the region the early stage calibration risks increasing the biases of smcrnp from the determination of the skewed parameter n0 therefore a recalibration is required to determine the final n0 after the initial calibration to ensure stable soil moisture estimation furthermore it is possible to operate crnp stations efficiently by selectively employing correction factors through analyses of the main correction variables reflecting the site characteristics to determine the point of recalibration data from the first day to different extents are used to derive n0 and smcrnp as shown in fig 11 n0 stabilizes after approximately one seasonal cycle since n0 is fitted to the value that minimized rmse the rmse increases gradually and converges to 0 015 m3 m3 to further evaluate smcrnp derived with different intervals of data the modified kling gupta efficiency kge kling et al 2012 statistic is calculated with 50 100 150 200 and 400 accumulative data points table 3 the bias is always smaller than 1 the error in the variability of smcrnp decreases rapidly during 100 days and gradually reaches 11 at 200 days accordingly kge converges to 0 87 at 200 days which corresponds to one seasonal cycle at the smc site the results suggest that if a site has a periodic pattern such as seasonality it is desirable to have a recalibration period of at least one cycle nevertheless if a station has not reached its target correlation and bias it should be recalibrated so that n0 and rmse become stable in some crnp stations the data required for a calibration could be missing either partially or totally due to a malfunctioning or absence of a sensor fig 12 a shows the final calibration results assuming that absolute humidity data cannot be obtained even when correction is not performed for absolute humidity it is highly correlated with smin situ r 0 9 and the rmse is also reasonable rmse 0 026 the low absolute humidity in the spring months of april and may leads to underestimation of soil moisture but in other seasons smcrnp agrees with smin situ except during peaks caused by rainfall in conclusion even if humidity data are missing from this site reliable soil moisture can be expected except in spring and rainy days in this case one could expect to obtain reasonable smcrnp data with recalibration period of one seasonal cycle like aforementioned since air pressure has the greatest effect on the neutron moderation and has the opposite seasonality to soil moisture the correlation was relatively low and the rmse also increased when the correction was not performed fig 12b the low correlation particularly attributes to the large intra seasonal variability of air pressure the effects of air pressure on this site mainly appear after october when sharp increases in air pressure lead to a significant decrease in neutron counts observed in the crnp resulting in an increase in smcrnp since the main source of error is unpredictable intra seasonal variability rather than predictable seasonal pattern of air pressure as pointed out in section 3 3 it is recommended to adopt multi point n0 method in this case on the other hand for im better results were achieved when the correction was not performed than when it was performed fig 12c d in mixed forests with complex terrain and distinct seasonality like the smc site it is very difficult to obtain auxiliary information e g biomass soil organic matters although they are known to affect neutron intensity andreasen et al 2017b baatz et al 2015 coopersmith et al 2014 the combined effect of these factors that is unknown could hide the independent impact of im another possibility is that the im data used in this study may not accurately reflect the characteristics of the site because it is not directly observed at the smc site in the final n0 determination process after two seasonal cycles it was concluded that fi was not effective in estimating smcrnp at the smc site in the process of finalizing the parameter n0 it is possible to employ correction factors selectively for continuous site operations if the relationship between neutron count and soil moisture is clear 4 summary and conclusion cosmic ray neutron probe crnp is very efficient in estimating soil moisture in that it is easy to install has excellent data acquisition stability and can monitor intermediate scale soil moisture non invasively these advantages of crnp make it suitable for use in complex regions such as mountainous terrain nevertheless the difficulties of obtaining influencing variables and of calibrating in complex terrains hinder the applications of crnp with the data obtained from the smc site this study analyzed the effects of major correction variables and characteristics of possible errors based on the results we proposed a framework to evaluate the independent effect of the correcting variables to calibrate the parameter n0 and to produce reliable crnp soil moisture measurements fig 13 after an installation of crnp and other sensors smcrnp can be estimated temporarily through initial calibration as mentioned in section 3 3 a possibility that smcrnp could be over under estimated by skewed n0 determination must be considered if all correcting variables are available the degree of correlation between neutron counts and each variable and the efficiency of corresponding correction factors should be evaluated using n0 inv based on the evaluation an effective correction factor can be selected for a recalibration process if clear relationships between neutron count and major factors are removed properly through corrections the recalibration period can be set if one or more correcting variables are unavailable n0 should be frequently recalibrated to avoid large errors in terms of the operational aspects of the observatory however frequent recalibration is inefficient since it affects the reliability of past soil moisture data moreover crnp cannot work as an independent sensor since it continuously requires smin situ for recalibration process therefore an examination on the characteristics of the missing variable in the area should be preceded by available observations nearby in the case of a variable with distinct seasonality and small intra seasonal variation e g absolute humidity in this study recalibration after a period reflecting the whole seasonal pattern is recommended if the variable has relatively large intra seasonal variation e g air pressure in this study it is recommended to adopt multiple n0 s to get the target precision obtaining reliable soil moisture data that could represent an area in mountainous terrain with dense vegetation has always been tricky the smc site showed great performance using the framework for crnp calibration proposed in this study validation with smin situ showed a high correlation coefficient of 0 95 and an rmse of 0 014 smcrnp also shows coincidence with rainfall events observed from aws unlike the several existing crnp based operational networks e g cosmos cosmoz there has been no such network in korea the results and the proposed framework show the possibility of using a crnp system in complex terrain with the least number of data and this will contribute to extend the crnp based soil moisture network

4320,a cosmic ray neutron probe crnp is a promising tool for obtaining reliable intermediate scale soil moisture although there are sound ways of correcting neutron counts and calibrating soil moisture it is difficult to obtain all the data required for corrections and calibration in a complex environment in this study three major correcting variables i e absolute humidity air pressure incoming neutron flux intensity were evaluated to determine their impacts on the neutron counts in the seolmacheon experimental site smc located in mountainous terrain efficiency of correction factors for atmospheric water vapor fwv air pressure fp and incoming neutron flux intensity fi was independently assessed through comparisons between the variables and a inversely calculated n0 n0 inv particular attention was given to the expected biases and errors in estimated soil moisture smcrnp with and without each correction factor especially at the early stage of the calibration period air pressure had the greatest impact on neutron count at the smc site followed by absolute humidity the dependency of neutron count on air pressure absolute humidity was found from the inverse relationship with n0 inv that is not corrected for air pressure absolute humidity with correlation coefficient 0 88 0 78 when fp fwv was applied the dependency of neutron count on the corresponding variable was significantly reduced with a correlation coefficient 0 06 0 07 on the other hand the effect of applying fi was contrary slightly degrading the result when neutron count was not corrected for air pressure absolute humidity the performance of smcrnp decreased with a correlation coefficient of 0 74 0 90 and root mean square error rmse of 0 030 m3 m3 0 026 m3 m3 at best the best result was obtained when both of them were corrected r 0 95 rmse 0 014 m3 m3 as data accumulates error metrics in terms of bias and variability converged at approximately one periodic cycle implying at least one seasonal cycle is necessary for recalibration however in a case where a variable with large intra seasonal variability e g air pressure in this study is missing it is recommended to adopt a multi point n0 method the procedures suggested in this study allow independent evaluations of the factors for which neutron count is corrected thus providing a basis for judging which factors are appropriate and which are not in addition n0 can be more efficiently tuned according to the characteristics of the errors in smcrnp based on these analyses crnp stations will be able to selectively apply favorable correction factors under various kinds of local characteristics making it easier to achieve target accuracy and precision keywords mountain hydrology cosmic ray neutron probe soil moisture network correction efficiency calibration framework 1 introduction accurate estimation of soil moisture is essential for understanding the partitioning and exchange of energy and water fluxes among hydrological processes that include infiltration evapotranspiration and runoff choi and jacobs 2007 das and mohanty 2006 entekhabi et al 1996 western and blöschl 1999 knowledge of the soil moisture state has potential for hydrologic applications in predicting floods landslides droughts and heatwaves brocca et al 2017 brocca et al 2012 pendergrass et al 2020 wehrli et al 2019 in addition information on soil moisture state is crucial for calibration and validation of the land surface model data assimilation and weather forecasting franz et al 2015 for these reasons a lot of research has been conducted to measure the variability of soil moisture at a large scale crow et al 2012 entekhabi et al 2010a jackson et al 2010 wagner et al 1999 large scale soil moisture measurements mainly use remote sensing data such as satellites which usually have a large spatial resolution of more than 10 km bartalis et al 2007 kerr et al 2001 brocca et al 2011 in recent years the synthetic aperture radar sar has been actively utilized to provide local scale soil moisture within 1 km bauer marschallingere et al 2019 lievens et al 2017 however scale gap issues remain between point sensor networks and remote sensing products from satellites crow et al 2012 because of the absence of field scale soil moisture data that represents an area cosmic ray neutron probe crnp is a promising means of measuring soil moisture at an intermediate scale to bridge the gap between sensor networks and remote sensing products desilets et al 2010 zreda et al 2008 in the last decade crnps have proved to be effective for measuring soil moisture at intermediate scales and validating remote sensing products kim et al 2018 nguyen et al 2021 ochsner et al 2013 crnps take advantage of the fact that fast neutrons occurring from natural nucleonic cosmic rays show a negative correlation with the hydrogen pool around the crnp hydrogen atoms are prevalent in natural soils as soil moisture and this implies it may be feasible to infer soil moisture signals from the fast neutron intensity the most outstanding property of crnp is that it can cover a radius of around 300 m at a high temporal resolution without invasive installation desilets and zreda 2013 kohli et al 2015 these features have prompted many experimental sites and soil moisture networks around the world to adopt crnp stations and a crnp rover system andreasen et al 2017b baatz et al 2014 fersch et al 2020 hawdon et al 2014 schron et al 2018 zreda et al 2012 since soil moisture cannot be directly measured with the crnp desilets et al 2010 developed a non linear theoretical calibration function using only one calibration parameter so called the n0 method based on the monte carlo neutron particle extended mcnpx transport simulation pelowitz 2005 to derive soil water content from the measured neutron flux investigations of neutron transport through air and soil by monte carlo simulations led to major advancements towards a precise interpretation of measurements based on the n0 method many studies evaluated the performance of crnp by comparing networks of point sensors installed to cover an extent similar to the crnp footprints bogena et al 2013 franz et al 2016 jakobi et al 2018 the possibility of using crnp measurements for monitoring soil moisture has also been successfully verified under various conditions including deserts franz et al 2012 semiarid regions schreiner mcgraw et al 2016 temperate humid regions baatz et al 2014 agricultural areas baroni et al 2018 franz et al 2015 mcjannet et al 2017 and forested areas heidbuchel et al 2016 nguyen et al 2017 the neutron intensity sensed by crnp is affected by various environmental factors as well as soil moisture if the covered area is not a wide flat and homogeneous region various environmental factors will make soil moisture estimation difficult due to complex interactions therefore it is necessary to separate the effect of each factor on neutron moderation before calibration in complex terrain however simple arithmetic separation addition and subtraction is impossible because the environmental factors affect neutron intensity simultaneously and numerous collisions cause energy loss for this reason various correction methods have been suggested to decrease the impact of other factors on neutron counts observed from crnp within the calibration process the main consideration in the typical calibration process is the reduction of neutron count by the higher air pressure atmospheric water vapor and the lower incoming neutron flux intensity hawdon et al 2014 rosolem et al 2013 zreda et al 2008 it is clear that they have a major influence on neutron regulation but the factors that actually affect them are more diverse as an example heidbuchel et al 2016 have also found that soil organic matter and root biomass can improve the calibration results in a forested site more complex regions are affected by more factors but ironically it is too difficult to acquire data to consider all of these factors to eliminate the effects of various unknown factors iwema et al 2015 suggested a multi point calibration based on the percentile of the wetness condition similar kinds of multi point calibrations using quartiles of variables affecting neutrons will always exhibit better performance than conventional results however it is recommended to avoid such situation as much as possible to make the calibration process simpler and produce stable data within this context the main objective of this study is to analyze the impacts of main correcting variables separately and propose a framework for crnp calibration under complex environment data from an experimental site located in a mountainous area was used to evaluate the impact and efficiency of each factor independently risks in estimating soil moisture at the early stage with and without the corrections were also assessed for each case with different availability of the factors the expected biases and errors were analyzed and a process for recalibration was proposed soil moisture estimated from crnp smcrnp was tested for its validity using weighted average soil moisture captured from in situ sensors smin situ 2 materials and methods 2 1 seolmacheon experimental site smc a crnp was installed at the study area the seolmacheon experimental site smc in northern south korea 37 94 n 126 95 e in august 2018 the site is located in the monsoon influenced hot summer humid continental climate zone dwa in köppen geiger classification peel et al 2007 with a mean annual temperature of 10 9 c and mean annual precipitation of 1 459 mm the crnp is located in a densely vegetated forest with complex terrain fig 1 the experimental site covers approximately 70 000 m2 in a spherical form centered around the crnp and is characterized dominantly by loamy sand with a rock bed a capacitance sensor based soil moisture network was installed around the crnp nine capacitance sensors in four specific locations 1 5 7 8 in fig 1 were installed together with the crnp in august 2018 and seven more sensors were installed in march 2019 to better represent the site s topographical hydrological characteristics in this study the data from april 2019 to october 2020 were used since there was a significant difference between the representability before and after the new installation in 2019 not shown which will be further addressed in a future study data from november to march when soil freezes were also removed due to the failures of the sensors in measuring soil moisture correctly furthermore the whole time series of soil moisture measurements during study period was inspected for quality control following standards in dorigo et al 2013 the locations of the sensors were chosen based first on the distances from the crnp approximately 0 100 and 150 m in radius and by considering the crnp s effective footprint 600 m in diameter at sea level desilets and zreda 2013 the specific points were decided by the geological property where the sub ground rock foundation is located at least 1 m below ground providing a clear profile of soil moisture and the wetting drying process the exact locations of the crnp and surrounding capacitance sensors are provided in table 1 in addition to the crnp and capacitance sensors meteorological data relative humidity atmospheric temperature atmospheric pressure precipitation were collected from an automatic weather station aws installed on a flux tower park et al 2015 2 2 weighting of in situ sensors measurements of soil moisture at four different depths 10 20 30 and 40 cm from the surface at each capacitance sensor yield 64 observations in total to make these observations valid for comparison with crnp soil moisture they were vertically and horizontally averaged with weighting to account for the individual contributions depending on each measurement s depth and distance from crnp bogena et al 2013 zreda et al 2008 and kohli et al 2015 demonstrated that the neutron signal detected by crnp varies with measuring depth and is the most sensitive to the surface layers franz et al 2012 proposed a weighting function using a linear relationship between penetration depth and soil moisture θ schron et al 2017 further developed this vertical weighting function wd to take the distance r from the crnp air pressure p and vegetation height hveg into account 1 w d r θ p h veg e 2 d d where d stands for the depth in meter of the individual measurement and d the penetration depth in meter defined as 2 d d 86 r θ ρ bulk here the penetration depth is corrected for air pressure and vegetation height in scaled distance r in m to represent the effective depth above which 86 of neutrons are expected to have traveled the soil kohli et al 2015 in this study total measurements were vertically weighted averaged according to eq 1 and 2 for more detailed descriptions of the process and the parameters used see schron et al 2017 generally in situ measurements within a footprint are simply averaged when evaluating remotely sensed products since the remotely sensed products themselves are representative of the area of interest however when it comes to crnp a simple averaging method could neglect the significant differences between neutron signals from different distances we therefore applied the horizontal weighting function wr from kohli et al 2015 and schron et al 2017 3 w r h θ p h veg f 1 e f 2 r f 3 e f 4 r 1 e f 0 r f 1 e f 2 r f 3 e f 4 r f 5 e f 6 r f 7 e f 8

calculation processes are provided in schron et al 2017 2 3 correction of neutron count the neutron signal sensed by crnp varies with surrounding atmospheric water vapor pressure and incoming flux of neutrons and has been corrected for those variables so that it contains variabilities affected solely by soil moisture hawdon et al 2014 rosolem et al 2013 zreda et al 2012 the measured neutron counts nraw is corrected into ncorr by following 4 n corr n raw f wv f p f i where fwv fp fi are the correction factors unitless of water vapor atmospheric pressure and incoming neutron flux intensity respectively water vapor in the surrounding atmosphere attenuates the neutron signal in way that is similar to that of soil moisture that is the hydrogen atoms in vapor moderate fast neutrons rosolem et al 2013 modelled this relationship to derive a correction factor fwv in a linear form 5 f wv 1 0 0054 ρ ρ ref where ρ and ρref are measured and the reference absolute humidity in g m3 respectively absolute humidity was calculated from relative humidity and temperature measured from the aws atmospheric pressure is known to have the biggest influence on the variability of neutron counts zreda et al 2012 the correction factor fp is calculated by 6 f p exp p p ref l where p refers to the measured atmospheric pressure in mbar and pref is the reference l is the mass attenuation length that ranges from 128 to 142 mbar according to the site s latitude desilets and zreda 2003 for our study area we used a value of 140 845 mbar following nguyen et al 2017 the incoming neutron flux intensity was corrected following the method proposed in hawdon et al 2014 in which the different geomagnetic cutoff rigidities between our site and the jungfraujoch neutron monitoring station were considered the correction factor fi is derived from 7 f i i m i ref 1 0 075 r csmc r cjung 1 1 where im and iref are the measured and the reference incoming neutron flux intensity in count per second cps respectively rcsmc is the cutoff rigidity in gv for our site and rcjung is the cutoff rigidity at the jungfraujoch station rcjung was 4 49 gv and rcsmc was 11 22gv which is the cutoff rigidity at the daejeon neutron monitoring station south korea the time series of incoming neutron flux intensities and the cutoff rigidities were available at the neutron monitor database nmdb http www nmdb eu 2 4 calibration of the crnp corrected neutron counts were converted to volumetric soil moisture through a shape defining function proposed by desilets et al 2010 8 θ ρ bd a 0 n corr n 0 a 1 a 2 where ρbd is the soil bulk density averaged from every in situ location 1 17 g cm3 and the ai s are shape fitting parameters simulated by mcnpx a0 0 0808 a1 0 372 a2 0 115 n0 is the neutron intensity under the driest soil condition in the experimental site environment it is the only constant that is subject to calibration the corrected neutron counts and averaged in situ soil moisture data are first 24 h block averaged to reduce noises attributed to crnp evans et al 2016 n0 is then fitted into a constant value that minimizes the root mean square error rmse between in situ soil moisture and soil moisture from crnp calculated as θ in eq 8 jakobi et al 2018 2 5 inversely calculated n0 rearranging eq 8 with respect to n0 we get 9 n 0 i n v n corr a 0 θ ρ bd a 2 a 1 since we are assuming ncorr is a function of soil moisture humidity pressure and neutron intensity n corr θ ρ p i m subtraction of one correction factor in eq 4 yields a unique dependency between n0 inv and the subtracted variable hereafter vtarget this is possible because inversely calculating n0 eliminates the effect of soil moisture by converting the orthogonal coordinate space between ncorr soil moisture and vtarget along the characteristic curve see figs 5 9 for example we analyzed the efficiency and direction of each correction by comparing the relationship between vtarget and n0 inv which is calculated from eq 9 with ncorr not corrected for humidity pressure and neutron intensity see section 3 2 the mean and standard deviation of n0 inv gives direct insight into the finally fitted n0 and the error range of smcrnp to analyze such a relationship we simulated smcrnp with sets of n0 inv manipulated to have different standard deviations by using the following equation 10 n 0 i n v r e s c a l e d n 0 i n v n 0 i n v σ original σ t arg e t n 0 i n v where σtarget is the standard deviation of interest smcrnp was derived by 1 calculating ncorr from eq 9 and 2 fitting n0 to minimize the rmse between smin situ and smcrnp 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance metric based on inversely calculated n0 the distribution of n0 inv is directly related to the estimated smcrnp performance fig 2 shows the scatter between smin situ and nraw ncorr with the calibration curves drawn at data points that have the largest and smallest n0 scatter colored red it also compares the histograms of n0 inv at the smc site soil moisture ranges from 0 09 to 0 30 m3 m3 and nraw from 1233 to 1700 cph while ncorr ranges from 1250 to 1672 cph smin situ and nraw are negatively correlated along the calibration curve and this relationship is clearer with ncorr the degree of such a relationship can be directly understood from the histogram of n0 inv after correction the distance between the maximum and minimum calibration curves decreases and the range of n0 inv decreases accordingly from 419 12 to 242 58 cph furthermore the standard deviation of n0 inv decreases from 87 18 to 48 47 cph which indicates that the performed corrections reduce the uncertainty in determining the final n0 and thus reduce the anticipated error in smcrnp since the purpose of the crnp calibration is to produce continuous and stable soil moisture estimation using a fixed calibration parameter n0 andreasen et al 2017a vather et al 2019 the distribution of n0 inv is a good criterion for assessing whether the corrections are properly or sufficiently performed everything else being the same the standard deviations of the n0 inv and rmse of smcrnp are linearly related to see how the performance of smcrnp in terms of correlation correlation coefficient r and error rmse changes depending on the standard deviation of n0 inv we rescaled n0 inv in fig 2b to have a standard deviation from 40 to 100 cph and simulated smcrnp with the final n0 fitted to minimize rmse during the study period fig 3 as the standard deviation increases the correlation coefficient decreases exponentially from 0 96 to 0 81 and the rmse increases linearly from 0 012 m3 m3 to 0 029 m3 m3 due to the larger range of soil moisture these two lines are site specific but this result could provide guidance for researchers who set target metrics according to their applications entekhabi et al 2010b fig 4 depicts smin situ at the smc site black line and smcrnp calculated with n0 inv having a standard deviation of 40 red line and 100 blue line smcrnp significantly underestimates smin situ in the lower range of soil moisture 0 2 m3 m3 and overestimates it in the higher range of soil moisture when the standard deviation of n0 inv is large additionally large variances during drying especially in apr to jul 2019 and oct 2020 led to a significant reduction of correlation on the other hand the small standard deviation of n0 inv both decreases the degree of under overestimation and reduces variances these results emphasize the importance of employing proper corrections and analyzing each correction factor s efficiency in reducing the standard deviation of n0 inv which are addressed in the following sections 3 2 evaluation of correction factors as mentioned earlier n0 inv excludes the effect of soil moisture on the neutron count therefore n0 inv is only dependent on the correcting variables specifically when ncorr in eq 9 is substituted with nraw n0 inv is dependent on absolute humidity air pressure and incoming neutron flux intensity when substituted with np i neutron count corrected for air pressure and incoming neutron flux intensity n0 inv is dependent only on absolute humidity and so forth likewise we assume n0 inv calculated with ncorr does not have a relationship with any variable since water vapor in the atmosphere has a stopping ability that moderates fast neutrons fwv corrects for lower neutron counts in more humid conditions rosolem et al 2013 fig 5 shows scatter between absolute humidity and n0 inv drawn with nraw np i and ncorr the absolute humidity and n0 inv appear to be scattered irregularly in fig 5a because there are mixed dependencies with the three correcting variables however after applying fp and fi there appears to be a clear inverse relationship with a correlation coefficient of 0 78 in fig 5b the correlation clearly shows that the variation of the absolute humidity at the smc site affects the calibration process the standard deviation 78 77 cph and the range 1992 to 2366 cph of n0 inv indicates that the uncertainty in determining n0 will become larger without the correction of the absolute humidity after applying fwv the correlation coefficient decreases to 0 07 reducing the relationship significantly fig 5c the standard deviation of n0 inv decreased to 48 47 cph and the range decreased by 36 2045 to 2287 cph the smaller standard deviation and range decreases the bias of smcrnp by n0 determined with low uncertainty during the calibration process in other words a reduction in the standard deviation of n0 inv after applying a correction factor has the effect of reducing the uncertainty of smcrnp therefore we concluded that the fwv proposed by rosolem et al 2013 works properly at the smc site high air pressure directly reduces the intensity of neutron nuclei cascades during their interaction with the atmosphere since the neutron intensity decreases by approximately a factor of two for each additional 100 hpa zreda et al 2008 air pressure usually has the greatest impact on the neutron counts in regions with large pressure differences at the smc site the air pressure varies between 963 hpa and 995 hpa and has a relatively clear relationship with n0 inv drawn with nraw fig 6 a with a correlation coefficient of 0 61 the correlation is more apparent r 0 88 with n0 inv drawn with nwv i neutron count corrected for absolute humidity and incoming neutron flux intensity fig 6b the standard deviation is 99 17 which is larger than that with absolute humidity the higher correlation and larger standard deviation imply that correcting for air pressure has a significant effect on the determination of n0 the wider range of the n0 inv 1896 to 2432 cph also indicates that the uncertainty in determining n0 will be even larger than when absolute humidity is not corrected for the effect of air pressure on neutron count significantly diminishes r 0 06 by applying fp fig 6c in addition range of n0 inv decreases by 55 after the application of fp the larger degree to which the uncertainty in estimating soil moisture is reduced makes the correction of atmospheric pressure the most critical correction at the smc site unlike the other two factors incoming neutron flux intensity has no evident relationship with n0 inv calculated using nwv p neutron count corrected for absolute humidity and air pressure fig 7 b the neutron flux intensity and n0 inv are even negatively correlated with a correlation coefficient value of 0 14 since the correction factor fi corrects neutron count in a direction that removes the positive correlation between the neutron flux intensity and neutron count one could expect that correcting the neutron flux intensity should degrade the calibration after applying fi as expected the range of n0 inv increased fig 7c the range of n0 inv before the correction was from 2051 to 2270 cph 10 larger than the range after correction which indicates that the uncertainty of the calibration is smaller than that observed after the correction this result suggests that it is not beneficial to apply fi at the smc site if there is no clear positive correlation between neutron flux intensity and n0 inv fig 8 shows the temporal variation of the three correcting variables corresponding correction factors and the combined correction factor at the smc site the effect of fp ranging from 0 9 to 1 1 was the greatest which is consistent to previous studies evans et al 2016 zreda et al 2012 since the correction factors show the same fluctuation as each variable the combined correction factor resembles the variation of the air pressure on the other hand fi shows the smallest variation ranging from 0 99 to 1 01 which is relatively negligible this is mainly due to the absence of an extreme variation in neutron flux hawdon et al 2014 in our study period this could also be the reason why there is no clear positive correlation in fig 7b there are clear signs of seasonal patterns in absolute humidity and air pressure because of the distinct seasonality of south korea fig 8 absolute humidity is the highest in the summer season with the asian monsoon while air pressure is the lowest in the same season resulting in the opposite seasonal pattern kim et al 2017 shin et al 2021 such opposite seasonal patterns yield a complementary relationship between the corrections of absolute humidity and air pressure which can be found in table 2 where the basic statistics of n0 inv and the correlation coefficient and rmse between smin situ and smcrnp for every case of corrections are provided when the neutron count is corrected only for the absolute humidity the standard deviation of n0 inv and the rmse of smcrnp increased because there remains a bias from the opposite seasonality of air pressure in addition the correlation coefficient also decreases since applying fwv makes the neutron count rely more on the variation of air pressure which has the largest effect when the neutron count is corrected only for the air pressure the correlation coefficient is improved because the intra seasonal variation from air pressure is eliminated however the improvement in the rmse is negligible because of the bias from remaining seasonality of the absolute humidity although the specific degree of improvements and degradations are site specific this kind of complex dependency to the correcting variables has been mentioned elsewhere kohli et al 2015 when both absolute humidity and air pressure are corrected for the best performance is obtained with correlation coefficient 0 95 and rmse of 0 014 m3 m3 which are comparable to the previous studies conducted under complex environment with vegetations bogena et al 2013 lv et al 2014 nguyen et al 2019 vather et al 2020 on the other hand correcting for the incoming neutron flux intensity always makes the result worse the results in this section emphasize the process of examining if there are clear correlations between the correcting variables and n0 inv in terms of the direction size and efficiency of each correction one should be particularly careful to avoid over correction that is situations in which the correcting power of a factor is too large and results in an inverse correlation this could lead to incorrect conclusions about the efficiency or appropriateness of other factors it is especially true at the smc site where the absolute humidity and air pressure show similar seasonal patterns in opposite direction since air pressure dominates the variation of the neutron count it is critical to apply fp appropriately to assess the other correction factors suitability 3 3 error characteristics due to limited data at early stage calibration shortly after installation of a crnp it is difficult to obtain sufficient data to determine when a parameter n0 is to be calibrated without knowledge of the annual pattern of the surrounding environmental condition no matter how adequately the in situ sensors for calculating the average soil moisture are set up it is not known whether the set up reflects the site s characteristics a common challenge in crnp calibration is how to determine an n0 that reflects the characteristics of the site the physical meaning of n0 is the neutron intensity under dry conditions and it is an important criterion for assuming the variations in neutron counts as primarily due to soil moisture desilets et al 2010 in the practical calibration process n0 determines the positioning of the calibration curve in this section we analyze the uncertainty that may occur in the early stage calibration process with limited data as mentioned in section 3 2 atmospheric water vapor is a factor that directly reduces neutron intensity fig 9a b show the distribution of the absolute humidity on soil moisture and neutron count space a layer of absolute humidity along the calibration curve is observed as higher absolute humidity is related to lower n0 fig 9a for this reason the calibration curves drawn at points with the maximum ahmax and minimum ahmin absolute humidity filled scatter points almost match the minimum and maximum n0 curves respectively without an atmospheric water vapor correction a risk exists in the calibration process due to the potentially layered data ahmax and ahmin are therefore the possible curves with the largest uncertainty in such situations from eq 5 and eq 9 using an absolute humidity greater than the reference absolute humidity results in an n0 that is smaller than the real site characteristics in other words the maximum absolute humidity underestimates soil moisture by calculating a lower n0 and places the calibration curve on the left while the minimum absolute humidity overestimates soil moisture by drawing the calibration curve on the right in particular smcrnp calibrated from the ahmin curve produced excessive errors under wet soil conditions fig 10 a this is because when calibrated under arid conditions reduction in the neutron counts is considered to be originated only from soil moisture neglecting the effect of water vapor conversely the ahmax curve determines all of the reasons for the increase in neutron counts as the effects of soil moisture and underestimates soil moisture when the absolute humidity decrease without a decrease in soil moisture these are consistent with the results in rosolem et al 2013 soil moisture was underestimated consistently especially during dry period when calibrated under moist atmospheric condition without correction for humidity and overestimated when calibrated under dry atmospheric condition therefore for regions with distinct seasonality and large annual variability it is recommended to use humidity meters together with crnp or at least use data from nearby stations to ensure the accuracy of smcrnp the layered distribution by absolute humidity disappears through a humidity correction fig 9b and significantly reduces the risk of error in soil moisture estimation air pressure formed a clearer and wider layer distribution in the soil moisture and neutron count space as previously shown in section 3 2 this had the greatest effect on calibration in this region fig 9c therefore the calibration is at risk for having the largest error if there is no atmospheric pressure correction similar to the previous case the calibration curves drawn at the maximum pa max and minimum pa min air pressure almost match with the minimum and maximum n0 curves respectively however since the annual variation pattern of air pressure in smc site is opposite to that of soil moisture the scatter between smcrnp and smin situ show a wider distribution than that in fig 10a resulting in significant errors in both cases calibrated with pa max and pa min curves fig 10b since air pressure tends to exhibit large variability over a relatively short period of time as well as annual seasonality we recommend using multi point n0 which is proposed by heidbuchel et al 2016 when the local air pressure characteristic is unknown even if the recalibration is performed frequently to prevent large errors the correlation coefficient is not expected to improve sufficiently the effect of incoming neutron flux intensity on this region is very small and unclear compared to other factors even when the effects of absolute humidity and air pressure are removed no layered distribution by incoming neutron flux intensity is observed and the width between the calibration curves is relatively narrow fig 9e besides two calibration curves having the maximum and minimum n0 were drawn with im values of 167 35 cps and 164 55 cps respectively contrary to expectations that higher im will give a larger n0 the smc site has rather shown the opposite trend therefore considering the im in smc site is not a priority even when all corrections can be performed continuously risks remain in the early stages of calibration a degree of uncertainty originates from the remaining gap between the maximum and minimum n0 curves fig 9b d f setting a calibration date at some point at the early stage could lead to a biased smcrnp fig 10d and the bias will remain permanently without a recalibration when the sensors used for measuring the correcting variables are unavailable within a crnp site it is desirable to determine the initial calibration point by investigating the annual variability of atmospheric water vapor and atmospheric pressure in the region of interest through a nearby weather station in particular identifying the seasonality of soil moisture and main factors can help understand the characteristics of errors in smcrnp data 3 4 determining calibration cycle with convergence of error although correcting for main variables allows successful estimation of soil moisture variation in the region the early stage calibration risks increasing the biases of smcrnp from the determination of the skewed parameter n0 therefore a recalibration is required to determine the final n0 after the initial calibration to ensure stable soil moisture estimation furthermore it is possible to operate crnp stations efficiently by selectively employing correction factors through analyses of the main correction variables reflecting the site characteristics to determine the point of recalibration data from the first day to different extents are used to derive n0 and smcrnp as shown in fig 11 n0 stabilizes after approximately one seasonal cycle since n0 is fitted to the value that minimized rmse the rmse increases gradually and converges to 0 015 m3 m3 to further evaluate smcrnp derived with different intervals of data the modified kling gupta efficiency kge kling et al 2012 statistic is calculated with 50 100 150 200 and 400 accumulative data points table 3 the bias is always smaller than 1 the error in the variability of smcrnp decreases rapidly during 100 days and gradually reaches 11 at 200 days accordingly kge converges to 0 87 at 200 days which corresponds to one seasonal cycle at the smc site the results suggest that if a site has a periodic pattern such as seasonality it is desirable to have a recalibration period of at least one cycle nevertheless if a station has not reached its target correlation and bias it should be recalibrated so that n0 and rmse become stable in some crnp stations the data required for a calibration could be missing either partially or totally due to a malfunctioning or absence of a sensor fig 12 a shows the final calibration results assuming that absolute humidity data cannot be obtained even when correction is not performed for absolute humidity it is highly correlated with smin situ r 0 9 and the rmse is also reasonable rmse 0 026 the low absolute humidity in the spring months of april and may leads to underestimation of soil moisture but in other seasons smcrnp agrees with smin situ except during peaks caused by rainfall in conclusion even if humidity data are missing from this site reliable soil moisture can be expected except in spring and rainy days in this case one could expect to obtain reasonable smcrnp data with recalibration period of one seasonal cycle like aforementioned since air pressure has the greatest effect on the neutron moderation and has the opposite seasonality to soil moisture the correlation was relatively low and the rmse also increased when the correction was not performed fig 12b the low correlation particularly attributes to the large intra seasonal variability of air pressure the effects of air pressure on this site mainly appear after october when sharp increases in air pressure lead to a significant decrease in neutron counts observed in the crnp resulting in an increase in smcrnp since the main source of error is unpredictable intra seasonal variability rather than predictable seasonal pattern of air pressure as pointed out in section 3 3 it is recommended to adopt multi point n0 method in this case on the other hand for im better results were achieved when the correction was not performed than when it was performed fig 12c d in mixed forests with complex terrain and distinct seasonality like the smc site it is very difficult to obtain auxiliary information e g biomass soil organic matters although they are known to affect neutron intensity andreasen et al 2017b baatz et al 2015 coopersmith et al 2014 the combined effect of these factors that is unknown could hide the independent impact of im another possibility is that the im data used in this study may not accurately reflect the characteristics of the site because it is not directly observed at the smc site in the final n0 determination process after two seasonal cycles it was concluded that fi was not effective in estimating smcrnp at the smc site in the process of finalizing the parameter n0 it is possible to employ correction factors selectively for continuous site operations if the relationship between neutron count and soil moisture is clear 4 summary and conclusion cosmic ray neutron probe crnp is very efficient in estimating soil moisture in that it is easy to install has excellent data acquisition stability and can monitor intermediate scale soil moisture non invasively these advantages of crnp make it suitable for use in complex regions such as mountainous terrain nevertheless the difficulties of obtaining influencing variables and of calibrating in complex terrains hinder the applications of crnp with the data obtained from the smc site this study analyzed the effects of major correction variables and characteristics of possible errors based on the results we proposed a framework to evaluate the independent effect of the correcting variables to calibrate the parameter n0 and to produce reliable crnp soil moisture measurements fig 13 after an installation of crnp and other sensors smcrnp can be estimated temporarily through initial calibration as mentioned in section 3 3 a possibility that smcrnp could be over under estimated by skewed n0 determination must be considered if all correcting variables are available the degree of correlation between neutron counts and each variable and the efficiency of corresponding correction factors should be evaluated using n0 inv based on the evaluation an effective correction factor can be selected for a recalibration process if clear relationships between neutron count and major factors are removed properly through corrections the recalibration period can be set if one or more correcting variables are unavailable n0 should be frequently recalibrated to avoid large errors in terms of the operational aspects of the observatory however frequent recalibration is inefficient since it affects the reliability of past soil moisture data moreover crnp cannot work as an independent sensor since it continuously requires smin situ for recalibration process therefore an examination on the characteristics of the missing variable in the area should be preceded by available observations nearby in the case of a variable with distinct seasonality and small intra seasonal variation e g absolute humidity in this study recalibration after a period reflecting the whole seasonal pattern is recommended if the variable has relatively large intra seasonal variation e g air pressure in this study it is recommended to adopt multiple n0 s to get the target precision obtaining reliable soil moisture data that could represent an area in mountainous terrain with dense vegetation has always been tricky the smc site showed great performance using the framework for crnp calibration proposed in this study validation with smin situ showed a high correlation coefficient of 0 95 and an rmse of 0 014 smcrnp also shows coincidence with rainfall events observed from aws unlike the several existing crnp based operational networks e g cosmos cosmoz there has been no such network in korea the results and the proposed framework show the possibility of using a crnp system in complex terrain with the least number of data and this will contribute to extend the crnp based soil moisture network

4321,water scarcity has become a major issue to sustainable development it can be estimated by available fresh water resources and human water withdrawal which are affected by both climate change and human activities however the key drivers for the changes in water scarcity at global scale remain unclear due to large uncertainties in the estimations of the contributions from changes in water withdrawal and water availability by using a newly reconstructed water withdrawal dataset and multi model simulations of water availability this study assessed global water scarcity evolution during 1971 2010 at half degree resolution and monthly time scale by applying the water stress index wsi results showed that wsi increased in areas with 61 1 of global population during 1971 2010 and the increase in water withdrawal especially agricultural sector was the key driving factor for areas with 57 5 of global population specifically growing water withdrawal led to increased water scarcity for areas with 21 of global population in spite of rising water availability resulted from climate change such as in southeastern china southeast asia southern india and central africa in contrast water scarcity mitigated over some developed areas including parts of usa europe and japan with 8 8 of global population which resulted from decreased human water withdrawal especially industrial sector and increased water availability this study reveals the synergistic or contrary effects of changes in water withdrawal and water availability on the changes in water scarcity over the globe and provides useful information for regional water planning and management keywords water scarcity water withdrawal water availability water stress index 1 introduction water resources is essential to human life socioeconomic development and ecosystem health during the past several decades human water withdrawal increased a lot due to rapid growth of population and increasing living standard shiklomanov 2000 döll et al 2009 wada and bierkens 2014 huang et al 2018 as water demand approaches or even exceeds the total renewable freshwater resources water scarcity has become one of the major risks to sustainable development in many areas of the world kummu et al 2016 water scarcity is not only affected by hydroclimate conditions which result in the amount of freshwater availability but also human water demand as well as socioeconomic factors and governmental policies dell angelo et al 2018 thus water scarcity could be considered from both physical and economic perspectives rosa et al 2020a physical water scarcity can be divided into green water scarcity and blue water scarcity where green water scarcity indicates the root zone soil moisture is insufficient to sustain crop production and blue water scarcity refers to the freshwater availability in surface and groundwater bodies can t meet human water withdrawal liu et al 2017a while economic water scarcity is defined as the condition where renewable freshwater resources are physically available but lack of socioeconomic and institutional capacity that limits societal ability to use that water rosa et al 2020a in this study we mainly focused on blue water scarcity as water scarcity would threat food security human health socioeconomic development as well as ecosystem services cheng et al 2009 rodell et al 2009 taylor et al 2013 yin et al 2017 understanding the spatial and temporal changing patterns of water scarcity and its driving factors at global scale is very important for sustainable use of water resources current water scarcity assessments were mostly based on simulations from global hydrological models ghms which considered the impacts of both climate change and human activities hanasaki et al 2013 hejazi et al 2015 wada et al 2016 flörke et al 2018 water stress index wsi which was defined as the ratio of water demand to water availability was often used to assess water scarcity conditions vörösmarty et al 2000 oki and kanae 2006 veldkamp et al 2017 water demand was often estimated as the sum of water withdrawal consumption from multiple water use sectors and water availability was calculated by river discharge vörösmarty et al 2005 hanasaki et al 2013 veldkamp et al 2017 therein model based water withdrawal simulations were often based on macroscale socioeconomic activity data and assumed simple changes in technological factors and water conservancy measures which might lead to biased trends in water withdrawal as well as uncertainties in water scarcity assessment zhou et al 2020 recent reconstructed water withdrawal data consisted of both water withdrawal estimations from ghms and historical water withdrawal records from surveys and statistical data and the spatial and temporal downscaling algorithms were applied to generate monthly gridded sectoral water withdrawal products huang et al 2018 despite that the downscaling algorithms may lead to uncertainties in sectoral water withdrawal estimation the application of reported water withdrawal data at country level in the reconstructed water withdrawal dataset could provide more reliable changing trend of water withdrawal against commonly used model simulation huang et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 thus the use of this reconstructed water withdrawal dataset could bring new insight into the changing pattern of historical global water scarcity a wealth of studies have assessed the spatial and temporal patterns of global water scarcity over the past decades and results agreed that global water scarcity had increased significantly along with warming climate and human activities but the magnitude of increasing trends varied across regions kummu et al 2010 furthermore previous studies have analyzed the impacts of hydro climate variability and climate change on water scarcity such as the influences from trends in climate factors le blanc and perez 2008 wada and bierkens 2014 gosling and arnell 2016 el niño southern oscillation enso and inter annual variability veldkamp et al 2015 on the other hand human activities including population growth increasing food demand reservoir regulation human induced land use change and human water use would also greatly affect evolution of water scarcity conditions liu et al 2017a schewe et al 2014 it has been found that growth in population and gross domestic product gdp increased the water scarcity mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 fant et al 2016 human interventions e g land use and land cover change reservoir regulation and human water use lead to water scarcity hotspots travelling to downstream areas veldkamp et al 2017 however previous studies regarding the driving factors of the changes in water scarcity mostly focused on a single factor water scarcity is determined by the availability of freshwater resources and the level of water withdrawal changes in water withdrawal varied across regions due to differences in socioeconomic development stage population growth rate and water saving techniques while water availability also showed different changing patterns under climate change therefore an explicit assessment of the relative contribution of changes in water withdrawal and water availability to water scarcity evolution at global regional and local scales is necessary moreover previous studies mostly focused on intensification of water scarcity and its driving factors for example wada et al 2011 reported that increased water withdrawal was the decisive factor for heightened water stress throughout the globe however the recent report from united nation un on sustainable development goals sdg 6 4 2 found that water scarcity increased for most countries but decreased for 44 countries where half of them were located in europe fao 2018 the dominant factor that driving the decreased water scarcity in these regions was still unknown since water withdrawal and water availability showed different changing patterns across global areas identifying the dominant drivers changes in water withdrawal or water availability that affected water scarcity changing pattern i e increase or decrease is of great significance for explaining the mechanisms behind the changes in water scarcity to address the above issues this study presented an explicit assessment of global water scarcity evolution that accounted for changes in water withdrawal and water availability during past decades based on a newly reconstructed water withdrawal dataset and multi model simulations of water availability the aims of this study were to assess the hotspots areas with significant change of water scarcity and further quantify the contribution of changes in sectoral water withdrawal and water availability to the changes in water scarcity thus finally identify the dominant factors that drive the changes in water scarcity at global regional and local scales to explain the mechanisms behind the changing patterns in water scarcity 2 data and methods in this study we obtained monthly water availability simulation from the inter sectoral impact model inter comparison project phase 2a isimip 2a which was generated by five ghms together with monthly water withdrawal dataset from huang et al 2018 global water scarcity assessment was performed by using the commonly used evaluation index i e wsi at half degree resolution and monthly time scale then another two experiments were designed to estimate the relative contribution of changes in water withdrawal and water availability to changes in global and regional water scarcity furthermore this study also separated the effects of sectoral water withdrawal i e agricultural industrial and domestic on regional water scarcity conditions we also defined nine types of changing mechanisms in wsi to further identify the dominant factors driving wsi change at grid scale an overview of the steps taken in the methodology was shown in fig 1 and table s1 data and methods were described in detail by the following subsections 2 1 hydrological simulation from isimip2a in this study hydrological simulation during the period 1971 2010 was obtained from the isimip2a https www isimip org protocol isimip2a gosling et al 2017 which was performed by five ghms namely dbh tang et al 2007 huang et al 2019 h08 hanasaki et al 2008a b lpjml biemans et al 2011 bondeau et al 2007 rost et al 2008 pcr globwb van beek et al 2011 wada et al 2011 and watergap2 flörke et al 2013 müller schmied et al 2014 müller schmied et al 2016 following the isimip2a simulation protocol these ghms were simulated at global half degree spatial resolution for the period 1971 2010 forced by three different global observations based historical meteorological forcing datasets i e the princeton sheffield et al 2006 gswp3 http hydro iis u tokyo ac jp gswp3 and wfdei weedon et al 2014 all ghms run with the same river routing map to generate streamflow within river basins ddm30 döll and lehner 2002 furthermore each ghm conducted two simulations with varsoc and without nosoc human impacts therein simulations in the varsoc experiment considered the impacts of both climate change and direct human activities i e human water use reservoir regulation and land use changes while hydrological simulation under nosoc only considered climate change impacts in terms of the parameterizations of direct human activities all these ghms used macroscale socioeconomic and hydro climatological datasets and parameters to estimate sectoral water use sources of water withdrawal defined in dbh h08 and lpjml were water resources in rivers and reservoirs while these for pcr globwb and watergap2 were both surface water and groundwater in terms of the return flow all these ghms used similar scheme for return flow of industrial returning to surface water and domestic returning to surface water water use but return flow from irrigation water use was different among ghms dbh and h08 defined that exceeded irrigation water withdrawal returned to the soil by means of infiltration while pcr globwb assumed that extra irrigation water withdrawal flowed back to soil via infiltration and groundwater via additional recharge lpjml and watergap2 returned directly to rivers and groundwater respectively and time varying land use and land cover change lulcc was also represented under varsoc runs therein present day year 2000 rainfed and irrigated areas from mirca2000 portmann et al 2010 cropland and pasture extents from ramankutty et al 2008 and trends of agricultural land from hyde3 were combined following fader et al 2010 to create a time varying dataset with information on lulcc as well as the extent of irrigated areas the reservoir information was derived from the global reservoir and dam grand database lehner et al 2011 and the operation schemes of hanasaki et al 2006 biemans et al 2011 and haddeland et al 2006 formed the basis of the reservoir operation schemes in these ghms due to differences not only in generation of local runoff and discharge but also in the parameterization of direct human activities modules and water withdrawal allocation methods hydrological simulations varied across ghms and we refer to liu et al 2017b masaki et al 2017 and veldkamp et al 2018 for a comprehensive overview of inter comparison of hydrological simulation by ghms a detailed representation of simulation by ghms runs were represented in table s2 monthly water flux i e streamflow surface runoff and baseflow simulated under varsoc experiments by ghms was treated as water availability for global water scarcity assessment water availability in this study refers to the monthly availability of renewable water resources in rivers which consists of the locally generated runoff in each grid cell and the incoming discharge from upstream cells being subtracted by the upstream water consumption 1 w a i m r i m q i m w c m where w a i m was the total water availability for grid cell i in the month m m3 month 1 r i m was the local runoff generated in grid cell i and month m m3 month 1 q i m was the upstream discharge flowing into cell i from all upstream grid cells in month m m3 month 1 and wcm was the upstream water consumption in month m m3 month 1 in addition ghms estimated water consumption based on water withdrawal simulation and water allocation rules and the parameterization schemes were different among ghms see table s2 thus monthly water availability was calculated by ghms with the consideration of upstream water consumption additionally the amount of water storage in the lakes aquifers and groundwater was assumed to be in equilibrium where the absolute values were unknown and also hard to estimate thus non renewable water resources e g fossil groundwater were not taken into consideration 2 2 reconstructed monthly gridded water withdrawal data global monthly gridded sectoral water withdrawal dataset which was used for global water scarcity assessment was obtained from huang et al 2018 where various sources of reported and estimated water withdrawal datasets were collected and consolidated and were reconstructed to finer resolutions this reconstructed water withdrawal dataset included water withdrawal for agricultural irrigation and livestock industrial electricity generation mining and manufacturing and domestic sectors for the period 1971 2010 at half degree resolution and monthly time scale therein irrigation water withdrawal data was reconstructed by correcting isimip2a simulation under varsoc section 2 1 using reported irrigation water withdrawal at the national level industrial and domestic water withdrawal were obtained by downscaling various sources of reported water withdrawal datasets from national regional scale to gridded and monthly scales by spatial and temporal statistical downscaling algorithms and the downscaling algorithms were also similar to the parameterization used in ghms e g h08 pcr globwb and watergap hanasaki et al 2008a wada et al 2011 flörke et al 2013 the schematic representation about the water withdrawal datasets and water availability simulation see section 2 1 was shown in fig s1 2 3 water scarcity assessment wsi defined as the ratio of water withdrawal to water availability was used to quantify water scarcity condition in this study this indicator can well represent the imbalance between water availability and total water demand for humans for a specific region over a specific time period the larger a wsi value the severer the water scarcity conditions are we adopted the state of art monthly assessments of water scarcity in this study which was recommended for sdgs targets vanham et al 2018 thus wsi was calculated at half degree spatial resolution and monthly time scale to better capture the changing pattern of global water scarcity 2 ws i i m w w i m w a i m where ws i i m represented the water scarcity condition for grid cell i in the month m w w i m was the total water withdrawal simulated from huang et al 2018 for grid cell i in the month m m3 month 1 and w a i m was the water availability for grid cell i in the month m m3 month 1 which was the monthly streamflow simulation under varsoc experiment details in section 2 1 grid cells with tiny average water withdrawal 1 000 m3 per day were neglected for excluding the unpopulated dry regions greve et al 2018 in this study we didn t take account of the environmental flow requirements efr but used the conventional wsi threshold of 0 4 to define the severe water scarcity which assumed that 60 of local streamflow would be used for environment similar to that in previous studies schewe et al 2014 liu et al 2019b the population in a grid cell with monthly wsi 0 4 would be considered as population exposure to severe water scarcity the global population density map obtained from gridded population of the world gpw for the year 2010 in socioeconomic data and application center sedac https sedac ciesin columbia edu data collection gpw v4 was applied for assessing the proportion of population exposed to water scarcity at both global and regional scales to assess the changing pattern of global water scarcity condition the study period 1971 2010 was split into two sub periods i e 1971 1990 and 1991 2010 and we compared the long term average wsi for these two periods at grid scales as well as the average population exposed to water scarcity during these two sub periods at global and regional scales 2 4 water scarcity attribution analysis to assess the relative contribution of changes in water withdrawal and water availability on the changing pattern global water scarcity three experiments were designed as shown in table 1 the first experiment ex1 which used time varying water withdrawal and water availability simulations estimated changes in global water scarcity condition during the period 1971 2010 the second and third experiment ex2 and ex3 were two sensitivity experiments which were designed to assess the relative contribution of changes in water withdrawal and water availability on global water scarcity assessment respectively water availability in ex2 was kept constant i e monthly average values for the period 1971 1975 during 1971 2010 but water withdrawal would change while water withdrawal in ex3 would keep constant and water availability was time varying when compared population exposed to water scarcity among these three different experiments the relative contributions of changes in water withdrawal and water availability to changes in water scarcity were assessed both at global and regional scales to further separate the contribution of changes in sectoral water withdrawal to water scarcity changes another three sensitive experiments were designed i e exs1 exs2 and exs3 details in table s3 sectoral water withdrawal in these three experiments i e agricultural industrial and domestic water withdrawal in exs1 exs2 and exs3 respectively was kept constant as the average values of the period 1971 1975 while water availability and water withdrawal for the remaining sectors changed during the study period then when compared global and regional water scarcity of these three experiments with ex1 the relative contributions of changes in sectoral water withdrawal to changes in water scarcity were assessed to further identify the dominant factor i e changes in water withdrawal or water availability that affected changing pattern in water scarcity conditions increase or decrease at grid scale we defined nine types of changes in wsi between two sub periods table 2 the relative change of long term average monthly water scarcity condition wsi water withdrawal ww and water availability wa between these two sub periods were first calculated then based on the changing pattern of wsi i e wsi 5 or wsi 5 we compared both changing pattern and the relative change magnitudes of water withdrawal ww and water availability wa and further detected the dominant role that affected changes in wsi as show in table 2 types 1 4 represented increased wsi where increased water withdrawal and decreased water availability dominated their changing pattern for types 1 2 and types 3 4 respectively types 5 8 represented decreased wsi while types 5 and 6 indicate that increased water availability dominates the mitigation of water scarcity and types 7 and 8 indicate that water scarcity alleviation were dominated by decreased water withdrawal in addition the grid cells would be classified into type 9 when water scarcity didn t show any significant changing pattern the magnitude of wsi 5 thus the dominant factor i e water withdrawal or water availability that affected water scarcity changing pattern i e increase or decrease was identified at half degree resolution 2 5 water availability changes and attribution based on water availability simulation from isimp2a under nosoc and varsoc experiments the contribution of human activity and climate change to water availability changes between the two sub periods was also examined following liu et al 2019a the difference of long term average water availability between the two periods in the varsoc experiment was defined as the total average water availability changes i e waa caused by both climate change and human activities which was calculated as the percentage of the average water availability of the first sub period 1971 1990 δ w a a w a ν p 2 w a ν p 1 w a ν p 1 100 where δ w a a was the total average water availability changes caused by both climate change and human activity between two sub periods w a v p 1 and w a v p 2 were long term average water availability under varsoc experiment in p1 1971 1990 and p2 1991 2010 respectively the difference between the two sub periods in the nosoc experiment was defined as average water availability change induced by only climate change which also expressed as the percentage of the average water availability of the first sub period p1 4 δ w a c w a n p 2 w a n p 1 w a v p 1 100 where w a n p 1 and w a n p 2 were long term average water availability under nosoc experiment in p1 and p2 respectively thus changes in average water availability between two sub periods induced by human activity only δ w a h was calculated as the difference between δ w a a and δ w a c 5 δ w a h δ w a a δ w a c in general δ w a a δ w a c and δ w a h are relative changes with respect to long term average water availability under varsoc experiment in p1 w a v p 1 in this paper 2 6 multi model ensemble in this study because there were 15 combinations of water availability simulations five ghms and three meteorological forcing datasets this study conducted 15 runs of global water scarcity assessments finally we used the ensemble medians across them and the interquartile range i e the range between 25th and 75th percentiles was calculated to present the spread across multi model ensembles 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal changing patterns of global water scarcity conditions during 1971 2010 the simulated long term average monthly wsi during 1971 2010 varied significantly across global areas fig 2 a in general water scarcity hotspots were mainly concentrated either in arid and semi arid areas with very low water availability such as the western usa mexico the western coast of south america the sub saharan africa pakistan middle east and central asia or areas where local available freshwater resources couldn t fully meet large human water demand as a result of high population density or irrigated agriculture including high plains in the usa india and northern china the spatial distribution of long term average wsi for 12 months agreed with long term average wsi with water scarcity mainly occurred in hotspots as represented above fig s2 however wsi showed significant seasonal variation for example wsi was lower in july to september when compared with that in other month in india and wsi was high in april to june in northern china due to limited precipitation and large irrigation water withdrawal while western us suffered water scarcity mainly in june to september seasonal variation of water scarcity condition was determined not only by water availability which mainly affected by climate conditions but also by the seasonal variation of human water withdrawal mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 when considering the changing pattern of long term average wsi between two sub periods long term average wsi in 1991 2010 increased a lot relative to that in 1971 1990 in most of global regions fig 2 b among them wsi in some water scare hotspots showed significant increasing pattern 40 between two sub periods such as mexico south america the sub saharan africa middle east india central asia and northern china however the water scarcity conditions significantly alleviated over some developed countries e g usa japan and some european countries e g sweden germany and poland as wsi decreased by 20 between the two sub periods furthermore the spatial pattern of changes in long term monthly average of wsi for 12 months between two sub periods mostly agreed with that for changes in long term average wsi fig 3 however the magnitude of changes in long term monthly average wsi varied across different months for example the magnitude of intensification of wsi in india for june to august was larger than that of other months wsi in part of the southern china showed moderate decreasing trend in june to august but significantly increased in other months in terms of population exposed to water scarcity fig 4 a about 32 33 of global population was exposed to water scarcity during 1971 1990 and the proportion global population exposed to water scarcity increased to 36 78 during 1991 2010 as shown in table s4 regions with high proportion of total population under water scarcity 40 during 1991 2010 were mostly found in middle east 60 7 northern africa 45 1 north america 40 6 southern asia 47 3 and central asia 41 6 in terms of the seasonal variation of global water scarcity fig s3 with the average of 41 2 global population was exposed to water scarcity in december to may during 1991 2010 which was higher than that for june to november i e 35 0 in general the severest global water scarcity occurred in january 42 9 and the slightest one was found in august 33 2 when compared the long term average population exposed to water scarcity between two sub periods fig 5 a significant increase of the proportion of population under water scarcity were mostly found in oceania by 7 29 middle east by 8 9 southeastern asia by 6 2 southern asia by 5 6 and south america by 5 2 furthermore water scarcity was relieved in some developed areas and population under water scarcity showed slight decreasing pattern proportion of population exposed to water scarcity in eastern europe western europe central europe and north america decreased by 2 19 1 02 0 92 and 0 33 respectively as for the monthly variation fig 4 b proportion of global population exposed to water scarcity between two period increased with the magnitude ranging from 2 95 in june to 5 85 in november 3 2 relative contribution of changes in water withdrawal and water availability to the change in water scarcity the increase of global population exposed to water scarcity can be attributed to changes in water withdrawal and water availability as shown in fig 4 the changes in water withdrawal resulted in an increase of 3 92 global population exposure rising from 27 36 during 1971 1990 to 31 4 during 1991 2010 under ex2 changes in water withdrawal dominated the changing pattern of global population under water scarcity when compared with the effects of changes in water availability which led to an increase of 0 56 global population under water scarcity i e 30 79 during 1971 1990 to 31 35 during 1991 2010 under ex3 at regional scale shown in fig 5b in areas like eastern africa northern africa southern africa south america eastern asia southern asia and middle east both changes in water withdrawal and water availability aggravated water scarcity conditions and the effects of water withdrawal were larger than water availability at regional scale in spite of mild mitigation by change in water availability water scarcity conditions still intensified due to large effects from increased water withdrawal in regions like central america western africa central asia and southeastern asia in contrast both changes in water withdrawal and water availability mitigated water scarcity in central europe eastern europe western europe and north america in oceania the contribution of change in water availability lead to 5 04 of more population exposed to water scarcity which was the twice than the contribution of increased water withdrawal as for the seasonal variation of water scarcity change between two sub periods among three experiments fig 4 b global population exposed to water scarcity between two sub periods increased in all months under both ex1 and ex2 and the magnitude of these changes were close in ex3 population exposed to water scarcity increased mildly in march to december i e ranging from 0 15 to 1 89 and even decreased slightly in january and february in general the effects of changes in water availability on changes in global water scarcity was lower than that of water demand and changes in water demand dominant the changes of global water scarcity fig 5 c further differentiated the effects of water withdrawal on regional water scarcity change by sectors i e agricultural industrial and domestic at global scale agricultural industrial and domestic water withdrawals increased between two sub periods and resulted in intensified water scarcity despite that expanding agricultural water withdrawal contributed to 72 8 of increase in global total water withdrawal by 23 0 agricultural sector accounted for about 38 16 of the increase in global population exposed to water scarcity which was close to that of domestic sectors about 38 14 and followed by industrial 23 7 however the contribution of changes in sectoral water withdrawal on water scarcity varied across regions in most of regions changes in water withdrawal by three sectors lead to increase in regional population exposed to water scarcity and the effects of increasing agricultural water withdrawal were larger than domestic and industrial sectors in regions like eastern africa northern africa southern asia southeastern asia and middle east in regions like oceania central america south america and central asia increasing domestic water withdrawal dominated the changing trend of regional water scarcity than agricultural and industrial sectors furthermore in regions like north america central europe western europe and eastern europe decrease in industrial water withdrawal made the largest contribution to water scarcity mitigation than other sectors in addition population exposed to water scarcity increased by 4 48 between two sub periods in the eastern asia due to increased water withdrawal which was mainly attributed to large increase in domestic and industrial water withdrawal in spite of decreasing agricultural water withdrawal table s5 3 3 the key driver of changes in water scarcity at grid scale fig 6 further illustrated the changing mechanisms behind the changes in long term average wsi between two sub periods at grid scale wsi increased in areas with about 36 4 of global population along with growing water withdrawal and decreasing water availability table 3 and the effect of increased water withdrawal was larger than that of decreased water availability type 1 in fig 6 for example fig 7 showed that human water withdrawal during 1991 2010 increased by 40 relative to that in 1971 1990 in the northern india and water availability reduced by 15 leading to large magnitude of the increase for water scarcity i e wsi increased by above 80 similar situations were also found in northern and central china middle east eastern and southern africa and mexico in areas like the southeastern china southeast asia southern india eastern coast of south america south korea and central africa despite that long term average water availability increased growing human water withdrawal greatly aggravated water scarcity conditions and this resulted in heightened water scarcity condition for about 21 0 of global population in general the increase in water withdrawal was the key driver of the intensified water scarcity for areas with 57 5 of global population table 3 as shown in fig 7 large increase of water withdrawal mainly concentrated in developing areas such as northern india 40 eastern and northern china 40 southeast asia 80 africa 80 and middle east 80 as a result of the increasing population urbanization the growing living standard the significant increase of regional human water withdrawal between two sub periods was attributed to the increase in agricultural water withdrawal which accounted for the largest part of the increase of regional total water withdrawal almost 50 except for eastern asia where total water withdrawal increased by 17 during two sub periods in spite of significant decrease in agricultural water withdrawal and increase in industrial water withdrawal was the main reason for the increase of total water withdrawal table s5 as agricultural water withdrawal was affected by both climate change and socioeconomic development we also investigated that expansion in irrigated cropland was the dominant factor driving increasing agricultural water withdrawal than climate change in most of global regions fig s4 high magnitude in the relative change of irrigation water withdrawal between two sub periods induced by changes in cropland area could be found in the middle east 38 0 southeastern asia 40 6 and western africa 41 5 and this human induced water withdrawal growth greatly exacerbated regional water scarcity conditions fig s5 due to significant decrease in water availability wsi for some areas also increased regardless of the changing pattern of water withdrawal leading to wsi increased in areas with about 3 2 of global population type 3 and type 4 in fig 6 for example water withdrawal didn t show any significant changing pattern 15 but long term average water availability decreased significantly above 20 between two sub periods in the eastern australia some area of northern and central china eastern pakistan and some areas of western usa we further separated the relative contribution of climate change and direct human activities to the changes in long terms average water availability between two sub periods fig 8 despite that climate change effects dominated the changing patterns of water availability during 1971 2010 water availability changes induced by changes in human activities were generally negative in most areas which agreed with previous studies ficklin et al 2018 liu et al 2019a in areas classified into type 3 and type 4 in fig 6 both climate change and direct human activities lead to significant decrease in long term average water availability and the magnitude of climate change effects was large than that of direct human activities such as the eastern australia some area of northern and central china eastern pakistan and some parts of western usa this climate change induced reduction in water availability can also attribute to the frequently occurred drought events for example in the past decades the central china showed a significant drying trend wang et al 2017 and the decrease in precipitation also lead to the significant drying trend in the western part of north china plain xu et al 2015 leading to significant decrease in water availability similarly drought events also intensified by climate variability in some area in eastern australia and western us cook et al 2004 deo et al 2009 ficklin et al 2015 which greatly increased water scarcity condition furthermore decreased water withdrawal played the leading role in water scarcity mitigation in some developed areas e g usa europe and japan where total water withdrawal decreased by about 20 between two sub periods and the decrease of total water withdrawal in these developed areas mainly caused by large decrease in industrial water withdrawal table s5 for example because of the low growth rate of population and the improvement of water use efficiency and cooling technologies for thermal power generation and water management strategies e g water price and water meters total water withdrawal decreased by 3 4 in central europe by 22 7 eastern europe and by 5 5 in western europe in spite of slight increase in domestic water withdrawal and irrigation water withdrawal caused by climate variability reduction in irrigated cropland and improvement in industrial water saving techniques lead to large decrease in irrigation and industrial water withdrawal and further mitigated their water scarcity conditions table s5 in general decreased water withdrawal resulted in about 7 6 of global population facing alleviated water scarcity table 3 increased water availability also relieved wsi for some areas in the north central usa europe and japan in these areas the magnitude of changes in water withdrawal was not significant but long term average water availability increased 20 between two sub periods fig 6 leading to the result that about 1 2 of global population was exposed to mitigated water scarcity in addition in some areas of northern china western usa and eastern europe long term average water withdrawal and water availability almost showed the same changing patterns that were also at the close magnitude so the long term average wsi didn t show significant changing trend type 9 in fig 6 for example both water withdrawal and water availability increased by about 15 between two sub periods in the huai river basin in china and changes in wsi there was not significant long term average wsi didn t show significant changing pattern between two sub periods in areas with about 28 5 of global population table 4 in general changes in water withdrawal was the dominant factor affecting evolution of long term average water scarcity in areas with total 65 1 of global population where 57 5 and 7 6 of global population experienced aggravated and alleviated wsi respectively the effect of water availability change was larger than water withdrawal on water scarcity in areas with 4 8 of global populations 3 4 drivers of changes in long term average monthly water scarcity this study further identified the dominant driver of changes in long term monthly average water scarcity for different month fig 9 increasing water withdrawal lead to the changing pattern of wsi in most of global areas across all the 12 months and wsi increased in areas with 63 1 of global population among 12 months with the largest value 68 1 in november and smallest value 56 3 in august decreased water withdrawal also lead to mitigation of monthly water scarcity in some developed areas such as the usa europe and japan which was similar to results from long term average wsi as shown in section 3 3 and fig 3 however the dominant driver i e water withdrawal or water availability of changes in long term average monthly water scarcity showed clear seasonal variation in some areas which was mainly attributed to the changing pattern of water availability varied across seasons for example in some area of northern china increased water withdrawal was the key factor of intensified water scarcity in low flow seasons i e october to april but decrease in water availability dominated this pattern during may to september due to frequently occurred drought events in wet seasons wang et al 2017 for northern australia despite long term average wsi didn t show any significant changes increased water availability during january to march led to the great mitigation of water scarcity in these months as for eastern australia decrease in water availability dominated the increased wsi during april to august but the effects of changes in water availability was not significant in other months 4 discussions 4 1 comparison to previous studies the spatial distribution of water scarcity conditions simulated in this study agreed with those in previous studies with water scarcity hotspots concentrated in either arid and semi arid regions or areas with large water demand hanasaki et al 2008b kummu et al 2010 wada et al 2011 veldkamp et al 2017 in terms of long term average population exposed water scarcity the proportion of global population living under water scarcity areas wsi 0 4 was estimated as 36 04 which was close to simulation in veldkamp et al 2017 in which an average of 37 6 global population was exposed to water scarcity during 1971 2010 even though these simulations were all conducted at global degree resolution and monthly time step the simulated population exposed to water scarcity in this study was slightly lower than that in wada et al 2011 and mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 which could be attributed to the difference in water withdrawal and water availability datasets furthermore global population exposed to water scarcity simulated in this study was distinctly larger than previous water scarcity assessments at annual scale e g vörösmarty et al 2000 hanasaki et al 2008b and veldkamp et al 2015 and the state of art monthly assessment could lead to more reasonable results in terms of the changing pattern of global water scarcity this study conducted a comparison of changes in long term average wsi between the estimation using the reconstructed water withdrawal data and the estimation using water withdrawal simulation by ghms in isimip2a where these two simulations used the same water availability data but applied different water withdrawal dataset figure s6 from the comparison wsi under both simulations showed significant increasing trends in most of global regions e g mexico south america the sub saharan africa middle east india central asia and northern china which agreed with previous results wada et al 2011 kummu et al 2016 but the magnitudes of changes in wsi by the reconstructed water withdrawal data were larger than that by water withdrawal simulation from ghms in the south america the sub saharan africa and middle east indicating that water withdrawal simulated in huang et al 2018 showed larger increasing patterns than these of ghms in isimip2a furthermore water scarcity in some developed regions e g usa europe and japan mitigated when using the reconstructed water withdrawal data from huang et al 2018 fao 2018 reported that water scarcity decreased in 44 countries and about half of them are from europe doeffinger and hall 2020 also found that 29 countries showed a significant negative trend in water scarcity with half of them from western and eastern europe and 19 of these countries were categorized as high or upper middle income countries this study presented the areas suffering decreased water scarcity at half degree resolution and monthly time scale and the results also consistent with that from fao 2018 and doeffinger and hall 2020 however wsi in these developed regions still showed increasing pattern when using water withdrawal simulation by ghms and ghms couldn t detect mitigation of water scarcity in these developed regions recognizing regions not only with significant increasing trend in water scarcity but also with water scarcity alleviation e g in some developed countries was very crucial to developing countries for water management and policymaking thus the use of reconstructed water withdrawal dataset has brought new insight into the changing pattern of global historical water scarcity as for the driving factors of changes in water scarcity wada et al 2011 reported that increasing water withdrawal was the leading factor for intensifying water scarcity at global scale especially in mexico india northern china and southern europe but except for the sahel where decreased water availability had larger impacts the results from wada et al 2011 agreed with this study and this study further separated the contribution of water withdrawal by different sectors on regional water scarcity evolution despite that human water withdrawal was the dominant reason for heightened water scarcity in most of global areas accounting for 57 5 of global population this study also found that decreased in water availability also had great effects on increased water scarcity such as in some areas of western usa eastern australia and northeastern china as large scale hydrological models often used macroscale socioeconomic data e g gross domestic production and population to simulate sectoral water withdrawal and they assumed simple changes of technological factors without consideration of the effect of water conservancy measures leading to biased water withdrawal simulation zhou et al 2020 by using a newly water withdrawal dataset based on reported water withdrawal and ghms simulation this study also explained the reason to decreasing trend of water scarcity occurring in some developed areas where deceased water withdrawal or increased water availability mitigated water scarcity condition which was often missed in previous studies e g kummu et al 2010 wada et al 2011 veldkamp et al 2015 the finding of mitigation water scarcity driven by decreased water withdrawal could also guide future water scarcity projections cui et al 2018 graham et al 2020 in addition this study further separated the effects of water withdrawal and water availability on changes in water scarcity at both global and regional scales and further revealed the mechanism behind the evolution of water scarcity which was important for water managements and policymaking 4 2 limitations and implications the major uncertainty in this quantitative assessment of global water scarcity usually originates from three aspects i e water withdrawal water availability and methodology in water scarcity assessment global historical gridded water withdrawal dataset was generated by downscaling country scale estimates of sectoral water withdrawal from reported data using various models and new modeling approaches huang et al 2018 the uncertainties of this global water withdrawal dataset were mainly from two parts i e original reported data and downscaling methodologies for example water withdrawal estimates from fao were mainly from national surveys and assessments e g national yearbook statistics and reports and also could provide reasonable changing trend of sectoral water withdrawal liu et al 2016 however the downscaling algorithms would lead to uncertainties in the spatial and temporal changing pattern of water withdrawal dataset for example this reconstructed water withdrawal dataset used reported data to correct irrigation water withdrawal simulation from ghms which used a time varying irrigated map i e hyde3 mirca2000 however as irrigated agriculture plays an importance role in climate change adaptation to meet growing demand for agricultural products rosa et al 2018 wada et al 2013 accurate estimation of irrigation water withdrawal needs to take the changes of irrigated and rainfed cropland area constraints of local available freshwater and land resources into consideration rosa et al 2020b in addition this study only used the water withdrawal to compute water scarcity however water scarcity assessed with gross water withdrawal generally overestimates actual biophysical water scarcity condition munia et al 2016 both water withdrawal and water consumption are suggested to estimate water scarcity which would provide more important information to understand the evolution of water scarcity vanham et al 2018 the uncertainties in water availability i e streamflow simulations would spread to the water scarcity assessments which mainly resulted from the uncertainties in the climate forcing datasets müller schmied et al 2014 and parameterizations among ghms zhao et al 2017 meanwhile the different human impact parameterizations in ghms also lead to different water availability simulation e g water withdrawal requirement and withdrawal sources liu et al 2017b masaki et al 2017 veldkamp et al 2018 in addition a few limitations in the methods of water scarcity assessment may also introduce uncertainties first efr was assumed 60 of total surface water availability in this study but more spatial and temporal explicit details of environmental flow requirement should be considered because of various hydrological regimes and ecosystems across global regions pastor et al 2014 veldkamp et al 2017 furthermore upstream human water abstraction would often affect water quality and available water resources in the downstream areas might be reduced due to pollution in the upstream areas neglecting water quality may result in underestimation of downstream water scarcity ma et al 2020 in addition the absence of water transfer projects will lead to overestimation of water scarcity conditions in the target area and will underestimate water scarcity in the source areas yin et al 2020 moreover non renewable water resources e g fossil groundwater which was an important available water resources particularly in arid regions was ignored in water scarcity assessment leading to overestimation of actual water scarcity conditions there wada et al 2011 despite the uncertainties and limitations discussed above this findings in this study would be helpful to better understanding of water scarcity and water resources management as represented in the results some developed countries have showed significant mitigation in water scarcity which was mainly attributed to decrease in water withdrawal with the water saving technology improvement and the considerable increase in water productivity zhou et al 2020 doeffinger and hall 2020 vanham and mekonnen 2021 human water withdrawal would decelerate or even shows decreasing trend thus water scarcity would mitigate not only in developed regions but also in some developing countries suffering increasing water scarcity at current stage e g china and some countries in southeast asia graham et al 2020 furthermore future water scarcity would be affected by various factors e g changes in diet springmann et al 2018 population agricultural and energy intensification and climate change beltran peña et al 2020 this study performed an explicit quantitative assessment of historical global water scarcity evolution and its driving factors following the framework and results of this study estimation about water scarcity projection with considering various factors as well as meeting human water demand without depleting the limited regional and global water resources could be conducted in the future works which can well represent water scarcity condition for better allocation water resources huang et al 2021 the effects in changes in water availability on water scarcity were also disclosed in this study as discussed before server drought events greatly reduced the water availability in some areas leading to heightened water scarcity in the future climate change could lead to reduced terrestrial water availability and increasing drought in many global regions especially in southern hemisphere pokhrel et al 2021 where water scarcity was significant intensified during 1971 2010 as assessed in this study thus water resources management should be taken in the future to increase water availability and cope with water scarcity e g inter basin water transfer yin et al 2020 optimal allocation of both renewable and non renewable water resources dalcin and fernandes marques 2020 and virtual water trade zhao et al 2015 5 conclusions this study performed an explicit quantitative assessment of the relative contributions of changes in water withdrawal and water availability on the evolution of global water scarcity during 1970 2010 based on reconstructed water withdrawal dataset and water availability simulations by ghms the global water scarcity was assessed at half degree resolution and monthly time scale the effects of climate change and human activities on the changes in water withdrawal and water availability were also separated to reveal the key driving factor of changes in water scarcity results showed that water scarcity conditions aggravated in most areas and wsi increased by 40 in 1991 2010 relative to 1971 1990 in some water scare hotspots e g mexico the sub saharan africa middle east india central asia and the northern china in some developed areas like usa japan and some european countries e g sweden germany and poland water scarcity conditions alleviated we estimated that 32 3 of the global population was exposed to water scarcity conditions for 1971 1990 and this number eventually increased to 36 8 for 1991 2010 with the significant increase mostly occurred in oceania middle east southeastern asia southern asia and north africa furthermore changes in water withdrawal had a considerable impact on evolution of water scarcity in areas with total 65 1 global population where 57 5 and 7 6 of global population experienced aggravated and alleviated wsi respectively here large increase of water withdrawal mainly concentrated in some developing areas such as northern india eastern and northern china southeast asia africa and middle east due to large increase of irrigation water withdrawal while water withdrawal also decreased significantly in some developed regions e g usa japan and some european countries as a result of decrease in industrial water withdrawal on the other hand the effects of water availability change were larger than water withdrawal on water scarcity in areas with 4 8 global populations therein 3 6 and 1 2 of global population experienced aggravated and alleviated water scarcity respectively changes in water availability were dominated by climate change excepted in areas like northern china where changes in human water use significantly affected water availability than climate impacts furthermore besides the assessment of long term average of water scarcity and its attribution we also analyzed the changing pattern of global water scarcity and its key driving factor for different monthly which further helped us understand the evolution of global water scarcity it should be noted that the results in this assessment is subject to uncertainties arising from the uncertainties in water withdrawal and multi model water availability simulations as well as the methodologies in water scarcity assessments and attribution nevertheless it provided quantitative results to better understanding the mechanism behind the changing pattern in water withdrawal water availability and water scarcity from local to global scales which was essential for coping with water scarcity and better management of water resources to sustainable development credit authorship

4321,water scarcity has become a major issue to sustainable development it can be estimated by available fresh water resources and human water withdrawal which are affected by both climate change and human activities however the key drivers for the changes in water scarcity at global scale remain unclear due to large uncertainties in the estimations of the contributions from changes in water withdrawal and water availability by using a newly reconstructed water withdrawal dataset and multi model simulations of water availability this study assessed global water scarcity evolution during 1971 2010 at half degree resolution and monthly time scale by applying the water stress index wsi results showed that wsi increased in areas with 61 1 of global population during 1971 2010 and the increase in water withdrawal especially agricultural sector was the key driving factor for areas with 57 5 of global population specifically growing water withdrawal led to increased water scarcity for areas with 21 of global population in spite of rising water availability resulted from climate change such as in southeastern china southeast asia southern india and central africa in contrast water scarcity mitigated over some developed areas including parts of usa europe and japan with 8 8 of global population which resulted from decreased human water withdrawal especially industrial sector and increased water availability this study reveals the synergistic or contrary effects of changes in water withdrawal and water availability on the changes in water scarcity over the globe and provides useful information for regional water planning and management keywords water scarcity water withdrawal water availability water stress index 1 introduction water resources is essential to human life socioeconomic development and ecosystem health during the past several decades human water withdrawal increased a lot due to rapid growth of population and increasing living standard shiklomanov 2000 döll et al 2009 wada and bierkens 2014 huang et al 2018 as water demand approaches or even exceeds the total renewable freshwater resources water scarcity has become one of the major risks to sustainable development in many areas of the world kummu et al 2016 water scarcity is not only affected by hydroclimate conditions which result in the amount of freshwater availability but also human water demand as well as socioeconomic factors and governmental policies dell angelo et al 2018 thus water scarcity could be considered from both physical and economic perspectives rosa et al 2020a physical water scarcity can be divided into green water scarcity and blue water scarcity where green water scarcity indicates the root zone soil moisture is insufficient to sustain crop production and blue water scarcity refers to the freshwater availability in surface and groundwater bodies can t meet human water withdrawal liu et al 2017a while economic water scarcity is defined as the condition where renewable freshwater resources are physically available but lack of socioeconomic and institutional capacity that limits societal ability to use that water rosa et al 2020a in this study we mainly focused on blue water scarcity as water scarcity would threat food security human health socioeconomic development as well as ecosystem services cheng et al 2009 rodell et al 2009 taylor et al 2013 yin et al 2017 understanding the spatial and temporal changing patterns of water scarcity and its driving factors at global scale is very important for sustainable use of water resources current water scarcity assessments were mostly based on simulations from global hydrological models ghms which considered the impacts of both climate change and human activities hanasaki et al 2013 hejazi et al 2015 wada et al 2016 flörke et al 2018 water stress index wsi which was defined as the ratio of water demand to water availability was often used to assess water scarcity conditions vörösmarty et al 2000 oki and kanae 2006 veldkamp et al 2017 water demand was often estimated as the sum of water withdrawal consumption from multiple water use sectors and water availability was calculated by river discharge vörösmarty et al 2005 hanasaki et al 2013 veldkamp et al 2017 therein model based water withdrawal simulations were often based on macroscale socioeconomic activity data and assumed simple changes in technological factors and water conservancy measures which might lead to biased trends in water withdrawal as well as uncertainties in water scarcity assessment zhou et al 2020 recent reconstructed water withdrawal data consisted of both water withdrawal estimations from ghms and historical water withdrawal records from surveys and statistical data and the spatial and temporal downscaling algorithms were applied to generate monthly gridded sectoral water withdrawal products huang et al 2018 despite that the downscaling algorithms may lead to uncertainties in sectoral water withdrawal estimation the application of reported water withdrawal data at country level in the reconstructed water withdrawal dataset could provide more reliable changing trend of water withdrawal against commonly used model simulation huang et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 thus the use of this reconstructed water withdrawal dataset could bring new insight into the changing pattern of historical global water scarcity a wealth of studies have assessed the spatial and temporal patterns of global water scarcity over the past decades and results agreed that global water scarcity had increased significantly along with warming climate and human activities but the magnitude of increasing trends varied across regions kummu et al 2010 furthermore previous studies have analyzed the impacts of hydro climate variability and climate change on water scarcity such as the influences from trends in climate factors le blanc and perez 2008 wada and bierkens 2014 gosling and arnell 2016 el niño southern oscillation enso and inter annual variability veldkamp et al 2015 on the other hand human activities including population growth increasing food demand reservoir regulation human induced land use change and human water use would also greatly affect evolution of water scarcity conditions liu et al 2017a schewe et al 2014 it has been found that growth in population and gross domestic product gdp increased the water scarcity mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 fant et al 2016 human interventions e g land use and land cover change reservoir regulation and human water use lead to water scarcity hotspots travelling to downstream areas veldkamp et al 2017 however previous studies regarding the driving factors of the changes in water scarcity mostly focused on a single factor water scarcity is determined by the availability of freshwater resources and the level of water withdrawal changes in water withdrawal varied across regions due to differences in socioeconomic development stage population growth rate and water saving techniques while water availability also showed different changing patterns under climate change therefore an explicit assessment of the relative contribution of changes in water withdrawal and water availability to water scarcity evolution at global regional and local scales is necessary moreover previous studies mostly focused on intensification of water scarcity and its driving factors for example wada et al 2011 reported that increased water withdrawal was the decisive factor for heightened water stress throughout the globe however the recent report from united nation un on sustainable development goals sdg 6 4 2 found that water scarcity increased for most countries but decreased for 44 countries where half of them were located in europe fao 2018 the dominant factor that driving the decreased water scarcity in these regions was still unknown since water withdrawal and water availability showed different changing patterns across global areas identifying the dominant drivers changes in water withdrawal or water availability that affected water scarcity changing pattern i e increase or decrease is of great significance for explaining the mechanisms behind the changes in water scarcity to address the above issues this study presented an explicit assessment of global water scarcity evolution that accounted for changes in water withdrawal and water availability during past decades based on a newly reconstructed water withdrawal dataset and multi model simulations of water availability the aims of this study were to assess the hotspots areas with significant change of water scarcity and further quantify the contribution of changes in sectoral water withdrawal and water availability to the changes in water scarcity thus finally identify the dominant factors that drive the changes in water scarcity at global regional and local scales to explain the mechanisms behind the changing patterns in water scarcity 2 data and methods in this study we obtained monthly water availability simulation from the inter sectoral impact model inter comparison project phase 2a isimip 2a which was generated by five ghms together with monthly water withdrawal dataset from huang et al 2018 global water scarcity assessment was performed by using the commonly used evaluation index i e wsi at half degree resolution and monthly time scale then another two experiments were designed to estimate the relative contribution of changes in water withdrawal and water availability to changes in global and regional water scarcity furthermore this study also separated the effects of sectoral water withdrawal i e agricultural industrial and domestic on regional water scarcity conditions we also defined nine types of changing mechanisms in wsi to further identify the dominant factors driving wsi change at grid scale an overview of the steps taken in the methodology was shown in fig 1 and table s1 data and methods were described in detail by the following subsections 2 1 hydrological simulation from isimip2a in this study hydrological simulation during the period 1971 2010 was obtained from the isimip2a https www isimip org protocol isimip2a gosling et al 2017 which was performed by five ghms namely dbh tang et al 2007 huang et al 2019 h08 hanasaki et al 2008a b lpjml biemans et al 2011 bondeau et al 2007 rost et al 2008 pcr globwb van beek et al 2011 wada et al 2011 and watergap2 flörke et al 2013 müller schmied et al 2014 müller schmied et al 2016 following the isimip2a simulation protocol these ghms were simulated at global half degree spatial resolution for the period 1971 2010 forced by three different global observations based historical meteorological forcing datasets i e the princeton sheffield et al 2006 gswp3 http hydro iis u tokyo ac jp gswp3 and wfdei weedon et al 2014 all ghms run with the same river routing map to generate streamflow within river basins ddm30 döll and lehner 2002 furthermore each ghm conducted two simulations with varsoc and without nosoc human impacts therein simulations in the varsoc experiment considered the impacts of both climate change and direct human activities i e human water use reservoir regulation and land use changes while hydrological simulation under nosoc only considered climate change impacts in terms of the parameterizations of direct human activities all these ghms used macroscale socioeconomic and hydro climatological datasets and parameters to estimate sectoral water use sources of water withdrawal defined in dbh h08 and lpjml were water resources in rivers and reservoirs while these for pcr globwb and watergap2 were both surface water and groundwater in terms of the return flow all these ghms used similar scheme for return flow of industrial returning to surface water and domestic returning to surface water water use but return flow from irrigation water use was different among ghms dbh and h08 defined that exceeded irrigation water withdrawal returned to the soil by means of infiltration while pcr globwb assumed that extra irrigation water withdrawal flowed back to soil via infiltration and groundwater via additional recharge lpjml and watergap2 returned directly to rivers and groundwater respectively and time varying land use and land cover change lulcc was also represented under varsoc runs therein present day year 2000 rainfed and irrigated areas from mirca2000 portmann et al 2010 cropland and pasture extents from ramankutty et al 2008 and trends of agricultural land from hyde3 were combined following fader et al 2010 to create a time varying dataset with information on lulcc as well as the extent of irrigated areas the reservoir information was derived from the global reservoir and dam grand database lehner et al 2011 and the operation schemes of hanasaki et al 2006 biemans et al 2011 and haddeland et al 2006 formed the basis of the reservoir operation schemes in these ghms due to differences not only in generation of local runoff and discharge but also in the parameterization of direct human activities modules and water withdrawal allocation methods hydrological simulations varied across ghms and we refer to liu et al 2017b masaki et al 2017 and veldkamp et al 2018 for a comprehensive overview of inter comparison of hydrological simulation by ghms a detailed representation of simulation by ghms runs were represented in table s2 monthly water flux i e streamflow surface runoff and baseflow simulated under varsoc experiments by ghms was treated as water availability for global water scarcity assessment water availability in this study refers to the monthly availability of renewable water resources in rivers which consists of the locally generated runoff in each grid cell and the incoming discharge from upstream cells being subtracted by the upstream water consumption 1 w a i m r i m q i m w c m where w a i m was the total water availability for grid cell i in the month m m3 month 1 r i m was the local runoff generated in grid cell i and month m m3 month 1 q i m was the upstream discharge flowing into cell i from all upstream grid cells in month m m3 month 1 and wcm was the upstream water consumption in month m m3 month 1 in addition ghms estimated water consumption based on water withdrawal simulation and water allocation rules and the parameterization schemes were different among ghms see table s2 thus monthly water availability was calculated by ghms with the consideration of upstream water consumption additionally the amount of water storage in the lakes aquifers and groundwater was assumed to be in equilibrium where the absolute values were unknown and also hard to estimate thus non renewable water resources e g fossil groundwater were not taken into consideration 2 2 reconstructed monthly gridded water withdrawal data global monthly gridded sectoral water withdrawal dataset which was used for global water scarcity assessment was obtained from huang et al 2018 where various sources of reported and estimated water withdrawal datasets were collected and consolidated and were reconstructed to finer resolutions this reconstructed water withdrawal dataset included water withdrawal for agricultural irrigation and livestock industrial electricity generation mining and manufacturing and domestic sectors for the period 1971 2010 at half degree resolution and monthly time scale therein irrigation water withdrawal data was reconstructed by correcting isimip2a simulation under varsoc section 2 1 using reported irrigation water withdrawal at the national level industrial and domestic water withdrawal were obtained by downscaling various sources of reported water withdrawal datasets from national regional scale to gridded and monthly scales by spatial and temporal statistical downscaling algorithms and the downscaling algorithms were also similar to the parameterization used in ghms e g h08 pcr globwb and watergap hanasaki et al 2008a wada et al 2011 flörke et al 2013 the schematic representation about the water withdrawal datasets and water availability simulation see section 2 1 was shown in fig s1 2 3 water scarcity assessment wsi defined as the ratio of water withdrawal to water availability was used to quantify water scarcity condition in this study this indicator can well represent the imbalance between water availability and total water demand for humans for a specific region over a specific time period the larger a wsi value the severer the water scarcity conditions are we adopted the state of art monthly assessments of water scarcity in this study which was recommended for sdgs targets vanham et al 2018 thus wsi was calculated at half degree spatial resolution and monthly time scale to better capture the changing pattern of global water scarcity 2 ws i i m w w i m w a i m where ws i i m represented the water scarcity condition for grid cell i in the month m w w i m was the total water withdrawal simulated from huang et al 2018 for grid cell i in the month m m3 month 1 and w a i m was the water availability for grid cell i in the month m m3 month 1 which was the monthly streamflow simulation under varsoc experiment details in section 2 1 grid cells with tiny average water withdrawal 1 000 m3 per day were neglected for excluding the unpopulated dry regions greve et al 2018 in this study we didn t take account of the environmental flow requirements efr but used the conventional wsi threshold of 0 4 to define the severe water scarcity which assumed that 60 of local streamflow would be used for environment similar to that in previous studies schewe et al 2014 liu et al 2019b the population in a grid cell with monthly wsi 0 4 would be considered as population exposure to severe water scarcity the global population density map obtained from gridded population of the world gpw for the year 2010 in socioeconomic data and application center sedac https sedac ciesin columbia edu data collection gpw v4 was applied for assessing the proportion of population exposed to water scarcity at both global and regional scales to assess the changing pattern of global water scarcity condition the study period 1971 2010 was split into two sub periods i e 1971 1990 and 1991 2010 and we compared the long term average wsi for these two periods at grid scales as well as the average population exposed to water scarcity during these two sub periods at global and regional scales 2 4 water scarcity attribution analysis to assess the relative contribution of changes in water withdrawal and water availability on the changing pattern global water scarcity three experiments were designed as shown in table 1 the first experiment ex1 which used time varying water withdrawal and water availability simulations estimated changes in global water scarcity condition during the period 1971 2010 the second and third experiment ex2 and ex3 were two sensitivity experiments which were designed to assess the relative contribution of changes in water withdrawal and water availability on global water scarcity assessment respectively water availability in ex2 was kept constant i e monthly average values for the period 1971 1975 during 1971 2010 but water withdrawal would change while water withdrawal in ex3 would keep constant and water availability was time varying when compared population exposed to water scarcity among these three different experiments the relative contributions of changes in water withdrawal and water availability to changes in water scarcity were assessed both at global and regional scales to further separate the contribution of changes in sectoral water withdrawal to water scarcity changes another three sensitive experiments were designed i e exs1 exs2 and exs3 details in table s3 sectoral water withdrawal in these three experiments i e agricultural industrial and domestic water withdrawal in exs1 exs2 and exs3 respectively was kept constant as the average values of the period 1971 1975 while water availability and water withdrawal for the remaining sectors changed during the study period then when compared global and regional water scarcity of these three experiments with ex1 the relative contributions of changes in sectoral water withdrawal to changes in water scarcity were assessed to further identify the dominant factor i e changes in water withdrawal or water availability that affected changing pattern in water scarcity conditions increase or decrease at grid scale we defined nine types of changes in wsi between two sub periods table 2 the relative change of long term average monthly water scarcity condition wsi water withdrawal ww and water availability wa between these two sub periods were first calculated then based on the changing pattern of wsi i e wsi 5 or wsi 5 we compared both changing pattern and the relative change magnitudes of water withdrawal ww and water availability wa and further detected the dominant role that affected changes in wsi as show in table 2 types 1 4 represented increased wsi where increased water withdrawal and decreased water availability dominated their changing pattern for types 1 2 and types 3 4 respectively types 5 8 represented decreased wsi while types 5 and 6 indicate that increased water availability dominates the mitigation of water scarcity and types 7 and 8 indicate that water scarcity alleviation were dominated by decreased water withdrawal in addition the grid cells would be classified into type 9 when water scarcity didn t show any significant changing pattern the magnitude of wsi 5 thus the dominant factor i e water withdrawal or water availability that affected water scarcity changing pattern i e increase or decrease was identified at half degree resolution 2 5 water availability changes and attribution based on water availability simulation from isimp2a under nosoc and varsoc experiments the contribution of human activity and climate change to water availability changes between the two sub periods was also examined following liu et al 2019a the difference of long term average water availability between the two periods in the varsoc experiment was defined as the total average water availability changes i e waa caused by both climate change and human activities which was calculated as the percentage of the average water availability of the first sub period 1971 1990 δ w a a w a ν p 2 w a ν p 1 w a ν p 1 100 where δ w a a was the total average water availability changes caused by both climate change and human activity between two sub periods w a v p 1 and w a v p 2 were long term average water availability under varsoc experiment in p1 1971 1990 and p2 1991 2010 respectively the difference between the two sub periods in the nosoc experiment was defined as average water availability change induced by only climate change which also expressed as the percentage of the average water availability of the first sub period p1 4 δ w a c w a n p 2 w a n p 1 w a v p 1 100 where w a n p 1 and w a n p 2 were long term average water availability under nosoc experiment in p1 and p2 respectively thus changes in average water availability between two sub periods induced by human activity only δ w a h was calculated as the difference between δ w a a and δ w a c 5 δ w a h δ w a a δ w a c in general δ w a a δ w a c and δ w a h are relative changes with respect to long term average water availability under varsoc experiment in p1 w a v p 1 in this paper 2 6 multi model ensemble in this study because there were 15 combinations of water availability simulations five ghms and three meteorological forcing datasets this study conducted 15 runs of global water scarcity assessments finally we used the ensemble medians across them and the interquartile range i e the range between 25th and 75th percentiles was calculated to present the spread across multi model ensembles 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal changing patterns of global water scarcity conditions during 1971 2010 the simulated long term average monthly wsi during 1971 2010 varied significantly across global areas fig 2 a in general water scarcity hotspots were mainly concentrated either in arid and semi arid areas with very low water availability such as the western usa mexico the western coast of south america the sub saharan africa pakistan middle east and central asia or areas where local available freshwater resources couldn t fully meet large human water demand as a result of high population density or irrigated agriculture including high plains in the usa india and northern china the spatial distribution of long term average wsi for 12 months agreed with long term average wsi with water scarcity mainly occurred in hotspots as represented above fig s2 however wsi showed significant seasonal variation for example wsi was lower in july to september when compared with that in other month in india and wsi was high in april to june in northern china due to limited precipitation and large irrigation water withdrawal while western us suffered water scarcity mainly in june to september seasonal variation of water scarcity condition was determined not only by water availability which mainly affected by climate conditions but also by the seasonal variation of human water withdrawal mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 when considering the changing pattern of long term average wsi between two sub periods long term average wsi in 1991 2010 increased a lot relative to that in 1971 1990 in most of global regions fig 2 b among them wsi in some water scare hotspots showed significant increasing pattern 40 between two sub periods such as mexico south america the sub saharan africa middle east india central asia and northern china however the water scarcity conditions significantly alleviated over some developed countries e g usa japan and some european countries e g sweden germany and poland as wsi decreased by 20 between the two sub periods furthermore the spatial pattern of changes in long term monthly average of wsi for 12 months between two sub periods mostly agreed with that for changes in long term average wsi fig 3 however the magnitude of changes in long term monthly average wsi varied across different months for example the magnitude of intensification of wsi in india for june to august was larger than that of other months wsi in part of the southern china showed moderate decreasing trend in june to august but significantly increased in other months in terms of population exposed to water scarcity fig 4 a about 32 33 of global population was exposed to water scarcity during 1971 1990 and the proportion global population exposed to water scarcity increased to 36 78 during 1991 2010 as shown in table s4 regions with high proportion of total population under water scarcity 40 during 1991 2010 were mostly found in middle east 60 7 northern africa 45 1 north america 40 6 southern asia 47 3 and central asia 41 6 in terms of the seasonal variation of global water scarcity fig s3 with the average of 41 2 global population was exposed to water scarcity in december to may during 1991 2010 which was higher than that for june to november i e 35 0 in general the severest global water scarcity occurred in january 42 9 and the slightest one was found in august 33 2 when compared the long term average population exposed to water scarcity between two sub periods fig 5 a significant increase of the proportion of population under water scarcity were mostly found in oceania by 7 29 middle east by 8 9 southeastern asia by 6 2 southern asia by 5 6 and south america by 5 2 furthermore water scarcity was relieved in some developed areas and population under water scarcity showed slight decreasing pattern proportion of population exposed to water scarcity in eastern europe western europe central europe and north america decreased by 2 19 1 02 0 92 and 0 33 respectively as for the monthly variation fig 4 b proportion of global population exposed to water scarcity between two period increased with the magnitude ranging from 2 95 in june to 5 85 in november 3 2 relative contribution of changes in water withdrawal and water availability to the change in water scarcity the increase of global population exposed to water scarcity can be attributed to changes in water withdrawal and water availability as shown in fig 4 the changes in water withdrawal resulted in an increase of 3 92 global population exposure rising from 27 36 during 1971 1990 to 31 4 during 1991 2010 under ex2 changes in water withdrawal dominated the changing pattern of global population under water scarcity when compared with the effects of changes in water availability which led to an increase of 0 56 global population under water scarcity i e 30 79 during 1971 1990 to 31 35 during 1991 2010 under ex3 at regional scale shown in fig 5b in areas like eastern africa northern africa southern africa south america eastern asia southern asia and middle east both changes in water withdrawal and water availability aggravated water scarcity conditions and the effects of water withdrawal were larger than water availability at regional scale in spite of mild mitigation by change in water availability water scarcity conditions still intensified due to large effects from increased water withdrawal in regions like central america western africa central asia and southeastern asia in contrast both changes in water withdrawal and water availability mitigated water scarcity in central europe eastern europe western europe and north america in oceania the contribution of change in water availability lead to 5 04 of more population exposed to water scarcity which was the twice than the contribution of increased water withdrawal as for the seasonal variation of water scarcity change between two sub periods among three experiments fig 4 b global population exposed to water scarcity between two sub periods increased in all months under both ex1 and ex2 and the magnitude of these changes were close in ex3 population exposed to water scarcity increased mildly in march to december i e ranging from 0 15 to 1 89 and even decreased slightly in january and february in general the effects of changes in water availability on changes in global water scarcity was lower than that of water demand and changes in water demand dominant the changes of global water scarcity fig 5 c further differentiated the effects of water withdrawal on regional water scarcity change by sectors i e agricultural industrial and domestic at global scale agricultural industrial and domestic water withdrawals increased between two sub periods and resulted in intensified water scarcity despite that expanding agricultural water withdrawal contributed to 72 8 of increase in global total water withdrawal by 23 0 agricultural sector accounted for about 38 16 of the increase in global population exposed to water scarcity which was close to that of domestic sectors about 38 14 and followed by industrial 23 7 however the contribution of changes in sectoral water withdrawal on water scarcity varied across regions in most of regions changes in water withdrawal by three sectors lead to increase in regional population exposed to water scarcity and the effects of increasing agricultural water withdrawal were larger than domestic and industrial sectors in regions like eastern africa northern africa southern asia southeastern asia and middle east in regions like oceania central america south america and central asia increasing domestic water withdrawal dominated the changing trend of regional water scarcity than agricultural and industrial sectors furthermore in regions like north america central europe western europe and eastern europe decrease in industrial water withdrawal made the largest contribution to water scarcity mitigation than other sectors in addition population exposed to water scarcity increased by 4 48 between two sub periods in the eastern asia due to increased water withdrawal which was mainly attributed to large increase in domestic and industrial water withdrawal in spite of decreasing agricultural water withdrawal table s5 3 3 the key driver of changes in water scarcity at grid scale fig 6 further illustrated the changing mechanisms behind the changes in long term average wsi between two sub periods at grid scale wsi increased in areas with about 36 4 of global population along with growing water withdrawal and decreasing water availability table 3 and the effect of increased water withdrawal was larger than that of decreased water availability type 1 in fig 6 for example fig 7 showed that human water withdrawal during 1991 2010 increased by 40 relative to that in 1971 1990 in the northern india and water availability reduced by 15 leading to large magnitude of the increase for water scarcity i e wsi increased by above 80 similar situations were also found in northern and central china middle east eastern and southern africa and mexico in areas like the southeastern china southeast asia southern india eastern coast of south america south korea and central africa despite that long term average water availability increased growing human water withdrawal greatly aggravated water scarcity conditions and this resulted in heightened water scarcity condition for about 21 0 of global population in general the increase in water withdrawal was the key driver of the intensified water scarcity for areas with 57 5 of global population table 3 as shown in fig 7 large increase of water withdrawal mainly concentrated in developing areas such as northern india 40 eastern and northern china 40 southeast asia 80 africa 80 and middle east 80 as a result of the increasing population urbanization the growing living standard the significant increase of regional human water withdrawal between two sub periods was attributed to the increase in agricultural water withdrawal which accounted for the largest part of the increase of regional total water withdrawal almost 50 except for eastern asia where total water withdrawal increased by 17 during two sub periods in spite of significant decrease in agricultural water withdrawal and increase in industrial water withdrawal was the main reason for the increase of total water withdrawal table s5 as agricultural water withdrawal was affected by both climate change and socioeconomic development we also investigated that expansion in irrigated cropland was the dominant factor driving increasing agricultural water withdrawal than climate change in most of global regions fig s4 high magnitude in the relative change of irrigation water withdrawal between two sub periods induced by changes in cropland area could be found in the middle east 38 0 southeastern asia 40 6 and western africa 41 5 and this human induced water withdrawal growth greatly exacerbated regional water scarcity conditions fig s5 due to significant decrease in water availability wsi for some areas also increased regardless of the changing pattern of water withdrawal leading to wsi increased in areas with about 3 2 of global population type 3 and type 4 in fig 6 for example water withdrawal didn t show any significant changing pattern 15 but long term average water availability decreased significantly above 20 between two sub periods in the eastern australia some area of northern and central china eastern pakistan and some areas of western usa we further separated the relative contribution of climate change and direct human activities to the changes in long terms average water availability between two sub periods fig 8 despite that climate change effects dominated the changing patterns of water availability during 1971 2010 water availability changes induced by changes in human activities were generally negative in most areas which agreed with previous studies ficklin et al 2018 liu et al 2019a in areas classified into type 3 and type 4 in fig 6 both climate change and direct human activities lead to significant decrease in long term average water availability and the magnitude of climate change effects was large than that of direct human activities such as the eastern australia some area of northern and central china eastern pakistan and some parts of western usa this climate change induced reduction in water availability can also attribute to the frequently occurred drought events for example in the past decades the central china showed a significant drying trend wang et al 2017 and the decrease in precipitation also lead to the significant drying trend in the western part of north china plain xu et al 2015 leading to significant decrease in water availability similarly drought events also intensified by climate variability in some area in eastern australia and western us cook et al 2004 deo et al 2009 ficklin et al 2015 which greatly increased water scarcity condition furthermore decreased water withdrawal played the leading role in water scarcity mitigation in some developed areas e g usa europe and japan where total water withdrawal decreased by about 20 between two sub periods and the decrease of total water withdrawal in these developed areas mainly caused by large decrease in industrial water withdrawal table s5 for example because of the low growth rate of population and the improvement of water use efficiency and cooling technologies for thermal power generation and water management strategies e g water price and water meters total water withdrawal decreased by 3 4 in central europe by 22 7 eastern europe and by 5 5 in western europe in spite of slight increase in domestic water withdrawal and irrigation water withdrawal caused by climate variability reduction in irrigated cropland and improvement in industrial water saving techniques lead to large decrease in irrigation and industrial water withdrawal and further mitigated their water scarcity conditions table s5 in general decreased water withdrawal resulted in about 7 6 of global population facing alleviated water scarcity table 3 increased water availability also relieved wsi for some areas in the north central usa europe and japan in these areas the magnitude of changes in water withdrawal was not significant but long term average water availability increased 20 between two sub periods fig 6 leading to the result that about 1 2 of global population was exposed to mitigated water scarcity in addition in some areas of northern china western usa and eastern europe long term average water withdrawal and water availability almost showed the same changing patterns that were also at the close magnitude so the long term average wsi didn t show significant changing trend type 9 in fig 6 for example both water withdrawal and water availability increased by about 15 between two sub periods in the huai river basin in china and changes in wsi there was not significant long term average wsi didn t show significant changing pattern between two sub periods in areas with about 28 5 of global population table 4 in general changes in water withdrawal was the dominant factor affecting evolution of long term average water scarcity in areas with total 65 1 of global population where 57 5 and 7 6 of global population experienced aggravated and alleviated wsi respectively the effect of water availability change was larger than water withdrawal on water scarcity in areas with 4 8 of global populations 3 4 drivers of changes in long term average monthly water scarcity this study further identified the dominant driver of changes in long term monthly average water scarcity for different month fig 9 increasing water withdrawal lead to the changing pattern of wsi in most of global areas across all the 12 months and wsi increased in areas with 63 1 of global population among 12 months with the largest value 68 1 in november and smallest value 56 3 in august decreased water withdrawal also lead to mitigation of monthly water scarcity in some developed areas such as the usa europe and japan which was similar to results from long term average wsi as shown in section 3 3 and fig 3 however the dominant driver i e water withdrawal or water availability of changes in long term average monthly water scarcity showed clear seasonal variation in some areas which was mainly attributed to the changing pattern of water availability varied across seasons for example in some area of northern china increased water withdrawal was the key factor of intensified water scarcity in low flow seasons i e october to april but decrease in water availability dominated this pattern during may to september due to frequently occurred drought events in wet seasons wang et al 2017 for northern australia despite long term average wsi didn t show any significant changes increased water availability during january to march led to the great mitigation of water scarcity in these months as for eastern australia decrease in water availability dominated the increased wsi during april to august but the effects of changes in water availability was not significant in other months 4 discussions 4 1 comparison to previous studies the spatial distribution of water scarcity conditions simulated in this study agreed with those in previous studies with water scarcity hotspots concentrated in either arid and semi arid regions or areas with large water demand hanasaki et al 2008b kummu et al 2010 wada et al 2011 veldkamp et al 2017 in terms of long term average population exposed water scarcity the proportion of global population living under water scarcity areas wsi 0 4 was estimated as 36 04 which was close to simulation in veldkamp et al 2017 in which an average of 37 6 global population was exposed to water scarcity during 1971 2010 even though these simulations were all conducted at global degree resolution and monthly time step the simulated population exposed to water scarcity in this study was slightly lower than that in wada et al 2011 and mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 which could be attributed to the difference in water withdrawal and water availability datasets furthermore global population exposed to water scarcity simulated in this study was distinctly larger than previous water scarcity assessments at annual scale e g vörösmarty et al 2000 hanasaki et al 2008b and veldkamp et al 2015 and the state of art monthly assessment could lead to more reasonable results in terms of the changing pattern of global water scarcity this study conducted a comparison of changes in long term average wsi between the estimation using the reconstructed water withdrawal data and the estimation using water withdrawal simulation by ghms in isimip2a where these two simulations used the same water availability data but applied different water withdrawal dataset figure s6 from the comparison wsi under both simulations showed significant increasing trends in most of global regions e g mexico south america the sub saharan africa middle east india central asia and northern china which agreed with previous results wada et al 2011 kummu et al 2016 but the magnitudes of changes in wsi by the reconstructed water withdrawal data were larger than that by water withdrawal simulation from ghms in the south america the sub saharan africa and middle east indicating that water withdrawal simulated in huang et al 2018 showed larger increasing patterns than these of ghms in isimip2a furthermore water scarcity in some developed regions e g usa europe and japan mitigated when using the reconstructed water withdrawal data from huang et al 2018 fao 2018 reported that water scarcity decreased in 44 countries and about half of them are from europe doeffinger and hall 2020 also found that 29 countries showed a significant negative trend in water scarcity with half of them from western and eastern europe and 19 of these countries were categorized as high or upper middle income countries this study presented the areas suffering decreased water scarcity at half degree resolution and monthly time scale and the results also consistent with that from fao 2018 and doeffinger and hall 2020 however wsi in these developed regions still showed increasing pattern when using water withdrawal simulation by ghms and ghms couldn t detect mitigation of water scarcity in these developed regions recognizing regions not only with significant increasing trend in water scarcity but also with water scarcity alleviation e g in some developed countries was very crucial to developing countries for water management and policymaking thus the use of reconstructed water withdrawal dataset has brought new insight into the changing pattern of global historical water scarcity as for the driving factors of changes in water scarcity wada et al 2011 reported that increasing water withdrawal was the leading factor for intensifying water scarcity at global scale especially in mexico india northern china and southern europe but except for the sahel where decreased water availability had larger impacts the results from wada et al 2011 agreed with this study and this study further separated the contribution of water withdrawal by different sectors on regional water scarcity evolution despite that human water withdrawal was the dominant reason for heightened water scarcity in most of global areas accounting for 57 5 of global population this study also found that decreased in water availability also had great effects on increased water scarcity such as in some areas of western usa eastern australia and northeastern china as large scale hydrological models often used macroscale socioeconomic data e g gross domestic production and population to simulate sectoral water withdrawal and they assumed simple changes of technological factors without consideration of the effect of water conservancy measures leading to biased water withdrawal simulation zhou et al 2020 by using a newly water withdrawal dataset based on reported water withdrawal and ghms simulation this study also explained the reason to decreasing trend of water scarcity occurring in some developed areas where deceased water withdrawal or increased water availability mitigated water scarcity condition which was often missed in previous studies e g kummu et al 2010 wada et al 2011 veldkamp et al 2015 the finding of mitigation water scarcity driven by decreased water withdrawal could also guide future water scarcity projections cui et al 2018 graham et al 2020 in addition this study further separated the effects of water withdrawal and water availability on changes in water scarcity at both global and regional scales and further revealed the mechanism behind the evolution of water scarcity which was important for water managements and policymaking 4 2 limitations and implications the major uncertainty in this quantitative assessment of global water scarcity usually originates from three aspects i e water withdrawal water availability and methodology in water scarcity assessment global historical gridded water withdrawal dataset was generated by downscaling country scale estimates of sectoral water withdrawal from reported data using various models and new modeling approaches huang et al 2018 the uncertainties of this global water withdrawal dataset were mainly from two parts i e original reported data and downscaling methodologies for example water withdrawal estimates from fao were mainly from national surveys and assessments e g national yearbook statistics and reports and also could provide reasonable changing trend of sectoral water withdrawal liu et al 2016 however the downscaling algorithms would lead to uncertainties in the spatial and temporal changing pattern of water withdrawal dataset for example this reconstructed water withdrawal dataset used reported data to correct irrigation water withdrawal simulation from ghms which used a time varying irrigated map i e hyde3 mirca2000 however as irrigated agriculture plays an importance role in climate change adaptation to meet growing demand for agricultural products rosa et al 2018 wada et al 2013 accurate estimation of irrigation water withdrawal needs to take the changes of irrigated and rainfed cropland area constraints of local available freshwater and land resources into consideration rosa et al 2020b in addition this study only used the water withdrawal to compute water scarcity however water scarcity assessed with gross water withdrawal generally overestimates actual biophysical water scarcity condition munia et al 2016 both water withdrawal and water consumption are suggested to estimate water scarcity which would provide more important information to understand the evolution of water scarcity vanham et al 2018 the uncertainties in water availability i e streamflow simulations would spread to the water scarcity assessments which mainly resulted from the uncertainties in the climate forcing datasets müller schmied et al 2014 and parameterizations among ghms zhao et al 2017 meanwhile the different human impact parameterizations in ghms also lead to different water availability simulation e g water withdrawal requirement and withdrawal sources liu et al 2017b masaki et al 2017 veldkamp et al 2018 in addition a few limitations in the methods of water scarcity assessment may also introduce uncertainties first efr was assumed 60 of total surface water availability in this study but more spatial and temporal explicit details of environmental flow requirement should be considered because of various hydrological regimes and ecosystems across global regions pastor et al 2014 veldkamp et al 2017 furthermore upstream human water abstraction would often affect water quality and available water resources in the downstream areas might be reduced due to pollution in the upstream areas neglecting water quality may result in underestimation of downstream water scarcity ma et al 2020 in addition the absence of water transfer projects will lead to overestimation of water scarcity conditions in the target area and will underestimate water scarcity in the source areas yin et al 2020 moreover non renewable water resources e g fossil groundwater which was an important available water resources particularly in arid regions was ignored in water scarcity assessment leading to overestimation of actual water scarcity conditions there wada et al 2011 despite the uncertainties and limitations discussed above this findings in this study would be helpful to better understanding of water scarcity and water resources management as represented in the results some developed countries have showed significant mitigation in water scarcity which was mainly attributed to decrease in water withdrawal with the water saving technology improvement and the considerable increase in water productivity zhou et al 2020 doeffinger and hall 2020 vanham and mekonnen 2021 human water withdrawal would decelerate or even shows decreasing trend thus water scarcity would mitigate not only in developed regions but also in some developing countries suffering increasing water scarcity at current stage e g china and some countries in southeast asia graham et al 2020 furthermore future water scarcity would be affected by various factors e g changes in diet springmann et al 2018 population agricultural and energy intensification and climate change beltran peña et al 2020 this study performed an explicit quantitative assessment of historical global water scarcity evolution and its driving factors following the framework and results of this study estimation about water scarcity projection with considering various factors as well as meeting human water demand without depleting the limited regional and global water resources could be conducted in the future works which can well represent water scarcity condition for better allocation water resources huang et al 2021 the effects in changes in water availability on water scarcity were also disclosed in this study as discussed before server drought events greatly reduced the water availability in some areas leading to heightened water scarcity in the future climate change could lead to reduced terrestrial water availability and increasing drought in many global regions especially in southern hemisphere pokhrel et al 2021 where water scarcity was significant intensified during 1971 2010 as assessed in this study thus water resources management should be taken in the future to increase water availability and cope with water scarcity e g inter basin water transfer yin et al 2020 optimal allocation of both renewable and non renewable water resources dalcin and fernandes marques 2020 and virtual water trade zhao et al 2015 5 conclusions this study performed an explicit quantitative assessment of the relative contributions of changes in water withdrawal and water availability on the evolution of global water scarcity during 1970 2010 based on reconstructed water withdrawal dataset and water availability simulations by ghms the global water scarcity was assessed at half degree resolution and monthly time scale the effects of climate change and human activities on the changes in water withdrawal and water availability were also separated to reveal the key driving factor of changes in water scarcity results showed that water scarcity conditions aggravated in most areas and wsi increased by 40 in 1991 2010 relative to 1971 1990 in some water scare hotspots e g mexico the sub saharan africa middle east india central asia and the northern china in some developed areas like usa japan and some european countries e g sweden germany and poland water scarcity conditions alleviated we estimated that 32 3 of the global population was exposed to water scarcity conditions for 1971 1990 and this number eventually increased to 36 8 for 1991 2010 with the significant increase mostly occurred in oceania middle east southeastern asia southern asia and north africa furthermore changes in water withdrawal had a considerable impact on evolution of water scarcity in areas with total 65 1 global population where 57 5 and 7 6 of global population experienced aggravated and alleviated wsi respectively here large increase of water withdrawal mainly concentrated in some developing areas such as northern india eastern and northern china southeast asia africa and middle east due to large increase of irrigation water withdrawal while water withdrawal also decreased significantly in some developed regions e g usa japan and some european countries as a result of decrease in industrial water withdrawal on the other hand the effects of water availability change were larger than water withdrawal on water scarcity in areas with 4 8 global populations therein 3 6 and 1 2 of global population experienced aggravated and alleviated water scarcity respectively changes in water availability were dominated by climate change excepted in areas like northern china where changes in human water use significantly affected water availability than climate impacts furthermore besides the assessment of long term average of water scarcity and its attribution we also analyzed the changing pattern of global water scarcity and its key driving factor for different monthly which further helped us understand the evolution of global water scarcity it should be noted that the results in this assessment is subject to uncertainties arising from the uncertainties in water withdrawal and multi model water availability simulations as well as the methodologies in water scarcity assessments and attribution nevertheless it provided quantitative results to better understanding the mechanism behind the changing pattern in water withdrawal water availability and water scarcity from local to global scales which was essential for coping with water scarcity and better management of water resources to sustainable development credit authorship

4322,the present study focuses on the influence of multiphase water transformation on the hydrology of the three river headwater region climatic factors accelerated transformation of water bodies and changes in runoff patterns were evaluated based on long term field observations subsequently we estimated that changes in climatic factors have prolonged the ablation period and accelerated warming since 1990 additionally the glacier retreat rate during 2001 2013 was accelerated by approximately 16 23 compared with that during 1976 2001 whereas the ratio of snowfall in annual precipitation has decreased by 2 37 since 1990 the beginning of the freezing cycles of lakes along with the complete cycles were delayed moreover snow sublimation significantly increased after 1990 amplitudes of frost days number of days with daily minimum temperature below 0 c during 1991 2019 were eight times higher than those during 1960 1990 furthermore the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation increased by 9 74 from1979 to 1990 to 1991 2019 the variations in actual evaporation increased from 1 257 mm a during 1980 1990 to 0 865 mm a during 1991 2017 and the runoff increased by 66 83 108 m3 10a during 1991 2012 july experienced the highest rainfall and runoff during the multiphase water transformation the runoff recharge sources changed significantly thus changing the historical trend of recharge in the headwaters of rivers only by the glacier snow meltwater by providing a new recharge mode however the accelerated multiphase water transformation caused by climate warming increased the challenges in water resource management and flood control in alpine regions keywords multiphase water transformation climatic factors runoff effects three river headwaters region 1 introduction global warming has accelerated changes in climate environment and multinomial water systems qin et al 2017 additionally warming is gradually changing the water conversion trends in the cold regions deng and zhang 2018 the trends of conversion of ice to water water to water vapor and water vapor to water are changing drastically moreover the climate of the qinghai tibet plateau the third pole region has also changed li et al 2019a the temperature in the 1980s increased rapidly which affected the relatively fragile and sensitive ecosystem in the three river headwater region trhr in the hinterland of the qinghai tibet plateau in china subsequently the trhr ecosystem responded strongly to climate change liang et al 2013 additionally climate change has resulted in changes in hydrological resources trhr has experienced a significant increasing trend in the annual precipitation during 1961 2014 and the mean annual precipitation in the trhr showed a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest shi et al 2016 2017 with the increase in the average global temperature the average temperature in the qinghai tibet plateau also gradually increased moreover since this region is at high altitudes the response to the global climate change is more prominent and the warming trend is highly significant li et al 2016 the rate of change of annual temperature maximum temperature and minimum temperature in the trhr for 52 years have been 0 33 0 28 and 0 4 10a respectively yang and fan 2019 the three entities are demonstrating an increasing trend with the average minimum temperature increasing at a faster rate than the average annual and maximum temperature yang and fan 2019 the rate of change of annual precipitation and the number of precipitation days in the trhr for 52 years showed an increasing trend and the climate tendency rate was 7 76 mm 10a yang and fan 2019 in general glaciers and lakes in the qinghai tibet plateau are sensitive to climate change and have changed significantly due to global warming zhang et al 2008 furthermore glaciers melt and retreat and lakes expand thereby increasing the water level thus plateau reservoirs glaciers and lakes play an important role in regulating runoff hu et al 2011 currently 753 glaciers having a total area of 1276 02 m2 and ice reserves of 104 4094 km2 are present in the trhr these glaciers are mainly distributed in tanggula mountain kunlun mountain sederifeng mountain and animaqing mountain zhou et al 2005 yang et al 2003 due to global warming the glaciers in the alpine region have retreated at an accelerated pace since 1990 permafrost has degenerated and the area under snow has continued to decrease furthermore due to climate warming in the recent decades glaciers have experienced large scale melting globally during 2003 2009 accounting for 29 13 of the global sea level rise in the same period gardner 2013 additionally himalayan glaciers in the central and eastern regions have experienced significant mass loss since the 1970s however majority of the glaciers retreated rapidly since the 1990s zhang et al 2013 ding et al 2019 however some studies have reported the advancement of few glaciers which can be attributed to errors in remote sensing data since 2000 the glacier mass loss rate has increased significantly more than 80 of the glaciers in western china have retreated and 4 5 of the glaciers have disappeared completely ding et al 2019 according to the data from 1969 to 1971 and 1999 to 2002 majority of the glaciers with an average length of 108 3 m and an area of 68 13 km2 accounting for 6 9 of the total glacier area from 1969 to 1971 at the source of the yangtze river are retreating xu et al 2013 meteorological data show that glacier retreat is mainly occurring because of temperature increase at the source of the yangtze river the total glacier area decreased by 155 33 km2 from 1969 1971 to 2009 yao et al 2014 moreover the rate of glacier retreat increased by 2 8 times i e from 2 27 km2 a during 1969 1999 to 8 72 km2 a during 1999 2009 the total glacier area of geladandong glacier decreased by 45 75 km2 with a relative change of 6 8 and an accelerated rate of glacier retreat from 1964 to 2010 wang et al 2013 according to field survey data the dongkemadi glacier also experienced significant melting from 2008 to 2012 its glacier snout retreated to 19 7 m height of the equilibrium line was 120 m higher than that in the early 1990s and the mass balance was 1584 mm the increase in summer temperature controls glacier melting yang et al 2003 the area of animaqing glacier reduced by 15 1 from the peak of the little ice age lia to 1966 at the source of the yellow river interestingly the glacier area reduced by 17 3 from 1966 to 2000 these results reflect that climate warming influences the melting of glaciers and has a profound impact on the development of glaciers in the trhr in recent years the warming rate of permafrost has been evident in the trhr luo et al 2017 the warming rates of surface soil 0 cm shallow soil 5 20 cm and deep soil 40 320 cm were 0 706 0 477 and 0 417 c 10a respectively at majority of the observation stations the seasonal average in the shallow soil had the highest warming trend in winter wang et al 2005 while the deep soil had a comparatively higher warming trend in summer according to the observation data the maximum freezing depths of permafrost at the zaduo yushu and dawu stations decreased by 24 1 and 9 cm respectively from 1961 to 1970 to 1990 2001 wang et al 2005 however the depth of the permafrost active layer at the wudaoliang kekexili honglianghe fenghuoshan bubingquan wuli and kaixinling stations increased by 33 15 4 22 19 73 and 9 cm respectively from 2006 to 2011 warming of soil due to climate warming will continue to increase thus increasing the degeneration of the permafrost furthermore the total snowfall increased at a rate of 0 8 mm per 10 years from 1960 to 2017 moreover snowfall rate 2 2 mm 10a increased from 1961 to 1990 while it showed a decreasing trend 3 6 mm 10a from 1991 to 2017 notably snowfall rate marginally decreased from 2005 to 2014 however the average actual annual evapotranspiration 277 6 mm increased significantly from 1960 to 2012 with a growth rate of 6 27 mm 10a the increase was significant after 1997 qin et al 2018 thus accelerated glacier melting permafrost degradation snowfall rate and increase in actual evapotranspiration significantly impact the runoff composition which requires quantification runoff is influenced by climatic factors underlying surface human activities glaciers and permafrost in the trhr additionally precipitation temperature and evaporation are important meteorological factors affecting the runoff the trhr is located in the alpine region where perennial and seasonal permafrost is widely distributed the melting and freezing of ice and snow and thawing and degradation of the permafrost release groundwater and recharge rivers yang et al 2003 simultaneously the thickness of the active layer of the permafrost increases and the seasonal freezing decreases the change in soil freezing and thawing promotes the movement of water to groundwater reservoirs and increases runoff recently scientists have been focusing on the effect of cryosphere changes on runoff variations however the cryosphere changes are only one of the many aspects of multiphase water transformation therefore to systematically and comprehensively analyze multiphase water transformation in the trhr due to climate warming based on long term meteorological and hydrological observation data this study aims to 1 analyze the influence of climate change characteristics on multiphase water transformation 2 quantify the rate of multiphase water transformation and 3 evaluate the runoff effect due to the multiphase water transformation the subsequent findings could provide an overall understanding of the frequency intensity and duration of multiphase water transformation and its hydrological effects in cold regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the trhr fig 1 is located in the hinterland of the qinghai tibet plateau and south of the qinghai province and covers 363 000 km2 31 39 36 12 n 89 45 102 23 e accounting for 50 4 of the total area of the qinghai province it is dominated by continuous mountain ranges and high altitude terrains with an altitude of 3335 6564 m the harsh climatic conditions make observation and research extremely difficult the climate is of the typical plateau continental type which is characterized by alternating cold and hot seasons distinct dry and wet seasons small annual temperature differences high daily temperature differences long sunshine durations strong radiations and similarity between the four seasons additionally more than 180 rivers more than 1800 lakes 2400 km2 of snow mountain glaciers 200 billion m3 of glaciers and 73 300 km2 of wetlands are present in the trhr the yangtze yellow and lancang rivers originate from the trhr and have an area of 167 000 km2 159 000 km2 and 37 000 km2 respectively which account for 46 44 and 10 of the total area of the trhr respectively furthermore 49 25 and 15 of the total volume of water of the yellow yangtze lancang rivers originate from the trhr more than 60 108 m3 of water is annually supplied to the middle and lower reaches of china known as the water tower of china and the source of life the trhr is an important site for water conservation since it supplies freshwater to china and its surrounding areas additionally it is the strategic base for water resource security in china protecting the ecosystem of the trhr by maintaining and enhancing its soil quality and promoting water conservation since water conservation ensures stable supply of water resources will assist in the long term development of china thus the trhr is critical to ensure water conservation maintain climate stability ecological security and sustainable economic and social development in southeast asia 2 2 data and methods in this study 19 meteorological stations table 1 in the study area were selected the meteorological data were sourced from the national climate center of the china meteorological administration detailed information about the stations is presented in table 1 meteorological data

moisture to precipitation in the trhr moisture recycling data for 1979 2019 were calculated in this study precipitation over a terrestrial region is derived from two sources 1 water vapor evaporated within the region and 2 water vapor evaporated outside the region but later transported in the region developed through the copernicus climate change service era5 is the fifth major global climate reanalysis produced by the european center for medium range weather forecasts after fgge era 15 era 40 era interim era5 is currently available for the period since 1979 until the present day https www

ratio the reanalysis data were available within a 0 25 latitude 0 25 longitude grid the actual evapotranspiration et and snow sublimation data in the trhr were obtained from the global land evaporation amsterdam model version 3 3a https www gleam eu miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 in this version et was estimated based on the reanalysis of net radiation and air temperature satellite and gauged based precipitation satellite based vod and soil moisture the dataset provides the actual global et and snow sublimation data for 1980 2017 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 the runoff data for the river basin table 2 were obtained from the qinghai and xizang provincial hydrographic resources bureau the glacier area data for 1958 1990 and 2010 were taken from the first chinese glacier inventory wang et al 1981 tian 2013 and second chinese glacier inventory sun et al 2015 other data used in this study were collected from previously published studies table 3 3 results 3 1 climatic factors 3 1 1 prolonged ablation period climate warming and the prolonged ablation period were verified especially in the alpine region the temperature significantly increased by 0 32 c 10a from 1960 to 2019 in the trhr fig a1 moreover the warming amplitude showed an increasing trend from the source of the yellow river to the yangtze and lancang rivers fig a2 the effect of warming was more prominent at high altitudes the increase in temperature prolonged the ablation period and decreased the freezing period id and fd amplitudes significantly decreased by 3 44 and 4 60 d 10a respectively during 1960 2019 the changes in spatial distribution of id and fd amplitudes indicated that the decreasing value increased gradually from the low altitudes to the high altitudes fig a2 moreover gsl significantly increased by 3 64 d 10a the gsl spatial distribution showed a similar trend as those of id and fd precipitation increased significantly by 35 79 mm 10a from 1960 to 2019 precipitation showed an increasing trend from southeast to northwest in the trhr similarly r 10 mm 0 74 d 10a r 20 mm 0 097 d 10a and r 25 mm 0 045 d 10a also showed a significant increasing trend during 1960 2019 and their spatial distributions were the same as those of precipitation fig a2 3 1 2 accelerated warming accelerated global warming increased the warming trends significantly in the trhr we comprehensively analyzed the amplitudes of the temperature and precipitation indexes before and after 1990 and the temporal changes in the climatic factors fig 2 the temperature amplitudes during 1991 2019 0 56 c 10a were higher than those during 1960 1990 0 12 c 10a moreover the decreasing amplitudes of fd and id were 8 82 and 6 61 d 10a respectively during 1991 2019 the amplitudes of fd and id during 1991 2019 were eight and three times higher than those during 1960 1990 respectively furthermore the gsl amplitudes during 1991 2019 4 45 d 10a were nine times higher than those during 1960 1990 0 48 d 10a however the amplitudes of precipitation during 1991 2019 were two times lower than those during 1960 1990 these findings suggested that the trhr was drying up due to accelerated warming in addition precipitation increased significantly from 1960 to 2019 35 79 mm 10a fig a1 moreover the amplitudes of r 10 mm r 20 mm and r 25 mm during 1991 2019 were 1 27 0 32 and 0 20 d 10a respectively the amplitudes of r 10 mm 1 15 d 10a r 20 mm 0 05 d 10a and r 25 mm 0 01 d 10a during 1960 1990 were lower than those during 1991 2019 fig 2 at different altitudes the amplitudes of temperature or precipitation indexes during 1991 2019 were higher than those during 1960 1990 fig a3 indicating higher warming in high altitudes thus warming increased with increasing altitude the findings indicate that high altitude regions which are mainly covered by glaciers snow and permafrost are highly sensitive to increasing temperatures 3 2 transformation processes 3 2 1 ice to water as shown in fig 3 the glacier area retreat rate increased from 1976 to 2001 to 2001 2013 in the trhr the glacier retreat rate was higher in the yangtze river than in the yellow river and lancang river however according to a pervious study the glacier retreat rate in the lancang river was higher than that in the yellow river the total area of the geladandong glacier decreased by 55 98 km2 from 1973 to 2009 area change rate was 6 62 and the average retreat rate was 1 55 km2 per year compared with 1976 2001 the glacier retreat rate during 2001 2013 accelerated by approximately 16 23 reflecting the accelerative transformation from solid water to liquid water in the trhr except for the 5k451f0012 glacier which was in a progressive state from 1973 to 1992 in the northern geladandong glacier the other four glaciers continued to retreat among them the gangjiaquba glacier with a length of 3300 m retreated significantly with an average annual recession of 91 7 m fig 3 the change in length of the glacier snout differed from that of the glacier area the most evident change was observed in the southern branch of the jianggudiru glacier from 1992 to 2004 the length of the glacier shrank by 90 m during the lia period the area of the animaqing glacier was 147 8 km2 since then the glacier area rapidly reduced furthermore the glacier area decreased by 17 from 1966 to 2000 fig 3 accelerated reduction in the glacial area is an important indication of the accelerated transformation of ice to water the maximum frozen soil depth showed a decreasing trend in the trhr with an average decrease of 0 5 cm per 10 years fig 3 moreover the maximum frozen soil depth decreased by 13 7 cm 10a during 1961 1969 and it decreased by 5 6 cm 10a during 1984 2017 while the maximum frozen soil depth increased by 16 9 cm 10a during 1970 1983 the beginning of the freezing cycle of permafrost was delayed by 3 2 d every 10 years since 1990 the melting period advanced significantly with an average of 7 6 d per 10 years the change in permafrost considerably affects the ecosystem hydrology soil and engineering stability of various structures accelerated degradation of permafrost is another important indicator of the accelerated transformation of ice to water furthermore the transformation from ice to water can also be characterized by decreasing snowfall fig 4 shows the variation in average snowfall with an increase in the snowfall followed by decrease from 1960 to 2019 in the trhr meanwhile snowfall showed a significant increasing trend 5 6 mm 10a from 1960 to 1990 while a significant decreasing trend 5 7 mm 10a was observed from 1991 to 2019 snowfall accounted for 11 01 of the average annual precipitation during 1960 1990 while this ratio decreased to 8 64 during 1991 2019 fig 4 the ratio of solid precipitation in annual precipitation has decreased by 2 37 since 1990 these results indicated the decrease in solid precipitation and the increase in liquid precipitation thereby confirming the accelerative transformation from solid water to liquid water in the trhr 3 2 2 water to ice lake ice is an important element of the cryosphere and is strongly affected by regional and global climate change freezing of major lakes in the trhr was observed to initiate in november and december each year and the freeze up duration lasted for approximately 20 d on an average the break up duration of lake ice initiated in april and may and the complete cycle lasted for approximately 22 d on an average the complete ice duration of the lakes included 102 d on an average fig 5 the freeze up start of the major lakes of the qinghai tibet plateau was delayed by approximately 0 23 d per year on an average and the freeze up end of lake ice was delayed by approximately 0 10 d per year approximately 35 7 of the total number of lakes experienced a delayed freezing cycle however 38 of the total number of the lakes experienced an early freezing cycle additionally the break up start of lake ice was delayed by approximately 0 42 d per year while the break up end of lake ice was delayed by approximately 0 35 days per year and 48 3 of the total number of lakes experienced the delay 3 2 3 ice to water vapor snow sublimation is a key link between water and energy balance in the snow surface atmosphere coupling system melting and evaporation occur during snow sublimation in the trhr snow sublimation increased by 0 031 mm a during 1980 1990 and by 0 009 mm a during 1991 2017 fig 6 the snow sublimation has increased by 70 96 since 1990 the spatial distribution of snow sublimation during 1980 1990 was lower than that during 1991 2017 the increase in the area under snow sublimation was majorly distributed in the central and north trhr however only the northern region showed a decreasing trend of snow sublimation during 1990 2017 while other regions demonstrated an increasing trend especially in the high altitudes fig 6 snow sublimation rate from 1980 to 2017 at the source of the yellow river and the lancang river was the highest especially southwest of the source of the yellow river however the increasing trend at the source of the yangtze river was observed in all regions except the northern region 3 2 4 water vapor to ice fd is defined as days with the daily minimum temperature lower than 0 c therefore the number of days of condensation and frost are the major indexes representing the transformation of water from gaseous to solid state fd amplitudes significantly decreased by 4 60 d 10a during 1960 2019 the changes in the spatial distribution of fd showed that the lowest value increased gradually from low to high altitudes fig a2 moreover the decreasing amplitudes of fd during 1991 2019 were 8 82 d 10a the amplitudes of fd during 1991 2019 were eight times higher than those during 1960 1990 fig a1 as shown in fig 6 the southeast region of trhr majorly witnessed a significant decrease in fd during 1960 1990 as compared with the other regions of the study area however the decreasing value of fd was relatively high in all the regions except for some regions during 1991 2019 the number of fd showed a significant decreasing trend from 1960 to 2019 especially after 1990 3 2 5 water vapor to water in the trhr the water vapor recycling rate 0 462 10a significantly increased from 1979 to 2019 fig 7 the average water vapor recycling rate during 1991 2019 9 69 was higher than that during 1979 1990 8 83 the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation increased by 9 74 from 1979 to 1990 to 1991 2019 this indicates an accelerated transformation of water vapor to water fig 8 annual average water vapor recycling rate in the yangtze river basin was 10 yi and tao 1997 indicating that 10 of the annual average precipitation originates from the evaporation of water however the water vapor recycling rate in the yellow river basin was 19 with low rate in the upper reaches of the yellow river but the water vapor recycling in the upper reaches can provide sufficient water vapor for precipitation in the lower reaches liu et al 2008 3 2 6 water to water vapor the actual evaporation in the trhr increased from 1 257 mm a during 1980 1990 to 0 865 mm a during 1991 2017 fig 9 however regions that witnessed an increasing trend during 1980 1990 were less in number than those during 1991 2017 furthermore annual evapotranspiration in the study area showed an overall increasing trend from 1980 to 2017 this trend was similar to that of the trhr which exhibited an evaporation trend at the source of the yangtze river yellow river and lancang river and was in the following order source of the lancang river 482 87 mm source of the yellow river 424 67 mm source of the yangtze river 414 18 mm climate is the main factor affecting changes in evapotranspiration evapotranspiration is positively correlated with precipitation and temperature additionally precipitation and temperature showed an increasing trend and thus evapotranspiration also exhibited an increasing trend 4 discussions 4 1 increase in runoff the annual runoff and runoff depth changed significantly due to climate warming and multiphase water transformation fig 10 at the source region of the yellow river the annual average runoff in the tangnaihai station increased by 16 14 108 m3 10a during 1956 1990 while it increased by 28 67 108 m3 10a during 1991 2012 thus the increasing trend during 1991 2012 was 1 78 times higher than that during 1956 1990 indicating a significant increase in runoff moreover the annual runoff depth showed a similar trend as the annual runoff at the source of the yellow river that is it increased by 13 23 mm 10a during 1956 1990 and by 23 50 mm 10a during 1991 2012 the increasing trend in the annual runoff depth verified the increase in runoff especially after 1990 additionally a significant increasing trend in the annual runoff and runoff depth was observed at the zhimenda station at the source of the yangtze river during 1956 2012 the annual runoff increased by 6 67 108 m3 10a during 1956 2012 however the increasing trend during 1991 2012 was 5 28 times higher than that during 1956 1990 indicating a significant increase in runoff meanwhile the annual runoff depth increased by 5 39 mm 10a during 1956 1990 while it increased by 28 44 mm 10a during 1991 2012 furthermore the annual runoff increased by 1 09 108 m3 10a during 1956 2012 at the xiangda station at the source of the lancang river the increasing trends during 1956 1990 and 1991 2012 were 1 09 108 m3 10a and 4 19 108 m3 10a respectively additionally the annual runoff depth increased by 6 11 mm 10a during 1956 2012 however the increasing trend during 1991 2012 was 1 25 times higher than that during 1956 1990 thus the annual runoff and the annual runoff depth showed a significant increasing trend from 1956 to 2012 indicating that climate warming accelerated the transformation of multiphase water bodies and resulted in an increase in runoff a similar trend was observed between the seasonal and interannual variations in runoff fig 10 as the annual runoff decreased by 1 89 108 m3 10a during 1956 2012 at the tangnaihai station the seasonal variations were similar to the interannual variations the runoff from january to december during 1991 2012 was lower than that during 1956 1990 possibly due to the accelerated thawing of permafrost during the warming of the entire basin thus transferring some of the precipitation infiltrate directly into the thawed permafrost later it recharges the supra permafrost water followed by the runoff but does not directly recharge runoff however the runoff from january to december except july at the zhimenda station and xiangda station during 1991 2012 was higher than that during 1956 1990 therefore the outlet runoff increased significantly at all the stations except tangnaihai in the yellow river basin in the trhr thus indicating an increase in the runoff therefore the runoff increased significantly in the entire basin in the trhr during 1991 2012 fig 10 with an increase of 66 83 108 m3 10a these findings prove that global warming accelerates multiphase water transformation which further increases runoff 4 2 relationship between precipitation and runoff climate warming prolonged ablation period increase in rainfall glacier melting and permafrost degradation have significantly influenced the seasonal runoff trends the maximum rainfall fig 11 and runoff were mainly observed in july furthermore similar trends in precipitation and runoff verified the relationship between precipitation and runoff in the trhr the precipitation and runoff at the sources of the yellow river and yangtze river showed a single peak trend with the maximum precipitation and runoff concentrated in july precipitation is the main source of runoff during the strong ablation period in the study area conversely the multiphase water transformation caused by climate change accelerated the recharge and transformation rate of each water body and shortened the duration of water source recharge runoff furthermore the regulating effect of glacier and snow meltwater and permafrost on runoff was weak in the cold regions the inherent hydrological cycle in these regions was simplified by climate warming glacier melting and permafrost degradation simultaneously it strengthened the hydraulic connections of various water bodies in the cold regions furthermore the results verified that atmospheric precipitation was the major source of supra permafrost water which in turn controlled the runoff in cold regions li et al 2019b li et al 2020a the runoff at the source of the lancang river showed a double peak trend while the maximum precipitation and runoff were majorly observed in july the first runoff peak was the same as that observed at the source of the yellow river and yangtze river however a second runoff peak occurred in september two major possibilities exist for this phenomenon first the peak value of runoff lags that of precipitation second it is caused by supra permafrost water which controls the runoff precipitation is the main source of runoff during the rainy season in cold regions while supra permafrost water and glacier snow meltwater control the runoff during other seasons li et al 2019b thus the relationship between precipitation and runoff in the trhr showed that the water cycle and possible recharge sources and modes of runoff in the cold regions changed significantly due to global warming therefore this is another indicator of multiphase water transformation caused by global warming 4 3 changes in runoff sources due to the varying trends in multiphase water transformation the runoff recharge sources changed significantly including the types and the respective proportions of possible recharge sources the distribution results of the runoff at the source of the yellow river indicated that precipitation groundwater and glacier snow melt water account for approximately 63 15 26 18 and 9 17 of the total annual runoff respectively additionally the primary source of runoff at this source is atmospheric precipitation whereas groundwater and glacier snow melt are secondary sources lan et al 2010 liu et al 2016 determined that the contribution rate of glacial meltwater to runoff was 15 0 permafrost ground ice is majorly sourced by supra permafrost water and permafrost water accounting for 58 9 87 0 and 13 0 41 1 respectively to runoff wang et al 2017 yang et al 2003 estimated that the river water at the beiluhe station was not only recharged by atmospheric precipitation but also was affected by regional water circulation and evaporation fractionation and the ground ice was recharged by precipitation and river water however at the tuotuohe station supra permafrost water precipitation and glacial snow meltwater accounted for 51 26 and 23 of the river water respectively furthermore at the zhimenda station 49 of the recharge was contributed by supra permafrost water with precipitation and glacial snow meltwater contributing 34 and 17 respectively the contribution of glacial snow meltwater to runoff displayed a decreasing trend from the source to the river outlet in the study area while the contribution of precipitation showed an increasing trend and the contribution of supra permafrost water was approximately uniform supra permafrost water dominated the runoff in may june and october but the contribution rate of precipitation in july and august was approximately 50 li et al 2019b furthermore to study the variations in the runoff components the sources of different types of tributaries were analyzed supra permafrost water was the main source of tributary river water in the glacier permafrost region permafrost region and mainstream at different altitudes the contribution of the supra permafrost water was not significantly different from that of the atmospheric precipitation and glacial snow meltwater during the strong ablation period the contribution of atmospheric precipitation and glacial snow meltwater to the tributary river water in the glacier permafrost region was relatively low however atmospheric precipitation is the main source of mainstreams at different altitudes during strong ablation events li et al 2020b the runoff in the headwaters of rivers has ended the previous records of being recharged only by glacier snow meltwater and subsequently opened a new recharge mode due to global warming rapid melting of cryosphere causes a sharp decline in ice and snow resources conversely the increasing melting water volume gradually changes the hydrological process and water cycle characteristics 4 4 relationship between climatic factors and multiphase water transformation climatic factors are the main driving forces for the transformation of multiphase water bodies in the trhr fig 12 temperature and precipitation significantly increased and the temperatures during 1991 2019 were higher than those during 1960 1990 temperature increased by 0 44 c 10a while precipitation increased by 22 88 mm 10a from 1960 to 1990 to 1991 2019 the change in the climatic factors verified the prolonged ablation period and accelerated warming after 1990 gsl increased by 3 97 d 10a from 1960 to 1990 to 1991 2019 the accelerated transformation of the water bodies majorly represented the multiphase water transformation in the trhr additionally the retreat rate of glaciers significantly increased 16 23 and the maximum frozen soil depth showed a significant decreasing trend 0 5 cm 10a especially after 1990 furthermore the ratio of snowfall in annual precipitation has decreased by 2 37 since 1990 the freezing cycles of lakes initiated late consequently the complete freezing cycle was delayed snow sublimation increased by 70 96 from 1960 to 1990 to 1991 2019 the amplitudes of fd were higher during 1991 2019 8 82 d 10a than during 1960 1990 2 78 d 10a the average water vapor recycling rate during 1979 1990 8 83 was higher than that during 1991 2019 9 69 furthermore runoff changes were evidently a result of the transformation of multiphase water bodies in the trhr therefore we can conclude that multiphase water transformation influences the runoff recharge sources including the types and the respective proportion of possible recharge sources the analysis of the relationship between climate factors and multiphase water transformation indicated that the temperature during 1991 2019 was 0 59 higher than that during 1960 1990 during the same period the glacier retreat rate increased by 0 49 km when the temperature increased by 1 moreover the snowfall decreased by 2 35 mm when the temperature increased by 1 furthermore snow sublimation decreased by 0 023 mm a when the temperature increased by 1 additionally the actual evaporation increased by 2 23 mm a when the temperature increased by 1 the quantitative relationships between temperature and glacier retreat rate snowfall snow sublimation and actual evaporation during the same period were calculated in this study a quantitative relationship between other indicators does not exist because the indicators belong to different periods however the present study can direct future research 5 conclusions the present study area provided evident data that suggested accelerated global warming the temperature significantly increased by 0 32 c 10a from 1960 to 2019 in the trhr furthermore the temperature amplitudes during 1991 2019 0 56 c 10a were higher than those during 1960 1990 0 12 c 10a precipitation increased significantly by 35 79 mm 10a from 1960 to 2019 moreover the decreasing amplitudes of fd and id were 8 82 and 6 61 d 10a respectively during 1991 2019 the amplitudes of fd and id during 1991 2019 were eight and three times higher than those during 1960 1990 respectively furthermore the gsl amplitudes during 1991 2019 4 45 d 10a were nine times higher than those during 1960 1990 0 48 d 10a the change in the climatic factors verified the prolonged ablation period and accelerated warming after 1990 additionally the glacier retreat rate during 2001 2013 was accelerated by approximately 16 23 compared with that during 1976 2001 whereas the ratio of snowfall in annual precipitation decreased by 2 37 since 1990 the beginning of the freezing cycles of lakes along with the complete cycles were delayed moreover snow sublimation significantly increased after 1990 fd amplitudes during 1991 2019 were eight times higher than those during 1960 1990 furthermore the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation increased by 9 74 from 1979 to 1990 to 1991 2019 the variations in actual evaporation increased from 1 257 mm a during 1980 1990 to 0 865 mm a during 1991 2017 further the runoff increased significantly by 66 83 108 m3 10a during 1991 2012 therefore we can conclude that multiphase water transformation influences the runoff recharge sources including the types and the respective proportion of possible recharge sources the results provide suitable evidence that suggested that the runoff in the headwaters of rivers can be recharged by multiple other sources rather than the previously assumed glacier snow meltwater sources in particular the changes in runoff components and hydrological effects caused by the increase in liquid precipitation and the significant melting of glaciers snow and permafrost have resulted in the evolution of different mechanisms for runoff and generation of water cycle in the cold regions furthermore these changes have a profound impact on the spatial and temporal allocation of water resources and the development and utilization of water resources multiphase water transformation depletes water resources and increases the risk of natural disasters such as glacier lake outburst high frequency debris flow and floods in cold regions therefore future studies should focus on the environmental effects of multiphase water transformation in the cold regions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

4322,the present study focuses on the influence of multiphase water transformation on the hydrology of the three river headwater region climatic factors accelerated transformation of water bodies and changes in runoff patterns were evaluated based on long term field observations subsequently we estimated that changes in climatic factors have prolonged the ablation period and accelerated warming since 1990 additionally the glacier retreat rate during 2001 2013 was accelerated by approximately 16 23 compared with that during 1976 2001 whereas the ratio of snowfall in annual precipitation has decreased by 2 37 since 1990 the beginning of the freezing cycles of lakes along with the complete cycles were delayed moreover snow sublimation significantly increased after 1990 amplitudes of frost days number of days with daily minimum temperature below 0 c during 1991 2019 were eight times higher than those during 1960 1990 furthermore the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation increased by 9 74 from1979 to 1990 to 1991 2019 the variations in actual evaporation increased from 1 257 mm a during 1980 1990 to 0 865 mm a during 1991 2017 and the runoff increased by 66 83 108 m3 10a during 1991 2012 july experienced the highest rainfall and runoff during the multiphase water transformation the runoff recharge sources changed significantly thus changing the historical trend of recharge in the headwaters of rivers only by the glacier snow meltwater by providing a new recharge mode however the accelerated multiphase water transformation caused by climate warming increased the challenges in water resource management and flood control in alpine regions keywords multiphase water transformation climatic factors runoff effects three river headwaters region 1 introduction global warming has accelerated changes in climate environment and multinomial water systems qin et al 2017 additionally warming is gradually changing the water conversion trends in the cold regions deng and zhang 2018 the trends of conversion of ice to water water to water vapor and water vapor to water are changing drastically moreover the climate of the qinghai tibet plateau the third pole region has also changed li et al 2019a the temperature in the 1980s increased rapidly which affected the relatively fragile and sensitive ecosystem in the three river headwater region trhr in the hinterland of the qinghai tibet plateau in china subsequently the trhr ecosystem responded strongly to climate change liang et al 2013 additionally climate change has resulted in changes in hydrological resources trhr has experienced a significant increasing trend in the annual precipitation during 1961 2014 and the mean annual precipitation in the trhr showed a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest shi et al 2016 2017 with the increase in the average global temperature the average temperature in the qinghai tibet plateau also gradually increased moreover since this region is at high altitudes the response to the global climate change is more prominent and the warming trend is highly significant li et al 2016 the rate of change of annual temperature maximum temperature and minimum temperature in the trhr for 52 years have been 0 33 0 28 and 0 4 10a respectively yang and fan 2019 the three entities are demonstrating an increasing trend with the average minimum temperature increasing at a faster rate than the average annual and maximum temperature yang and fan 2019 the rate of change of annual precipitation and the number of precipitation days in the trhr for 52 years showed an increasing trend and the climate tendency rate was 7 76 mm 10a yang and fan 2019 in general glaciers and lakes in the qinghai tibet plateau are sensitive to climate change and have changed significantly due to global warming zhang et al 2008 furthermore glaciers melt and retreat and lakes expand thereby increasing the water level thus plateau reservoirs glaciers and lakes play an important role in regulating runoff hu et al 2011 currently 753 glaciers having a total area of 1276 02 m2 and ice reserves of 104 4094 km2 are present in the trhr these glaciers are mainly distributed in tanggula mountain kunlun mountain sederifeng mountain and animaqing mountain zhou et al 2005 yang et al 2003 due to global warming the glaciers in the alpine region have retreated at an accelerated pace since 1990 permafrost has degenerated and the area under snow has continued to decrease furthermore due to climate warming in the recent decades glaciers have experienced large scale melting globally during 2003 2009 accounting for 29 13 of the global sea level rise in the same period gardner 2013 additionally himalayan glaciers in the central and eastern regions have experienced significant mass loss since the 1970s however majority of the glaciers retreated rapidly since the 1990s zhang et al 2013 ding et al 2019 however some studies have reported the advancement of few glaciers which can be attributed to errors in remote sensing data since 2000 the glacier mass loss rate has increased significantly more than 80 of the glaciers in western china have retreated and 4 5 of the glaciers have disappeared completely ding et al 2019 according to the data from 1969 to 1971 and 1999 to 2002 majority of the glaciers with an average length of 108 3 m and an area of 68 13 km2 accounting for 6 9 of the total glacier area from 1969 to 1971 at the source of the yangtze river are retreating xu et al 2013 meteorological data show that glacier retreat is mainly occurring because of temperature increase at the source of the yangtze river the total glacier area decreased by 155 33 km2 from 1969 1971 to 2009 yao et al 2014 moreover the rate of glacier retreat increased by 2 8 times i e from 2 27 km2 a during 1969 1999 to 8 72 km2 a during 1999 2009 the total glacier area of geladandong glacier decreased by 45 75 km2 with a relative change of 6 8 and an accelerated rate of glacier retreat from 1964 to 2010 wang et al 2013 according to field survey data the dongkemadi glacier also experienced significant melting from 2008 to 2012 its glacier snout retreated to 19 7 m height of the equilibrium line was 120 m higher than that in the early 1990s and the mass balance was 1584 mm the increase in summer temperature controls glacier melting yang et al 2003 the area of animaqing glacier reduced by 15 1 from the peak of the little ice age lia to 1966 at the source of the yellow river interestingly the glacier area reduced by 17 3 from 1966 to 2000 these results reflect that climate warming influences the melting of glaciers and has a profound impact on the development of glaciers in the trhr in recent years the warming rate of permafrost has been evident in the trhr luo et al 2017 the warming rates of surface soil 0 cm shallow soil 5 20 cm and deep soil 40 320 cm were 0 706 0 477 and 0 417 c 10a respectively at majority of the observation stations the seasonal average in the shallow soil had the highest warming trend in winter wang et al 2005 while the deep soil had a comparatively higher warming trend in summer according to the observation data the maximum freezing depths of permafrost at the zaduo yushu and dawu stations decreased by 24 1 and 9 cm respectively from 1961 to 1970 to 1990 2001 wang et al 2005 however the depth of the permafrost active layer at the wudaoliang kekexili honglianghe fenghuoshan bubingquan wuli and kaixinling stations increased by 33 15 4 22 19 73 and 9 cm respectively from 2006 to 2011 warming of soil due to climate warming will continue to increase thus increasing the degeneration of the permafrost furthermore the total snowfall increased at a rate of 0 8 mm per 10 years from 1960 to 2017 moreover snowfall rate 2 2 mm 10a increased from 1961 to 1990 while it showed a decreasing trend 3 6 mm 10a from 1991 to 2017 notably snowfall rate marginally decreased from 2005 to 2014 however the average actual annual evapotranspiration 277 6 mm increased significantly from 1960 to 2012 with a growth rate of 6 27 mm 10a the increase was significant after 1997 qin et al 2018 thus accelerated glacier melting permafrost degradation snowfall rate and increase in actual evapotranspiration significantly impact the runoff composition which requires quantification runoff is influenced by climatic factors underlying surface human activities glaciers and permafrost in the trhr additionally precipitation temperature and evaporation are important meteorological factors affecting the runoff the trhr is located in the alpine region where perennial and seasonal permafrost is widely distributed the melting and freezing of ice and snow and thawing and degradation of the permafrost release groundwater and recharge rivers yang et al 2003 simultaneously the thickness of the active layer of the permafrost increases and the seasonal freezing decreases the change in soil freezing and thawing promotes the movement of water to groundwater reservoirs and increases runoff recently scientists have been focusing on the effect of cryosphere changes on runoff variations however the cryosphere changes are only one of the many aspects of multiphase water transformation therefore to systematically and comprehensively analyze multiphase water transformation in the trhr due to climate warming based on long term meteorological and hydrological observation data this study aims to 1 analyze the influence of climate change characteristics on multiphase water transformation 2 quantify the rate of multiphase water transformation and 3 evaluate the runoff effect due to the multiphase water transformation the subsequent findings could provide an overall understanding of the frequency intensity and duration of multiphase water transformation and its hydrological effects in cold regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the trhr fig 1 is located in the hinterland of the qinghai tibet plateau and south of the qinghai province and covers 363 000 km2 31 39 36 12 n 89 45 102 23 e accounting for 50 4 of the total area of the qinghai province it is dominated by continuous mountain ranges and high altitude terrains with an altitude of 3335 6564 m the harsh climatic conditions make observation and research extremely difficult the climate is of the typical plateau continental type which is characterized by alternating cold and hot seasons distinct dry and wet seasons small annual temperature differences high daily temperature differences long sunshine durations strong radiations and similarity between the four seasons additionally more than 180 rivers more than 1800 lakes 2400 km2 of snow mountain glaciers 200 billion m3 of glaciers and 73 300 km2 of wetlands are present in the trhr the yangtze yellow and lancang rivers originate from the trhr and have an area of 167 000 km2 159 000 km2 and 37 000 km2 respectively which account for 46 44 and 10 of the total area of the trhr respectively furthermore 49 25 and 15 of the total volume of water of the yellow yangtze lancang rivers originate from the trhr more than 60 108 m3 of water is annually supplied to the middle and lower reaches of china known as the water tower of china and the source of life the trhr is an important site for water conservation since it supplies freshwater to china and its surrounding areas additionally it is the strategic base for water resource security in china protecting the ecosystem of the trhr by maintaining and enhancing its soil quality and promoting water conservation since water conservation ensures stable supply of water resources will assist in the long term development of china thus the trhr is critical to ensure water conservation maintain climate stability ecological security and sustainable economic and social development in southeast asia 2 2 data and methods in this study 19 meteorological stations table 1 in the study area were selected

chinese glacier inventory wang et al 1981 tian 2013 and second chinese glacier inventory sun et al 2015 other data used in this study were collected from previously published studies table 3 3 results 3 1 climatic factors 3 1 1 prolonged ablation period climate warming and the prolonged ablation period were verified especially in the alpine region the temperature significantly increased by 0 32 c 10a from 1960 to 2019 in the trhr fig a1 moreover the warming amplitude showed an increasing trend from the source of the yellow river to the yangtze and lancang rivers fig a2 the effect of warming was more prominent at high altitudes the increase in temperature prolonged the ablation period and decreased the freezing period id and fd amplitudes significantly decreased by 3 44 and 4 60 d 10a respectively during 1960 2019 the changes in spatial distribution of id and fd amplitudes indicated that the decreasing value increased gradually from the low altitudes to the high altitudes fig a2 moreover gsl significantly increased by 3 64 d 10a the gsl spatial distribution showed a similar trend as those of id and fd precipitation increased significantly by 35 79 mm 10a from 1960 to 2019 precipitation showed an increasing trend from southeast to northwest in the trhr similarly r 10 mm 0 74 d 10a r 20 mm 0 097 d 10a and r 25 mm 0 045 d 10a also showed a significant increasing trend during 1960 2019 and their spatial distributions were the same as those of precipitation fig a2 3 1 2 accelerated warming accelerated global warming increased the warming trends significantly in the trhr we comprehensively analyzed the amplitudes of the temperature and precipitation indexes before and after 1990 and the temporal changes in the climatic factors fig 2 the temperature amplitudes during 1991 2019 0 56 c 10a were higher than those during 1960 1990 0 12 c 10a moreover the decreasing amplitudes of fd and id were 8 82 and 6 61 d 10a respectively during 1991 2019 the amplitudes of fd and id during 1991 2019 were eight and three times higher than those during 1960 1990 respectively furthermore the gsl amplitudes during 1991 2019 4 45 d 10a were nine times higher than those during 1960 1990 0 48 d 10a however the amplitudes of precipitation during 1991 2019 were two times lower than those during 1960 1990 these findings suggested that the trhr was drying up due to accelerated warming in addition precipitation increased significantly from 1960 to 2019 35 79 mm 10a fig a1 moreover the amplitudes of r 10 mm r 20 mm and r 25 mm during 1991 2019 were 1 27 0 32 and 0 20 d 10a respectively the amplitudes of r 10 mm 1 15 d 10a r 20 mm 0 05 d 10a and r 25 mm 0 01 d 10a during 1960 1990 were lower than those during 1991 2019 fig 2 at different altitudes the amplitudes of temperature or precipitation indexes during 1991 2019 were higher than those during 1960 1990 fig a3 indicating higher warming in high altitudes thus warming increased with increasing altitude the findings indicate that high altitude regions which are mainly covered by glaciers snow and permafrost are highly sensitive to increasing temperatures 3 2 transformation processes 3 2 1 ice to water as shown in fig 3 the glacier area retreat rate increased from 1976 to 2001 to 2001 2013 in the trhr the glacier retreat rate was higher in the yangtze river than in the yellow river and lancang river however according to a pervious study the glacier retreat rate in the lancang river was higher than that in the yellow river the total area of the geladandong glacier decreased by 55 98 km2 from 1973 to 2009 area change rate was 6 62 and the average retreat rate was 1 55 km2 per year compared with 1976 2001 the glacier retreat rate during 2001 2013 accelerated by approximately 16 23 reflecting the accelerative transformation from solid water to liquid water in the trhr except for the 5k451f0012 glacier which was in a progressive state from 1973 to 1992 in the northern geladandong glacier the other four glaciers continued to retreat among them the gangjiaquba glacier with a length of 3300 m retreated significantly with an average annual recession of 91 7 m fig 3 the change in length of the glacier snout differed from that of the glacier area the most evident change was observed in the southern branch of the jianggudiru glacier from 1992 to 2004 the length of the glacier shrank by 90 m during the lia period the area of the animaqing glacier was 147 8 km2 since then the glacier area rapidly reduced furthermore the glacier area decreased by 17 from 1966 to 2000 fig 3 accelerated reduction in the glacial area is an important indication of the accelerated transformation of ice to water the maximum frozen soil depth showed a decreasing trend in the trhr with an average decrease of 0 5 cm per 10 years fig 3 moreover the maximum frozen soil depth decreased by 13 7 cm 10a during 1961 1969 and it decreased by 5 6 cm 10a during 1984 2017 while the maximum frozen soil depth increased by 16 9 cm 10a during 1970 1983 the beginning of the freezing cycle of permafrost was delayed by 3 2 d every 10 years since 1990 the melting period advanced significantly with an average of 7 6 d per 10 years the change in permafrost considerably affects the ecosystem hydrology soil and engineering stability of various structures accelerated degradation of permafrost is another important indicator of the accelerated transformation of ice to water furthermore the transformation from ice to water can also be characterized by decreasing snowfall fig 4 shows the variation in average snowfall with an increase in the snowfall followed by decrease from 1960 to 2019 in the trhr meanwhile snowfall showed a significant increasing trend 5 6 mm 10a from 1960 to 1990 while a significant decreasing trend 5 7 mm 10a was observed from 1991 to 2019 snowfall accounted for 11 01 of the average annual precipitation during 1960 1990 while this ratio decreased to 8 64 during 1991 2019 fig 4 the ratio of solid precipitation in annual precipitation has decreased by 2 37 since 1990 these results indicated the decrease in solid precipitation and the increase in liquid precipitation thereby confirming the accelerative transformation from solid water to liquid water in the trhr 3 2 2 water to ice lake ice is an important element of the cryosphere and is strongly affected by regional and global climate change freezing of major lakes in the trhr was observed to initiate in november and december each year and the freeze up duration lasted for approximately 20 d on an average the break up duration of lake ice initiated in april and may and the complete cycle lasted for approximately 22 d on an average the complete ice duration of the lakes included 102 d on an average fig 5 the freeze up start of the major lakes of the qinghai tibet plateau was delayed by approximately 0 23 d per year on an average and the freeze up end of lake ice was delayed by approximately 0 10 d per year approximately 35 7 of the total number of lakes experienced a delayed freezing cycle however 38 of the total number of the lakes experienced an early freezing cycle additionally the break up start of lake ice was delayed by approximately 0 42 d per year while the break up end of lake ice was delayed by approximately 0 35 days per year and 48 3 of the total number of lakes experienced the delay 3 2 3 ice to water vapor snow sublimation is a key link between water and energy balance in the snow surface atmosphere coupling system melting and evaporation occur during snow sublimation in the trhr snow sublimation increased by 0 031 mm a during 1980 1990 and by 0 009 mm a during 1991 2017 fig 6 the snow sublimation has increased by 70 96 since 1990 the spatial distribution of snow sublimation during 1980 1990 was lower than that during 1991 2017 the increase in the area under snow sublimation was majorly distributed in the central and north trhr however only the northern region showed a decreasing trend of snow sublimation during 1990 2017 while other regions demonstrated an increasing trend especially in the high altitudes fig 6 snow sublimation rate from 1980 to 2017 at the source of the yellow river and the lancang river was the highest especially southwest of the source of the yellow river however the increasing trend at the source of the yangtze river was observed in all regions except the northern region 3 2 4 water vapor to ice fd is defined as days with the daily minimum temperature lower than 0 c therefore the number of days of condensation and frost are the major indexes representing the transformation of water from gaseous to solid state fd amplitudes significantly decreased by 4 60 d 10a during 1960 2019 the changes in the spatial distribution of fd showed that the lowest value increased gradually from low to high altitudes fig a2 moreover the decreasing amplitudes of fd during 1991 2019 were 8 82 d 10a the amplitudes of fd during 1991 2019 were eight times higher than those during 1960 1990 fig a1 as shown in fig 6 the southeast region of trhr majorly witnessed a significant decrease in fd during 1960 1990 as compared with the other regions of the study area however the decreasing value of fd was relatively high in all the regions except for some regions during 1991 2019 the number of fd showed a significant decreasing trend from 1960 to 2019 especially after 1990 3 2 5 water vapor to water in the trhr the water vapor recycling rate 0 462 10a significantly increased from 1979 to 2019 fig 7 the average water vapor recycling rate during 1991 2019 9 69 was higher than that during 1979 1990 8 83 the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation increased by 9 74 from 1979 to 1990 to 1991 2019 this indicates an accelerated transformation of water vapor to water fig 8 annual average water vapor recycling rate in the yangtze river basin was 10 yi and tao 1997 indicating that 10 of the annual average precipitation originates from the evaporation of water however the water vapor recycling rate in the yellow river basin was 19 with low rate in the upper reaches of the yellow river but the water vapor recycling in the upper reaches can provide sufficient water vapor for precipitation in the lower reaches liu et al 2008 3 2 6 water to water vapor the actual evaporation in the trhr increased from 1 257 mm a during 1980 1990 to 0 865 mm a during 1991 2017 fig 9 however regions that witnessed an increasing trend during 1980 1990 were less in number than those during 1991 2017 furthermore annual evapotranspiration in the study area showed an overall increasing trend from 1980 to 2017 this trend was similar to that of the trhr which exhibited an evaporation trend at the source of the yangtze river yellow river and lancang river and was in the following order source of the lancang river 482 87 mm source of the yellow river 424 67 mm source of the yangtze river 414 18 mm climate is the main factor affecting changes in evapotranspiration evapotranspiration is positively correlated with precipitation and temperature additionally precipitation and temperature showed an increasing trend and thus evapotranspiration also exhibited an increasing trend 4 discussions 4 1 increase in runoff the annual runoff and runoff depth changed significantly due to climate warming and multiphase water transformation fig 10 at the source region of the yellow river the annual average runoff in the tangnaihai station increased by 16 14 108 m3 10a during 1956 1990 while it increased by 28 67 108 m3 10a during 1991 2012 thus the increasing trend during 1991 2012 was 1 78 times higher than that during 1956 1990 indicating a significant increase in runoff moreover the annual runoff depth showed a similar trend as the annual runoff at the source of the yellow river that is it increased by 13 23 mm 10a during 1956 1990 and by 23 50 mm 10a during 1991 2012 the increasing trend in the annual runoff depth verified the increase in runoff especially after 1990 additionally a significant increasing trend in the annual runoff and runoff depth was observed at the zhimenda station at the source of the yangtze river during 1956 2012 the annual runoff increased by 6 67 108 m3 10a during 1956 2012 however the increasing trend during 1991 2012 was 5 28 times higher than that during 1956 1990 indicating a significant increase in runoff meanwhile the annual runoff depth increased by 5 39 mm 10a during 1956 1990 while it increased by 28 44 mm 10a during 1991 2012 furthermore the annual runoff increased by 1 09 108 m3 10a during 1956 2012 at the xiangda station at the source of the lancang river the increasing trends during 1956 1990 and 1991 2012 were 1 09 108 m3 10a and 4 19 108 m3 10a respectively additionally the annual runoff depth increased by 6 11 mm 10a during 1956 2012 however the increasing trend during 1991 2012 was 1 25 times higher than that during 1956 1990 thus the annual runoff and the annual runoff depth showed a significant increasing trend from 1956 to 2012 indicating that climate warming accelerated the transformation of multiphase water bodies and resulted in an increase in runoff a similar trend was observed between the seasonal and interannual variations in runoff fig 10 as the annual runoff decreased by 1 89 108 m3 10a during 1956 2012 at the tangnaihai station the seasonal variations were similar to the interannual variations the runoff from january to december during 1991 2012 was lower than that during 1956 1990 possibly due to the accelerated thawing of permafrost during the warming of the entire basin thus transferring some of the precipitation infiltrate directly into the thawed permafrost later it recharges the supra permafrost water followed by the runoff but does not directly recharge runoff however the runoff from january to december except july at the zhimenda station and xiangda station during 1991 2012 was higher than that during 1956 1990 therefore the outlet runoff increased significantly at all the stations except tangnaihai in the yellow river basin in the trhr thus indicating an increase in the runoff therefore the runoff increased significantly in the entire basin in the trhr during 1991 2012 fig 10 with an increase of 66 83 108 m3 10a these findings prove that global warming accelerates multiphase water transformation which further increases runoff 4 2 relationship between precipitation and runoff climate warming prolonged ablation period increase in rainfall glacier melting and permafrost degradation have significantly influenced the seasonal runoff trends the maximum rainfall fig 11 and runoff were mainly observed in july furthermore similar trends in precipitation and runoff verified the relationship between precipitation and runoff in the trhr the precipitation and runoff at the sources of the yellow river and yangtze river showed a single peak trend with the maximum precipitation and runoff concentrated in july precipitation is the main source of runoff during the strong ablation period in the study area conversely the multiphase water transformation caused by climate change accelerated the recharge and transformation rate of each water body and shortened the duration of water source recharge runoff furthermore the regulating effect of glacier and snow meltwater and permafrost on runoff was weak in the cold regions the inherent hydrological cycle in these regions was simplified by climate warming glacier melting and permafrost degradation simultaneously it strengthened the hydraulic connections of various water bodies in the cold regions furthermore the results verified that atmospheric precipitation was the major source of supra permafrost water which in turn controlled the runoff in cold regions li et al 2019b li et al 2020a the runoff at the source of the lancang river showed a double peak trend while the maximum precipitation and runoff were majorly observed in july the first runoff peak was the same as that observed at the source of the yellow river and yangtze river however a second runoff peak occurred in september two major possibilities exist for this phenomenon first the peak value of runoff lags that of precipitation second it is caused by supra permafrost water which controls the runoff precipitation is the main source of runoff during the rainy season in cold regions while supra permafrost water and glacier snow meltwater control the runoff during other seasons li et al 2019b thus the relationship between precipitation and runoff in the trhr showed that the water cycle and possible recharge sources and modes of runoff in the cold regions changed significantly due to global warming therefore this is another indicator of multiphase water transformation caused by global warming 4 3 changes in runoff sources due to the varying trends in multiphase water transformation the runoff recharge sources changed significantly including the types and the respective proportions of possible recharge sources the distribution results of the runoff at the source of the yellow river indicated that precipitation groundwater and glacier snow melt water account for approximately 63 15 26 18 and 9 17 of the total annual runoff respectively additionally the primary source of runoff at this source is atmospheric precipitation whereas groundwater and glacier snow melt are secondary sources lan et al 2010 liu et al 2016 determined that the contribution rate of glacial meltwater to runoff was 15 0 permafrost ground ice is majorly sourced by supra permafrost water and permafrost water accounting for 58 9 87 0 and 13 0 41 1 respectively to runoff wang et al 2017 yang et al 2003 estimated that the river water at the beiluhe station was not only recharged by atmospheric precipitation but also was affected by regional water circulation and evaporation fractionation and the ground ice was recharged by precipitation and river water however at the tuotuohe station supra permafrost water precipitation and glacial snow meltwater accounted for 51 26 and 23 of the river water respectively furthermore at the zhimenda station 49 of the recharge was contributed by supra permafrost water with precipitation and glacial snow meltwater contributing 34 and 17 respectively the contribution of glacial snow meltwater to runoff displayed a decreasing trend from the source to the river outlet in the study area while the contribution of precipitation showed an increasing trend and the contribution of supra permafrost water was approximately uniform supra permafrost water dominated the runoff in may june and october but the contribution rate of precipitation in july and august was approximately 50 li et al 2019b furthermore to study the variations in the runoff components the sources of different types of tributaries were analyzed supra permafrost water was the main source of tributary river water in the glacier permafrost region permafrost region and mainstream at different altitudes the contribution of the supra permafrost water was not significantly different from that of the atmospheric precipitation and glacial snow meltwater during the strong ablation period the contribution of atmospheric precipitation and glacial snow meltwater to the tributary river water in the glacier permafrost region was relatively low however atmospheric precipitation is the main source of mainstreams at different altitudes during strong ablation events li et al 2020b the runoff in the headwaters of rivers has ended the previous records of being recharged only by glacier snow meltwater and subsequently opened a new recharge mode due to global warming rapid melting of cryosphere causes a sharp decline in ice and snow resources conversely the increasing melting water volume gradually changes the hydrological process and water cycle characteristics 4 4 relationship between climatic factors and multiphase water transformation climatic factors are the main driving forces for the transformation of multiphase water bodies in the trhr fig 12 temperature and precipitation significantly increased and the temperatures during 1991 2019 were higher than those during 1960 1990 temperature increased by 0 44 c 10a while precipitation increased by 22 88 mm 10a from 1960 to 1990 to 1991 2019 the change in the climatic factors verified the prolonged ablation period and accelerated warming after 1990 gsl increased by 3 97 d 10a from 1960 to 1990 to 1991 2019 the accelerated transformation of the water bodies majorly represented the multiphase water transformation in the trhr additionally the retreat rate of glaciers significantly increased 16 23 and the maximum frozen soil depth showed a significant decreasing trend 0 5 cm 10a especially after 1990 furthermore the ratio of snowfall in annual precipitation has decreased by 2 37 since 1990 the freezing cycles of lakes initiated late consequently the complete freezing cycle was delayed snow sublimation increased by 70 96 from 1960 to 1990 to 1991 2019 the amplitudes of fd were higher during 1991 2019 8 82 d 10a than during 1960 1990 2 78 d 10a the average water vapor recycling rate during 1979 1990 8 83 was higher than that during 1991 2019 9 69 furthermore runoff changes were evidently a result of the transformation of multiphase water bodies in the trhr therefore we can conclude that multiphase water transformation influences the runoff recharge sources including the types and the respective proportion of possible recharge sources the analysis of the relationship between climate factors and multiphase water transformation indicated that the temperature during 1991 2019 was 0 59 higher than that during 1960 1990 during the same period the glacier retreat rate increased by 0 49 km when the temperature increased by 1 moreover the snowfall decreased by 2 35 mm when the temperature increased by 1 furthermore snow sublimation decreased by 0 023 mm a when the temperature increased by 1 additionally the actual evaporation increased by 2 23 mm a when the temperature increased by 1 the quantitative relationships between temperature and glacier retreat rate snowfall snow sublimation and actual evaporation during the same period were calculated in this study a quantitative relationship between other indicators does not exist because the indicators belong to different periods however the present study can direct future research 5 conclusions the present study area provided evident data that suggested accelerated global warming the temperature significantly increased by 0 32 c 10a from 1960 to 2019 in the trhr furthermore the temperature amplitudes during 1991 2019 0 56 c 10a were higher than those during 1960 1990 0 12 c 10a precipitation increased significantly by 35 79 mm 10a from 1960 to 2019 moreover the decreasing amplitudes of fd and id were 8 82 and 6 61 d 10a respectively during 1991 2019 the amplitudes of fd and id during 1991 2019 were eight and three times higher than those during 1960 1990 respectively furthermore the gsl amplitudes during 1991 2019 4 45 d 10a were nine times higher than those during 1960 1990 0 48 d 10a the change in the climatic factors verified the prolonged ablation period and accelerated warming after 1990 additionally the glacier retreat rate during 2001 2013 was accelerated by approximately 16 23 compared with that during 1976 2001 whereas the ratio of snowfall in annual precipitation decreased by 2 37 since 1990 the beginning of the freezing cycles of lakes along with the complete cycles were delayed moreover snow sublimation significantly increased after 1990 fd amplitudes during 1991 2019 were eight times higher than those during 1960 1990 furthermore the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation increased by 9 74 from 1979 to 1990 to 1991 2019 the variations in actual evaporation increased from 1 257 mm a during 1980 1990 to 0 865 mm a during 1991 2017 further the runoff increased significantly by 66 83 108 m3 10a during 1991 2012 therefore we can conclude that multiphase water transformation influences the runoff recharge sources including the types and the respective proportion of possible recharge sources the results provide suitable evidence that suggested that the runoff in the headwaters of rivers can be recharged by multiple other sources rather than the previously assumed glacier snow meltwater sources in particular the changes in runoff components and hydrological effects caused by the increase in liquid precipitation and the significant melting of glaciers snow and permafrost have resulted in the evolution of different mechanisms for runoff and generation of water cycle in the cold regions furthermore these changes have a profound impact on the spatial and temporal allocation of water resources and the development and utilization of water resources multiphase water transformation depletes water resources and increases the risk of natural disasters such as glacier lake outburst high frequency debris flow and floods in cold regions therefore future studies should focus on the environmental effects of multiphase water transformation in the cold regions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

4323,streamflow forecasting is critical for real time water resources management and flood early warning in this study we introduce a novel attention based long short term memory lstm cell deep learning dl model for postprocessing streamflow simulations which will herein be referred to as self activated and internal attention lstm or saina lstm in this model we incorporate an improved self attention mechanism into the inner structure of the lstm cell to increase focus on the more important time points thereby enhancing the information flow of the cell performance of the saina lstm is then compared against that of the current national weather service s operational streamflow forecast ensemble postprocessor enspost a recently developed multiscale alternative ms enspost a robust machine learning algorithm gradient boosting and two other deep learning algorithms lstm and gated recurrent unit gru forecast performance in four basins in different climatological regimes of the united states are compared several deterministic evaluation metrics are examined for one to seven day ahead predictions of daily flows saina lstm reduce the biases in simulations of low medium and high daily flows the other two deep learning models also outperform enspost and ms enspost in most cases the results highlight the relatively poor performance of enspost particularly in low flow conditions generally the novel saina lstm model outperforms other models in low medium and high ranges of flow and for 1 to 7 day ahead forecasts in all three highly nonlinear and non snow driven study basins in snow driven basins due to low nonlinearity the three deep learning models are relatively comparable and significantly improved over statistical models the results of the comparative evaluation demonstrate the capability of saina lstm to reduce the rmse of daily predicted flow by up to 20 percent compared to ms enspost the promising result shown here is a motivation for extending this research to also cover ensemble forecasting using the novel model developed in this work keywords streamflow prediction deep learning attention mechanism machine learning statistical post processing enspost 1 introduction streamflow simulations often contain considerable meteorological and hydrological uncertainties seo et al 2006 the former include uncertain boundary condition of precipitation and temperature while the latter corresponds to hydrologic modeling errors including initial conditions model parameterization and structure gupta et al 2012 schaake et al 2007b additional uncertainty can arise from human interventions such as river management tavakol davani et al 2019 alizadeh 2019 the propagation of errors from these various sources of uncertainty can negatively impact the accuracy of streamflow simulations these model inaccuracies can then contribute to poor performance in hydrologic forecast systems in recent decades numerous methodologies have been proposed and developed to account for these uncertainties in streamflow simulation in general these approaches can be grouped into three principal categories 1 physically based models 2 empirically based models alameer et al 2020 birkel and soulsby 2015 khorrami et al 2019 seibert et al 2018 and 3 hybrid models mount et al 2016 nourani et al 2014 there have been recent efforts to transition operational systems towards more physically based models distributed physically based models explicitly take account of spatial variability of watershed characteristics and meteorological inputs rahimi et al 2020 vaze et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 which in principle yields more realistic model structures parameterizations and calibrations chen et al 2020 gao et al 2017 mohammad et al 2020 nonetheless physically based models have large data requirements beven 2011 complex mathematical tools duan et al 1992 and require numerous simplifying assumptions mehr et al 2013 which pose challenges to calibration and validation gupta et al 2005 sitterson et al 2017 empirical models on the other hand are based on mapping a relationship between catchment observed characteristics and predictands from a statistical viewpoint shen 2018 and are widely utilized due to their relative simplicity robustness minimal information and parameter requirements and modest effort for development and application chen et al 2018 lashkar ara et al 2021 all of which can lead to more accurate results sitterson et al 2017 the past decade has seen an extensive application of machine learning techniques to different fields of hydrology in particular streamflow prediction alipour et al 2020 baharvand et al 2020 hassanzadeh et al 2020 although these methods have shown more promising results compared to linear empirical models they still face considerable issues when applied to highly nonstationary time series reichstein et al 2019 more recently hybrid modeling techniques have been introduced mount et al 2016 nourani et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 to address the weaknesses of earlier methods by assimilating both physical and empirical models hybrid models are expected to improve overall predictive performance nourani et al 2014 one popular hybrid approach is to use empirical methods to post process physically based predictions by mapping a connection between the outputs of the physical model and relevant observations by using an empirical model to provide a means for eliminating model bias from all sources of uncertainty ye et al 2014 for streamflow prediction some researchers have applied different post processing methods including statistical tools and or machine learning methods combined with a specific physical model and have concluded that the hybrid model more often produce predictions with better accuracy and less uncertainty compared to physical or empirical models in the united states the national weather service s nws hydrologic forecast service hefs demargne et al 2014 has been developed and implemented at various river forecast centers rfc the two main components of hefs the meteorological ensemble forecast processor mefp schaake et al 2007a wu et al 2011 and the ensemble post processor enspost seo et al 2006 are intended to quantify and reduce meteorologic and hydrologic uncertainties respectively enspost which is a combination of probability matching and autoregressive modeling was originally developed for reliable short term forecasting and for natural flows in headwaters basins only to overcome this limitation of enspost a simple parsimonious multiscale post processor known as ms enspost has been developed alizadeh et al 2020b ms enspost applies a magnitude dependent bias correction to simulated flows a multiscale regression approach to utilize the available skill in observed and simulated flows at different temporal scales and an ensemble generator based on error modeling alizadeh et al 2020a while ms enspost shows promising improvements compared to the original enspost its performance has never been compared against other nonlinear approaches such as machine learning and deep learning models over the past few years deep learning methods have shown promising results when applied to complex tasks especially in computer vision yang et al 2020 natural language processing gunawan et al 2018 and environmental forecasting kamangir et al 2020 among classes of deep learning rnn is of particular importance given that it has been specifically designed to correct the limitations of traditional artificial neural networks anns rnn preserve the state of the network kratzert et al 2018 and better manage sequential data by capturing temporal dependencies among samples using internal self looped cells hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 kao et al 2020 this property makes rnn more applicable to forecasting bengio et al 1994 salinas et al 2020 a modern variant of the simple rnn or the lstm neural networks have been developed as a response to the vanishing exploding gradients problem of the simple rnn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 through replacing nodes in the hidden layer of the earlier recurrent networks with a memory cell i e a computation unit lipton et al 2015 in recent years hydrologists have applied lstm to hydrological time series applications kao et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 while the lstms can yield good predictions in some cases the method still struggles with highly nonlinear time series liu et al 2019 one possible reason could be the fact that the temporal dependencies between elements in these time series are not well exploited chen et al 2020 for a streamflow series only some of the key hydrological features may provide contextual information while other hydrological features may add less valuable information for instance in a rainfall event the importance of the initial phase should be lower than the importance of approaching the peak phase ding et al 2020 feng et al 2019 in principle therefore one may improve predictions from a single feature sequence by focusing on the most instructive time points and disregarding the less pertinent ones ding et al 2020 chen et al 2018 this relatively new dynamic feature selection procedure is known as the attention mechanism ding et al 2020 inspired by the visual attention of humans the attention mechanism has been applied in various fields with encouraging results liu and durlofsky 2020 nabati and behrad 2020 song et al 2017 few papers however have explored its potential value in the context of hydrologic forecasting chen et al 2020 ding et al 2019 in almost all previous works the attention mechanism has been used as a separate layer before or after the main layer e g the lstm layer we postulate that the incorporating of the attention mechanism into the structure of lstm cell could alleviate further improvement of lstm based architecture and simplify consistent implementation of the attention mechanism with lstm cell meanwhile the application of an improved lstm cell with such a mechanism is limited zheng and chen 2020 and to the best of our knowledge no researcher has used an attention based lstm variant in the field of hydrology to address the strong nonlinearity of hydrological processes rnn models like other dl models may have various vital hyperparameters which need to be optimized in order to improve the model s performance cheng et al 2019 ma et al 2019 this makes hyperparameter optimization a critical step ma et al 2020 as such this study uses bayesian optimization bo due to its higher efficiency compared to alternatives such as genetic algorithms he et al 2019 lin et al 2020 bo is more applicable when objective functions are computationally expensive to calculate feurer and hutter 2019 ju et al 2017 the main objective of this research is to develop and evaluate a novel attention based lstm called the self activated and internal attention saina lstm and compare its streamflow forecasting performance against that of enspost ms enspost and other machine learning gradient boosting and deep learning models gru and lstm and identify the one which best reduce uncertainty in hydrologic forecasts we use several deterministic measures to compare these models at different ranges of flow and for different forecast horizons as a part of this evaluation the following research questions are also addressed how well do the deep learning models can improve over the machine learning and statistical models in deterministic prediction of streamflow how do different models compare against one another at different ranges of flow and for different ranges of forecast how does the prediction errors is related to the hydroclimatology of the study area the fundamental contributions of this study can thus be summarized as follows 1 presenting a novel rnn model called saina lstm which incorporates an attention mechanism into the lstm cell 2 comparison of saina lstm with other deep learning lstm and gru machine learning gradient boosting and statistical enspost and ms enspost models 3 application of bayesian optimization for rnn hyperparameter selection in streamflow prediction 4 evaluation of the above models for a range of flow and lead times and in different hydroclimatological regimes this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present the study basins and data used in section 3 we describe the methods used for this research section 4 presents the results of comparative evaluation section 5 provides summary and recommendations for future research 2 study basins and data used this research considers model performance in four watersheds in different service areas of colorado basin cb california nevada cn middle atlantic ma and west gulf wg river forecast center the locations of the four study watersheds in their respective rfcs are shown in fig 1 these watersheds were among those examined in previous studies of enspost regonda and seo 2008 seo et al 2006 and ms enspost alizadeh et al 2020b and were chosen to reflect a range of hydroclimatological regimes general basin characteristics are illustrated in table 1 using three hydrological indices 1 mean annual precipitation 2 the aridity index i e the partitioning of precipitation into streamflow and evaporation budyko 1974 and 3 the snow fraction i e the fraction of precipitation which is solid phase these four watersheds are not significantly affected by reservoir operations alizadeh et al 2020b bswc2 located in the high elevations along the rocky mountain shows high snow fractions and experiences accumulation of snow in winter and a delayed contribution to soil moisture and recharge during springtime melt contributing to delayed streamflow responses berghuijs et al 2014 hunp1 which is located in the northeast tend to be humid and hence have low values of aridity index whereas nfdc1 and dcjt2 are generally semi arid to arid with extremely high aridity index in general it is expected that arid basins shown lower predictability of streamflow than humid basins while snow driven basins tend to show the highest predictability for training and testing the models the mean daily observed and simulated flow are used the historical observed mean daily flow is obtained from the united stated geological survey usgs since the focus of this research is to reduce hydrologic uncertainty the variable of interest is the simulated streamflow which reflects hydrologic uncertainty only rather than the streamflow forecast which reflects both meteorological and hydrologic uncertainties alizadeh 2019 the simulated mean daily flow was obtained from the nws and are derived from simulated instantaneous flows generated at 6 h intervals using two operational hydrologic models and observed precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration forcings alizadeh 2019 the hydrologic models used were the sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac sma burnash et al 1973 for cb cn and wgrfc and the continuous antecedent precipitation index model api cont fedora and beschta 1989 sittner et al 1969 for marfc the unit hydrograph chow et al 1988 and snow 17 anderson 1973 are used for surface runoff routing and snow accumulation and ablation respectively the period of record is chosen such that there are continuous data for the entire period without missing flow values table 2 presents general information about the data used for this research at different rfcs 3 materials and methods in this section the method and mathematical equations for the statistical machine learning and deep learning models are described first the regression equations for enspost and ms enspost are provided then the gb lstm and gru methods are described finally the attention based lstm model saina lstm is explained in detail 3 1 statistical methods 3 1 1 enspost the statistical prediction model in the enspost is based on the following recursive linear regression arx 1 1 in normal space as shown in eq 1 1 z k 1 o 1 b z k o bz k 1 s e k 1 where z k o and z k 1 o denote the observed flow in normal space at the current time and one step ahead respectively z k 1 s is the model predicted flow at time step k 1 in normal space and e k 1 denotes the random error at one step in the future in normal space while b denotes the weight given to the normalized model prediction for further details about the deterministic forecast of enspost readers are referred to seo et al 2006 3 1 2 ms enspost to address the significant drawbacks of enspost namely its high data requirements particularly for high flows and its poor performance in intermittent streams in semi arid and arid regions ms enspost provides a simpler and more parsimonious model which can solve several low dimensional regression equations instead of a single high dimensional one for that purpose a multiplicative bias correction factor β i is estimated at the daily scale and applied to the simulated flow at the i th day q i s as 2 β q i o q i s where q i o is the predicted flow valid at the i th day this bias correction procedure is designed to address the dependence of error magnitudes on different ranges of flow then to predict the observed flow the following linear model is applied for the predicted time aggregated observed flow 3 a k 1 p ω k a k 0 o 1 ω k a k 1 b k 1 m where a k 1 p and a k 1 b denote the observed and bias corrected simulated flows at the k th time scale respectively while subscript 1 signifies that the prediction is for a single time step ahead ω k denotes the optimal weight for the time aggregated observed flow at the k th scale a k 0 o where subscript 0 signifies the current time step further details about regression model can be found in alizadeh et al 2020b 3 2 machine learning method 3 2 1 gradient boosting gradient boosting gb friedman 2002 is one of the most popular ensemble machine learning models the intuition behind ensemble models is converting weak learner members into strong learners by aggregating the results of multiple predictors to eventually predict a class based on predictions of several individual backbone decision tree models liaw et al 2002 each backbone decision tree model partitions the data with regards to the main object based on if else rules gb trains many decision tree models in a gradual additive sequential manner in which the k th tree is trained from the first k 1 trees and updates the residual for the i th example of difference between prediction and target real value friedman 2002 gb uses gradients in the loss function to identify the weak learners decision tress and to optimize the loss function in gb the gini index or the entropy index are using for partitioning the data in regression or classification trees for more details refer to friedman 2002 machine learning models usually have tuning parameters i e hyperparameters parameter tuning means choosing the optimal values for the parameters and optimize them to reach the best performance gb input hyperparameters their tuning ranges and optimal values detected by grid search technique bergstra et al 2011 are listed in table 3 3 3 deep learning methods 3 3 1 recurrent neural network rnn in a typical ann architecture hidden cells of a layer are only connected to the next and previous layers and not to one another meaning that the information of a hidden cell cannot be transferred to adjacent hidden cells in the same layer this results in a less effective architecture for tasks such as translation and time series analysis in contrast to these architectures rnn applies a recurrent hidden unit which works as a self loop cycle and is responsible for transforming the information of the previous hidden cells to the next ones working as a memory unit the flow of information can thus be preserved leading to a more effective structure for the prediction of sequenced data elman 1990 liang et al 2018 lipton et al 2015 as shown in eq 4 the current hidden state h t is upgraded at each time step using information from both input data at the current time x t and previous cells in the pretext of the hidden state h t 1 4 h t f 1 w h x t u h h t 1 b h 5 y t f 2 w y h t b y where f 1 and f 2 represents activation functions w h w y and u h are weight matrices b h and b y are bias vectors and y t denotes the cell output at time t although the rnn architecture has proved to be a powerful tool for time series analysis it still has drawbacks in the case of long length dependency of input sequences the back propagation gradient flow of hidden states may exponentially converge to 0 or in rare cases explode to 1 leading to incorrect transfer of the previous hidden cells information this is known as the vanishing or exploding gradient problem 3 3 2 long short term memory lstm to overcome the vanishing gradient problem described in the previous section hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 developed a long short term memory structure by introducing a new hidden state called cell state c t which is responsible for tracking the current history of information in this structure three gates the forget input gers et al 1999 and output gates manage both the gradient flow of back propagation and long and short dependencies of information the structure of an lstm cell is depicted in fig 2 b the flow of information in a lstm cell can be described as following three steps initially and at the first step the forget gate controls the amount of information of earlier cell state c t 1 which can be added to the current cell state as f t c t 1 where the sign denotes the element wise multiplication operator the output of the gate is in the range 0 0 1 0 the value 0 0 indicates deletion of all the former information while unity means all the information is kept 6 f t σ w f x t u f h t 1 b f the next step calculates the current cell state which itself includes three phases in the first phase the values of x t and h t 1 convert to values between 1 and 1 using a hyperbolic tangent tanh activation function to get a new cell state candidate c t at time t 7 c t tanh w c x t u c h t 1 b c in the second phase c t is updated using values from the input gate as i t c t which works similarly to the forget gate the input gate controls the amount of both information from the previous hidden state and the input data sequence at the current time t which should be written to the cell state 8 i t σ w i x t u i h t 1 b i in the last phase the updated values from previous phases are added to the earlier updated cell state from the first step 9 c t f t c t 1 i t c t t finally in the last step the output gate controls how much information from the new cell state should pass as both the output of current lstm memory cell and the new hidden state to the next cell 10 o t σ w o x t u o h t 1 b o 11 h t o tanh c t in the above equations f t i t o t represent the outputs of forget input and output gates at time t respectively c t and c t 1 are the current and previous cell states respectively while h t 1 denotes output of the unit at time t 1 and x t is the input of the current lstm cell w u and b represent network weight matrices and bias vector and σ is the sigmoid function 3 3 3 gated recurrent unit gru to expedite the running process gru networks were proposed as a simpler structure compared to lstm cho et al 2014 as a variant of the lstm cell the gru cell is similar in terms of its application and its ability to monitor the basic rnn cell gradient problem of vanishing exploding grus meanwhile are simpler to implement since unlike lstm cell they have only two control gates reset r t and update z t and the hidden state and cell state are merged together the purpose of the update gate z t is to regulate how much information from the previous time step state h t 1 will be stored in the current time step the reset gate r t in which the previous hidden state and new inputs are combined manages the amount of information that is brought into the current candidate set h t by the previous state the structure of the gru cell is shown in fig 2 c the gru equations are expressed as 12 r t σ w r x t u r h t 1 b r 13 z t σ w z x t u z h t 1 b z 14 h t tanh w c x t u c r c h t 1 b c 15 h t 1 z t h t 1 z t h t where r t and z t denotes the output of reset and update gates at time t and h t and h t 1 are unit outputs the at time t and t 1 respectively x t represents the input of the lstm cell at time t w u and b are network weight matrices and bias vector of the network sign is element wise multiplication operator and σ represents the sigmoid function 3 3 4 attention based lstm cell one possible approach to improve ability of lstm for capturing high nonlinearity is to use an attention mechanism which assigns attention scores to each observed value allowing the consideration of the interdependency of streamflow sequences at various time steps pei et al 2017 in this study we integrate an improved self attention mechanism into the inner structure of the lstm cell presenting an attention based lstm cell to be both simple in implementation and effective in addressing higher nonlinearity in streamflow data we first give a brief description of the general attention and self attention structures then we describe the architecture of our new lstm cell called saina lstm in detail 3 3 4 1 attention mechanism given a query and a set of key value pairs attention can be described as computation of a weighted sum of the values based on the query and the related keys the query q key k and value v are matrices and the query ascertains which values to attend on 16 a q k v i exp e qk j j exp e qk j v j where e qk j is an alignment model which can be computed using the basic dot product attention function 17 e qk j qk t r where d k d q and the two terms denote the dimensions of the k and q matrices respectively dot product attention is faster and more space efficient in practice than additive attention since it can be implemented using a highly optimized matrix multiplication code vaswani et al 2017 3 3 4 2 self attention mechanism self attention as a special type of attention is the mechanism of relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the same sequence bahdanau et al 2014 vaswani et al 2017 applied a self attention mechanism called scaled dot product attention in their transformer model this can be written as 18 a q k v softmax qk t d k v this attention is identical to dot product attention except for scaling factor 1 d k the logic behind this scaling is to inhibit the softmax function from going to regions with small gradient values when d k is large 3 3 4 3 saina lstm cell in this study we modify the scaled dot product attention as follows given the input matrix i the proposed attention mechanism can be formulated as 19 i i 1 i 2 i h t h 20 q t a sigmoid iw q h a 21 k t a tanh iw k h a 22 s t t softmax sigmoid qk t 23 o t h i s t where w q and w k are trainable weights q and k are the query and key matrices respectively s is the attention score matrix and o is the output or in other words the attended input matrix denotes the element wise hadamard multiplication operator the indices of t h and a represent the dimension of matrices and are the given values for time step length hidden unit dimension and the second dimension of q and k respectively which all are hyperparameter values and need to be optimized the salient point is that the o matrix needs to have identical dimensions as i to ensure this we consider some adjustments to the scaled dot product attention first we use i directly as the value matrix with no prior multiplication by a weight matrix secondly in contrast to scaled dot product attention we use the element wise product to compute o according to eq 23 we also exclude the scaling factor 1 d k since the multiplication of t and a and consequently the value of d k is usually not large we observed that applying the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions prior to calculating q k and s can lead to smaller training and validation errors experimentally we suspect that the sigmoid function can give functionality similar to the input gate i t and the hyperbolic tangent function can provide a better calibration for the output values it should also be noted that i s t is a three dimensional matrix of t t h which by summing the values in matching positions for the second and third dimensions yields a two dimensional matrix of t h we use the summation function as it is faster in processing than the mean product maximum and minimum functions in practice in the final stage we integrate the developed attention unit into the lstm cell after several experiments we observed that feeding the candidate cell state to the developed attention unit before feeding it to the input gate i t can improve the general performance of cell since we have incorporated an activated self attention mechanism into the structure of lstm cell we call the developed cell self activated internal attention lstm cell or saina lstm its complete mechanism is shown in fig 3 it is worth mentioning that by modifying the inner information flow of the lstm cell the gradient stream of the cell changes and subsequently one needs to rederive the gradient in this study the cell gradient is calculated automatically by using a custom class in the tensorflow library abadi et al 2016 3 3 5 deep learning hyperparameter tuning despite the growing popularity of deep learning methods for hydrologic prediction experimental trial and error methods are used frequently to optimize model hyperparameters gao et al 2020 nguyen 2020 zuo et al 2020 however these procedures are slow since the optimal combinations cannot be attained quickly and they do not consider the mixed effects of hyperparameters sameen et al 2020 some studies also use limited parameter sets or recommended values lv et al 2020 yin et al 2020 this is very problematic particularly for studies that attempt to evaluate the performance of different models since such practices cannot provide fair comparisons another common method is grid search fang et al 2020 which can be computationally expensive when the number of hyperparameters and their corresponding search space is large this study proposes the implementation of bayesian optimization which has shown the capability of acquiring satisfactory results with fewer iterations compared to traditional optimization algorithms he et al 2019 though frequently used in other areas of research few studies have evaluated bo s application for streamflow prediction and to our knowledge no researcher has combined lstm and bo for that application the procedure of bo is described generally given a black box function we are to find the global maximum 24 x argmax f x x a where x is the optimal set of parameters and a r d is the candidate space having n pairs of inputs and observations x i y i i 1 2 n we are intended to select x n 1 in a way that y n 1 is maximized bo can answer this using bayes conditional probability rule taking the previous iteration s result into account to choose values for the next iteration the steps of bo can be described as below a establishing a probabilistic surrogate model which commonly is based on the gaussian process gp a gp is an extension of a multivariate gaussian distribution to an infinitely dimensional stochastic process in which any finite linear combination of dimensions has a joint gaussian distribution brochu et al 2010 as a distribution over functions a gp can be specified by its mean function m and covariance matrix function k respectively as follows 25 f gp m k consequently the gp can be modified and applied to get the prior distribution based on accumulated observations b applying an acquisition function to determine the next observation location where the observation property is expected to be the best the principal goal of using an acquisition function is to avoid attaining local optima by having a tradeoff between exploration areas in which the objective function is very ambiguous and exploitation areas at which the objective function is expected to be optimal cheng et al 2019 in this study we applied the expected improvement ei acquisition function which selects points that are expected to have an enhancement over the present best observation we assume that the current optimum is at x where acquisition function f x reaches its maximum the new query point can be obtained by the expected improvement as shown in eq 26 26 x argmax e max 0 f t 1 x f x d t where the expectation is taken over y t 1 which is itself distributed as the posterior objective value at x t 1 using a gp the analytic expression of ei can be derived 27 ei x μ x f x φ z σ x ϕ z if σ x 0 0 if σ x 0 28 z μ x f x σ x where φ and ϕ are the cumulative distribution function cdf and probability density function pdf of a standard normal distribution and μ x and σ x are the prediction expectation and variance respectively c stop if the new set of parameters satisfies the termination conditions else return to step a and repeat the process 3 3 6 framework of deep learning models the flowchart of saina lstm models is depicted in fig 4 bo is initially run for 100 iterations to find shared values of parameters among the best results to decrease the search space then for each lead time 30 additional bo iterations are used to find the final parameter set the mentioned values for each iteration number have been selected experimentally optimized parameters and their corresponding search spaces are given in table 4 also we use leave two years out cross validation to have independent validation of the prediction results generated from all of the models moreover we adopt a recursive pattern for performing the simulation from all models as shown in fig 5 in order to improve short range 1 to 3 days ahead and medium range 4 to 7 days ahead prediction accuracy similar framework can be applied for lstm and gru models since deep learning models are stochastic algorithms and the outputs from iterations in the model can be different we ran the model three times and selected the results that produce the lowest evaluation error for the validation data 3 4 evaluation metrics the purpose of postprocessing is to create streamflow predictions which are better than the raw i e unprocessed hydrological simulations for this purpose we evaluate the performance of six models and compare them against each other as well as against the raw simulated flow using leave two years out cross validation several metrics are used to evaluate the predictions for different lead times since the accurate and reliable prediction is mainly important for during high flow events these metrics are also evaluated specifically for high flows the primary accuracy measure for a deterministic forecast is the root mean square error rmse 29 rmse k 1 n k i 1 n k q i p k q i o k 2 where q i p k denotes the i th day k prediction of daily flow q i o k denotes the observed daily flow and n k denotes the total number of day k daily flow predictions compared with metrics such as mean absolute error mae rmse penalizes large errors which is desirable for high flow forecasts the mean error me is another measure which is used to evaluate the performance of different models 30 me k 1 n k i 1 n k q i p k q i o k me can also provide beneficial information about the overall bias of the models and whether the model over or under predicts at different lead times and with different flow values unlike rmse which gives a relatively high weight to large errors mean absolute error mae which is a linear statistical measure is more applicable when the overall impact of errors is proportionate to the increase in error mae can be formulated as 31 mae k 1 n k i 1 n k q i p k q i o k another widely used measure to quantify hydrologic prediction error is the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 32 nse 1 i 1 n k q i p k q i o k 2 i 1 n k q o k q i o k 2 where q o k denotes the mean of day k observed daily flow nse assesses the predictive power of the model and ranges between and 1 an nse of 1 corresponds to a perfect forecast by the model whereas an nse of zero indicates that the model prediction performs equally well as the observed mean thus any value between 0 and 1 indicates predictive skill in addition to these error metrics scatter plots of observed vs predicted flow for all models are compared and the cumulative distribution functions cdf of the observed raw model simulated and postprocessed flows are also described 4 results and discussion the rmse of six postprocessing models and the raw i e not postprocessed hydrologic simulations are compared in fig 6 in bswc2 which is a snow driven basin with high snow fraction and aridity index table 1 and generally has low flow values due to its snowy nature the deep learning models clearly outperform the statistical and machine learning models for 1 to 7 day ahead forecasts fig 6a the machine learning model gb outperforms the statistical model for lead times up to five days beyond which it is similar for nfdc1 located in semi arid california with moderate snow fraction due to its high elevation and relatively high aridity index saina lstm shows the best results for all lead times the other two deep learning model also show similar results for one day forecasts the other models show relatively comparable errors at different forecast horizons for hunp1 which is a large subwatershed of the juniata river basin in pennsylvania with low snow fraction and aridity the three deep learning models substantially outperform the machine learning and statistical models ms enspost is comparable to the raw model simulations while gb and enspost are clearly inferior to other models dcjt2 on the other hand is a flashy basin located in the semi arid area of texas with zero snow and high aridity of the four basins dcjt2 poses the biggest prediction challenge due to its intermittent behavior particularly during the summer as mentioned earlier enspost struggles with intermittent flow regimes which is clear for dcjt2 gb predictions are also poor ms enspost on the other hand is successfully able to deal with zero values in the streamflow most notable however is the clear superiority of saina lstm at all forecast times fig 7 shows similar results but focuses on rmse of predicted flows only if the observed flow exceeds the 90th percentile the rmse results for high flows generally follow similar patterns to what has already been described for all flows saina lstm shows the best prediction in general for all forecast lead times gru and lstm also perform relatively well for short range forecasts while gb performs relatively poorly enspost performs better for high flows compared to its performance for the entire range of flow this indicates the limited capability of enspost to perform well in low flow prediction particularly in ephemeral basins where considerable zero flows exist e g during the summer the mean error results are compared in fig 8 to find out the bias in the streamflow prediction by each model in addition to rmse showing the me statistics can provide additional information regarding the overall tendency of the model to overpredict or underpredict at different lead times in this figure the horizontal light gray line indicates an me of zero it can be seen from all four basins that enspost shows the highest me large me values for hunp1 and dcjt2 indicates the highly overprediction by enspost this can also indicate the considerable number of low flows in these basins for short lead times other five models show comparable results but it seems interesting that the results from saina lstm indicate its slight underprediction for these four basins at longer forecast ranges the comparison of mae for different basins shows the improved prediction capability by deep learning models particularly for short term forecasts these results also demonstrate the ability of these nonlinear models to reduce the mae compared to statistical models i e enspost and ms enspost fig 9 nse for snow dominated bswc2 approach the perfect value of 1 0 for the 1 day ahead forecast fig 10 the three deep learning models outperform the machine learning and statistical models in nfdc1 saina lstm shows the best nse performance for 1 to 6 day ahead forecasts while enspost and gb shows the worst for hunp1 saina lstm performs best for the 1 day ahead forecast while gb shows consistently high nse for all lead times the two statistical models show the least accurate results for this basin though the low nse values for dcjt2 highlight the difficulty in prediction in ephemeral and flashy rivers the better predictive power of saina lstm in this basin is clear the other two deep learning models gru and lstm also show relatively high nses for short term prediction scatter plots of predicted streamflows from all six models against the corresponding observed flows for 1 day ahead prediction are shown in fig 11 the thick line close to the diagonal also shows the quantile quantile result for bswc2 fig 11a gb exhibits substantial scatter while there is systematic underprediction of low flows in enspost the other four models produce less scatter for nfdc1 fig 11b gb again shows substantial scatter particularly for medium flows 30th to 60th percentile flow corresponding to high errors shown in fig 6b the quantile quantile line for saina lstm closely aligns with the diagonal for medium and high flows the results for hunp1 fig 11c show systematic biases in enspost particularly for low flows and also shows clear discontinuities due to the stratification of flows during parameter estimation seo et al 2006 the three deep learning models show strong results for all ranges of flow particularly for very high flows however gru shows slight overprediction in medium flow conditions compared with the lstm models the scatter plots for dcjt2 fig 11d clearly show the potency of dl models to predict for intermittent basins in arid regions where there might exist consecutive zero values of flow for long periods enspost shows poor prediction for all ranges of flow in dcjt2 particularly for low flows while ms enspost outperforms enspost it still struggles with high flows as can be seen from the quantile quantile plot at large flows substantial scatter also exists in gb predictions in this basin the deep learning models provide more promising results at all ranges with saina lstm performing best at high flows to check the ability of each model to capture the flow distribution in dcjt2 the cdfs of predicted flows are also examined fig 12 also shown in the lower right corner of the figure is a magnification of the upper tail of the distribution the blue curve shows the cdf of the observed flow while the red curve shows that of the raw simulated flow this figure signifies the difference between statistical models and nonlinear models and the potency of nonlinear models in capturing the distribution of the observed flow in semi arid basin of dcjt2 similar plots for other basins show less clear differences among the corresponding flow time series and are not included in the text to better visualize the time series of observed vs predicted flow from each model the two hydrographs are included as an example in fig 13 for 7 day ahead forecast in bswc2 for a period of one year these hydrographs show mismatch between the observed and predicted flow from enspost however other five models are able to generate more accurate prediction in terms of both timing and peak in the hydrograph among six models saina lstm is the best to capture the peak which proves its capability in streamflow prediction 5 summary and future research recommendations the deterministic performance of the gb machine learning technique and three deep learning techniques gru lstm and saina lstm is compared against that of the national weather service s operational streamflow postprocessor enspost and the ms enspost multi scale post processor for postprocessing streamflow forecast simulations in four basins across the united states of these models saina lstm which uses a self attention based lstm cell is introduced here for the first time comparison of the six models indicates that saina lstm generally outperforms the other approaches particularly in an arid intermittent and flashy river in northern texas saina lstm is able to reduce rmse for 1 day ahead forecasts for the bswc2 nfdc1 hunp1 and dcjt2 basins by 20 4 19 and 8 percent respectively compared with ms enspost the gru and lstm models generally outperform ms enspost particularly for 1 day ahead forecasts while their performance at longer lead times are comparable scatter plots of predicted flow vs verifying observed flow show large biases for enspost particularly for low flows these plots also show relatively high scatter in the gb model although this study presents a deterministic evaluation for four basins a more comprehensive study using both deterministic and probabilistic evaluation metrics is needed this will be consequential to assess the predictability of machine learning and deep learning models the promising results generated by saina lstm for deterministic forecasts is a motivation for extending this work to also cover ensemble forecasting using the novel model developed in this work to further develop this model the authors suggest using preprocessing techniques such as mode decomposition as well finally while this study presents the potential of newly developed nonlinear deep learning models for streamflow forecast postprocessing the required effort to operationalize these methods requires further research as well

4323,streamflow forecasting is critical for real time water resources management and flood early warning in this study we introduce a novel attention based long short term memory lstm cell deep learning dl model for postprocessing streamflow simulations which will herein be referred to as self activated and internal attention lstm or saina lstm in this model we incorporate an improved self attention mechanism into the inner structure of the lstm cell to increase focus on the more important time points thereby enhancing the information flow of the cell performance of the saina lstm is then compared against that of the current national weather service s operational streamflow forecast ensemble postprocessor enspost a recently developed multiscale alternative ms enspost a robust machine learning algorithm gradient boosting and two other deep learning algorithms lstm and gated recurrent unit gru forecast performance in four basins in different climatological regimes of the united states are compared several deterministic evaluation metrics are examined for one to seven day ahead predictions of daily flows saina lstm reduce the biases in simulations of low medium and high daily flows the other two deep learning models also outperform enspost and ms enspost in most cases the results highlight the relatively poor performance of enspost particularly in low flow conditions generally the novel saina lstm model outperforms other models in low medium and high ranges of flow and for 1 to 7 day ahead forecasts in all three highly nonlinear and non snow driven study basins in snow driven basins due to low nonlinearity the three deep learning models are relatively comparable and significantly improved over statistical models the results of the comparative evaluation demonstrate the capability of saina lstm to reduce the rmse of daily predicted flow by up to 20 percent compared to ms enspost the promising result shown here is a motivation for extending this research to also cover ensemble forecasting using the novel model developed in this work keywords streamflow prediction deep learning attention mechanism machine learning statistical post processing enspost 1 introduction streamflow simulations often contain considerable meteorological and hydrological uncertainties seo et al 2006 the former include uncertain boundary condition of precipitation and temperature while the latter corresponds to hydrologic modeling errors including initial conditions model parameterization and structure gupta et al 2012 schaake et al 2007b additional uncertainty can arise from human interventions such as river management tavakol davani et al 2019 alizadeh 2019 the propagation of errors from these various sources of uncertainty can negatively impact the accuracy of streamflow simulations these model inaccuracies can then contribute to poor performance in hydrologic forecast systems in recent decades numerous methodologies have been proposed and developed to account for these uncertainties in streamflow simulation in general these approaches can be grouped into three principal categories 1 physically based models 2 empirically based models alameer et al 2020 birkel and soulsby 2015 khorrami et al 2019 seibert et al 2018 and 3 hybrid models mount et al 2016 nourani et al 2014 there have been recent efforts to transition operational systems towards more physically based models distributed physically based models explicitly take account of spatial variability of watershed characteristics and meteorological inputs rahimi et al 2020 vaze et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 which in principle yields more realistic model structures parameterizations and calibrations chen et al 2020 gao et al 2017 mohammad et al 2020 nonetheless physically based models have large data requirements beven 2011 complex mathematical tools duan et al 1992 and require numerous simplifying assumptions mehr et al 2013 which pose challenges to calibration and validation gupta et al 2005 sitterson et al 2017 empirical models on the other hand are based on mapping a relationship between catchment observed characteristics and predictands from a statistical viewpoint shen 2018 and are widely utilized due to their relative simplicity robustness minimal information and parameter requirements and modest effort for development and application chen et al 2018 lashkar ara et al 2021 all of which can lead to more accurate results sitterson et al 2017 the past decade has seen an extensive application of machine learning techniques to different fields of hydrology in particular streamflow prediction alipour et al 2020 baharvand et al 2020 hassanzadeh et al 2020 although these methods have shown more promising results compared to linear empirical models they still face considerable issues when applied to highly nonstationary time series reichstein et al 2019 more recently hybrid modeling techniques have been introduced mount et al 2016 nourani et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 to address the weaknesses of earlier methods by assimilating both physical and empirical models hybrid models are expected to improve overall predictive performance nourani et al 2014 one popular hybrid approach is to use empirical methods to post process physically based predictions by mapping a connection between the outputs of the physical model and relevant observations by using an empirical model to provide a means for eliminating model bias from all sources of uncertainty ye et al 2014 for streamflow prediction some researchers have applied different post processing methods including statistical tools and or machine learning methods combined with a specific physical model and have concluded that the hybrid model more often produce predictions with better accuracy and less uncertainty compared to physical or empirical models in the united states the national weather service s nws hydrologic forecast service hefs demargne et al 2014 has been developed and implemented at various river forecast centers rfc the two main components of hefs the meteorological ensemble forecast processor mefp schaake et al 2007a wu et al 2011 and the ensemble post processor enspost seo et al 2006 are intended to quantify and reduce meteorologic and hydrologic uncertainties respectively enspost which is a combination of probability matching and autoregressive modeling was originally developed for reliable short term forecasting and for natural flows in headwaters basins only to overcome this limitation of enspost a simple parsimonious multiscale post processor known as ms enspost has been developed alizadeh et al 2020b ms enspost applies a magnitude dependent bias correction to simulated flows a multiscale regression approach to utilize the available skill in observed and simulated flows at different temporal scales and an ensemble generator based on error modeling alizadeh et al 2020a while ms enspost shows promising improvements compared to the original enspost its performance has never been compared against other nonlinear approaches such as machine learning and deep learning models over the past few years deep learning methods have shown promising results when applied to complex tasks especially in computer vision yang et al 2020 natural language processing gunawan et al 2018 and environmental forecasting kamangir et al 2020 among classes of deep learning rnn is of particular importance given that it has been specifically designed to correct the limitations of traditional artificial neural networks anns rnn preserve the state of the network kratzert et al 2018 and better manage sequential data by capturing temporal dependencies among samples using internal self looped cells hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 kao et al 2020 this property makes rnn more applicable to forecasting bengio et al 1994 salinas et al 2020 a modern variant of the simple rnn or the lstm neural networks have been developed as a response to the vanishing exploding gradients problem of the simple rnn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 through replacing nodes in the hidden layer of the earlier recurrent networks with a memory cell i e a computation unit lipton et al 2015 in recent years hydrologists have applied lstm to hydrological time series applications kao et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 while the lstms can yield good predictions in some cases the method still struggles with highly nonlinear time series liu et al 2019 one possible reason could be the fact that the temporal dependencies between elements in these time series are not well exploited chen et al 2020 for a streamflow series only some of the key hydrological features may provide contextual information while other hydrological features may add less valuable information for instance in a rainfall event the importance of the initial phase should be lower than the importance of approaching the peak phase ding et al 2020 feng et al 2019 in principle therefore one may improve predictions from a single feature sequence by focusing on the most instructive time points and disregarding the less pertinent ones ding et al 2020 chen et al 2018 this relatively new dynamic feature selection procedure is known as the attention mechanism ding et al 2020 inspired by the visual attention of humans the attention mechanism has been applied in various fields with encouraging results liu and durlofsky 2020 nabati and behrad 2020 song et al 2017 few papers however have explored its potential value in the context of hydrologic forecasting chen et al 2020 ding et al 2019 in almost all previous works the attention mechanism has been used as a separate layer before or after the main layer e g the lstm layer we postulate that the incorporating of the attention mechanism into the structure of lstm cell could alleviate further improvement of lstm based architecture and simplify consistent implementation of the attention mechanism with lstm cell meanwhile the application of an improved lstm cell with such a mechanism is limited zheng and chen 2020 and to the best of our knowledge no researcher has used an attention based lstm variant in the field of hydrology to address the strong nonlinearity of hydrological processes rnn models like other dl models may have various vital hyperparameters which need to be optimized in order to improve the model s performance cheng et al 2019 ma et al 2019 this makes hyperparameter optimization a critical step ma et al 2020 as such this study uses bayesian optimization bo due to its higher efficiency compared to alternatives such as genetic algorithms he et al 2019 lin et al 2020 bo is more applicable when objective functions are computationally expensive to calculate feurer and hutter 2019 ju et al 2017 the main objective of this research is to develop and evaluate a novel attention based lstm called the self activated and internal attention saina lstm and compare its streamflow forecasting performance against that of enspost ms enspost and other machine learning gradient boosting and deep learning models gru and lstm and identify the one which best reduce uncertainty in hydrologic forecasts we use several deterministic measures to compare these models at different ranges of flow and for different forecast horizons as a part of this evaluation the following research questions are also addressed how well do the deep learning models can improve over the machine learning and statistical models in deterministic prediction of streamflow how do different models compare against one another at different ranges of flow and for different ranges of forecast how does the prediction errors is related to the hydroclimatology of the study area the fundamental contributions of this study can thus be summarized as follows 1 presenting a novel rnn model called saina lstm which incorporates an attention mechanism into the lstm cell 2 comparison of saina lstm with other deep learning lstm and gru machine learning gradient boosting and statistical enspost and ms enspost models 3 application of bayesian optimization for rnn hyperparameter selection in streamflow prediction 4 evaluation of the above models for a range of flow and lead times and in different hydroclimatological regimes this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present the study basins and data used in section 3 we describe the methods used for this research section 4 presents the results of comparative evaluation section 5 provides summary and recommendations for future research 2 study basins and data used this research considers model performance in four watersheds in different service areas of colorado basin cb california nevada cn middle atlantic ma and west gulf wg river forecast center the locations of the four study watersheds in their respective rfcs are shown in fig 1 these watersheds were among those examined in previous studies of enspost regonda and seo 2008 seo et al 2006 and ms enspost alizadeh et al 2020b and were chosen to reflect a range of hydroclimatological regimes general basin characteristics are illustrated in table 1 using three hydrological indices 1 mean annual precipitation 2 the aridity index i e the partitioning of precipitation into streamflow and evaporation budyko 1974 and 3 the snow fraction i e the fraction of precipitation which is solid phase these four watersheds are not significantly affected by reservoir operations alizadeh et al 2020b bswc2 located in the high elevations along the rocky mountain shows high snow fractions and experiences accumulation of snow in winter and a delayed contribution to soil moisture and recharge during springtime melt contributing to delayed streamflow responses berghuijs et al 2014 hunp1 which is located in the northeast tend to be humid and hence have low values of aridity index whereas nfdc1 and dcjt2 are generally semi arid to arid with extremely high aridity index in general it is expected that arid basins shown lower predictability of streamflow than humid basins while snow driven basins tend to show the highest predictability for training and testing the models the mean daily observed and simulated flow are used the historical observed mean daily flow is obtained from the united stated geological survey usgs since the focus of this research is to reduce hydrologic uncertainty the variable of interest is the simulated streamflow which reflects hydrologic uncertainty only rather than the streamflow forecast which reflects both meteorological and hydrologic uncertainties alizadeh 2019 the simulated mean daily flow was obtained from the nws and are derived from simulated instantaneous flows generated at 6 h intervals using two operational hydrologic models and observed precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration forcings alizadeh 2019 the hydrologic models used were the sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac sma burnash et al 1973 for cb cn and wgrfc and the continuous antecedent precipitation index model api cont fedora and beschta 1989 sittner et al 1969 for marfc the unit hydrograph chow et al 1988 and snow 17 anderson 1973 are used for surface runoff routing and snow accumulation and ablation respectively the period of record is chosen such that there are continuous data for the entire period without missing flow values table 2 presents general information about the data used for this research at different rfcs 3 materials and methods in this section the method and mathematical equations for the statistical machine learning and deep learning models are described first the regression equations for enspost and ms enspost are provided then the gb lstm and gru methods are described finally the attention based lstm model saina lstm is explained in detail 3 1 statistical methods 3 1 1 enspost the statistical prediction model in the enspost is based on the following recursive linear regression arx 1 1 in normal space as shown in eq 1 1 z k 1 o 1 b z k o bz k 1 s e k 1 where z k o and z k 1 o denote the observed flow in normal space at the current time and one step ahead respectively z k 1 s is the model predicted flow at time step k 1 in normal space and e k 1 denotes the random error at one step in the future in normal space while b denotes the weight given to the normalized model prediction for further details about the deterministic forecast of enspost readers are referred to seo et al 2006 3 1 2 ms enspost to address the significant drawbacks of enspost namely its high data requirements particularly for high flows and its poor performance in intermittent streams in semi arid and arid regions ms enspost provides a simpler and more parsimonious model which can solve several low dimensional regression equations instead of a single high dimensional one for that purpose a multiplicative bias correction factor β i is estimated at the daily scale and applied to the simulated flow at the i th day q i s as 2 β q i o q i s where q i o is the predicted flow valid at the i th day this bias correction procedure is designed to address the dependence of error magnitudes on different ranges of flow then to predict the observed flow the following linear model is applied for the predicted time aggregated observed flow 3 a k 1 p ω k a k 0 o 1 ω k a k 1 b k 1 m where a k 1 p and a k 1 b denote the observed and bias corrected simulated flows at the k th time scale respectively while subscript 1 signifies that the prediction is for a single time step ahead ω k denotes the optimal weight for the time aggregated observed flow at the k th scale a k 0 o where subscript 0 signifies the current time step further details about regression model can be found in alizadeh et al 2020b 3 2 machine learning method 3 2 1 gradient boosting gradient boosting gb friedman 2002 is one of the most popular ensemble machine learning models the intuition behind ensemble models is converting weak learner members into strong learners by aggregating the results of multiple predictors to eventually predict a class based on predictions of several individual backbone decision tree models liaw et al 2002 each backbone decision tree model partitions the data with regards to the main object based on if else rules gb trains many decision tree models in a gradual additive sequential manner in which the k th tree is trained from the first k 1 trees and updates the residual for the i th example of difference between prediction and target real value friedman 2002 gb uses gradients in the loss function to identify the weak learners decision tress and to optimize the loss function in gb the gini index or the entropy index are using for partitioning the data in regression or classification trees for more details refer to friedman 2002 machine learning models usually have tuning parameters i e hyperparameters parameter tuning means choosing the optimal values for the parameters and optimize them to reach the best performance gb input hyperparameters their tuning ranges and optimal values detected by grid search technique bergstra et al 2011 are listed in table 3 3 3 deep learning methods 3 3 1 recurrent neural network rnn in a typical ann architecture hidden cells of a layer are only connected to the next and previous layers and not to one another meaning that the information of a hidden cell cannot be transferred to adjacent hidden cells in the same layer this results in a less effective architecture for tasks such as translation and time series analysis in contrast to these architectures rnn applies a recurrent hidden unit which works as a self loop cycle and is responsible for transforming the information of the previous hidden cells to the next ones working as a memory unit the flow of information can thus be preserved leading to a more effective structure for the prediction of sequenced data elman 1990 liang et al 2018 lipton et al 2015 as shown in eq 4 the current hidden state h t is upgraded at each time step using information from both input data at the current time x t and previous cells in the pretext of the hidden state h t 1 4 h t f 1 w h x t u h h t 1 b h 5 y t f 2 w y h t b y where f 1 and f 2 represents activation functions w h w y and u h are weight matrices b h and b y are bias vectors and y t denotes the cell output at time t although the rnn architecture has proved to be a powerful tool for time series analysis it still has drawbacks in the case of long length dependency of input sequences the back propagation gradient flow of hidden states may exponentially converge to 0 or in rare cases explode to 1 leading to incorrect transfer of the previous hidden cells information this is known as the vanishing or exploding gradient problem 3 3 2 long short term memory lstm to overcome the vanishing gradient problem described in the previous section hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 developed a long short term memory structure by introducing a new hidden state called cell state c t which is responsible for tracking the current history of information in this structure three gates the forget input gers et al 1999 and output gates manage both the gradient flow of back propagation and long and short dependencies of information the structure of an lstm cell is depicted in fig 2 b the flow of information in a lstm cell can be described as following three steps initially and at the first step the forget gate controls the amount of information of earlier cell state c t 1 which can be added to the current cell state as f t c t 1 where the sign denotes the element wise multiplication operator the output of the gate is in the range 0 0 1 0 the value 0 0 indicates deletion of all the former information while unity means all the information is kept 6 f t σ w f x t u f h t 1 b f the next step calculates the current cell state which itself includes three phases in the first phase the values of x t and h t 1 convert to values between 1 and 1 using a hyperbolic tangent tanh activation function to get a new cell state candidate c t at time t 7 c t tanh w c x t u c h t 1 b c in the second phase c t is updated using values from the input gate as i t c t which works similarly to the forget gate the input gate controls the amount of both information from the previous hidden state and the input data sequence at the current time t which should be written to the cell state 8 i t σ w i x t u i h t 1 b i in the last phase the updated values from previous phases are added to the earlier updated cell state from the first step 9 c t f t c t 1 i t c t t finally in the last step the output gate controls how much information from the new cell state should pass as both the output of current lstm memory cell and the new hidden state to the next cell 10 o t σ w o x t u o h t 1 b o 11 h t o tanh c t in the above equations f t i t o t represent the outputs of forget input and output gates at time t respectively c t and c t 1 are the current and previous cell states respectively while h t 1 denotes output of the unit at time t 1 and x t is the input of the current lstm cell w u and b represent network weight matrices and bias vector and σ is the sigmoid function 3 3 3 gated recurrent unit gru to expedite the running process gru networks were proposed as a simpler structure compared to lstm cho et al 2014 as a variant of the lstm cell the gru cell is similar in terms of its application and its ability to monitor the basic rnn cell gradient problem of vanishing exploding grus meanwhile are simpler to implement since unlike lstm cell they have only two control gates reset r t and update z t and the hidden state and cell state are merged together the purpose of the update gate z t is to regulate how much information from the previous time step state h t 1 will be stored in the current time step the reset gate r t in which the previous hidden state and new inputs are combined manages the amount of information that is brought into the current candidate set h t by the previous state the structure of the gru cell is shown in fig 2 c the gru equations are expressed as 12 r t σ w r x t u r h t 1 b r 13 z t σ w z x t u z h t 1 b z 14 h t tanh w c x t u c r c h t 1 b c 15 h t 1 z t h t 1 z t h t where r t and z t denotes the output of reset and update gates at time t and h t and h t 1 are unit outputs the at time t and t 1 respectively x t represents the input of the lstm cell at time t w u and b are network weight matrices and bias vector of the network sign is element wise multiplication operator and σ represents the sigmoid function 3 3 4 attention based lstm cell one possible approach to improve ability of lstm for capturing high nonlinearity is to use an attention mechanism which assigns attention scores to each observed value allowing the consideration of the interdependency of streamflow sequences at various time steps pei et al 2017 in this study we integrate an improved self attention mechanism into the inner structure of the lstm cell presenting an attention based lstm cell to be both simple in implementation and effective in addressing higher nonlinearity in streamflow data we first give a brief description of the general attention and self attention structures then we describe the architecture of our new lstm cell called saina lstm in detail 3 3 4 1 attention mechanism given a query and a set of key value pairs attention can be described as computation of a weighted sum of the values based on the query and the related keys the query q key k and value v are matrices and the query ascertains which values to attend on 16 a q k v i exp e qk j j exp e qk j v j where e qk j is an alignment model which can be computed using the basic dot product attention function 17 e qk j qk t r where d k d q and the two terms denote the dimensions of the k and q matrices respectively dot product attention is faster and more space efficient in practice than additive attention since it can be implemented using a highly optimized matrix multiplication code vaswani et al 2017 3 3 4 2 self attention mechanism self attention as a special type of attention is the mechanism of relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the same sequence bahdanau et al 2014 vaswani et al 2017 applied a self attention mechanism called scaled dot product attention in their transformer model this can be written as 18 a q k v softmax qk t d k v this attention is identical to dot product attention except for scaling factor 1 d k the logic behind this scaling is to inhibit the softmax function from going to regions with small gradient values when d k is large 3 3 4 3 saina lstm cell in this study we modify the scaled dot product attention as follows given the input matrix i the proposed attention mechanism can be formulated as 19 i i 1 i 2 i h t h 20 q t a sigmoid iw q h a 21 k t a tanh iw k h a 22 s t t softmax sigmoid qk t 23 o t h i s t where w q and w k are trainable weights q and k are the query and key matrices respectively s is the attention score matrix and o is the output or in other words the attended input matrix denotes the element wise hadamard multiplication operator the indices of t h and a represent the dimension of matrices and are the given values for time step length hidden unit dimension and the second dimension of q and k respectively which all are hyperparameter values and need to be optimized the salient point is that the o matrix needs to have identical dimensions as i to ensure this we consider some adjustments to the scaled dot product attention first we use i directly as the value matrix with no prior multiplication by a weight matrix secondly in contrast to scaled dot product attention we use the element wise product to compute o according to eq 23 we also exclude the scaling factor 1 d k since the multiplication of t and a and consequently the value of d k is usually not large we observed that applying the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions prior to calculating q k and s can lead to smaller training and validation errors experimentally we suspect that the sigmoid function can give functionality similar to the input gate i t and the hyperbolic tangent function can provide a better calibration for the output values it should also be noted that i s t is a three dimensional matrix of t t h which by summing the values in matching positions for the second and third dimensions yields a two dimensional matrix of t h we use the summation function as it is faster in processing than the mean product maximum and minimum functions in practice in the final stage we integrate the developed attention unit into the lstm cell after several experiments we observed that feeding the candidate cell state to the developed attention unit before feeding it to the input gate i t can improve the general performance of cell since we have incorporated an activated self attention mechanism into the structure of lstm cell we call the developed cell self activated internal attention lstm cell or saina lstm its complete mechanism is shown in fig 3 it is worth mentioning that by modifying the inner information flow of the lstm cell the gradient stream of the cell changes and subsequently one needs to rederive the gradient in this study the cell gradient is calculated automatically by using a custom class in the tensorflow library abadi et al 2016 3 3 5 deep learning hyperparameter tuning despite the growing popularity of deep learning methods for hydrologic prediction experimental trial and error methods are used frequently to optimize model hyperparameters gao et al 2020 nguyen 2020 zuo et al 2020 however these procedures are slow since the optimal combinations cannot be attained quickly and they do not consider the mixed effects of hyperparameters sameen et al 2020 some studies also use limited parameter sets or recommended values lv et al 2020 yin et al 2020 this is very problematic particularly for studies that attempt to evaluate the performance of different models since such practices cannot provide fair comparisons another common method is grid search fang et al 2020 which can be computationally expensive when the number of hyperparameters and their corresponding search space is large this study proposes the implementation of bayesian optimization which has shown the capability of acquiring satisfactory results with fewer iterations compared to traditional optimization algorithms he et al 2019 though frequently used in other areas of research few studies have evaluated bo s application for streamflow prediction and to our knowledge no researcher has combined lstm and bo for that application the procedure of bo is described generally given a black box function we are to find the global maximum 24 x argmax f x x a where x is the optimal set of parameters and a r d is the candidate space having n pairs of inputs and observations x i y i i 1 2 n we are intended to select x n 1 in a way that y n 1 is maximized bo can answer this using bayes conditional probability rule taking the previous iteration s result into account to choose values for the next iteration the steps of bo can be described as below a establishing a probabilistic surrogate model which commonly is based on the gaussian process gp a gp is an extension of a multivariate gaussian distribution to an infinitely dimensional stochastic process in which any finite linear combination of dimensions has a joint gaussian distribution brochu et al 2010 as a distribution over functions a gp can be specified by its mean function m and covariance matrix function k respectively as follows 25 f gp m k consequently the gp can be modified and applied to get the prior distribution based on accumulated observations b applying an acquisition function to determine the next observation location where the observation property is expected to be the best the principal goal of using an acquisition function is to avoid attaining local optima by having a tradeoff between exploration areas in which the objective function is very ambiguous and exploitation areas at which the objective function is expected to be optimal cheng et al 2019 in this study we applied the expected improvement ei acquisition function which selects points that are expected to have an enhancement over the present best observation we assume that the current optimum is at x where acquisition function f x reaches its maximum the new query point can be obtained by the expected improvement as shown in eq 26 26 x argmax e max 0 f t 1 x f x d t where the expectation is taken over y t 1 which is itself distributed as the posterior objective value at x t 1 using a gp the analytic expression of ei can be derived 27 ei x μ x f x φ z σ x ϕ z if σ x 0 0 if σ x 0 28 z μ x f x σ x where φ and ϕ are the cumulative distribution function cdf and probability density function pdf of a standard normal distribution and μ x and σ x are the prediction expectation and variance respectively c stop if the new set of parameters satisfies the termination conditions else return to step a and repeat the process 3 3 6 framework of deep learning models the flowchart of saina lstm models is depicted in fig 4 bo is initially run for 100 iterations to find shared values of parameters among the best results to decrease the search space then for each lead time 30 additional bo iterations are used to find the final parameter set the mentioned values for each iteration number have been selected experimentally optimized parameters and their corresponding search spaces are given in table 4 also we use leave two years out cross validation to have independent validation of the prediction results generated from all of the models moreover we adopt a recursive pattern for performing the simulation from all models as shown in fig 5 in order to improve short range 1 to 3 days ahead and medium range 4 to 7 days ahead prediction accuracy similar framework can be applied for lstm and gru models since deep learning models are stochastic algorithms and the outputs from iterations in the model can be different we ran the model three times and selected the results that produce the lowest evaluation error for the validation data 3 4 evaluation metrics the purpose of postprocessing is to create streamflow predictions which are better than the raw i e unprocessed hydrological simulations for this purpose we evaluate the performance of six models and compare them against each other as well as against the raw simulated flow using leave two years out cross validation several metrics are used to evaluate the predictions for different lead times since the accurate and reliable prediction is mainly important for during high flow events these metrics are also evaluated specifically for high flows the primary accuracy measure for a deterministic forecast is the root mean square error rmse 29 rmse k 1 n k i 1 n k q i p k q i o k 2 where q i p k denotes the i th day k prediction of daily flow q i o k denotes the observed daily flow and n k denotes the total number of day k daily flow predictions compared with metrics such as mean absolute error mae rmse penalizes large errors which is desirable for high flow forecasts the mean error me is another measure which is used to evaluate the performance of different models 30 me k 1 n k i 1 n k q i p k q i o k me can also provide beneficial information about the overall bias of the models and whether the model over or under predicts at different lead times and with different flow values unlike rmse which gives a relatively high weight to large errors mean absolute error mae which is a linear statistical measure is more applicable when the overall impact of errors is proportionate to the increase in error mae can be formulated as 31 mae k 1 n k i 1 n k q i p k q i o k another widely used measure to quantify hydrologic prediction error is the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 32 nse 1 i 1 n k q i p k q i o k 2 i 1 n k q o k q i o k 2 where q o k denotes the mean of day k observed daily flow nse assesses the predictive power of the model and ranges between and 1 an nse of 1 corresponds to a perfect forecast by the model whereas an nse of zero indicates that the model prediction performs equally well as the observed mean thus any value between 0 and 1 indicates predictive skill in addition to these error metrics scatter plots of observed vs predicted flow for all models are compared and the cumulative distribution functions cdf of the observed raw model simulated and postprocessed flows are also described 4 results and discussion the rmse of six postprocessing models and the raw i e not postprocessed hydrologic simulations are compared in fig 6 in bswc2 which is a snow driven basin with high snow fraction and aridity index table 1 and generally has low flow values due to its snowy nature the deep learning models clearly outperform the statistical and machine learning models for 1 to 7 day ahead forecasts fig 6a the machine learning model gb outperforms the statistical model for lead times up to five days beyond which it is similar for nfdc1 located in semi arid california with moderate snow fraction due to its high elevation and relatively high aridity index saina lstm shows the best results for all lead times the other two deep learning model also show similar results for one day forecasts the other models show relatively comparable errors at different forecast horizons for hunp1 which is a large subwatershed of the juniata river basin in pennsylvania with low snow fraction and aridity the three deep learning models substantially outperform the machine learning and statistical models ms enspost is comparable to the raw model simulations while gb and enspost are clearly inferior to other models dcjt2 on the other hand is a flashy basin located in the semi arid area of texas with zero snow and high aridity of the four basins dcjt2 poses the biggest prediction challenge due to its intermittent behavior particularly during the summer as mentioned earlier enspost struggles with intermittent flow regimes which is clear for dcjt2 gb predictions are also poor ms enspost on the other hand is successfully able to deal with zero values in the streamflow most notable however is the clear superiority of saina lstm at all forecast times fig 7 shows similar results but focuses on rmse of predicted flows only if the observed flow exceeds the 90th percentile the rmse results for high flows generally follow similar patterns to what has already been described for all flows saina lstm shows the best prediction in general for all forecast lead times gru and lstm also perform relatively well for short range forecasts while gb performs relatively poorly enspost performs better for high flows compared to its performance for the entire range of flow this indicates the limited capability of enspost to perform well in low flow prediction particularly in ephemeral basins where considerable zero flows exist e g during the summer the mean error results are compared in fig 8 to find out the bias in the streamflow prediction by each model in addition to rmse showing the me statistics can provide additional information regarding the overall tendency of the model to overpredict or underpredict at different lead times in this figure the horizontal light gray line indicates an me of zero it can be seen from all four basins that enspost shows the highest me large me values for hunp1 and dcjt2 indicates the highly overprediction by enspost this can also indicate the considerable number of low flows in these basins for short lead times other five models show comparable results but it seems interesting that the results from saina lstm indicate its slight underprediction for these four basins at longer forecast ranges the comparison of mae for different basins shows the improved prediction capability by deep learning models particularly for short term forecasts these results also demonstrate the ability of these nonlinear models to reduce the mae compared to statistical models i e enspost and ms enspost fig 9 nse for snow dominated bswc2 approach the perfect value of 1 0 for the 1 day ahead forecast fig 10 the three deep learning models outperform the machine learning and statistical models in nfdc1 saina lstm shows the best nse performance for 1 to 6 day ahead forecasts while enspost and gb shows the worst for hunp1 saina lstm performs best for the 1 day ahead forecast while gb shows consistently high nse for all lead times the two statistical models show the least accurate results for this basin though the low nse values for dcjt2 highlight the difficulty in prediction in ephemeral and flashy rivers the better predictive power of saina lstm in this basin is clear the other two deep learning models gru and lstm also show relatively high nses for short term prediction scatter plots of predicted streamflows from all six models against the corresponding observed flows for 1 day ahead prediction are shown in fig 11 the thick line close to the diagonal also shows the quantile quantile result for bswc2 fig 11a gb exhibits substantial scatter while there is systematic underprediction of low flows in enspost the other four models produce less scatter for nfdc1 fig 11b gb again shows substantial scatter particularly for medium flows 30th to 60th percentile flow corresponding to high errors shown in fig 6b the quantile quantile line for saina lstm closely aligns with the diagonal for medium and high flows the results for hunp1 fig 11c show systematic biases in enspost particularly for low flows and also shows clear discontinuities due to the stratification of flows during parameter estimation seo et al 2006 the three deep learning models show strong results for all ranges of flow particularly for very high flows however gru shows slight overprediction in medium flow conditions compared with the lstm models the scatter plots for dcjt2 fig 11d clearly show the potency of dl models to predict for intermittent basins in arid regions where there might exist consecutive zero values of flow for long periods enspost shows poor prediction for all ranges of flow in dcjt2 particularly for low flows while ms enspost outperforms enspost it still struggles with high flows as can be seen from the quantile quantile plot at large flows substantial scatter also exists in gb predictions in this basin the deep learning models provide more promising results at all ranges with saina lstm performing best at high flows to check the ability of each model to capture the flow distribution in dcjt2 the cdfs of predicted flows are also examined fig 12 also shown in the lower right corner of the figure is a magnification of the upper tail of the distribution the blue curve shows the cdf of the observed flow while the red curve shows that of the raw simulated flow this figure signifies the difference between statistical models and nonlinear models and the potency of nonlinear models in capturing the distribution of the observed flow in semi arid basin of dcjt2 similar plots for other basins show less clear differences among the corresponding flow time series and are not included in the text to better visualize the time series of observed vs predicted flow from each model the two hydrographs are included as an example in fig 13 for 7 day ahead forecast in bswc2 for a period of one year these hydrographs show mismatch between the observed and predicted flow from enspost however other five models are able to generate more accurate prediction in terms of both timing and peak in the hydrograph among six models saina lstm is the best to capture the peak which proves its capability in streamflow prediction 5 summary and future research recommendations the deterministic performance of the gb machine learning technique and three deep learning techniques gru lstm and saina lstm is compared against that of the national weather service s operational streamflow postprocessor enspost and the ms enspost multi scale post processor for postprocessing streamflow forecast simulations in four basins across the united states of these models saina lstm which uses a self attention based lstm cell is introduced here for the first time comparison of the six models indicates that saina lstm generally outperforms the other approaches particularly in an arid intermittent and flashy river in northern texas saina lstm is able to reduce rmse for 1 day ahead forecasts for the bswc2 nfdc1 hunp1 and dcjt2 basins by 20 4 19 and 8 percent respectively compared with ms enspost the gru and lstm models generally outperform ms enspost particularly for 1 day ahead forecasts while their performance at longer lead times are comparable scatter plots of predicted flow vs verifying observed flow show large biases for enspost particularly for low flows these plots also show relatively high scatter in the gb model although this study presents a deterministic evaluation for four basins a more comprehensive study using both deterministic and probabilistic evaluation metrics is needed this will be consequential to assess the predictability of machine learning and deep learning models the promising results generated by saina lstm for deterministic forecasts is a motivation for extending this work to also cover ensemble forecasting using the novel model developed in this work to further develop this model the authors suggest using preprocessing techniques such as mode decomposition as well finally while this study presents the potential of newly developed nonlinear deep learning models for streamflow forecast postprocessing the required effort to operationalize these methods requires further research as well

4324,climate change affects the growth of vegetation and its physiological states such as leaf area index lai which in turn can affect groundwater recharge because of changes in evapotranspiration et presently most recharge modeling studies over simplify transient vegetation conditions and the potential corresponding impact on recharge by using climatological values of vegetation parameters such as lai our study uses the community land model clmv4 5 to investigate the sensitivity of recharge to interannual varying vegetation in minnesota usa across different climate hydrogeology and ecoregions at a 25 km spatial resolution and for the period of 2000 2015 the ensemble kalman filter enkf was used to calibrate soil and runoff parameters to statewide water table depth observations results of the study indicate that although year to year varying vegetation does not affect long term climatological recharge estimates it can drive disproportionately large variability in annual and seasonal recharge comparing simulations with dynamic and climatological vegetation inputs the average magnitude difference root mean square difference rmsd for recharge was 21 1 in response to only a 4 difference in lai inputs regression analysis revealed that the combination of local hydrogeology and vegetation type affects the magnitude of recharge response to lai and et changes we also found cross ecoregion dominance of temperature rather than precipitation controlling lai anomalies and resulting recharge variability with springtime temperature being the primary factor because of its impact on leaf out conditions drier western minnesota showed higher relative lai differences as well as higher spring time and relative annual recharge compared to the wetter eastern part of the state indicating higher vulnerability of the water limited region to changing vegetation and climatic conditions our study shows that models can underestimate or overestimate annual and seasonal recharge if vegetation dynamics are neglected demonstrating the need to incorporate transient vegetation conditions when assessing the impact of future climate change on recharge keywords groundwater recharge dynamic vegetation data assimilation ensemble kalman filter ecohydrology 1 introduction vegetation interacts with the water cycle in multiple ways rodriguez iturbe 2000 leaves intercept precipitation before it either evaporates from the canopy surface or moves to the ground and infiltrates plant litter also alters the water retention and infiltration properties of the soil however the most important link in terms of water balance is usually the effect of vegetation on soil moisture through transpiration arora 2002 through these processes vegetation directly influences the amount of water that percolates past the root zone and recharges the water table in particular plant physiological properties such as amount of leaves and root distribution control the amount of water being intercepted and or transpired le maitre et al 1999 thus any changes in these plant physiological properties have the potential to induce changes in hydrological processes including groundwater recharge in hydrological or land surface models vegetation parameters usually include leaf area index lai which is the ratio of the one sided leaf area to the underlying ground area lai serves as a key functional plant trait because it controls the magnitude of important ecohydrological fluxes such as transpiration canopy evaporation and photosynthesis asner et al 2003 zheng and moskal 2009 bondeau et al 1999 as such most models calculate these fluxes on the gridcell scale through scaling by lai values lai is commonly specified in the model using repeated climatological monthly values this representation of lai neglects the response of vegetation to interannual variability in climatic factors arora 2002 fatichi et al 2015 in reality changes in environmental conditions such as shifts in temperature and precipitation may influence the growth of vegetation jeong et al 2011 gunderson et al 2012 for example an earlier or a warmer spring might lead to an early bud burst in plants while an extended period of moisture stress may hinder growth seasonal and annual changes in vegetation in turn have the potential to affect hydrologic processes at various temporal or spatial scales there have been previous studies that have investigated the impact of dynamic vegetation on different components of the water cycle apart from recharge using physically based hydrologic or land surface models with a focus on runoff zhang et al 2009 and tesemma 2015 included transient lai in their model simulations and found significant improvement in the runoff estimate when compared to model simulations with climatological vegetation looking at the impact on evapotranspiration et and soil moisture tang et al 2012 and vivoni 2012 found that substantial year to year variability in vegetation greening onset and dormancy dates generate significant differences in et simulations compared to results using climatological lai ford and quiring 2013 showed that adding dynamic lai improved simulated soil moisture and predictions of the intensity and duration of drought conditions hwang et al 2018 analyzed precipitation runoff deficits i e the difference between precipitation and runoff and concluded that the long term non stationary hydrologic behavior could not be simulated unless full vegetation dynamics including vegetation phenology and long term growth were incorporated into the model these studies provide strong evidence of the influence of dynamic vegetation on important hydrologic components et runoff soil moisture and prompts questions whether similar interactions between vegetation and recharge occur very few studies have specifically addressed the influence of dynamic lai on groundwater recharge wegehenkel 2009 despite the importance of recharge in determining groundwater resource availability however previous work has established the general sensitivity of groundwater to vegetation although early seminal work in ecohydrology eagleson 1978 rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 porporato et al 2001 fernandez illescas et al 2001 did not explicitly consider this connection in their focus on dryland regions where deep water tables are largely disconnected from root zone soil moisture tight coupling has long been recognized in humid lands and wetlands in field based observations peck and williamson 1987 chang 2012 and more recently in model based studies laio et al 2009 loheide and gorelick 2007 the influence of vegetation on recharge has been more widely demonstrated across diverse environments across the globe through studies investigating land use land cover effects lu lc on recharge including both spatial variability and temporal shifts in lu lc scanlon et al 2006 petheram et al 2002 kim and jackson 2012 these lu lc studies however focused on changes in vegetation type and did not consider the dynamic growth variations within a vegetation type the impact of more subtle vegetation growth variations on groundwater recharge without vegetation type change has received less attention this serves a critical knowledge gap because climate change is predicted to alter plant phenology and leaf carbon stocks xu et al 2013 loheide and gorelick 2013 zhu et al 2016 wu et al 2015 and these changes directly impact et and subsequently influence the amount of water that is available to recharge the water table most work on the impact of climate change on recharge included yearly repeated climatological inputs for vegetation parameters e g jyrkama and sykes 2007 döll 2009 ng et al 2010 hanson and dettinger 2005 bouraoui et al 1999 herrera pantoja and hiscock 2007 chen et al 2002 croley and luukkonen 2003 kirshen 2002 and thus fail to account for vegetation responses that can drive feedbacks among climate vegetation and water taylor et al 2012 mao et al 2016 a smaller number of climate change studies eckhardt and ulbrich 2003 green et al 2007 crosbie et al 2010 wegehenkel 2009 have included dynamic representations of vegetation including transient lai in their predictions of recharge although these recent studies reflect growing recognition of vegetation dynamics none with the exception of wegehenkel 2009 conducted an assessment of the impact of dynamic vegetation on recharge predictions in their analysis of a catchment in northeastern germany over 1950 2100 wegehenkel 2009 first executed two reference simulations using climatological and dynamic vegetation for 1950 1966 and then compared those with future projections over 2078 2094 again with the two vegetation scenarios they found that cumulative groundwater recharge showed a decrease of 9 from the reference to the future period when using dynamic vegetation compared to a decrease of 22 when using climatological vegetation they attributed this difference to feedbacks among transpiration soil water availability and crop growth in the case with dynamic vegetation findings from this case study motivates further work to quantify the effect of climatically driven vegetation dynamics on recharge across climates and plant types a fuller understanding of the interactions among climate vegetation and groundwater can help to determine the complexity needed for representing vegetation in future climate change assessments of groundwater resources obstacles to understanding the influence of dynamic vegetation on recharge include uncertainties in constraining their interactions outside of regions where roots are directly in contact with groundwater e g outside of wetlands and riparian zones although recent advances have led to more mechanistic representation of processes spanning the canopy to the deeper subsurface clark et al 2015 challenges remain in calibrating such models to reliably simulate processes across the entire soil column where soil properties are typically uncertain our study tackles this obstacle by implementing an efficient data assimilation method to calibrate regional land surface model simulations of recharge which enables us to address knowledge gaps about the influence of dynamic lai on groundwater recharge this modeling work is carried out using dynamic remotely sensed lai observations across the state of minnesota usa the state s precipitation and temperature gradients and its varied ecoregions that include prairie cropland deciduous forest evergreen forest and mixed forest provide an apt testbed to evaluate the impact of spatiotemporal variability in vegetation on groundwater recharge across a range of conditions specifically we address the following questions using minnesota as a test case i how has groundwater recharge over seasonal to multi year time scales responded to interannual changes in lai in different ecoregions ii what has been the relative importance of different climatic factors in driving interannual vegetation dynamics that influence groundwater recharge answers to these questions can help guide future predictions about climate change impacts on groundwater recharge across diverse continental ecoregions 2 methods 2 1 study area minnesota experiences a continental climate with hot summers and cold winters it has a distinct precipitation gradient with an average annual precipitation of about 89 cm in the southeast that gradually reduces to about 50 cm in the northwest fig 1 a about two thirds of the precipitation in the state occurs during may to september the us environmental pollution agency epa divides minnesota into five major ecological provinces or ecoregions fig 1b white 2020 we will refer to the first of these ecoregions as great plains gp in the west and southwestern part of the state these were once covered with tallgrass prairie but now over 75 of the area is cropland we further subdivided gp into northern great plains ngp and southern great plains sgp on the basis of soil texture both ngp and sgp are composed of glacial till but glacial lake agassiz in the last glacial period deposited thick beds of lake sediment on top of glacial till in the north ngp is also distinct with its lower crop cover and smaller statured boreal forests the central hardwood forests chf ecoregion extending from the southeastern to northwestern part of minnesota consists of temperate deciduous forests along with extensive cropland pasture and dairy operations the northern forests nf ecoregion occupying the northern and northeastern part of the state is a region of mixed coniferous and deciduous temperate forests conifer bogs and broad lacustrine basins the northern wetlands province consist of vast stretches of peat soil on former lake beds with some forest and several eroded river channels the driftless area province in the southeast is a karst dominated region characterized by forested ridges and carved river valleys because of the limitations of common hydrological and land surface models in reliably simulating groundwater recharge in the complex systems of wetlands and karst regions ringeval et al 2012 hartmann et al 2017 we focus our ecoregion specific analyses on the four regions of ngp sgp chf and nf key characteristics summarized in table 1 list of abbreviations in table 4 2 2 model description we used the community land model clm v4 5 oleson et al 2013 for our assessment of dynamic vegetation controls on groundwater recharge clm is a spatially distributed mechanistic land surface model that serves as the terrestrial component of the national center for atmospheric research s ncar larger community earth system model cesm hurrell et al 2013 clmv4 5 has process based representations of land surface biogeophysics biogeochemistry hydrology and vegetation oleson et al 2013 because its domain spans the land surface to unconfined aquifers clm is suitable for evaluating climate and vegetation controls on recharge to surficial aquifers clm lacks representation of deeper subsurface units and applies an approximate solution for lateral subsurface flow described below we consider the omission of a more detailed lateral subsurface flow scheme to be an acceptable approximation considering our target modeling resolution of 25 km for this regional scale application accurate simulation of lateral groundwater flow requires a higher spatial resolution due to its dependence on gravity and local topographic factors zeng et al 2018 moreover minnesota has a relatively low relief topography minimum of 183 m a s l and maximum of 701 m a s l over 225 181 km2 that likely reduces the consequences of simplifying lateral groundwater movement the default representation of vegetation in clm uses satellite based monthly climatological lai obtained from gridded datasets we refer to this climatological satellite vegetation configuration as clmcs over the last decade several land surface models including clm have added process based modules to simulate plant carbon and nitrogen stocks as well as lai as prognostic variables there has also been progress in developing dynamic global vegetation models dgvm within land surface models that can predict shifts in vegetation types over space and time i e transient pfts e g druel et al 2017 clark et al 2011 levis et al 2004 fisher et al 2017 although clm incorporates optional modes for both these capabilities clm biogeochemical clm bgc and clm dgvm we instead modified the general clm code to directly take as inputs spatiotemporally dynamic lai from satellite observations this strategy has the advantage over the bgc mode of avoiding uncertainties in prognostic plant variable simulations which depend on a large number of vegetation parameters that substantially add to the computational load for model calibration because the model integrates over multiple plant functional types pfts within a grid cell to simulate total transpiration and other vegetation fluxes we developed a scheme to convert satellite observed total lai into pft level lai based on the disaggregation in the default climatological clm dataset 1 lai i sat tlai sat lai i clm def tlai clm def where lai i and tlai are pft level lai for the ith pft out of a total of 15 pfts represented in clm and total lai respectively sat denotes lai observed from satellite and clm def indicates the default clm dataset that is provided with the model our scheme assumes that the default clm spatial distributions of pft cover applies for our disaggregation calculation ecoregion averages of percent cover of each pft are included in table 1 full spatial distribution shown in fig s9 in supplementary information clm s default climatological lai tlai clm def and pft cover dataset is a spatially distributed product at a base resolution of 0 05 and is derived from modis satellite data over the years 2001 2003 lawrence and chase 2007 this time period for the default clm dataset overlaps with the early part of our simulation period 2000 2015 and we consider the default clm pft distribution to reasonably apply over later years as well given that more recent land cover datasets have not shown substantial changes in minnesota see supplementary information section s1 1 we refer to our modified implementation with dynamic satellite vegetation as clmds the hydrological component of the model includes an upper soil column that is discretized into 10 computational layers extending from the ground surface to about 3 8 m depth with the thicknesses of each layer increasing exponentially with depth boundary conditions for the upper soil column include simulations of surface runoff canopy and ground evaporation infiltration flux to and from a deeper unconfined aquifer layer when the water table is positioned below the upper soil column and subsurface drainage when the water table is positioned within the upper soil column for calculating the dynamic soil water content of each computational layer within the upper soil column clm uses a modified form of the 1d vertical richards equation zeng and decker 2009 2 θ t z k ψ ψ e z q where θ is the volumetric soil water content ψ is the soil matric potential ψ e is the equilibrium hydrostatic soil matric potential

clm based on soil texture percent sand and clay and organic matter content in each soil layer clapp and hornberger 1978 cosby et al 1984 lawrence and slater 2007 details about the pedotransfer function used in the model can be found in oleson et al 2013 determination of the water table depth and recharge is based on niu et al 2007 if the water table is within the upper soil column within 3 8 m depth recharge to the water table is calculated by applying darcy s law across the water table 3 q recharge k aq ψ ψ jwt z z jwt where ψ 0 is the matric potential at the water table at depth z subscript jwt denotes the index of the layer directly above the water table and k aq is the hydraulic conductivity of the layer containing the water table jwt 1 for the case when the water table is below the upper soil column below 3 8 m recharge is set to the potential recharge defined as the net flux of water across the lower boundary of the deepest explicit soil layer at 3 8 m depth because most of the major water table aquifers in minnesota are close to the surface within 3 m adams 2016 the approximation of potential recharge as actual recharge is needed for only certain parts of the state clm computes potential recharge by calculating the change in water content of an additional soil layer below the upper soil column 4 q recharge δ θ liq n 1 δ z n 1 δ t where δ θ liq n 1 θ n 1 t 1 θ n 1 t is the change in liquid water content in an additional lower layer layer n 1 from the bottom of the upper soil column to the water table over a model time step t to t 1 and δ z n 1 z z n is the difference between the water table depth z and the bottom of the upper soil column z n 3 8 m liquid water content of the lowest n 1 th layer is calculated using the modified form of richards equation as noted above in eq 2 assuming no vertical flux across the bottom of the layer the change in water table depth is calculated based on recharge and drainage 5 δ z q recharge q drai s y δ t where δ t is the model time step s y is specific yield calculated as s y θ sat 1 1 z ψ sat 1 b and q drai is the subsurface drainage defined as the flux of water out of the vertical soil column via lateral flux at the water table subsurface drainage is represented through a parameterization based on topographic statistics 6 q drai q drai max exp f drai z where f drai 2 5 m 1 is a decay factor parameter and q drai max 10 sin β kg m 2 s 1 is the maximum drainage when the water table is at the ground surface with β as the mean grid cell topographic slope in radians as noted previously we consider simulations in southeast minnesota to have higher uncertainty largely because this parameterization is likely insufficient for representing complex flows in karst regions the model was run for two scenarios at a spatial resolution of 25 km chosen for computational purposes using a 30 min time step over the 16 year period of 2000 to 2015 with a monthly model output frequency in the first scenario clmcs the default climatological monthly lai inputs were used in the second scenario clmds we replaced the default climatological lai with annually dynamic lai from the global land surface satellite glass xiao et al 2014 glass was derived by combining modis and avhrr satellite data on vegetation it has a temporal resolution of 8 days and is available globally starting from 1982 at 1 km spatial resolution this dataset has been validated in multiple studies and found to be in good agreement with observations fang et al 2019 the lai data was inputted to the model at its original temporal resolution of 8 day for meteorological data inputs we used daymet thornton et al 2014 for precipitation temperature and humidity as well as ncep narr meixner et al 2006 for wind speed and atmospheric pressure soil texture inputs were obtained from polaris chaney et al 2016 compared to the default clm global soil dataset polaris is a much newer product that was derived from a probabilistic remapping of ssurgo soil survey staff 2020 an observational database that specifically focuses on north america all input datasets were regridded to the 25x25 km computational grid details in supplementary information section s1 2 soil hydraulic parameters derived by clm pedotransfer functions from the soil texture inputs were further calibrated using water table depth observations from the minnesota department of natural resources s mndnr cooperative groundwater management cgm database www dnr state mn us waters cgm as described in the following section 2 3 model calibration with ensemble kalman filter as previously mentioned simulations of vegetation recharge coupling in clm can be highly uncertain due to poor constraints on soil properties over the entire unsaturated zone because clm is a complex nonlinear spatially distributed model that uses a large number of parameters to simulate ecohydrological processes model calibration is critical but also challenging to address this we used the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 to calibrate soil parameters by assimilating observations of dynamic water table depths to reduce uncertainty in recharge simulations we focused on subsurface parameter estimation because surface model inputs of climate and vegetation variables were considered to be relatively well known based on direct observations enkf was chosen for its flexible application with any model and observation type as well as its efficient handling of high dimensional models like clm water table depth time series were selected as the calibration data because changes in water table depth capture water movement over the entire overlying soil column enkf combines spatiotemporally resolved details from clm with depth integrated information from water table depth measurements in order to generate soil property estimates throughout the soil column we used water table data from 320 surficial wells within the cgm database locations shown in fig 2b water level depths shown in fig s1 in supplementary information that had repeat measurements ranging from monthly to annual frequency over the 2000 2015 simulation period the cgm database processing procedure includes periodic checks of automated water level measurements against manual measurements for accuracy pearson et al 2012 we further removed data points that showed unusually large one time jumps in water level more than 3 5 m within a month although water levels could be influenced by groundwater extractions we did not attempt to filter for affected wells global studies e g gleeson et al 2012 do not show minnesota aquifers to be experiencing any major regional groundwater overdraws and collecting local pumping information on a statewide scale was beyond the scope of this study 2 3 1 ensemble kalman filter enkf is a data assimilation method that merges information from imperfect models and uncertain observations in an optimal way to reduce and quantify uncertainty liu and gupta 2007 the kalman filter and its variants are widely used in the earth sciences carrassi et al 2018 liu and gupta 2007 reichle 2008 sun et al 2016 a sequence of assimilation cycles are carried out in enkf each of which consists of two steps forecast and update in the forecast step an n member ensemble of state variables are evolved forward in time through the model i e monte carlo runs with each member using a different perturbed parameter set and or including added state variable noise to represent model structural uncertainty the forecast step at timestep t can be represented as 7 x t f g x t 1 u p u t 1 b t ω t where x r n n is the ensemble of n dimensional state variables superscripts f and u respectively denote the forecast and updated variables g is the non linear model applied to each ensemble member p r p n is the ensemble of p dimensional parameter values b is the forcing at the boundaries and ω includes any additional model error terms in the update step when parameter estimates are desired an augmented state matrix ξ t r n p n is created in which p u t 1 is appended to x t the ensemble members are adjusted based on observations using the following equation 8 ξ t u ξ t f k y h ξ t f where the matrix y r m n contains a different perturbed vector of observations y r m in each column with y j y γ j j 1 n and γ j representing a random draw for a 0 mean observation error k is the kalman gain and h is the measurement operator that relates the model state to the observations the kalman gain is computed as follows 9 k p e f h t hp e f h t r e 1 where the model error covariance is calculated as p e f ξ t f ξ t f t n 1 with ξ t f r n p n containing replicates of the ensemble mean vector in each column and the observation error covariance matrix is calculated as r e β β t n 1 with β γ 1 γ 2 γ n r m n the updated model error covariance p e u ξ t u ξ t u ξ t u ξ t u t n 1 quantifies the uncertainty in the estimate at the end of the update step the updated states and parameters at time t are then used for the forecast step in the subsequent assimilation cycle for time t 1 2 3 2 implementation of enkf with clm sensitivity tests were carried out to identify the parameters most strongly controlling simulations of water table depth and groundwater recharge table 2 lists these parameters as well as the state variables that were estimated with enkf using water table depth observations enkf was initialized at the beginning of the simulation period using random parameter draws from prior uniform probability distributions with uncertainty ranges shown in table 2 the range for subsurface drainage and surface runoff parameters were specified based on past studies ray et al 2015 huang et al 2016 and test simulations uncertainty in polaris dataset was accounted for by applying depth correlated soil texture perturbations similar to ng et al 2009 for each soil layer the prior soil parameter range was then derived using the pedotransfer function of clm value range listed in table 2 based on the perturbed soil texture inputs perturbation range of 40 for soil texture table 2 was chosen based on preliminary tests that showed it to be appropriate for generating ensemble simulations that cover observed water table depths for our implementation with clm we applied several modifications to the standard enkf algorithm to improve its performance for simultaneous state and parameter estimation which can be prone to issues due to non linearities ng et al 2014 as detailed fully in supplementary information section s1 3 these include parameter perturbations moradkhani 2005 variance inflation anderson and anderson 1999 and update iterations liu and ng 2019 we set the observation error for water table depth to 0 45 m to represent not only measurement errors but also scale representation errors between a single well and the model gridcell preliminary tests showed that an ensemble size of 100 provided an appropriate balance between performance and computation cost the final set of ensemble parameter estimates from enkf were used to execute two separate sets of model runs clmcs using the climatological vegetation inputs and clmds using satellite based dynamic vegetation as the input the ensemble median of clmds simulations are taken as the final calibrated estimate with the full ensemble representing estimation uncertainty while clmcs simulations are used for comparison to evaluate the effect of dynamic vegetation 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance evaluation to evaluate the performance of the model calibration to water table depths we compared the simulated ensemble median water table depth and observed water table depth using the root mean square residual rmsr over the different observation times for 2000 2015 the spatially averaged mean rmsr improved by 51 to 1 27 m in the posterior run after calibration with enkf compared to the prior before calibration with enkf indicating a statewide improvement of clm outputs fig s3 in the supplementary information in a 5 year model validation run over 2016 2020 using the calibrated parameters the rmsr for water table depth remained low at 1 36 m fig s4 in supplementary information providing further confidence in our calibration results using the calibrated model over the study period of 2000 2015 simulations of recharge show a notable difference compared to the recharge results before calibration fig s5 in supplementary information demonstrating the effect of the constraint on water table observations the calibrated ensemble median recharge estimates with dynamic vegetation across minnesota at 25 km resolution averaged over the 2000 2015 simulation period ranged from less than 0 1 cm year 1 in the western part of the state to 26 4 cm year 1 in the east with a statewide average of 7 4 cm year 1 fig 2a this increasing west to east spatial trend agrees with past regional recharge studies delin et al 2007 smith and westenbroek 2015 and largely reflects the underlying precipitation pattern fig 1a the highest simulated recharge occurred in the central part of the state which is known to contain highly conductive glacially deposited sand plains in addition to moderately high precipitation smith and westenbroek 2015 mesinger et al 1993 we also found that recharge varies seasonally fig s2 in supplementary information with 82 of the annual statewide recharge occurring during spring april june and a smaller second period of recharge occurring during fall october and november recharge estimate uncertainty was quantified using the difference between the 75th and 25th percentile of the ensemble recharge simulations in fig 2b the 320 groundwater wells used for calibration data were unevenly distributed throughout the state with almost all in central northwestern and southwestern minnesota allowing for lower uncertainty in many of those areas fig 2b higher uncertainty in the recharge estimate in northeastern minnesota corresponds with where there is almost no water table depth data the high uncertainty in central minnesota is around the minneapolis st paul twin cities metropolitan area it is likely that uncertainties persist there despite the availability of water table depth observations because clm inadequately captures the effects of urbanization and management on groundwater which is the source of more than 70 of the municipal water used in the twin cities metro area twin cities metropolitan council 2007 our simulated statewide recharge estimates the ensemble median were generally lower 35 statewide than previous water balance based recharge estimates in minnesota smith and westenbroek 2015 because direct observations of recharge are lacking for validation we compared our estimates to available observation based data for other major hydrological fluxes specifically et and runoff evaluating et is particularly important for our study given the focus on vegetation our statewide average simulated et closely matched within 5 the et product from modis mod16 mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 and fell between two other et products that use satellite and flux tower measurements ssebop senay et al 2013 and gfet jung et al 2009 fig s6 in supplementary information generally locations with moderate to high et simulations better match the observation based et products compared to locations with low et simulations fig s7 in supplementary information we also compared ensemble median streamflow calculated as subsurface drainage plus surface runoff in clm simulations with measurements from 13 long term usgs stream gauges and found that the model captured overall observed spatial trends without any statewide bias fig s8 in supplementary information reasonable estimation of these major components of the water balance as well as water table depth gives confidence in the model s ability to satisfactorily simulate groundwater recharge and its links with vegetation dynamics although errors could persist in absolute groundwater recharge estimates from clm these likely become less important when we examine differences in recharge for dynamic versus climatological vegetation inputs 3 2 impacts of dynamic vegetation on recharge 3 2 1 statewide results below we used the ensemble medians of clmds and clmcs simulations to evaluate the impacts of dynamic vegetation on recharge as well as the influence of climatic drivers the statewide recharge simulated with dynamic satellite vegetation clmds was very similar to the result with climatological satellite vegetation clmcs 7 4 versus 7 1 cm yr this similarity indicates that across the state over the 16 year period times and locations with higher than average recharge with dynamic vegetation were mostly offset by other times and locations with lower than average recharge as such dynamic vegetation seems not to be important to consider for climatological studies of recharge however as reflected in the overall spatiotemporal correlation of 0 4 p value 0 05 between lai differences and simulated annual recharge differences for clmds versus clmcs higher lower than time averaged lai conditions can cause a decrease increase in recharge in certain years and locations correspondingly fig 3 a shows the occurrence of appreciable differences between recharge results with and without dynamic vegetation over the 16 year period here appreciable differences are defined as those years when the difference in recharge is at least 10 calculated relative to clmcs and the average annual recharge is at least 10 mm yr these criteria were set to detect cases in which recharge differences may be sufficiently large as to have water resource and ecological implications across different grid cells an average of 2 years out of the 16 year simulation period experienced appreciable differences in annual recharge simulations the drier northwest showed the greatest recharge sensitivity to dynamic vegetation with an average 12 out of 16 years showing appreciable differences to evaluate the size of recharge differences over the 16 years and to compare them to the underlying dynamic vegetation conditions we first calculated the time averaged recharge difference dr for each grid cell over the simulation period 10 d r t r t ds r t cs n where t is the time index for simulation year n 16 is the number of years simulated and r t is the simulated annual recharge at time t for the clmds or clmcs scenario even though average lai differences over the 16 years between the scenarios is zero because climatological vegetation is defined as the mean of the 16 year dynamic vegetation we found that a number of grid cells exhibit a sign bias in dr fig 3b ranging from 0 5 cm yr to 0 5 cm yr the notable non zero dr results in some grid cells indicate that cumulatively over the 16 year simulation period there can be an asymmetric impact on recharge by either higher or lower than average lai conditions resulting in respectively lower or higher overall recharge than expected with climatological vegetation conditions for example in fig 3b recharge in parts of northwestern and southern minnesota on average experienced higher recharge over the 16 years positive dr indicating greater influence by lower than average lai in contrast a number of locations in central and eastern minnesota with lower than expected recharge over the 16 years negative dr show greater sensitivity to above normal lai while dr magnitudes appeared heterogeneously distributed across the state in fig 3b recharge differences normalized by time averaged local recharge in fig 3c were highest in the western part of the state where recharge values are lowest fig 2a these differences ranged from a minimum of 68 to a maximum of 235 of average recharge for different grid cells indicating that dynamic vegetation can have a substantial relative impact on recharge over a 16 year period while fig 3b shows whether there is a tendency for higher or lower recharge to accumulate over the 16 years due to dynamic vegetation within a grid cell annual recharge in clmds likely falls both above and below what is expected with climatological vegetation over the 16 years to examine the magnitude of recharge and lai differences between the clmds and clmcs scenarios regardless of the sign we calculated the root mean square difference rmsd over the 16 year period i e 11 rmsd r t r t ds r t cs 2 n 12 rmsd l t l t ds l t cs 2 n where l t is the input lai at t for the clmds or clmcs scenario and we show non normalized and normalized results in figs 3d g by comparing fig 3b d and f it can be seen that locations with higher rmsdr and rmsdl often correspond to areas with greater positive or negative dr such as north western minnesota however it can also be seen that as expected because of both higher and lower recharge over the 16 years average recharge difference magnitudes rmsdr are generally much greater than average difference values dr over the 16 year simulation period compare values in figs 3 b and f spatially averaged over the state rmsdr and rmsdl normalized respectively by mean recharge and lai were 21 1 and 4 and for some parts of the state they respectively reached as high as 597 and 17 fig 3e and g the higher rmsd for recharge compared to lai demonstrates that year to year variability in vegetation growth may drive disproportionately high relative variability in recharge 3 2 2 ecoregion specific analysis the different major ecoregions of minnesota fig 1b may be expected to exhibit varying sensitivity of recharge to interannual changes in vegetation growth because of their differences in climate and plant type although recharge differences over the 16 years show substantial spatial variability between grid cells in fig 3b spatial coefficient of variations of 16 some alignment with ecoregions can be discerned for example it was previously noted that northwest minnesota corresponding to the ngp ecoregion shows greater frequency and magnitudes of recharge differences for clmds compared to clmcs fig 3a b f as well as greater normalized lai differences fig 3e ecoregion based trends become clearer when evaluating transient annual lai and recharge values in figs 4 and 5 rather than aggregating over the 16 year simulation period as was done for average differences and rmsd here we use d r a and da l to denote annual level differences in recharge and lai respectively between clmds and clmcs these are defined analogously to dr in eq 10 except that they are not averaged over time note that because lai inputs in clmcs are the long term average of lai inputs in clmds da l represents lai anomalies in each year differences from the temporal average in fig 4 we show da l normalized by the 16 year mean lai d l a where the tilde indicates normalization in the respective grid cell because normalized da l exhibits a stronger spatiotemporal correlation with d r a across the state compared to non normalized d r a 0 47 versus 0 4 the stronger correlation likely occurs because the normalization accounts for the underlying diversity in lai due to plant type see fig s9 in supplementary information for pft information clearest ecoregion trends can be seen in d l a in fig 4 for which ecoregion is a statistically significant predictor in nearly half the years using a simple regression test p value 0 05 for example fig 4 shows significant regional greening positive d l a occurred in chf in 2002 and moderate regional greening occurred in nf in 2008 these results suggest that even though some years experienced similar d l a across the state such as 2013 and 2014 lai variability is often influenced by ecoregion based conditions the corresponding recharge differences between clmds and clmcs in fig 5 show considerably more spatial heterogeneity than lai anomalies as seen in the variable results among neighboring grid cells with similar lai anomalies a regression test revealed that ecoregion was not a significant predictor for recharge differences for any of the 16 years p value 0 05 however a negative response of recharge to the lai differences can still be gleaned through strong statistically significant temporal correlations between d l a and d r a of 0 68 to 0 85 for the different ecoregions fig 6 a this relationship can be seen for example in the uniformly low lai years of 2013 or 2014 when recharge was generally higher than expected with climatological vegetation in all four ecoregions as well as in 2002 and 2008 when regional greening corresponded with mostly reduced recharge fig 5 as a result some correspondence between ecoregion and recharge differences does appear based on underlying ecoregion controls on lai anomalies in fig 7a b boxplots of d l s and ds r summarize how much lai and corresponding recharge differences vary across the 16 years for each ecoregion superscript s here denotes seasonal average by further breaking these results down by season we note that lai anomalies not only differ by ecoregion but they also vary within a year fig 7a winter december march is omitted from our discussion because lai anomalies and corresponding recharge differences between clmds and clmcs are very small during that season it can be seen that the greatest normalized differences positive and negative between dynamic and climatological lai occur in the spring april june for all ecoregions except nf the large spring time variability in ngp sgp and chf reflects the year to year differences in leaf out or crop dates in nf where there are substantial evergreen forests table 1 spring time lai anomalies are smaller and more similar to other times of the year fall october and november shows the second largest lai differences between clmds and clmcs due to year to year differences in senescence timing especially in ngp sgp and chf the spring dominated seasonal pattern in normalized lai differences is translated to spring dominated recharge differences in ngp sgp and chf fig 7b this is also reflected in the correlations between d l s and ds r parsed out by season which show that recharge is most consistently sensitive to lai anomalies in the spring correlations of 0 80 to 0 92 across ecoregions fig 6b in springtime both ds r and d l s are greatest in the two great plains ecoregions ngp and sgp followed by chf fig 3b this could reflect crop management decisions in the great plains table 1 which can differ more dramatically year to year than natural shifts in leaf out with major implications for recharge even though chf and ngp have similar crop and grassland land cover lower d l s in chf might be because of the higher average lai of temperate forests in chf compared to boreal forests in ngp which can lower the normalized lai difference interestingly moderately high d l s in the fall in ngp sgp and chf is not reflected in higher recharge differences fig 7a b this is further discussed in section 3 3 3 3 3 controls on vegetation dynamics and recharge response 3 3 1 impact of ecohydrological partioning to evaluate the ecohydrological processes driving the recharge responses to lai anomalies we further examined model simulations of et and surface runoff note that interception was not included in our analysis because its simulated magnitude was negligible compared to et and surface runoff et typically increases with higher lai and can result in a lesser amount of water reaching the water table as recharge kergoat 1998 vivoni 2012 we found very strong temporal correlations between annual simulations of ecoregion averaged lai anomalies and corresponding differences in et calculated analogously as d r a that ranged from 0 85 to 0 91 p value 0 05 as reflected in the negative temporal correlations of 0 68 to 0 85 noted above between d l a and d r a an increase in et due to greater lai can cause a decrease in recharge because there is less water that can pass below the root zone however how much a difference in annual et for clmds versus clmcs ultimately affects recharge depends on how the et difference first influences surface runoff in the upper part of the soil column in fact the partitioning of et differences to surface runoff in addition to recharge explains the weaker temporal correlation for lai differences with recharge differences than with et differences differences in net water storage change can also affect the recharge response to et change but storage changes were found to be small on an annual timescale how et differences affect surface runoff can be complex lower soil moisture with greater et can reduce saturation excess surface runoff when conditions are generally wet but it may increase infiltration excess surface runoff when conditions are generally drier we determined the average partitioning of et differences between recharge and surface runoff differences by fitting lines through annual simulated values over the 16 years in each ecoregion fig 8 we found that much of the et differences are partitioned to recharge 63 100 see slopes reported in figure legends but how much differs by ecoregion fig 8 while nearly all of et differences are reflected in recharge differences in chf and nf the lowest fraction occurs for sgp which has the highest partitioning of et differences to surface runoff the stronger influence on surface runoff in sgp compared to other ecoregions results from the high surface runoff to total runoff ratios values in that region fig s11 in supplementary information driven by higher surface runoff soil parameters fmax in fig s13 in supplementary information and less precipitation hydrogeologic and climatic factors are further considered in the next sections our findings on et partitioning show that even though statistically ecoregion does not appear to be a very strong predictor for recharge differences with vegetation dynamics noted above in fig 5 distinct hydrological processes based on ecoregion do in fact affect the response of recharge to lai and et changes 3 3 2 impact of hydrogeologic factors compared to temporal correlations between ecoregion averaged d l a and d r a 0 68 to 0 85 spatial correlations within each ecoregion between d l a and d r a are much weaker 0 31 to 0 48 fig 6a this can also be seen in the high grid cell to grid cell variability in d r a compared to d l a figs 4 and 5 the stronger spatial variability in d r a suggests that although lai anomalies overall drive recharge differences between clmds and clmcs through changes in et the specific response is influenced by local heterogeneities such as in hydrogeologic properties as we already started to see in the previous section to analyze spatial variability in how recharge responds to dynamic vegetation we conducted a regression over time to predict d r a based on d l a for each gridcell and then evaluated the slope of the regression line denoted as mr l the value of the slope provides a measure of recharge sensitivity to vegetation dynamics by quantifying the change in dr for a unit change in normalized dl negative slope indicates an inverse relationship by examining the spatial distribution of mr l in fig 9 some regional patterns emerge for example the northwestern corner of ngp shows a cluster of high sensitivity strongly negative mr l where normalized lai anomalies are also generally greatest fig 3e while shp includes areas of the lowest sensitivity where absolute recharge amounts are also very low fig 2a however as can be expected from lower spatial correlations between d l a and d r a compared to temporal the regression slope exhibits considerable grid cell to grid cell variability through all ecoregions to assess the spatial influence of hydrogeologic parameters on the sensitivity of recharge to changing vegetation we carried out a multiple linear regression analysis on the regression slope mr l specifically we used the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters subsurface drainage parameters and surface runoff parameters listed in table 2 and shown in fig s13 in supplementary information as predictors of mr l for each ecoregion k sat and θ sat were the only highly correlated pair of parameters correlation 0 8 p value 0 05 and so we dropped θ sat from our regression model to remove effects of multicollinearity but retained all other parameters to allow direct comparison of regression coefficients in table 3 we also standardized the predictor variables subtracted the mean and divided by the standard deviation before conducting the regression in table 3 we see a good overall multiple linear regression model fit with r2 values ranging from 0 4 to 0 5 for ngp sgp and chf indicating that the hydrogeologic parameters are able to explain significant variability in mr l for these ecoregions interestingly the statistically significant predictors of mr l were found to differ in the various ecoregions indicating that distinct hydrogeologic processes affect the sensitivity of recharge to lai anomalies based on ecoregion ngp and chf had k sat as the most important predictor for the regression slope while it was the surface runoff parameter fmax for sgp based on coefficient magnitudes in table 3 this result is consistent with the above finding that sgp has the greatest fraction of et changes partitioned to surface runoff which subsequently affects how much recharge is impacted fmax which positively controls surface runoff shows the highest calibrated values in sgp fig s13 in supplementary information importantly these calibrated fmax values are much higher than the pre calibration topographically determined fmax values this suggests that the calibrated values are likely reflecting the effect of the extensive tile drainage system present throughout southwestern minnesota which were installed to manage soil moisture by moving water from the shallow soil column to surface water features smith et al 2018 although the use of tile drains is also common in the northern great plains their impact may be more subtle there because of lower precipitation and already high runoff due to clayey soils in ecoregions where more of the et differences are partitioned to recharge such as chf and ngp k sat is important for predicting mr l because it directly controls flux through the soil column chf also includes relatively high values of calibrated fmax fig s13 in supplementary information which appears as another major predictor of mr l in that ecoregion table 3 note that for all ecoregions with good r2 values in table 3 there was more than one statistically significant soil parameter predictor which explains greater spatial variability in mr l and consequently d r a than in any single soil parameter the poor predictive model for mr l in nf could be due to variable conditions in this large ecoregion for example compared to other ecoregions nf exhibits much greater variety in primary and secondary pft assignments fig s9 in supplementary information pft variables were not included in the multiple linear regression analysis but could drive some of the spatial variability in recharge responses to lai anomalies in nf especially given differences in phenology and rooting depths among vegetation types with d l a corresponding strongly with ecoregions fig 4 it is likely that any correspondence between ecoregion and simulated recharge response to dynamic vegetation is mostly driven by underlying patterns in lai anomalies however as the above multiple regression analysis shows the recharge response is also influenced by spatially variable hydrogeologic parameters and the importance of these parameters varies depending on the ecoregion 3 3 3 impact of climatic factors to assess the drivers of the year to year vegetation variations that impact recharge we examined their relationships with the major climatic factors of air temperature and precipitation across the four ecoregions temperature anomalies from the 16 year mean t are greatest in the fall and spring fig 7c while precipitation anomalies from the 16 year mean p show more similarity across seasons and ecoregions fig 7d high spring time temporal correlations between temperature and lai in fig 6c suggest that in spring notable temperature anomalies strongly drive lai anomalies across all ecoregions showing the well known effect of warm spring temperatures triggering leaf out and influencing cropping schedules jeong et al 2011 wang et al 2011 los 2012 this interaction results in the large spring time normalized lai anomalies found in ngp sgp and chf though its effect is tempered in nf fig 7a where the magnitude of lai anomalies are likely muted by the evergreen forest fraction as previously noted although spring time t ranges are similar across ecoregions corresponding spring time d l s are greater in ngp and sgp in part because of the effect of smaller nominal lai values there fig s12 in supplementary information on the normalized anomalies interestingly fall time correlations between d l s and t are very weak fig 6c indicating that although cold temperatures in addition to photoperiod induce leaf fall the sizable temperature anomalies in fall are not the main control on fall lai anomalies weak summer time correlations between d l s and t can be expected given that between leaf out and leaf fall harvest lai is relatively constant between years for mature forests grasslands and established croplands fig 6d shows that in contrast to temperature precipitation anomalies have correlations with lai anomalies that are not statistically significant across all ecoregions this was not surprising in the wetter nf region where near zero correlations in all seasons reflect consistently well watered conditions in the eastern part of the state fig 1 in the more arid ngp and sgp regions modest negative spring time correlations between precipitation and lai anomalies could indicate less plant water stress during cooler times however lack of statistical significance in these correlations as well as very small positive correlations between summer precipitation anomalies and lai anomalies makes this difficult to conclude statistical significance for p and d l s correlations was found for sgp and chf spring when the correlation with temperature was still stronger and for chf fall when the effect of dynamic vegetation on recharge is small fig 7b the cross ecoregion dominance of temperature rather than precipitation correlation with lai anomalies shows that despite the precipitation gradient across the state the cold continental climate makes spring temperature the primary factor controlling year to year lai variability our finding of temperature being the primary driving factor of vegetation changes is consistent with several studies that have investigated the response of vegetation to changing climatic factors wu et al 2015 quetin and swann 2018 braswell 1997 piao et al 2006 for example wu et al 2015 found vegetation growth in the middle to high latitudes 30 n 90 n was most strongly correlated with temperature changes among climatic variables that included precipitation and solar radiation similarly jeong et al 2011 showed that climate warming resulted in an extended vegetation growing season in temperate forests in the northern hemisphere and an increase in vegetation greenness during the growing season like d l s ds r shows the strongest relationship with temperature anomalies in the spring compared to precipitation and other seasons fig 6e f which is consistent with large negative correlations between d l s and ds r especially in the spring fig 6b this can be explained by warm spring temperatures supporting higher lai anomalies which in turn decreases recharge through increased et vivoni 2012 temperature anomalies outside of spring as well as precipitation anomalies in all seasons often also show similar relationships with ds r as with d l s compare figs 6c and d with e and f respectively notably the relationships are always considerably weaker than the spring time relationship with temperature however there are occasionally distinctions in the climate anomaly correlations with ds r versus d l s during summer and fall in ngp sgp and chf as reflected in the weaker ds r and d l s correlations for these instances fig 6b these weaker summer and fall correlations between ds r and d l s could be appearing because of water stress in these seasons outside of the humid nf ecoregion water stress can dampen the influence of lai on et and consequently on recharge such that greater lai may not support proportionately higher et due to weather limitations water stress in the summer and fall outside of nf can be seen in the low sometimes negligible or negative recharge values in these ecoregions see fig s2 in supplementary information for this study summer and fall processes are of less concern for vegetation driven recharge variability given that the magnitudes of d l s and ds r are generally smaller in those seasons fig 7a overall although non spring seasons can exhibit appreciable ds r values fig 7 apart from in nf ds r magnitudes are greatest in the spring when temperature is the clear driving factor through its control on lai anomalies fig 6c our finding about the importance of temperature compared to precipitation for recharge variability may be surprising because precipitation is of course the primary driver of absolute recharge amounts for example the spatial distribution of 16 year average recharge across the state is strongly correlated with mean annual precipitation 0 86 p value 0 05 while it shows little correspondence with mean temperature 0 07 p value 0 05 it is important to note that climate inputs were identical in our two model scenarios which only differed in their lai inputs our modeling study thus does not attempt to demonstrate direct effects of climate variability on recharge instead it brings to light the role of vegetation in mediating the influence of climate anomalies on recharge variability while precipitation serves as the first order driver of recharge amounts we showed that year to year changes in vegetation variables such as lai which in minnesota are largely driven by spring temperatures further impact recharge this impact on recharge occurs on the magnitude of about 0 4 cm yr or up to 40 in certain ecoregions over the 16 year study period fig s10 in supplementary information 4 summary and conclusion our study investigated the impact of dynamic vegetation on groundwater recharge by comparing clm model simulations for two different vegetation scenarios clmds in which satellite based year to year varying lai conditions were implemented as model inputs and clmcs the standard approach in which climatological 16 year average monthly lai conditions were implemented the study was carried out for 2000 2015 at a resolution of 25 km for the state of minnesota focusing on the surface and subsurface hydrological properties we used enkf to calibrate runoff subsurface drainage and soil hydraulic parameters by assimilating statewide observations of dynamic water table depth in order to reduce uncertainty in the recharge simulations we found that 16 year statewide average recharge was similar when considering dynamic versus climatological vegetation indicating that year to year varying vegetation was not important for climatological estimates of recharge however we did find notable responses in recharge to dynamic vegetation on an annual scale statewide the average magnitude of annual recharge differences with and without dynamic vegetation rmsdr was 21 1 this recharge difference corresponded to only an average 4 average magnitude difference between climatological and dynamic lai rmsdl indicating a disproportionately high impact on recharge by year to year variability in vegetation as reflected in a strong negative temporal correlation across the state between normalized lai anomalies and simulated recharge differences for the two model scenarios higher than normal lai reduces groundwater recharge due to higher et how much recharge is affected by lai anomalies through et depends on both larger scale ecoregion conditions and local scale hydrogeological conditions in many of the years lai anomalies align with the major ecoregions of minnesota and ecoregions with the greatest normalized springtime lai anomalies also exhibit the greatest differences in springtime recharge which constitutes the bulk of annual recharge the drier ecoregions in western minnesota ngp sgp undergo the greatest normalized lai anomalies and total recharge differences with dynamic vegetation while the wet eastern part of the state nf shows much stabler interannual lai and corresponding recharge differences ecoregion also appears to determine how much lai driven et differences are partitioned to recharge versus runoff in the water balance in most ecoregions nearly all of et differences is reflected in recharge differences but in southwestern minnesota sgp a substantial amount of excess water that results from reduced et is likely removed by tile drains before reaching the water table high within ecoregion spatial variability in recharge differences for the two scenarios reveal that local hydrogeological conditions also control the response of recharge to lai anomalies using multivariable linear regression tests we found that hydrogeologic parameters were able to explain significant variability 40 to 50 of the sensitivity of recharge to dynamic vegetation within three out of four ecoregions nf had more varied vegetation types pfts than other ecoregions likely contributing to the poor predictability there of the response of recharge interestingly significant hydrogeologic predictors varied according to the ecoregion with hydraulic conductivity playing an important role in ecoregions where lai driven et differences are mostly partitioned to recharge and calibrated runoff parameters playing an important role where there are major tile drain effects to assess drivers of the vegetation dynamics that affect recharge we examined inter annual climatic factors and found that large springtime temperature anomalies are responsible for the large springtime normalized lai anomalies and recharge differences this reflects the well known relationship between temperature and leaf emergence and cropping schedules in higher latitudes temperature anomalies do not seem to have a similar control on fall time leaf senescence and harvest schedules and precipitation appears to have a minor influence on lai anomalies and recharge responses to vegetation dynamics even in drier regions and seasons our assessment of recharge responses to vegetation dynamics have important implications for recharge predictions under climate change because it reveals that vegetation responses to climate should be accounted for we showed that across a precipitation gradient vegetation leaf out including crop schedules across minnesota is highly sensitive to springtime temperature anomalies and this phenological response can trigger notable changes in et and subsequently recharge although the high sensitivity of vegetation and recharge to temperature suggests that precipitation may be a less important factor at higher mid latitudes the response of recharge differed along the state s precipitation gradient in the drier great plains to the west springtime normalized lai anomalies and corresponding recharge differences were greater than in the wetter eastern part of the state despite having similar magnitude temperature anomalies suggesting greater ecohydrological vulnerability to temperature anomalies with lower precipitation overall our findings indicate that regardless of uncertain future projections of precipitation projected temperature increases will extend growing seasons across minnesota which will exert a decreasing effect on springtime recharge that will be stronger in drier regions of the state as well as where hydraulic conductivity is higher and the effects of tile drains are more minor see

4324,climate change affects the growth of vegetation and its physiological states such as leaf area index lai which in turn can affect groundwater recharge because of changes in evapotranspiration et presently most recharge modeling studies over simplify transient vegetation conditions and the potential corresponding impact on recharge by using climatological values of vegetation parameters such as lai our study uses the community land model clmv4 5 to investigate the sensitivity of recharge to interannual varying vegetation in minnesota usa across different climate hydrogeology and ecoregions at a 25 km spatial resolution and for the period of 2000 2015 the ensemble kalman filter enkf was used to calibrate soil and runoff parameters to statewide water table depth observations results of the study indicate that although year to year varying vegetation does not affect long term climatological recharge estimates it can drive disproportionately large variability in annual and seasonal recharge comparing simulations with dynamic and climatological vegetation inputs the average magnitude difference root mean square difference rmsd for recharge was 21 1 in response to only a 4 difference in lai inputs regression analysis revealed that the combination of local hydrogeology and vegetation type affects the magnitude of recharge response to lai and et changes we also found cross ecoregion dominance of temperature rather than precipitation controlling lai anomalies and resulting recharge variability with springtime temperature being the primary factor because of its impact on leaf out conditions drier western minnesota showed higher relative lai differences as well as higher spring time and relative annual recharge compared to the wetter eastern part of the state indicating higher vulnerability of the water limited region to changing vegetation and climatic conditions our study shows that models can underestimate or overestimate annual and seasonal recharge if vegetation dynamics are neglected demonstrating the need to incorporate transient vegetation conditions when assessing the impact of future climate change on recharge keywords groundwater recharge dynamic vegetation data assimilation ensemble kalman filter ecohydrology 1 introduction vegetation interacts with the water cycle in multiple ways rodriguez iturbe 2000 leaves intercept precipitation before it either evaporates from the canopy surface or moves to the ground and infiltrates plant litter also alters the water retention and infiltration properties of the soil however the most important link in terms of water balance is usually the effect of vegetation on soil moisture through transpiration arora 2002 through these processes vegetation directly influences the amount of water that percolates past the root zone and recharges the water table in particular plant physiological properties such as amount of leaves and root distribution control the amount of water being intercepted and or transpired le maitre et al 1999 thus any changes in these plant physiological properties have the potential to induce changes in hydrological processes including groundwater recharge in hydrological or land surface models vegetation parameters usually include leaf area index lai which is the ratio of the one sided leaf area to the underlying ground area lai serves as a key functional plant trait because it controls the magnitude of important ecohydrological fluxes such as transpiration canopy evaporation and photosynthesis asner et al 2003 zheng and moskal 2009 bondeau et al 1999 as such most models calculate these fluxes on the gridcell scale through scaling by lai values lai is commonly specified in the model using repeated climatological monthly values this representation of lai neglects the response of vegetation to interannual variability in climatic factors arora 2002 fatichi et al 2015 in reality changes in environmental conditions such as shifts in temperature and precipitation may influence the growth of vegetation jeong et al 2011 gunderson et al 2012 for example an earlier or a warmer spring might lead to an early bud burst in plants while an extended period of moisture stress may hinder growth seasonal and annual changes in vegetation in turn have the potential to affect hydrologic processes at various temporal or spatial scales there have been previous studies that have investigated the impact of dynamic vegetation on different components of the water cycle apart from recharge using physically based hydrologic or land surface models with a focus on runoff zhang et al 2009 and tesemma 2015 included transient lai in their model simulations and found significant improvement in the runoff estimate when compared to model simulations with climatological vegetation looking at the impact on evapotranspiration et and soil moisture tang et al 2012 and vivoni 2012 found that substantial year to year variability in vegetation greening onset and dormancy dates generate significant differences in et simulations compared to results using climatological lai ford and quiring 2013 showed that adding dynamic lai improved simulated soil moisture and predictions of the intensity and duration of drought conditions hwang et al 2018 analyzed precipitation runoff deficits i e the difference between precipitation and runoff and concluded that the long term non stationary hydrologic behavior could not be simulated unless full vegetation dynamics including vegetation phenology and long term growth were incorporated into the model these studies provide strong evidence of the influence of dynamic vegetation on important hydrologic components et runoff soil moisture and prompts questions whether similar interactions between vegetation and recharge occur very few studies have specifically addressed the influence of dynamic lai on groundwater recharge wegehenkel 2009 despite the importance of recharge in determining groundwater resource availability however previous work has established the general sensitivity of groundwater to vegetation although early seminal work in ecohydrology eagleson 1978 rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 porporato et al 2001 fernandez illescas et al 2001 did not explicitly consider this connection in their focus on dryland regions where deep water tables are largely disconnected from root zone soil moisture tight coupling has long been recognized in humid lands and wetlands in field based observations peck and williamson 1987 chang 2012 and more recently in model based studies laio et al 2009 loheide and gorelick 2007 the influence of vegetation on recharge has been more widely demonstrated across diverse environments across the globe through studies investigating land use land cover effects lu lc on recharge including both spatial variability and temporal shifts in lu lc scanlon et al 2006 petheram et al 2002 kim and jackson 2012 these lu lc studies however focused on changes in vegetation type and did not consider the dynamic growth variations within a vegetation type the impact of more subtle vegetation growth variations on groundwater recharge without vegetation type change has received less attention this serves a critical knowledge gap because climate change is predicted to alter plant phenology and leaf carbon stocks xu et al 2013 loheide and gorelick 2013 zhu et al 2016 wu et al 2015 and these changes directly impact et and subsequently influence the amount of water that is available to recharge the water table most work on the impact of climate change on recharge included yearly repeated climatological inputs for vegetation parameters e g jyrkama and sykes 2007 döll 2009 ng et al 2010 hanson and dettinger 2005 bouraoui et al 1999 herrera pantoja and hiscock 2007 chen et al 2002 croley and luukkonen 2003 kirshen 2002 and thus fail to account for vegetation responses that can drive feedbacks among climate vegetation and water taylor et al 2012 mao et al 2016 a smaller number of climate change studies eckhardt and ulbrich 2003 green et al 2007 crosbie et al 2010 wegehenkel 2009 have included dynamic representations of vegetation including transient lai in their predictions of recharge although these recent studies reflect growing recognition of vegetation dynamics none with the exception of wegehenkel 2009 conducted an assessment of the impact of dynamic vegetation on recharge predictions in their analysis of a catchment in northeastern germany over 1950 2100 wegehenkel 2009 first executed two reference simulations using climatological and dynamic vegetation for 1950 1966 and then compared those with future projections over 2078 2094 again with the two vegetation scenarios they found that cumulative groundwater recharge showed a decrease of 9 from the reference to the future period when using dynamic vegetation compared to a decrease of 22 when using climatological vegetation they attributed this difference to feedbacks among transpiration soil water availability and crop growth in the case with dynamic vegetation findings from this case study motivates further work to quantify the effect of climatically driven vegetation dynamics on recharge across climates and plant types a fuller understanding of the interactions among climate vegetation and groundwater can help to determine the complexity needed for representing vegetation in future climate change assessments of groundwater resources obstacles to understanding the influence of dynamic vegetation on recharge include uncertainties in constraining their interactions outside of regions where roots are directly in contact with groundwater e g outside of wetlands and riparian zones although recent advances have led to more mechanistic representation of processes spanning the canopy to the deeper subsurface clark et al 2015 challenges remain in calibrating such models to reliably simulate processes across the entire soil column where soil properties are typically uncertain our study tackles this obstacle by implementing an efficient data assimilation method to calibrate regional land surface model simulations of recharge which enables us to address knowledge gaps about the influence of dynamic lai on groundwater recharge this modeling work is carried out using dynamic remotely sensed lai observations across the state of minnesota usa the state s precipitation and temperature gradients and its varied ecoregions that include prairie cropland deciduous forest evergreen forest and mixed forest provide an apt testbed to evaluate the impact of spatiotemporal variability in vegetation on groundwater recharge across a range of conditions specifically we address the following questions using minnesota as a test case i how has groundwater recharge over seasonal to multi year time scales responded to interannual changes in lai in different ecoregions ii what has been the relative importance of different climatic factors in driving interannual vegetation dynamics that influence groundwater recharge answers to these questions can help guide future predictions about climate change impacts on groundwater recharge across diverse continental ecoregions 2 methods 2 1 study area minnesota experiences a continental climate with hot summers and cold winters it has a distinct precipitation gradient with an average annual precipitation of about 89 cm in the southeast that gradually reduces to about 50 cm in the northwest fig 1 a about two thirds of the precipitation in the state occurs during may to september the us environmental pollution agency epa divides minnesota into five major ecological provinces or ecoregions fig 1b white 2020 we will refer to the first of these ecoregions as great plains gp in the west and southwestern part of the state these were once covered with tallgrass prairie but now over 75 of the area is cropland we further subdivided gp into northern great plains ngp and southern great plains sgp on the basis of soil texture both ngp and sgp are composed of glacial till but glacial lake agassiz in the last glacial period deposited thick beds of lake sediment on top of glacial till in the north ngp is also distinct with its lower crop cover and smaller statured boreal forests the central hardwood forests chf ecoregion extending from the southeastern to northwestern part of minnesota consists of temperate deciduous forests along with extensive cropland pasture and dairy operations the northern forests nf ecoregion occupying the northern and northeastern part of the state is a region of mixed coniferous and deciduous temperate forests conifer bogs and broad lacustrine basins the northern wetlands province consist of vast stretches of peat soil on former lake beds with some forest and several eroded river channels the driftless area province in the southeast is a karst dominated region characterized by forested ridges and carved river valleys because of the limitations of common hydrological and land surface models in reliably simulating groundwater recharge in the complex systems of wetlands and karst regions ringeval et al 2012 hartmann et al 2017 we focus our ecoregion specific analyses on the four regions of ngp sgp chf and nf key characteristics summarized in table 1 list of abbreviations in table 4 2 2 model description we used the community land model clm v4 5 oleson et al 2013 for our assessment of dynamic vegetation controls on groundwater recharge clm is a spatially distributed mechanistic land surface model that serves as the terrestrial component of the national center for atmospheric research s ncar larger community earth system model cesm hurrell et al 2013 clmv4 5 has process based representations of land surface biogeophysics biogeochemistry hydrology and vegetation oleson et al 2013 because its domain spans the land surface to unconfined aquifers clm is suitable for evaluating climate and vegetation controls on recharge to surficial aquifers clm lacks representation of deeper subsurface units and applies an approximate solution for lateral subsurface flow described below we consider the omission of a more detailed lateral subsurface flow scheme to be an acceptable approximation considering our target modeling resolution of 25 km for this regional scale application accurate simulation of lateral groundwater flow requires a higher spatial resolution due to its dependence on gravity and local topographic factors zeng et al 2018 moreover minnesota has a relatively low relief topography minimum of 183 m a s l and maximum of 701 m a s l over 225 181 km2 that likely reduces the consequences of simplifying lateral groundwater movement the default representation of vegetation in clm uses satellite based monthly climatological lai obtained from gridded datasets we refer to this climatological satellite vegetation configuration as clmcs over the last decade several land surface models including clm have added process based modules to simulate plant carbon and nitrogen stocks as well as lai as prognostic variables there has also been progress in developing dynamic global vegetation models dgvm within land surface models that can predict shifts in vegetation types over space and time i e transient pfts e g druel et al 2017 clark et al 2011 levis et al 2004 fisher et al 2017 although clm incorporates optional modes for both these capabilities clm biogeochemical clm bgc and clm dgvm we instead modified the general clm code to directly take as inputs spatiotemporally dynamic lai from satellite observations this strategy has the advantage over the bgc mode of avoiding uncertainties in prognostic plant variable simulations which depend on a large number of vegetation parameters that substantially add to the computational load for model calibration because the model integrates over multiple plant functional types pfts within a grid cell to simulate total transpiration and other vegetation fluxes we developed a scheme to convert satellite observed total lai into pft level lai based on the disaggregation in the default climatological clm dataset 1 lai i sat tlai sat lai i clm def tlai clm def where lai i and tlai are pft level lai for the ith pft out of a total of 15 pfts represented in clm and total lai respectively sat denotes lai observed from satellite and clm def indicates the default clm dataset that is provided with the model our scheme assumes that the default clm spatial distributions of pft cover applies for our disaggregation calculation ecoregion averages of percent cover of each pft are included in table 1 full spatial distribution shown in fig s9 in supplementary information clm s default climatological lai tlai clm def and pft cover dataset is a spatially distributed product at a base resolution of 0 05 and is derived from modis satellite data over the years 2001 2003 lawrence and chase 2007 this time period for the default clm dataset overlaps with the early part of our simulation period 2000 2015 and we consider the default clm pft distribution to reasonably apply over later years as well given that more recent land cover datasets have not shown substantial changes in minnesota see supplementary information section s1 1 we refer to our modified implementation with dynamic satellite vegetation as clmds the hydrological component of the model includes an upper soil column that is discretized into 10 computational layers extending from the ground surface to about 3 8 m depth with the thicknesses of each layer increasing exponentially with depth boundary conditions for the upper soil column include simulations of surface runoff canopy and ground evaporation infiltration flux to and from a deeper unconfined aquifer layer when the water table is positioned below the upper soil column and subsurface drainage when the water table is positioned within the upper soil column for calculating the dynamic soil water content of each computational layer within the upper soil column clm uses a modified form of the 1d vertical richards equation zeng and decker 2009 2 θ t z k ψ ψ e z q where θ is the volumetric soil water content ψ is the soil matric potential ψ e is the equilibrium hydrostatic soil matric potential

clm based on soil texture percent sand and clay and organic matter content in each soil layer clapp and hornberger 1978 cosby et al 1984 lawrence and slater 2007 details about the pedotransfer function used in the model can be found in oleson et al 2013 determination of the water table depth and recharge is based on niu et al 2007 if the water table is within the upper soil column within 3 8 m depth recharge to the water table is calculated by applying darcy s law across the water table 3 q recharge k aq ψ ψ jwt z z jwt where ψ 0 is the matric potential at the water table at depth z subscript jwt denotes the index of the layer directly above the water table and k aq is the hydraulic conductivity of the layer containing the water table jwt 1 for the case when the water table is below the upper soil column below 3 8 m recharge is set to the potential recharge defined as the net flux of water across the lower boundary of the deepest explicit soil layer at 3 8 m depth because most of the major water table aquifers in minnesota are close to the surface within 3 m adams 2016 the approximation of potential recharge as actual recharge is needed for only certain parts of the state clm computes potential recharge by calculating the change in water content of an additional soil layer below the upper soil column 4 q recharge δ θ liq n 1 δ z n 1 δ t where δ θ liq n 1 θ n 1 t 1 θ n 1 t is the change in liquid water content in an additional lower layer layer n 1 from the bottom of the upper soil column to the water table over a model time step t to t 1 and δ z n 1 z z n is the difference between the water table depth z and the bottom of the upper soil column z n 3 8 m liquid water content of the lowest n 1 th layer is calculated using the modified form of richards equation as noted above in eq 2 assuming no vertical flux across the bottom of the layer the change in water table depth is calculated based on recharge and drainage 5 δ z q recharge q drai s y δ t where δ t is the model time step s y is specific yield calculated as s y θ sat 1 1 z ψ sat 1 b and q drai is the subsurface drainage defined as the flux of water out of the vertical soil column via lateral flux at the water table subsurface drainage is represented through a parameterization based on topographic statistics 6 q drai q drai max exp f drai z where f drai 2 5 m 1 is a decay factor parameter and q drai max 10 sin β kg m 2 s 1 is the maximum drainage when the water table is at the ground surface with β as the mean grid cell topographic slope in radians as noted previously we consider simulations in southeast minnesota to have higher uncertainty largely because this parameterization is likely insufficient for representing complex flows in karst regions the model was run for two scenarios at a spatial resolution of 25 km chosen for computational purposes using a 30 min time step over the 16 year period of 2000 to 2015 with a monthly model output frequency in the first scenario clmcs the default climatological monthly lai inputs were used in the second scenario clmds we replaced the default climatological lai with annually dynamic lai from the global land surface satellite glass xiao et al 2014 glass was derived by combining modis and avhrr satellite data on vegetation it has a temporal resolution of 8 days and is available globally starting from 1982 at 1 km spatial resolution this dataset has been validated in multiple studies and found to be in good agreement with observations fang et al 2019 the lai data was inputted to the model at its original temporal resolution of 8 day for meteorological data inputs we used daymet thornton et al 2014 for precipitation temperature and humidity as well as ncep narr meixner et al 2006 for wind speed and atmospheric pressure soil texture inputs were obtained from polaris chaney et al 2016 compared to the default clm global soil dataset polaris is a much newer product that was derived from a probabilistic remapping of ssurgo soil survey staff 2020 an observational database that specifically focuses on north america all input datasets were regridded to the 25x25 km computational grid details in supplementary information section s1 2 soil hydraulic parameters derived by clm pedotransfer functions from the soil texture inputs were further calibrated using water table depth observations from the minnesota department of natural resources s mndnr cooperative groundwater management cgm database www dnr state mn us waters cgm as described in the following section 2 3 model calibration with ensemble kalman filter as previously mentioned simulations of vegetation recharge coupling in clm can be highly uncertain due to poor constraints on soil properties over the entire unsaturated zone because clm is a complex nonlinear spatially distributed model that uses a large number of parameters to simulate ecohydrological processes model calibration is critical but also challenging to address this we used the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 to calibrate soil parameters by assimilating observations of dynamic water table depths to reduce uncertainty in recharge simulations we focused on subsurface parameter estimation because surface model inputs of climate and vegetation variables were considered to be relatively well known based on direct observations enkf was chosen for its flexible application with any model and observation type as well as its efficient handling of high dimensional models like clm water table depth time series were selected as the calibration data because changes in water table depth capture water movement over the entire overlying soil column enkf combines spatiotemporally resolved details from clm with depth integrated information from water table depth measurements in order to generate soil property estimates throughout the soil column we used water table data from 320 surficial wells within the cgm database locations shown in fig 2b water level depths shown in fig s1 in supplementary information that had repeat measurements ranging from monthly to annual frequency over the 2000 2015 simulation period the cgm database processing procedure includes periodic checks of automated water level measurements against manual measurements for accuracy pearson et al 2012 we further removed data points that showed unusually large one time jumps in water level more than 3 5 m within a month although water levels could be influenced by groundwater extractions we did not attempt to filter for affected wells global studies e g gleeson et al 2012 do not show minnesota aquifers to be experiencing any major regional groundwater overdraws and collecting local pumping information on a statewide scale was beyond the scope of this study 2 3 1 ensemble kalman filter enkf is a data assimilation method that merges information from imperfect models and uncertain observations in an optimal way to reduce and quantify uncertainty liu and gupta 2007 the kalman filter and its variants are widely used in the earth sciences carrassi et al 2018 liu and gupta 2007 reichle 2008 sun et al 2016 a sequence of assimilation cycles are carried out in enkf each of which consists of two steps forecast and update in the forecast step an n member ensemble of state variables are evolved forward in time through the model i e monte carlo runs with each member using a different perturbed parameter set and or including added state variable noise to represent model structural uncertainty the forecast step at timestep t can be represented as 7 x t f g x t 1 u p u t 1 b t ω t where x r n n is the ensemble of n dimensional state variables superscripts f and u respectively denote the forecast and updated variables g is the non linear model applied to each ensemble member p r p n is the ensemble of p dimensional parameter values b is the forcing at the boundaries and ω includes any additional model error terms in the update step when parameter estimates are desired an augmented state matrix ξ t r n p n is created in which p u t 1 is appended to x t the ensemble members are adjusted based on observations using the following equation 8 ξ t u ξ t f k y h ξ t f where the matrix y r m n contains a different perturbed vector of observations y r m in each column with y j y γ j j 1 n and γ j representing a random draw for a 0 mean observation error k is the kalman gain and h is the measurement operator that relates the model state to the observations the kalman gain is computed as follows 9 k p e f h t hp e f h t r e 1 where the model error covariance is calculated as p e f ξ t f ξ t f t n 1 with ξ t f r n p n containing replicates of the ensemble mean vector in each column and the observation error covariance matrix is calculated as r e β β t n 1 with β γ 1 γ 2 γ n r m n the updated model error covariance p e u ξ t u ξ t u ξ t u ξ t u t n 1 quantifies the uncertainty in the estimate at the end of the update step the updated states and parameters at time t are then used for the forecast step in the subsequent assimilation cycle for time t 1 2 3 2 implementation of enkf with clm sensitivity tests were carried out to identify the parameters most strongly controlling simulations of water table depth and groundwater recharge table 2 lists these parameters as well as the state variables that were estimated with enkf using water table depth observations enkf was initialized at the beginning of the simulation period using random parameter draws from prior uniform probability distributions with uncertainty ranges shown in table 2 the range for subsurface drainage and surface runoff parameters were specified based on past studies ray et al 2015 huang et al 2016 and test simulations uncertainty in polaris dataset was accounted for by applying depth correlated soil texture perturbations similar to ng et al 2009 for each soil layer the prior soil parameter range was then derived using the pedotransfer function of clm value range listed in table 2 based on the perturbed soil texture inputs perturbation range of 40 for soil texture table 2 was chosen based on preliminary tests that showed it to be appropriate for generating ensemble simulations that cover observed water table depths for our implementation with clm we applied several modifications to the standard enkf algorithm to improve its performance for simultaneous state and parameter estimation which can be prone to issues due to non linearities ng et al 2014 as detailed fully in supplementary information section s1 3 these include parameter perturbations moradkhani 2005 variance inflation anderson and anderson 1999 and update iterations liu and ng 2019 we set the observation error for water table depth to 0 45 m to represent not only measurement errors but also scale representation errors between a single well and the model gridcell preliminary tests showed that an ensemble size of 100 provided an appropriate balance between performance and computation cost the final set of ensemble parameter estimates from enkf were used to execute two separate sets of model runs clmcs using the climatological vegetation inputs and clmds using satellite based dynamic vegetation as the input the ensemble median of clmds simulations are taken as the final calibrated estimate with the full ensemble representing estimation uncertainty while clmcs simulations are used for comparison to evaluate the effect of dynamic vegetation 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance evaluation to evaluate the performance of the model calibration to water table depths we compared the simulated ensemble median water table depth and observed water table depth using the root mean square residual rmsr over the different observation times for 2000 2015 the spatially averaged mean rmsr improved by 51 to 1 27 m in the posterior run after calibration with enkf compared to the prior before calibration with enkf indicating a statewide improvement of clm outputs fig s3 in the supplementary information in a 5 year model validation run over 2016 2020 using the calibrated parameters the rmsr for water table depth remained low at 1 36 m fig s4 in supplementary information providing further confidence in our calibration results using the calibrated model over the study period of 2000 2015 simulations of recharge show a notable difference compared to the recharge results before calibration fig s5 in supplementary information demonstrating the effect of the constraint on water table observations the calibrated ensemble median recharge estimates with dynamic vegetation across minnesota at 25 km resolution averaged over the 2000 2015 simulation period ranged from less than 0 1 cm year 1 in the western part of the state to 26 4 cm year 1 in the east with a statewide average of 7 4 cm year 1 fig 2a this increasing west to east spatial trend agrees with past regional recharge studies delin et al 2007 smith and westenbroek 2015 and largely reflects the underlying precipitation pattern fig 1a the highest simulated recharge occurred in the central part of the state which is known to contain highly conductive glacially deposited sand plains in addition to moderately high precipitation smith and westenbroek 2015 mesinger et al 1993 we also found that recharge varies seasonally fig s2 in supplementary information with 82 of the annual statewide recharge occurring during spring april june and a smaller second period of recharge occurring during fall october and november recharge estimate uncertainty was quantified using the difference between the 75th and 25th percentile of the ensemble recharge simulations in fig 2b the 320 groundwater wells used for calibration data were unevenly distributed throughout the state with almost all in central northwestern and southwestern minnesota allowing for lower uncertainty in many of those areas fig 2b higher uncertainty in the recharge estimate in northeastern minnesota corresponds with where there is almost no water table depth data the high uncertainty in central minnesota is around the minneapolis st paul twin cities metropolitan area it is likely that uncertainties persist there despite the availability of water table depth observations because clm inadequately captures the effects of urbanization and management on groundwater which is the source of more than 70 of the municipal water used in the twin cities metro area twin cities metropolitan council 2007 our simulated statewide recharge estimates the ensemble median were generally lower 35 statewide than previous water balance based recharge estimates in minnesota smith and westenbroek 2015 because direct observations of recharge are lacking for validation we compared our estimates to available observation based data for other major hydrological fluxes specifically et and runoff evaluating et is particularly important for our study given the focus on vegetation our statewide average simulated et closely matched within 5 the et product from modis mod16 mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 and fell between two other et products that use satellite and flux tower measurements ssebop senay et al 2013 and gfet jung et al 2009 fig s6 in supplementary information generally locations with moderate to high et simulations better match the observation based et products compared to locations with low et simulations fig s7 in supplementary information we also compared ensemble median streamflow calculated as subsurface drainage plus surface runoff in clm simulations with measurements from 13 long term usgs stream gauges and found that the model captured overall observed spatial trends without any statewide bias fig s8 in supplementary information reasonable estimation of these major components of the water balance as well as water table depth gives confidence in the model s ability to satisfactorily simulate groundwater recharge and its links with vegetation dynamics although errors could persist in absolute groundwater recharge estimates from clm these likely become less important when we examine differences in recharge for dynamic versus climatological vegetation inputs 3 2 impacts of dynamic vegetation on recharge 3 2 1 statewide results below we used the ensemble medians of clmds and clmcs simulations to evaluate the impacts of dynamic vegetation on recharge as well as the influence of climatic drivers the statewide recharge simulated with dynamic satellite vegetation clmds was very similar to the result with climatological satellite vegetation clmcs 7 4 versus 7 1 cm yr this similarity indicates that across the state over the 16 year period times and locations with higher than average recharge with dynamic vegetation were mostly offset by other times and locations with lower than average recharge as such dynamic vegetation seems not to be important to consider for climatological studies of recharge however as reflected in the overall spatiotemporal correlation of 0 4 p value 0 05 between lai differences and simulated annual recharge differences for clmds versus clmcs higher lower than time averaged lai conditions can cause a decrease increase in recharge in certain years and locations correspondingly fig 3 a shows the occurrence of appreciable differences between recharge results with and without dynamic vegetation over the 16 year period here appreciable differences are defined as those years when the difference in recharge is at least 10 calculated relative to clmcs and the average annual recharge is at least 10 mm yr these criteria were set to detect cases in which recharge differences may be sufficiently large as to have water resource and ecological implications across different grid cells an average of 2 years out of the 16 year simulation period experienced appreciable differences in annual recharge simulations the drier northwest showed the greatest recharge sensitivity to dynamic vegetation with an average 12 out of 16 years showing appreciable differences to evaluate the size of recharge differences over the 16 years and to compare them to the underlying dynamic vegetation conditions we first calculated the time averaged recharge difference dr for each grid cell over the simulation period 10 d r t r t ds r t cs n where t is the time index for simulation year n 16 is the number of years simulated and r t is the simulated annual recharge at time t for the clmds or clmcs scenario even though average lai differences over the 16 years between the scenarios is zero because climatological vegetation is defined as the mean of the 16 year dynamic vegetation we found that a number of grid cells exhibit a sign bias in dr fig 3b ranging from 0 5 cm yr to 0 5 cm yr the notable non zero dr results in some grid cells indicate that cumulatively over the 16 year simulation period there can be an asymmetric impact on recharge by either higher or lower than average lai conditions resulting in respectively lower or higher overall recharge than expected with climatological vegetation conditions for example in fig 3b recharge in parts of northwestern and southern minnesota on average experienced higher recharge over the 16 years positive dr indicating greater influence by lower than average lai in contrast a number of locations in central and eastern minnesota with lower than expected recharge over the 16 years negative dr show greater sensitivity to above normal lai while dr magnitudes appeared heterogeneously distributed across the state in fig 3b recharge differences normalized by time averaged local recharge in fig 3c were highest in the western part of the state where recharge values are lowest fig 2a these differences ranged from a minimum of 68 to a maximum of 235 of average recharge for different grid cells indicating that dynamic vegetation can have a substantial relative impact on recharge over a 16 year period while fig 3b shows whether there is a tendency for higher or lower recharge to accumulate over the 16 years due to dynamic vegetation within a grid cell annual recharge in clmds likely falls both above and below what is expected with climatological vegetation over the 16 years to examine the magnitude of recharge and lai differences between the clmds and clmcs scenarios regardless of the sign we calculated the root mean square difference rmsd over the 16 year period i e 11 rmsd r t r t ds r t cs 2 n 12 rmsd l t l t ds l t cs 2 n where l t is the input lai at t for the clmds or clmcs scenario and we show non normalized and normalized results in figs 3d g by comparing fig 3b d and f it can be seen that locations with higher rmsdr and rmsdl often correspond to areas with greater positive or negative dr such as north western minnesota however it can also be seen that as expected because of both higher and lower recharge over the 16 years average recharge difference magnitudes rmsdr are generally much greater than average difference values dr over the 16 year simulation period compare values in figs 3 b and f spatially averaged over the state rmsdr and rmsdl normalized respectively by mean recharge and lai were 21 1 and 4 and for some parts of the state they respectively reached as high as 597 and 17 fig 3e and g the higher rmsd for recharge compared to lai demonstrates that year to year variability in vegetation growth may drive disproportionately high relative variability in recharge 3 2 2 ecoregion specific analysis the different major ecoregions of minnesota fig 1b may be expected to exhibit varying sensitivity of recharge to interannual changes in vegetation growth because of their differences in climate and plant type although recharge differences over the 16 years show substantial spatial variability between grid cells in fig 3b spatial coefficient of variations of 16 some alignment with ecoregions can be discerned for example it was previously noted that northwest minnesota corresponding to the ngp ecoregion shows greater frequency and magnitudes of recharge differences for clmds compared to clmcs fig 3a b f as well as greater normalized lai differences fig 3e ecoregion based trends become clearer when evaluating transient annual lai and recharge values in figs 4 and 5 rather than aggregating over the 16 year simulation period as was done for average differences and rmsd here we use d r a and da l to denote annual level differences in recharge and lai respectively between clmds and clmcs these are defined analogously to dr in eq 10 except that they are not averaged over time note that because lai inputs in clmcs are the long term average of lai inputs in clmds da l represents lai anomalies in each year differences from the temporal average in fig 4 we show da l normalized by the 16 year mean lai d l a where the tilde indicates normalization in the respective grid cell because normalized da l exhibits a stronger spatiotemporal correlation with d r a across the state compared to non normalized d r a 0 47 versus 0 4 the stronger correlation likely occurs because the normalization accounts for the underlying diversity in lai due to plant type see fig s9 in supplementary information for pft information clearest ecoregion trends can be seen in d l a in fig 4 for which ecoregion is a statistically significant predictor in nearly half the years using a simple regression test p value 0 05 for example fig 4 shows significant regional greening positive d l a occurred in chf in 2002 and moderate regional greening occurred in nf in 2008 these results suggest that even though some years experienced similar d l a across the state such as 2013 and 2014 lai variability is often influenced by ecoregion based conditions the corresponding recharge differences between clmds and clmcs in fig 5 show considerably more spatial heterogeneity than lai anomalies as seen in the variable results among neighboring grid cells with similar lai anomalies a regression test revealed that ecoregion was not a significant predictor for recharge differences for any of the 16 years p value 0 05 however a negative response of recharge to the lai differences can still be gleaned through strong statistically significant temporal correlations between d l a and d r a of 0 68 to 0 85 for the different ecoregions fig 6 a this relationship can be seen for example in the uniformly low lai years of 2013 or 2014 when recharge was generally higher than expected with climatological vegetation in all four ecoregions as well as in 2002 and 2008 when regional greening corresponded with mostly reduced recharge fig 5 as a result some correspondence between ecoregion and recharge differences does appear based on underlying ecoregion controls on lai anomalies in fig 7a b boxplots of d l s and ds r summarize how much lai and corresponding recharge differences vary across the 16 years for each ecoregion superscript s here denotes seasonal average by further breaking these results down by season we note that lai anomalies not only differ by ecoregion but they also vary within a year fig 7a winter december march is omitted from our discussion because lai anomalies and corresponding recharge differences between clmds and clmcs are very small during that season it can be seen that the greatest normalized differences positive and negative between dynamic and climatological lai occur in the spring april june for all ecoregions except nf the large spring time variability in ngp sgp and chf reflects the year to year differences in leaf out or crop dates in nf where there are substantial evergreen forests table 1 spring time lai anomalies are smaller and more similar to other times of the year fall october and november shows the second largest lai differences between clmds and clmcs due to year to year differences in senescence timing especially in ngp sgp and chf the spring dominated seasonal pattern in normalized lai differences is translated to spring dominated recharge differences in ngp sgp and chf fig 7b this is also reflected in the correlations between d l s and ds r parsed out by season which show that recharge is most consistently sensitive to lai anomalies in the spring correlations of 0 80 to 0 92 across ecoregions fig 6b in springtime both ds r and d l s are greatest in the two great plains ecoregions ngp and sgp followed by chf fig 3b this could reflect crop management decisions in the great plains table 1 which can differ more dramatically year to year than natural shifts in leaf out with major implications for recharge even though chf and ngp have similar crop and grassland land cover lower d l s in chf might be because of the higher average lai of temperate forests in chf compared to boreal forests in ngp which can lower the normalized lai difference interestingly moderately high d l s in the fall in ngp sgp and chf is not reflected in higher recharge differences fig 7a b this is further discussed in section 3 3 3 3 3 controls on vegetation dynamics and recharge response 3 3 1 impact of ecohydrological partioning to evaluate the ecohydrological processes driving the recharge responses to lai anomalies we further examined model simulations of et and surface runoff note that interception was not included in our analysis because its simulated magnitude was negligible compared to et and surface runoff et typically increases with higher lai and can result in a lesser amount of water reaching the water table as recharge kergoat 1998 vivoni 2012 we found very strong temporal correlations between annual simulations of ecoregion averaged lai anomalies and corresponding differences in et calculated analogously as d r a that ranged from 0 85 to 0 91 p value 0 05 as reflected in the negative temporal correlations of 0 68 to 0 85 noted above between d l a and d r a an increase in et due to greater lai can cause a decrease in recharge because there is less water that can pass below the root zone however how much a difference in annual et for clmds versus clmcs ultimately affects recharge depends on how the et difference first influences surface runoff in the upper part of the soil column in fact the partitioning of et differences to surface runoff in addition to recharge explains the weaker temporal correlation for lai differences with recharge differences than with et differences differences in net water storage change can also affect the recharge response to et change but storage changes were found to be small on an annual timescale how et differences affect surface runoff can be complex lower soil moisture with greater et can reduce saturation excess surface runoff when conditions are generally wet but it may increase infiltration excess surface runoff when conditions are generally drier we determined the average partitioning of et differences between recharge and surface runoff differences by fitting lines through annual simulated values over the 16 years in each ecoregion fig 8 we found that much of the et differences are partitioned to recharge 63 100 see slopes reported in figure legends but how much differs by ecoregion fig 8 while nearly all of et differences are reflected in recharge differences in chf and nf the lowest fraction occurs for sgp which has the highest partitioning of et differences to surface runoff the stronger influence on surface runoff in sgp compared to other ecoregions results from the high surface runoff to total runoff ratios values in that region fig s11 in supplementary information driven by higher surface runoff soil parameters fmax in fig s13 in supplementary information and less precipitation hydrogeologic and climatic factors are further considered in the next sections our findings on et partitioning show that even though statistically ecoregion does not appear to be a very strong predictor for recharge differences with vegetation dynamics noted above in fig 5 distinct hydrological processes based on ecoregion do in fact affect the response of recharge to lai and et changes 3 3 2 impact of hydrogeologic factors compared to temporal correlations between ecoregion averaged d l a and d r a 0 68 to 0 85 spatial correlations within each ecoregion between d l a and d r a are much weaker 0 31 to 0 48 fig 6a this can also be seen in the high grid cell to grid cell variability in d r a compared to d l a figs 4 and 5 the stronger spatial variability in d r a suggests that although lai anomalies overall drive recharge differences between clmds and clmcs through changes in et the specific response is influenced by local heterogeneities such as in hydrogeologic properties as we already started to see in the previous section to analyze spatial variability in how recharge responds to dynamic vegetation we conducted a regression over time to predict d r a based on d l a for each gridcell and then evaluated the slope of the regression line denoted as mr l the value of the slope provides a measure of recharge sensitivity to vegetation dynamics by quantifying the change in dr for a unit change in normalized dl negative slope indicates an inverse relationship by examining the spatial distribution of mr l in fig 9 some regional patterns emerge for example the northwestern corner of ngp shows a cluster of high sensitivity strongly negative mr l where normalized lai anomalies are also generally greatest fig 3e while shp includes areas of the lowest sensitivity where absolute recharge amounts are also very low fig 2a however as can be expected from lower spatial correlations between d l a and d r a compared to temporal the regression slope exhibits considerable grid cell to grid cell variability through all ecoregions to assess the spatial influence of hydrogeologic parameters on the sensitivity of recharge to changing vegetation we carried out a multiple linear regression analysis on the regression slope mr l specifically we used the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters subsurface drainage parameters and surface runoff parameters listed in table 2 and shown in fig s13 in supplementary information as predictors of mr l for each ecoregion k sat and θ sat were the only highly correlated pair of parameters correlation 0 8 p value 0 05 and so we dropped θ sat from our regression model to remove effects of multicollinearity but retained all other parameters to allow direct comparison of regression coefficients in table 3 we also standardized the predictor variables subtracted the mean and divided by the standard deviation before conducting the regression in table 3 we see a good overall multiple linear regression model fit with r2 values ranging from 0 4 to 0 5 for ngp sgp and chf indicating that the hydrogeologic parameters are able to explain significant variability in mr l for these ecoregions interestingly the statistically significant predictors of mr l were found to differ in the various ecoregions indicating that distinct hydrogeologic processes affect the sensitivity of recharge to lai anomalies based on ecoregion ngp and chf had k sat as the most important predictor for the regression slope while it was the surface runoff parameter fmax for sgp based on coefficient magnitudes in table 3 this result is consistent with the above finding that sgp has the greatest fraction of et changes partitioned to surface runoff which subsequently affects how much recharge is impacted fmax which positively controls surface runoff shows the highest calibrated values in sgp fig s13 in supplementary information importantly these calibrated fmax values are much higher than the pre calibration topographically determined fmax values this suggests that the calibrated values are likely reflecting the effect of the extensive tile drainage system present throughout southwestern minnesota which were installed to manage soil moisture by moving water from the shallow soil column to surface water features smith et al 2018 although the use of tile drains is also common in the northern great plains their impact may be more subtle there because of lower precipitation and already high runoff due to clayey soils in ecoregions where more of the et differences are partitioned to recharge such as chf and ngp k sat is important for predicting mr l because it directly controls flux through the soil column chf also includes relatively high values of calibrated fmax fig s13 in supplementary information which appears as another major predictor of mr l in that ecoregion table 3 note that for all ecoregions with good r2 values in table 3 there was more than one statistically significant soil parameter predictor which explains greater spatial variability in mr l and consequently d r a than in any single soil parameter the poor predictive model for mr l in nf could be due to variable conditions in this large ecoregion for example compared to other ecoregions nf exhibits much greater variety in primary and secondary pft assignments fig s9 in supplementary information pft variables were not included in the multiple linear regression analysis but could drive some of the spatial variability in recharge responses to lai anomalies in nf especially given differences in phenology and rooting depths among vegetation types with d l a corresponding strongly with ecoregions fig 4 it is likely that any correspondence between ecoregion and simulated recharge response to dynamic vegetation is mostly driven by underlying patterns in lai anomalies however as the above multiple regression analysis shows the recharge response is also influenced by spatially variable hydrogeologic parameters and the importance of these parameters varies depending on the ecoregion 3 3 3 impact of climatic factors to assess the drivers of the year to year vegetation variations that impact recharge we examined their relationships with the major climatic factors of air temperature and precipitation across the four ecoregions temperature anomalies from the 16 year mean t are greatest in the fall and spring fig 7c while precipitation anomalies from the 16 year mean p show more similarity across seasons and ecoregions fig 7d high spring time temporal correlations between temperature and lai in fig 6c suggest that in spring notable temperature anomalies strongly drive lai anomalies across all ecoregions showing the well known effect of warm spring temperatures triggering leaf out and influencing cropping schedules jeong et al 2011 wang et al 2011 los 2012 this interaction results in the large spring time normalized lai anomalies found in ngp sgp and chf though its effect is tempered in nf fig 7a where the magnitude of lai anomalies are likely muted by the evergreen forest fraction as previously noted although spring time t ranges are similar across ecoregions corresponding spring time d l s are greater in ngp and sgp in part because of the effect of smaller nominal lai values there fig s12 in supplementary information on the normalized anomalies interestingly fall time correlations between d l s and t are very weak fig 6c indicating that although cold temperatures in addition to photoperiod induce leaf fall the sizable temperature anomalies in fall are not the main control on fall lai anomalies weak summer time correlations between d l s and t can be expected given that between leaf out and leaf fall harvest lai is relatively constant between years for mature forests grasslands and established croplands fig 6d shows that in contrast to temperature precipitation anomalies have correlations with lai anomalies that are not statistically significant across all ecoregions this was not surprising in the wetter nf region where near zero correlations in all seasons reflect consistently well watered conditions in the eastern part of the state fig 1 in the more arid ngp and sgp regions modest negative spring time correlations between precipitation and lai anomalies could indicate less plant water stress during cooler times however lack of statistical significance in these correlations as well as very small positive correlations between summer precipitation anomalies and lai anomalies makes this difficult to conclude statistical significance for p and d l s correlations was found for sgp and chf spring when the correlation with temperature was still stronger and for chf fall when the effect of dynamic vegetation on recharge is small fig 7b the cross ecoregion dominance of temperature rather than precipitation correlation with lai anomalies shows that despite the precipitation gradient across the state the cold continental climate makes spring temperature the primary factor controlling year to year lai variability our finding of temperature being the primary driving factor of vegetation changes is consistent with several studies that have investigated the response of vegetation to changing climatic factors wu et al 2015 quetin and swann 2018 braswell 1997 piao et al 2006 for example wu et al 2015 found vegetation growth in the middle to high latitudes 30 n 90 n was most strongly correlated with temperature changes among climatic variables that included precipitation and solar radiation similarly jeong et al 2011 showed that climate warming resulted in an extended vegetation growing season in temperate forests in the northern hemisphere and an increase in vegetation greenness during the growing season like d l s ds r shows the strongest relationship with temperature anomalies in the spring compared to precipitation and other seasons fig 6e f which is consistent with large negative correlations between d l s and ds r especially in the spring fig 6b this can be explained by warm spring temperatures supporting higher lai anomalies which in turn decreases recharge through increased et vivoni 2012 temperature anomalies outside of spring as well as precipitation anomalies in all seasons often also show similar relationships with ds r as with d l s compare figs 6c and d with e and f respectively notably the relationships are always considerably weaker than the spring time relationship with temperature however there are occasionally distinctions in the climate anomaly correlations with ds r versus d l s during summer and fall in ngp sgp and chf as reflected in the weaker ds r and d l s correlations for these instances fig 6b these weaker summer and fall correlations between ds r and d l s could be appearing because of water stress in these seasons outside of the humid nf ecoregion water stress can dampen the influence of lai on et and consequently on recharge such that greater lai may not support proportionately higher et due to weather limitations water stress in the summer and fall outside of nf can be seen in the low sometimes negligible or negative recharge values in these ecoregions see fig s2 in supplementary information for this study summer and fall processes are of less concern for vegetation driven recharge variability given that the magnitudes of d l s and ds r are generally smaller in those seasons fig 7a overall although non spring seasons can exhibit appreciable ds r values fig 7 apart from in nf ds r magnitudes are greatest in the spring when temperature is the clear driving factor through its control on lai anomalies fig 6c our finding about the importance of temperature compared to precipitation for recharge variability may be surprising because precipitation is of course the primary driver of absolute recharge amounts for example the spatial distribution of 16 year average recharge across the state is strongly correlated with mean annual precipitation 0 86 p value 0 05 while it shows little correspondence with mean temperature 0 07 p value 0 05 it is important to note that climate inputs were identical in our two model scenarios which only differed in their lai inputs our modeling study thus does not attempt to demonstrate direct effects of climate variability on recharge instead it brings to light the role of vegetation in mediating the influence of climate anomalies on recharge variability while precipitation serves as the first order driver of recharge amounts we showed that year to year changes in vegetation variables such as lai which in minnesota are largely driven by spring temperatures further impact recharge this impact on recharge occurs on the magnitude of about 0 4 cm yr or up to 40 in certain ecoregions over the 16 year study period fig s10 in supplementary information 4 summary and conclusion our study investigated the impact of dynamic vegetation on groundwater recharge by comparing clm model simulations for two different vegetation scenarios clmds in which satellite based year to year varying lai conditions were implemented as model inputs and clmcs the standard approach in which climatological 16 year average monthly lai conditions were implemented the study was carried out for 2000 2015 at a resolution of 25 km for the state of minnesota focusing on the surface and subsurface hydrological properties we used enkf to calibrate runoff subsurface drainage and soil hydraulic parameters by assimilating statewide observations of dynamic water table depth in order to reduce uncertainty in the recharge simulations we found that 16 year statewide average recharge was similar when considering dynamic versus climatological vegetation indicating that year to year varying vegetation was not important for climatological estimates of recharge however we did find notable responses in recharge to dynamic vegetation on an annual scale statewide the average magnitude of annual recharge differences with and without dynamic vegetation rmsdr was 21 1 this recharge difference corresponded to only an average 4 average magnitude difference between climatological and dynamic lai rmsdl indicating a disproportionately high impact on recharge by year to year variability in vegetation as reflected in a strong negative temporal correlation across the state between normalized lai anomalies and simulated recharge differences for the two model scenarios higher than normal lai reduces groundwater recharge due to higher et how much recharge is affected by lai anomalies through et depends on both larger scale ecoregion conditions and local scale hydrogeological conditions in many of the years lai anomalies align with the major ecoregions of minnesota and ecoregions with the greatest normalized springtime lai anomalies also exhibit the greatest differences in springtime recharge which constitutes the bulk of annual recharge the drier ecoregions in western minnesota ngp sgp undergo the greatest normalized lai anomalies and total recharge differences with dynamic vegetation while the wet eastern part of the state nf shows much stabler interannual lai and corresponding recharge differences ecoregion also appears to determine how much lai driven et differences are partitioned to recharge versus runoff in the water balance in most ecoregions nearly all of et differences is reflected in recharge differences but in southwestern minnesota sgp a substantial amount of excess water that results from reduced et is likely removed by tile drains before reaching the water table high within ecoregion spatial variability in recharge differences for the two scenarios reveal that local hydrogeological conditions also control the response of recharge to lai anomalies using multivariable linear regression tests we found that hydrogeologic parameters were able to explain significant variability 40 to 50 of the sensitivity of recharge to dynamic vegetation within three out of four ecoregions nf had more varied vegetation types pfts than other ecoregions likely contributing to the poor predictability there of the response of recharge interestingly significant hydrogeologic predictors varied according to the ecoregion with hydraulic conductivity playing an important role in ecoregions where lai driven et differences are mostly partitioned to recharge and calibrated runoff parameters playing an important role where there are major tile drain effects to assess drivers of the vegetation dynamics that affect recharge we examined inter annual climatic factors and found that large springtime temperature anomalies are responsible for the large springtime normalized lai anomalies and recharge differences this reflects the well known relationship between temperature and leaf emergence and cropping schedules in higher latitudes temperature anomalies do not seem to have a similar control on fall time leaf senescence and harvest schedules and precipitation appears to have a minor influence on lai anomalies and recharge responses to vegetation dynamics even in drier regions and seasons our assessment of recharge responses to vegetation dynamics have important implications for recharge predictions under climate change because it reveals that vegetation responses to climate should be accounted for we showed that across a precipitation gradient vegetation leaf out including crop schedules across minnesota is highly sensitive to springtime temperature anomalies and this phenological response can trigger notable changes in et and subsequently recharge although the high sensitivity of vegetation and recharge to temperature suggests that precipitation may be a less important factor at higher mid latitudes the response of recharge differed along the state s precipitation gradient in the drier great plains to the west springtime normalized lai anomalies and corresponding recharge differences were greater than in the wetter eastern part of the state despite having similar magnitude temperature anomalies suggesting greater ecohydrological vulnerability to temperature anomalies with lower precipitation overall our findings indicate that regardless of uncertain future projections of precipitation projected temperature increases will extend growing seasons across minnesota which will exert a decreasing effect on springtime recharge that will be stronger in drier regions of the state as well as where hydraulic conductivity is higher and the effects of tile drains are more minor see
