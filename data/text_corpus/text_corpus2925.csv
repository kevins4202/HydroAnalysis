14625,superoxide radicals o2 have been suggested as an important chain carrier in the radical chain reaction that promotes ozone o3 decomposition to hydroxyl radicals oh during ozonation however due to the difficulty in measuring transient o2 concentrations this hypothesis has not been verified under realistic ozonation conditions during water treatment in this study a probe compound was used in combination with kinetic modeling to evaluate the role of o2 for o3 decomposition during ozonation of synthetic solutions with model promotors and inhibitors methanol and acetate or tert butanol and natural waters one groundwater and two surface waters by measurement of the abatement of spiked tetrachloromethane as a o2 probe the o2 exposure during ozonation was determined based on the measured o2 exposures the relative contribution of o2 to o3 decomposition in comparison to oh oh and dissolved organic matter dom was quantitatively evaluated using kinetic modeling the results show that water compositions e g the concentration of promotors and inhibitors and the o3 reactivity of dom have a considerable effect on the extent of the o2 promoted radical chain reaction during ozonation in general the reaction with o2 accounted for 59 70 and 45 52 of the overall o3 decomposition during ozonation of the selected synthetic solutions and natural waters respectively this confirms that o2 plays a critical role in promoting o3 decomposition to oh overall this study provides new insights on the controlling factors for ozone stability during ozonation processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ozonation ozone stability superoxide radical hydroxyl radical models chain carrier data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the decomposition of aqueous ozone o3 to hydroxyl radicals oh plays a critical role for disinfection and pollutant abatement during ozonation of water and wastewater lim et al 2022 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 it has been suggested that ozone decomposition in water can be characterized by a radical chain reaction and roughly be divided into three steps initiation promotion propagation and inhibition termination acero and von gunten 2001 staehelin and hoigné 1985 in aqueous solutions o3 decomposition is initiated by its reaction with dissolved organic matter dom and or hydroxide oh which can give rise to an initial oh formation initiation the initial oh then mainly reacts with water constituents such as dom moieties and carbonate leading to the formation superoxide radicals o2 eq 1 from some dom moieties or no o2 from some dom moieties and carbonate respectively i e promotion versus inhibition respectively after formation o2 reacts fast with o3 to yield an ozonide radical o3 eq 2 k 2 1 6 109 m 1 s 1 buhler et al 1984 with the ensuing formation of oh eqs 3 and 4 k 3 1 4 103 s 1 and k 4 108 s 1 flyunt et al 2003 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 1 oh promotor promotor ox o 2 2 o 2 o 3 o 2 o 3 3 o 3 o 2 o 4 o h 2 o oh o h this radical chain reaction eqs 1 4 continues to promote o3 decomposition to oh until it is terminated by oh reactions without o2 formation inhibition correspondingly water constituents for which reactions with oh will give rise to o2 or no o2 are conventionally referred to as promotors and inhibitors of the radical chain reaction of o3 decomposition respectively acero and von gunten 2001 staehelin and hoigné 1985 because of its fast reaction with o3 o2 has been hypothesized as an important chain carrier for promotion of o3 decomposition to oh during ozonation staehelin and hoigné 1985 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in a pioneering study staehelin and hoigné 1985 developed a kinetic model that showed the rate of ozone depletion to be first order during ozonation of model solutions containing well defined solutes e g formic acid and tert butanol tba as promotor and inhibitor respectively nevertheless the rate constants of ozone depletion predicted by this model did not agree with the experimentally determined values because the kinetics of the radical initiation reactions are too complex to be simulated staehelin and hoigné 1985 moreover the role of o2 in promoting o3 decomposition during ozonation of real water matrices cannot be evaluated by the previous model because of the complexity of dom with insufficient details on kinetics of o2 formation staehelin and hoigné 1985 so far due to the difficulty in measuring o2 in ozone based processes quantitative evaluation of the role of o2 in o3 decomposition to oh has not been achieved therefore although the o2 promoted chain reaction has been commonly applied to interpret oh formation from o3 decomposition during ozone based processes bing et al 2015 ikhlaq et al 2013 pi et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 more evidence is still needed to support this hypothesis especially during ozonation of real water matrices recent studies have shown that by using chloroform chcl3 or tetrachloromethane ccl4 as o2 probes the o2 exposures during ozonation can be determined guo et al 2021a guo et al 2021b the results obtained in these studies suggest that similarly to the ratio of oh to o3 exposures defined as the rct eq 5 elovitz and von gunten 1999 the ratios of the exposures of o2 and o3 and the exposures of o2 and oh defined as the rso and rsh eqs 6 and 7 remain almost constant for the entire reaction time during ozonation for a given water matrix guo et al 2021a guo et al 2021b 5 r ct oh dt o 3 dt oh o 3 6 r so o 2 dt o 3 dt o 2 o 3 7 r sh o 2 dt oh dt o 2 oh therefore the rct rso and rsh also represent the ratios of transient concentration of o3 oh and o2 during an ozonation process based on the constant rso value and the measured o3 concentrations the evolution of o2 concentrations can be calculated by eq 6 guo et al 2021a these results suggest that this probe method can provide a feasible approach to determine the o2 concentration during ozonation which in turn may allow to assess the role of o2 in promoting o3 decomposition by kinetic modeling based on the probe compound method this study aims to evaluate the role of o2 as a chain carrier for promoting o3 decomposition to oh the decomposition of o3 was firstly evaluated in synthetic solutions containing varying concentrations of methanol and acetate tert butanol meoh and acetate tba see table 1 as radical chain promotors and inhibitors respectively para chlorobenzoic acid pcba as a probe compound for oh and ccl4 for o2 to determine oh and o2 exposures were applied a kinetic model was developed to simulate the kinetics of o3 decomposition and to quantitatively evaluate the role of o2 as the chain carrier in promoting o3 decomposition in synthetic solutions finally the role of o2 was further verified during ozonation of real water matrices groundwater and surface water 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and water samples pcba 4 chloro 7 nitro 1 2 3 benzoxadiazole nbd cl and

xanthine and xanthine oxidase xod and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid detapac with purity 98 were obtained from sigma aldrich usa all other reagents e g ccl4 tba and boric acid were of analytical grade and were purchased from beijing chemical works co china ultrapure water was prepared in a milli q millipore usa nanopure system ozone stock solutions were prepared by sparging an o3 o2 mixture through ultrapure water cooled in an ice bath the concentration of the ozone stock solution was approximately 35 mg l measured with the indigo method bader and hoigne 1981 synthetic solutions with a total oh scavenging rate of 1 2 105 s 1 were prepared using ultrapure water with varying concentrations of meoh and acetate or tba as a chain promotor or inhibitor respectively see table s1 the oh scavenging rate is within the typical range of groundwater and surface water 0 5 1 4 105 s 1 acero et al 2000 acero and von gunten 2001 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wang et al 2018 in addition a groundwater gw and two surface waters sw1 and sw2 were collected in the northwest suburban area of beijing see table 2 for the main water quality parameters 2 2 ozonation experiments ozonation of the synthetic solutions or selected real water samples was conducted in a batch reactor approximately 250 ml of the water samples were added to an airtight acrylic column reactor small volumes of freshly prepared ozone stock solutions were dosed to the water to initiate the oxidation reaction the specific ozone doses were 1 0 mg l for synthetic solutions and 1 0 mg o3 mg doc for the selected groundwater and the surface waters compared with ozonation of the real water matrices a lower ozone dose was used in ozonation of the synthetic solutions because they contained no ozone reactive constituents elovitz and von gunten 1999 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 all experiments were conducted in duplicate at 15 1 c which is within the typical temperature range 10 20 c of real water treatment 2 3 analytical methods the ozone concentration was measured with the indigo method bader and hoigne 1981 pcba concentrations were measured using an ultra performance liquid chromatograph tandem mass spectrometry system api3200 applied biosystems usa as described previously guo et al 2018 ccl4 was extracted with methyltertbutyl ether mtbe and measured with gas chromatography with an electron capture detector gc ecd agilent7890a usa according to the usepa method 551 1 usepa 1985 the electron donating capacity edc of dom in the selected groundwater and surface water was analyzed using a previously published photometric method walpen et al 2020 second order rate constants for the reactions of o 2 with acetate and phosphate k o 2 were determined using the competition kinetics method in a xanthine xanthine oxidase system see si section s2 for more details guo et al 2021b pasternack and halliwell 1979 the o3 exposures o 3 dt eq 8 were obtained from the area under ozone decay curves using the integral function of the origin software version 8 0 originlab von sonntag and von gunten 2012 while oh exposures oh dt and o 2 exposures o 2 dt were calculated using eqs 9 and 10 based on the depletion of pcba 0 63 μm 100 μg l and ccl4 0 32 μm 50 μg l during ozonation guo et al 2021b due to the significantly lower concentrations of pcba and ccl4 than that of meoh and acetate tba in the synthetic solutions or the background constituents e g dom and carbonate in the selected groundwater and surface water see tables 2 and 3 the spiked probes will not impact o3 decomposition

al 2021a note that the oh exposures are typically calculated based on only the depletion of pcba as an oh probe elovitz and von gunten 1999 however a recent study has shown that due to the reaction of o2 with pcba o2 can contribute about 10 to pcba abatement during ozonation guo et al 2021a therefore the contribution of o2 is included in eq 9 to avoid an overestimation of oh exposures in analogy oh is included in the modelling of ccl4 abatement eq 10 although the contribution of oh to ccl4 degradation is usually negligible 1 during ozonation guo et al 2021a 3 results and discussion 3 1 ozone decomposition in the presence of ccl4 as o2 scavenger to qualitatively evaluate the role of o2 in o3 decomposition varying concentrations of ccl4 were added in the synthetic solutions ultrapure water ph 9 buffered with borate 10 mm during ozonation fig s3 shows that with increasing ccl4 concentrations from 0 mm to 6 3 mm the rate of o3 depletion decreased considerably at ph 9 the reaction of o3 with oh gives rise to ho2 and o2 via the formation of the intermediate ho4 eqs 11 and 12 k 11 70 m 1 s 1 k 12 107 s 1 merényi et al 2010 11 o h o 3 ho 4 12 ho 4 ho 2 o 2 the pk a of ho2 is 4 8 eq 13 and therefore it exists essentially as o2 at ph 9 staehelin and hoigné 1982 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 13 ho 2 h o 2 the formed o2 can promote o3 decomposition via the radical chain reaction eqs 1 4 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 as reported in table 1 ccl4 does not react with o3 or oh but mainly with o2 the second order rate constant for the reaction of o2 with ccl4 k 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 is similar to the reaction with o3 k 1 6 109 m 1 s 1 buhler et al 1984 see si for more information on the reaction of ccl4 with o2 it is therefore expected that increasing ccl4 concentrations will enhance quenching of o2 thereby slowing down but not fully suppressing the radical chain reaction that promotes o3 decomposition with ensuing oh formation fig s3 note that the reaction of oh with o3 is very slow k 70 m 1 s 1 staehelin and hoigné 1982 at ph 9 the rate of oh induced o3 decomposition k 7 10 4 s 1 t1 2 103 s is only about one third of the rate of o3 depletion observed when the highest concentration of ccl4 was added in the solution k obs 1 9 10 3 s 1 see si fig s3 this difference suggests that the o2 promoted o3 decomposition is not fully suppressed at the applied ccl4 concentration or there are some impurities in the synthetic solutions that may initiate the o3 decomposition ultrapure water itself but also impurities in the used chemicals may contribute to this 3 2 ozonation of synthetic solutions to further evaluate the role of o2 in promoting o3 decomposition varying concentrations of meoh and acetate or tba see section s6 si were added as radical chain promotor and inhibitor in synthetic solutions respectively as reported in table 1 meoh acetate and tba react poorly with o3 but significantly with oh in presence of o2 which is present at high concentrations during ozonation the reaction of meoh with oh proceeds mainly by a h abstraction mechanism and releases o2 rabani et al 1974 in contrast the dominant reaction pathways of acetate and tba with oh do not yield o2 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the addition of meoh and acetate tba can thus promote and inhibit the o2 induced radical chain reaction of o3 decomposition during ozonation respectively elovitz and von gunten 1999 gulde et al 2021 staehelin and hoigné 1985 fig 1 a shows that with decreasing oh scavenging ratios for the promotor and inhibitor k oh meoh k oh acetate referred to as p i hereafter the rate of o3 depletion decreases during ozonation of the synthetic solutions consequently for the same applied o3 dose 1 mg l the reaction time for complete ozone depletion increased gradually from 20 min for the solution containing only the promotor meoh to 30 min for only the inhibitor acetate these changes can be attributed to the fact that with decreasing p i ratios higher fractions of oh generated during ozonation are scavenged by the inhibitor which results in more significant termination of the radical chain reaction staehelin and hoigné 1985 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for decreasing p i ratios the rate of ozone depletion was smaller with a corresponding lower depletion kinetics and final abatement efficiencies for pcba and ccl4 fig 1b and c due to their low o3 reactivity and different reactivity with oh and o2 table 1 pcba or ccl4 are mainly abated by the reaction with oh or o2 during ozonation respectively guo et al 2021a the results shown in fig 1b and c suggest that an increase of the extent of inhibition impedes the conversion of o3 to o2 and consequently to oh and therefore the abatement of ozone resistant pollutant is less efficient based on the evolution of o3 pcba and ccl4 observed during ozonation of synthetic solutions the o3 oh and o2 exposures during ozonation were calculated by eqs 8 10 and are shown in the inset of fig 1a c as the kinetics of o3 depletion decreased with decreasing p i ratios higher o3 exposures were obtained in contrast the oh and o2 exposures decreased with decreasing the p i ratios during ozonation because of a smaller contribution of oh scavenging by meoh which led to a lower formation of o2 notably for a given p i ratio the ratios between o3 oh and o2 exposures rct rso and rsh remained almost constant during the entire ozonation process fig 2 a c the time independence of rct rso and rsh suggest that the ratios between o3 oh and o2 transient concentrations also remain constant elovitz and von gunten 1999 guo et al 2021b consequently the evolution of oh and o2 concentrations during ozonation can be modelled by eqs 5 and 6 based on the observed o3 depletion curves and rct and rso values see fig 2d for p i 1 1 and si fig s4 for other p i ratios as shown in fig 2d the calculated transient concentrations of oh and o2 decreased generally in parallel with o3 concentrations during ozonation of the synthetic solutions in agreement with previous findings elovitz and von gunten 1999 guo et al 2021a guo et al 2021b fig 2a and b show that the rct and rso values increased with increasing p i ratios of the synthetic solutions while the rsh was very similar 5 0 5 4 see fig 2c and table 3 in all cases the increase of rct and rso with increasing p i ratios can be mainly attributed to the acceleration of o3 decomposition in the presence of higher concentrations of promotor staehelin and hoigné 1985 as shown in fig s5a for the same o3 dose 0 021mm and total oh scavenging rate 1 2 105 s 1 o3 decomposed more quickly in solutions for higher p i ratios corresponding to the faster o3 decomposition higher oh and o2 concentrations were observed during the early stage of ozonation of synthetic solutions at higher p i ratios figs s5b and c and higher oh and o2 exposures were obtained when ozone depletion was completed fig 1b and c these observations confirm that the transformation of o3 to o2 and oh is enhanced in the solutions with higher p i ratios which leads to an enhanced abatement of ozone resistant compounds e g pcba shown in fig 1b unlike rct and rso the rsh is almost independent of the p i ratios during ozonation of the synthetic solutions fig 2c this observation can be possibly attributed to the interconversion of oh and o2 through the radical chain cycle i e oh reacts with promotors to form o2 which can then react with o3 to produce new oh staehelin and hoigné 1985 as reported in table 1 o3 does not react with meoh and acetate in contrast o3 reacts with high second order rate constants with oh k 1 1 108 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 sehested et al 1984 staehelin et al 1984 and o2 k 1 6 109 m 1 s 1 buhler et al 1984 therefore o3 depletion is expected to be mainly caused by its reactions with oh and o2 staehelin and hoigné 1985 in addition some o3 may decompose by the reaction with oh although this reaction is usually insignificant at circumneutral ph due to its low second order rate constant k 70 m 1 s 1 staehelin and hoigné 1982 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 overall the depletion of o3 during ozonation of the synthetic solutions can be described by eq 14 14 d o 3 dt k o h o h o 3 k oh oh o 3 k o 2 o 2 o 3 integration of eq 14 yields eq 15 15 ln o 3 o 3 0 k o h o h t k oh oh dt k o 2 o 2 dt based on the oh concentration and oh and o 2 exposures observed during ozonation of the synthetic solutions with the varying p i ratios the evolution of measured and modeled o3 concentrations eq 15 was compared fig 3 a e in general the model satisfactorily simulated the ozone depletion kinetics during the experiments although slight deviations were observed at a later stage of ozonation of the solutions that had the highest concentrations of inhibitor acetate or tba fig 3e and si fig s10e these observations suggest that the model reasonably represents the main routes of o3 decomposition in the synthetic solutions and the slight deviations at the later stage of ozonation can possibly be attributed to the fact that some reactions that can contribute to o3 consumption are not considered in the model eq 15 these could be reactions of o3 with meoh and acetate tba derived transformation products flyunt et al 2003 staehelin and hoigné 1985 or reactions with impurities in the synthetic solutions for example the reaction of tba with oh yields about 30 h2o2 which influences the ozone stability acero and von gunten 2000 such reactions may become non negligible at a later stage of ozonation of synthetic solutions especially when the o3 decay kinetics is slow at high inhibitor concentrations note that singlet oxygen 1o2 and other radicals e g o3 are not considered in the model because they play a negligible role for o3 decomposition due to their low reactivity and or concentrations in the investigated reaction systems guo et al 2022 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the second order rate constants for the reaction of oh with o3 reported in literature vary considerably from 1 1 108 m 1 s 1 to 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 bahnemann and hart 1982 sehested et al 1984 staehelin et al 1984 and the simulations shown in fig 3 were performed with a value of 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 bahnemann and hart 1982 simulations using the lower value of 1 1 108 m 1 s 1 sehested et al 1984 resulted in significantly slower o3 depletion kinetics compared to the experimental results see si fig s6 therefore based on these model calculations the higher second order rate constant for the oh o3 reaction 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 seems more likely based on the oh and o2 exposures observed during ozonation the fraction of ozone decay by the reactions with oh f o h oh f oh or o2 f o 2 were estimated using eqs 16 18 respectively 16 f o h k o h o h t k o h o h t k oh oh dt k o 2 o 2 dt 17 f oh k oh oh dt k o h o h t k oh oh dt k o 2 o 2 dt 18 f o 2 k o 2 o 2 dt k o h o h t k oh oh dt k o 2 o 2 dt as shown in fig 3f j the reaction of o2 with o3 is the main pathway for ozone consumption during ozonation of the synthetic solutions f o 2 59 70 while the reactions with oh and oh contribute only moderately or marginally f oh 22 27 and f o h 7 19 in addition the results show that with decreasing the p i ratios the relative importance of oh and o2 for ozone depletion decrease while the importance of oh increase slightly this change can be attributed to the decrease of oh and o2 exposures at the lower p i ratios see fig 1b and c insets 3 3 ozonation of natural waters to evaluate the role of o2 during ozonation of real water matrices groundwater and surface water samples with different water qualities were collected and tested table 2 during ozonation of the selected groundwater and surface waters a specific ozone dose of 1 mg o3 mg doc was applied which corresponds to ozone doses of 2 3 3 8 and 5 7 mg l for gw sw1 and sw2 respectively in contrast to ozonation of the synthetic solutions where ozone depletion can generally be described by pseudo first order kinetics fig 1a in real waters ozone depletion exhibited a rapid initial demand followed by slower pseudo first order kinetics fig 4 a this difference can be mainly attributed to the presence of ozone reactive dom moieties e g phenols in the real water matrices houska et al 2021 in contrast to meoh and acetate which are essentially non reactive with o3 see table 1 such dom moieties react rapidly with o3 e g k o3 app 105 m 1 s 1 for many phenolic moieties von sonntag and von gunten 2012 and can thus result in a rapid depletion of o3 in the first few seconds of ozonation i e the instantaneous ozone demand iod table 4 the phenol content of dom in the selected groundwater and surface water was estimated based on the electron donating capacity measured with abts as chemical oxidant walpen et al 2020 as reported in table 4 the edc values were 4 1 8 1 and 7 6 mmole gc for gw sw1 and sw2 respectively these values are generally comparable to those reported for dom isolates from natural water e g 3 89 6 93 mmole gc for suwannee river ii standard humic acid and aquatic natural organic matter houska et al 2021 considering the doc concentration of the three water matrices table 2 this corresponds to 9 3 31 0 and 43 3 μm of phenolic moieties in the solutions of gw sw1 and sw2 consistent with an increasing phenol content the iod and o3 depletion kinetics increased in the order of gw sw1 sw2 table 4 and fig 4a these results suggest that the fast reacting dom content plays an important role in ozone depletion especially in the initial phase of ozonation of real water matrices similar to ozonation of synthetic solutions fig 1 the concentrations of pcba and ccl4 decreased generally in parallel with decreasing o3 concentrations during ozonation of the selected groundwater and surface waters fig 4 based on the depletion of o3 pcba and ccl4 the corresponding o3 oh and o2 exposures were calculated and are shown in the insets of fig 4a c the ratios of the o3 oh and o2 exposures are also constant for most of the duration of the ozonation of the groundwater and the surface waters fig s11 si compared with the two surface waters especially sw1 the groundwater had a lower rct and rso table 4 this difference can be possibly attributed to the higher carbonate content of gw compared to sw1 and sw2 table 2 as reported in table 2 carbonate bicarbonate accounted for a large fraction of the total oh scavenging rate 48 for the gw carbonate is a well known inhibitor which does not lead to the generation of o2 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 therefore carbonate bicarbonate interrupts the radical chain reaction that promotes o3 decomposition to oh resulting in a lower rct and rso for gw than sw1 and sw2 similarly to the synthetic waters with a higher oh scavenging fraction of acetate during ozonation of natural water o3 reacts with dissolved water constituents mainly dom simultaneously with oh oh and o2 therefore the kinetics of the depletion of o3 during ozonation of the groundwater and surface waters can be described by eq 19 for simplicity the reactions of o3 with dissolved water constituents are summarized by the reaction with dom 19 d o 3 dt k o h o h o 3 k oh oh o 3 k o 2 o 2 o 3 k dom dom o 3 rearranging and integrating eq 19 yields eq 20 20 ln o 3 o 3 0 k o h o h t k oh oh dt k o 2 o 2 dt k dom dom dt due to the complex composition of dom the second order rate constant for the reaction of o3 with dom k dom is not available to simulate the decomposition kinetics of o3 during ozonation of the three real water matrices therefore the relative contribution of oh f o h oh f oh o2 f o 2 and dom fdom to o3 depletion during ozonation of the selected natural waters are calculated by eqs 21 24 based on the o3 concentrations and the exposures of oh oh and o2 observed during the ozonation process see fig 5 21 f o h k o h o h t ln o 3 o 3 0 22 f oh k oh oh dt ln o 3 o 3 0 23 f k o 2 o 2 dt ln o 3 o 3 0 24 f dom 1 f o h f oh f o 2 although there are errors associated with this approach due to uncertainties of literature reported rate constants and experimental errors in determining oh and o2 exposures the modelling results are acceptable for a preliminary estimation of the contribution of oh oh o2 and dom to o3 decomposition during ozonation figure 5a c show that the initial o3 depletion in the iod period 10 s is mainly attributed to the reaction of o3 with dom then f o 2 increases quickly and reaches 45 52 at the end of ozonation of the selected groundwater and surface waters meanwhile the direct reaction of o3 with dom was estimated to contribute 36 40 to the overall ozone depletion whereas oh and oh contributed 12 15 and 3 7 respectively these data demonstrate that the o2 promoted radical chain reaction also plays an important role in o3 decomposition during ozonation of real water matrices notably fig 5a c show that after a quick increase in the first few minutes 5 min for gw and 3 min for sw1 and sw2 f o 2 decreased slightly during ozonation of the selected groundwater and surface waters this observation can be possibly attributed to the change of dom compositions during ozonation pocostales et al 2010 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 as shown in fig 5 the initial rapid o3 depletion during ozonation is mainly caused by dom which can be attributed to the fast reaction of o3 with electron rich dom moieties e g phenols in the real water matrices part of the reaction of o3 with electron rich moieties occurs by an electron transfer mechanism to yield o3 which then gives rise to a high initial oh formation initiation buffle et al 2006 buffle and von gunten 2006 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the generated primary oh can then react with many moieties in dom e g aromatic moieties and aliphatic c h bonds in dom to form o2 and thus promote the radical chain reaction to accelerate o3 decomposition to secondary oh staehelin and hoigné 1985 due to the high oh yield from the fast reaction of phenolic moieties with o3 large amounts of o2 can be quickly produced from the ensuing reaction of oh with promotors during the early phase of ozonation consequently both f oh and f o 2 increases quickly during the initial stage of ozonation fig 5 however as the fast o3 reacting moieties in the water matrices are depleted the reaction of o3 with dom is controlled by reactions that do not lead to o3 and thus primary oh formation therefore oh and o2 are mostly slowly formed by the promotion pathway in the later phase of ozonation nothe et al 2009 staehelin and hoigné 1985 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 consequently both f oh and f o 2 decreased slightly during the later phase of ozonation where o3 decomposition is mainly driven by the slower reaction of o3 with non oh generating dom subunits these observations suggest that due to changes of dom composition during ozonation the mechanism of o3 decomposition e g by direct reactions with dom or by the o2 promoted radical chain reaction can change considerably this change can in turn influence the oh formation and pollutant abatement during water treatment by ozonation and therefore has to be taken into account when interpreting ozonation results pocostales et al 2010 staehelin and hoigné 1985 it has often been shown that o3 refractory micropollutants are more quickly abated during the initial phase of ozonation especially in the instantaneous ozone demand iod period when fast o3 reacting dom is still present in the water matrix than during the later phase when the fast o3 reacting dom is depleted acero and von gunten 2001 guo et al 2021a it has been measured previously with quench flow systems that the rct during the initial phase is very high on the order of 10 6 buffle et al 2006 buffle and von gunten 2006 the significant oh formation in this phase can thus promote the abatement of ozone refractory micropollutants in contrast due to the decrease in oh formation from the o2 promoted radical chain reaction thereafter the abatement of ozone refractory micropollutants is usually slow at the later phase of ozonation 4 conclusions based on a novel approach to measure transient concentrations of o2 this study supports the hypothesis that they play a critical role in promoting o3 decomposition during ozonation by combination of a probe compound based experimental and kinetic model the decomposition kinetics of o3 in synthetic solutions with varying ratios of model promotor and inhibitor compounds can be well simulated in addition the role of o2 for o3 decomposition to oh under realistic ozonation conditions of groundwater and surface water can be quantitatively evaluated which shows that approximately half 45 52 of the overall o3 decomposition occurs through the o2 promoted radical chain reaction these results present a direct evidence that o2 is important for o3 decomposition kinetics and oh formation in synthetic and real waters and provide new insights to understand the controlling factors for ozone stability during ozonation processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial

14625,superoxide radicals o2 have been suggested as an important chain carrier in the radical chain reaction that promotes ozone o3 decomposition to hydroxyl radicals oh during ozonation however due to the difficulty in measuring transient o2 concentrations this hypothesis has not been verified under realistic ozonation conditions during water treatment in this study a probe compound was used in combination with kinetic modeling to evaluate the role of o2 for o3 decomposition during ozonation of synthetic solutions with model promotors and inhibitors methanol and acetate or tert butanol and natural waters one groundwater and two surface waters by measurement of the abatement of spiked tetrachloromethane as a o2 probe the o2 exposure during ozonation was determined based on the measured o2 exposures the relative contribution of o2 to o3 decomposition in comparison to oh oh and dissolved organic matter dom was quantitatively evaluated using kinetic modeling the results show that water compositions e g the concentration of promotors and inhibitors and the o3 reactivity of dom have a considerable effect on the extent of the o2 promoted radical chain reaction during ozonation in general the reaction with o2 accounted for 59 70 and 45 52 of the overall o3 decomposition during ozonation of the selected synthetic solutions and natural waters respectively this confirms that o2 plays a critical role in promoting o3 decomposition to oh overall this study provides new insights on the controlling factors for ozone stability during ozonation processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ozonation ozone stability superoxide radical hydroxyl radical models chain carrier data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the decomposition of aqueous ozone o3 to hydroxyl radicals oh plays a critical role for disinfection and pollutant abatement during ozonation of water and wastewater lim et al 2022 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 it has been suggested that ozone decomposition in water can be characterized by a radical chain reaction and roughly be divided into three steps initiation promotion propagation and inhibition termination acero and von gunten 2001 staehelin and hoigné 1985 in aqueous solutions o3 decomposition is initiated by its reaction with dissolved organic matter dom and or hydroxide oh which can give rise to an initial oh formation initiation the initial oh then mainly reacts with water constituents such as dom moieties and carbonate leading to the formation superoxide radicals o2 eq 1 from some dom moieties or no o2 from some dom moieties and carbonate respectively i e promotion versus inhibition respectively after formation o2 reacts fast with o3 to yield an ozonide radical o3 eq 2 k 2 1 6 109 m 1 s 1 buhler et al 1984 with the ensuing formation of oh eqs 3 and 4 k 3 1 4 103 s 1 and k 4 108 s 1 flyunt et al 2003 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 1 oh promotor promotor ox o 2 2 o 2 o 3 o 2 o 3 3 o 3 o 2 o 4 o h 2 o oh o h this radical chain reaction eqs 1 4 continues to promote o3 decomposition to oh until it is terminated by oh reactions without o2 formation inhibition correspondingly water constituents for which reactions with oh will give rise to o2 or no o2 are conventionally referred to as promotors and inhibitors of the radical chain reaction of o3 decomposition respectively acero and von gunten 2001 staehelin and hoigné 1985 because of its fast reaction with o3 o2 has been hypothesized as an important chain carrier for promotion of o3 decomposition to oh during ozonation staehelin and hoigné 1985 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in a pioneering study staehelin and hoigné 1985 developed a kinetic model that showed the rate of ozone depletion to be first order during ozonation of model solutions containing well defined solutes e g formic acid and tert butanol tba as promotor and inhibitor respectively nevertheless the rate constants of ozone depletion predicted by this model did not agree with the experimentally determined values because the kinetics of the radical initiation reactions are too complex to be simulated staehelin and hoigné 1985 moreover the role of o2 in promoting o3 decomposition during ozonation of real water matrices cannot be evaluated by the previous model because of the complexity of dom with insufficient details on kinetics of o2 formation staehelin and hoigné 1985 so far due to the difficulty in measuring o2 in ozone based processes quantitative evaluation of the role of o2 in o3 decomposition to oh has not been achieved therefore although the o2 promoted chain reaction has been commonly applied to interpret oh formation from o3 decomposition during ozone based processes bing et al 2015 ikhlaq et al 2013 pi et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 more evidence is still needed to support this hypothesis especially during ozonation of real water matrices recent studies have shown that by using chloroform chcl3 or tetrachloromethane ccl4 as o2 probes the o2 exposures during ozonation can be determined guo et al 2021a guo et al 2021b the results obtained in these studies suggest that similarly to the ratio of oh to o3 exposures defined as the rct eq 5 elovitz and von gunten 1999 the ratios of the exposures of o2 and o3 and the exposures of o2 and oh defined as the rso and rsh eqs 6 and 7 remain almost constant for the entire reaction time during ozonation for a given water matrix guo et al 2021a guo et al 2021b 5 r ct oh dt o 3 dt oh o 3 6 r so o 2 dt o 3 dt o 2 o 3 7 r sh o 2 dt oh dt o 2 oh therefore the rct rso and rsh also represent the ratios of transient concentration of o3 oh and o2 during an ozonation process based on the constant rso value and the measured o3 concentrations the evolution of o2 concentrations can be calculated by eq 6 guo et al 2021a these results suggest that this probe method can provide a feasible approach to determine the o2 concentration during ozonation which in turn may allow to assess the role of o2 in promoting o3 decomposition by kinetic modeling based on the probe compound method this study aims to evaluate the role of o2 as a chain carrier for promoting o3 decomposition to oh the decomposition of o3 was firstly evaluated in synthetic solutions containing varying concentrations of methanol and acetate tert butanol meoh and acetate tba see table 1 as radical chain promotors and inhibitors respectively para chlorobenzoic acid pcba as a probe compound for oh and ccl4 for o2 to determine oh and o2 exposures were applied a kinetic model was developed to simulate the kinetics of o3 decomposition and to quantitatively evaluate the role of o2 as the chain carrier in promoting o3 decomposition in synthetic solutions finally the role of o2 was further verified during ozonation of real water matrices groundwater and surface water 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and water samples pcba 4 chloro 7 nitro 1 2 3 benzoxadiazole nbd cl and

xanthine and xanthine oxidase xod and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid detapac with purity 98 were obtained from sigma aldrich usa all other reagents e g ccl4 tba and boric acid were of analytical grade and were purchased from beijing chemical works co china ultrapure water was prepared in a milli q millipore usa nanopure system ozone stock solutions were prepared by sparging an o3 o2 mixture through ultrapure water cooled in an ice bath the concentration of the ozone stock solution was approximately 35 mg l measured with the indigo method bader and hoigne 1981 synthetic solutions with a total oh scavenging rate of 1 2 105 s 1 were prepared using ultrapure water with varying concentrations of meoh and acetate or tba as a chain promotor or inhibitor respectively see table s1 the oh scavenging rate is within the typical range of groundwater and surface water 0 5 1 4 105 s 1 acero et al 2000 acero and von gunten 2001 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wang et al 2018 in addition a groundwater gw and two surface waters sw1 and sw2 were collected in the northwest suburban area of beijing see table 2 for the main water quality parameters 2 2 ozonation experiments ozonation of the synthetic solutions or selected real water samples was conducted in a batch reactor approximately 250 ml of the water samples were added to an airtight acrylic column reactor small volumes of freshly prepared ozone stock solutions were dosed to the water to initiate the oxidation reaction the specific ozone doses were 1 0 mg l for synthetic solutions and 1 0 mg o3 mg doc for the selected groundwater and the surface waters compared with ozonation of the real water matrices a lower ozone dose was used in ozonation of the synthetic solutions because they contained no ozone reactive constituents elovitz and von gunten 1999 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 all experiments were conducted in duplicate at 15 1 c which is within the typical temperature range 10 20 c of real water treatment 2 3 analytical methods the ozone concentration was measured with the indigo method bader and hoigne 1981 pcba concentrations were measured using an ultra performance liquid chromatograph tandem mass spectrometry system api3200 applied biosystems usa as described previously guo et al 2018 ccl4 was extracted with methyltertbutyl ether mtbe and measured with gas chromatography with an electron capture detector gc ecd agilent7890a usa according to the usepa method 551 1 usepa 1985 the electron donating capacity edc of dom in the selected groundwater and surface water was analyzed using a previously published photometric method walpen et al 2020 second order rate constants for the reactions of o 2 with acetate and phosphate k o 2 were determined using the competition kinetics method in a xanthine xanthine oxidase system see si section s2 for more details guo et al 2021b pasternack and halliwell 1979 the o3 exposures o 3 dt eq 8 were obtained from the area under ozone decay curves using the integral function of the origin software version 8 0 originlab von sonntag and von gunten 2012 while oh exposures oh dt and o 2 exposures o 2 dt were calculated using eqs 9 and 10 based on the depletion of pcba 0 63 μm 100 μg l and ccl4 0 32 μm 50 μg l during ozonation guo et al 2021b due to the significantly lower concentrations of pcba and ccl4 than that of meoh and acetate tba in the synthetic solutions or the background constituents e g dom and carbonate in the selected groundwater and surface water see tables 2 and 3 the spiked probes will not impact o3 decomposition

al 2021a note that the oh exposures are typically calculated based on only the depletion of pcba as an oh probe elovitz and von gunten 1999 however a recent study has shown that due to the reaction of o2 with pcba o2 can contribute about 10 to pcba abatement during ozonation guo et al 2021a therefore the contribution of o2 is included in eq 9 to avoid an overestimation of oh exposures in analogy oh is included in the modelling of ccl4 abatement eq 10 although the contribution of oh to ccl4 degradation is usually negligible 1 during ozonation guo et al 2021a 3 results and discussion 3 1 ozone decomposition in the presence of ccl4 as o2 scavenger to qualitatively evaluate the role of o2 in o3 decomposition varying concentrations of ccl4 were added in the synthetic solutions ultrapure water ph 9 buffered with borate 10 mm during ozonation fig s3 shows that with increasing ccl4 concentrations from 0 mm to 6 3 mm the rate of o3 depletion decreased considerably at ph 9 the reaction of o3 with oh gives rise to ho2 and o2 via the formation of the intermediate ho4 eqs 11 and 12 k 11 70 m 1 s 1 k 12 107 s 1 merényi et al 2010 11 o h o 3 ho 4 12 ho 4 ho 2 o 2 the pk a of ho2 is 4 8 eq 13 and therefore it exists essentially as o2 at ph 9 staehelin and hoigné 1982 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 13 ho 2 h o 2 the formed o2 can promote o3 decomposition via the radical chain reaction eqs 1 4 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 as reported in table 1 ccl4 does not react with o3 or oh but mainly with o2 the second order rate constant for the reaction of o2 with ccl4 k 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 is similar to the reaction with o3 k 1 6 109 m 1 s 1 buhler et al 1984 see si for more information on the reaction of ccl4 with o2 it is therefore expected that increasing ccl4 concentrations will enhance quenching of o2 thereby slowing down but not fully suppressing the radical chain reaction that promotes o3 decomposition with ensuing oh formation fig s3 note that the reaction of oh with o3 is very slow k 70 m 1 s 1 staehelin and hoigné 1982 at ph 9 the rate of oh induced o3 decomposition k 7 10 4 s 1 t1 2 103 s is only about one third of the rate of o3 depletion observed when the highest concentration of ccl4 was added in the solution k obs 1 9 10 3 s 1 see si fig s3 this difference suggests that the o2 promoted o3 decomposition is not fully suppressed at the applied ccl4 concentration or there are some impurities in the synthetic solutions that may initiate the o3 decomposition ultrapure water itself but also impurities in the used chemicals may contribute to this 3 2 ozonation of synthetic solutions to further evaluate the role of o2 in promoting o3 decomposition varying concentrations of meoh and acetate or tba see section s6 si were added as radical chain promotor and inhibitor in synthetic solutions respectively as reported in table 1 meoh acetate and tba react poorly with o3 but significantly with oh in presence of o2 which is present at high concentrations during ozonation the reaction of meoh with oh proceeds mainly by a h abstraction mechanism and releases o2 rabani et al 1974 in contrast the dominant reaction pathways of acetate and tba with oh do not yield o2 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the addition of meoh and acetate tba can thus promote and inhibit the o2 induced radical chain reaction of o3 decomposition during ozonation respectively elovitz and von gunten 1999 gulde et al 2021 staehelin and hoigné 1985 fig 1 a shows that with decreasing oh scavenging ratios for the promotor and inhibitor k oh meoh k oh acetate referred to as p i hereafter the rate of o3 depletion decreases during ozonation of the synthetic solutions consequently for the same applied o3 dose 1 mg l the reaction time for complete ozone depletion increased gradually from 20 min for the solution containing only the promotor meoh to 30 min for only the inhibitor acetate these changes can be attributed to the fact that with decreasing p i ratios higher fractions of oh generated during ozonation are scavenged by the inhibitor which results in more significant termination of the radical chain reaction staehelin and hoigné 1985 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for decreasing p i ratios the rate of ozone depletion was smaller with a corresponding lower depletion kinetics and final abatement efficiencies for pcba and ccl4 fig 1b and c due to their low o3 reactivity and different reactivity with oh and o2 table 1 pcba or ccl4 are mainly abated by the reaction with oh or o2 during ozonation respectively guo et al 2021a the results shown in fig 1b and c suggest that an increase of the extent of inhibition impedes the conversion of o3 to o2 and consequently to oh and therefore the abatement of ozone resistant pollutant is less efficient based on the evolution of o3 pcba and ccl4 observed during ozonation of synthetic solutions the o3 oh and o2 exposures during ozonation were calculated by eqs 8 10 and are shown in the inset of fig 1a c as the kinetics of o3 depletion decreased with decreasing p i ratios higher o3 exposures were obtained in contrast the oh and o2 exposures decreased with decreasing the p i ratios during ozonation because of a smaller contribution of oh scavenging by meoh which led to a lower formation of o2 notably for a given p i ratio the ratios between o3 oh and o2 exposures rct rso and rsh remained almost constant during the entire ozonation process fig 2 a c the time independence of rct rso and rsh suggest that the ratios between o3 oh and o2 transient concentrations also remain constant elovitz and von gunten 1999 guo et al 2021b consequently the evolution of oh and o2 concentrations during ozonation can be modelled by eqs 5 and 6 based on the observed o3 depletion curves and rct and rso values see fig 2d for p i 1 1 and si fig s4 for other p i ratios as shown in fig 2d the calculated transient concentrations of oh and o2 decreased generally in parallel with o3 concentrations during ozonation of the synthetic solutions in agreement with previous findings elovitz and von gunten 1999 guo et al 2021a guo et al 2021b fig 2a and b show that the rct and rso values increased with increasing p i ratios of the synthetic solutions while the rsh was very similar 5 0 5 4 see fig 2c and table 3 in all cases the increase of rct and rso with increasing p i ratios can be mainly attributed to the acceleration of o3 decomposition in the presence of higher concentrations of promotor staehelin and hoigné 1985 as shown in fig s5a for the same o3 dose 0 021mm and total oh scavenging rate 1 2 105 s 1 o3 decomposed more quickly in solutions for higher p i ratios corresponding to the faster o3 decomposition higher oh and o2 concentrations were observed during the early stage of ozonation of synthetic solutions at higher p i ratios figs s5b and c and higher oh and o2 exposures were obtained when ozone depletion was completed fig 1b and c these observations confirm that the transformation of o3 to o2 and oh is enhanced in the solutions with higher p i ratios which leads to an enhanced abatement of ozone resistant compounds e g pcba shown in fig 1b unlike rct and rso the rsh is almost independent of the p i ratios during ozonation of the synthetic solutions fig 2c this observation can be possibly attributed to the interconversion of oh and o2 through the radical chain cycle i e oh reacts with promotors to form o2 which can then react with o3 to produce new oh staehelin and hoigné 1985 as reported in table 1 o3 does not react with meoh and acetate in contrast o3 reacts with high second order rate constants with oh k 1 1 108 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 sehested et al 1984 staehelin et al 1984 and o2 k 1 6 109 m 1 s 1 buhler et al 1984 therefore o3 depletion is expected to be mainly caused by its reactions with oh and o2 staehelin and hoigné 1985 in addition some o3 may decompose by the reaction with oh although this reaction is usually insignificant at circumneutral ph due to its low second order rate constant k 70 m 1 s 1 staehelin and hoigné 1982 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 overall the depletion of o3 during ozonation of the synthetic solutions can be described by eq 14 14 d o 3 dt k o h o h o 3 k oh oh o 3 k o 2 o 2 o 3 integration of eq 14 yields eq 15 15 ln o 3 o 3 0 k o h o h t k oh oh dt k o 2 o 2 dt based on the oh concentration and oh and o 2 exposures observed during ozonation of the synthetic solutions with the varying p i ratios the evolution of measured and modeled o3 concentrations eq 15 was compared fig 3 a e in general the model satisfactorily simulated the ozone depletion kinetics during the experiments although slight deviations were observed at a later stage of ozonation of the solutions that had the highest concentrations of inhibitor acetate or tba fig 3e and si fig s10e these observations suggest that the model reasonably represents the main routes of o3 decomposition in the synthetic solutions and the slight deviations at the later stage of ozonation can possibly be attributed to the fact that some reactions that can contribute to o3 consumption are not considered in the model eq 15 these could be reactions of o3 with meoh and acetate tba derived transformation products flyunt et al 2003 staehelin and hoigné 1985 or reactions with impurities in the synthetic solutions for example the reaction of tba with oh yields about 30 h2o2 which influences the ozone stability acero and von gunten 2000 such reactions may become non negligible at a later stage of ozonation of synthetic solutions especially when the o3 decay kinetics is slow at high inhibitor concentrations note that singlet oxygen 1o2 and other radicals e g o3 are not considered in the model because they play a negligible role for o3 decomposition due to their low reactivity and or concentrations in the investigated reaction systems guo et al 2022 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the second order rate constants for the reaction of oh with o3 reported in literature vary considerably from 1 1 108 m 1 s 1 to 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 bahnemann and hart 1982 sehested et al 1984 staehelin et al 1984 and the simulations shown in fig 3 were performed with a value of 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 bahnemann and hart 1982 simulations using the lower value of 1 1 108 m 1 s 1 sehested et al 1984 resulted in significantly slower o3 depletion kinetics compared to the experimental results see si fig s6 therefore based on these model calculations the higher second order rate constant for the oh o3 reaction 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 seems more likely based on the oh and o2 exposures observed during ozonation the fraction of ozone decay by the reactions with oh f o h oh f oh or o2 f o 2 were estimated using eqs 16 18 respectively 16 f o h k o h o h t k o h o h t k oh oh dt k o 2 o 2 dt 17 f oh k oh oh dt k o h o h t k oh oh dt k o 2 o 2 dt 18 f o 2 k o 2 o 2 dt k o h o h t k oh oh dt k o 2 o 2 dt as shown in fig 3f j the reaction of o2 with o3 is the main pathway for ozone consumption during ozonation of the synthetic solutions f o 2 59 70 while the reactions with oh and oh contribute only moderately or marginally f oh 22 27 and f o h 7 19 in addition the results show that with decreasing the p i ratios the relative importance of oh and o2 for ozone depletion decrease while the importance of oh increase slightly this change can be attributed to the decrease of oh and o2 exposures at the lower p i ratios see fig 1b and c insets 3 3 ozonation of natural waters to evaluate the role of o2 during ozonation of real water matrices groundwater and surface water samples with different water qualities were collected and tested table 2 during ozonation of the selected groundwater and surface waters a specific ozone dose of 1 mg o3 mg doc was applied which corresponds to ozone doses of 2 3 3 8 and 5 7 mg l for gw sw1 and sw2 respectively in contrast to ozonation of the synthetic solutions where ozone depletion can generally be described by pseudo first order kinetics fig 1a in real waters ozone depletion exhibited a rapid initial demand followed by slower pseudo first order kinetics fig 4 a this difference can be mainly attributed to the presence of ozone reactive dom moieties e g phenols in the real water matrices houska et al 2021 in contrast to meoh and acetate which are essentially non reactive with o3 see table 1 such dom moieties react rapidly with o3 e g k o3 app 105 m 1 s 1 for many phenolic moieties von sonntag and von gunten 2012 and can thus result in a rapid depletion of o3 in the first few seconds of ozonation i e the instantaneous ozone demand iod table 4 the phenol content of dom in the selected groundwater and surface water was estimated based on the electron donating capacity measured with abts as chemical oxidant walpen et al 2020 as reported in table 4 the edc values were 4 1 8 1 and 7 6 mmole gc for gw sw1 and sw2 respectively these values are generally comparable to those reported for dom isolates from natural water e g 3 89 6 93 mmole gc for suwannee river ii standard humic acid and aquatic natural organic matter houska et al 2021 considering the doc concentration of the three water matrices table 2 this corresponds to 9 3 31 0 and 43 3 μm of phenolic moieties in the solutions of gw sw1 and sw2 consistent with an increasing phenol content the iod and o3 depletion kinetics increased in the order of gw sw1 sw2 table 4 and fig 4a these results suggest that the fast reacting dom content plays an important role in ozone depletion especially in the initial phase of ozonation of real water matrices similar to ozonation of synthetic solutions fig 1 the concentrations of pcba and ccl4 decreased generally in parallel with decreasing o3 concentrations during ozonation of the selected groundwater and surface waters fig 4 based on the depletion of o3 pcba and ccl4 the corresponding o3 oh and o2 exposures were calculated and are shown in the insets of fig 4a c the ratios of the o3 oh and o2 exposures are also constant for most of the duration of the ozonation of the groundwater and the surface waters fig s11 si compared with the two surface waters especially sw1 the groundwater had a lower rct and rso table 4 this difference can be possibly attributed to the higher carbonate content of gw compared to sw1 and sw2 table 2 as reported in table 2 carbonate bicarbonate accounted for a large fraction of the total oh scavenging rate 48 for the gw carbonate is a well known inhibitor which does not lead to the generation of o2 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 therefore carbonate bicarbonate interrupts the radical chain reaction that promotes o3 decomposition to oh resulting in a lower rct and rso for gw than sw1 and sw2 similarly to the synthetic waters with a higher oh scavenging fraction of acetate during ozonation of natural water o3 reacts with dissolved water constituents mainly dom simultaneously with oh oh and o2 therefore the kinetics of the depletion of o3 during ozonation of the groundwater and surface waters can be described by eq 19 for simplicity the reactions of o3 with dissolved water constituents are summarized by the reaction with dom 19 d o 3 dt k o h o h o 3 k oh oh o 3 k o 2 o 2 o 3 k dom dom o 3 rearranging and integrating eq 19 yields eq 20 20 ln o 3 o 3 0 k o h o h t k oh oh dt k o 2 o 2 dt k dom dom dt due to the complex composition of dom the second order rate constant for the reaction of o3 with dom k dom is not available to simulate the decomposition kinetics of o3 during ozonation of the three real water matrices therefore the relative contribution of oh f o h oh f oh o2 f o 2 and dom fdom to o3 depletion during ozonation of the selected natural waters are calculated by eqs 21 24 based on the o3 concentrations and the exposures of oh oh and o2 observed during the ozonation process see fig 5 21 f o h k o h o h t ln o 3 o 3 0 22 f oh k oh oh dt ln o 3 o 3 0 23 f k o 2 o 2 dt ln o 3 o 3 0 24 f dom 1 f o h f oh f o 2 although there are errors associated with this approach due to uncertainties of literature reported rate constants and experimental errors in determining oh and o2 exposures the modelling results are acceptable for a preliminary estimation of the contribution of oh oh o2 and dom to o3 decomposition during ozonation figure 5a c show that the initial o3 depletion in the iod period 10 s is mainly attributed to the reaction of o3 with dom then f o 2 increases quickly and reaches 45 52 at the end of ozonation of the selected groundwater and surface waters meanwhile the direct reaction of o3 with dom was estimated to contribute 36 40 to the overall ozone depletion whereas oh and oh contributed 12 15 and 3 7 respectively these data demonstrate that the o2 promoted radical chain reaction also plays an important role in o3 decomposition during ozonation of real water matrices notably fig 5a c show that after a quick increase in the first few minutes 5 min for gw and 3 min for sw1 and sw2 f o 2 decreased slightly during ozonation of the selected groundwater and surface waters this observation can be possibly attributed to the change of dom compositions during ozonation pocostales et al 2010 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 as shown in fig 5 the initial rapid o3 depletion during ozonation is mainly caused by dom which can be attributed to the fast reaction of o3 with electron rich dom moieties e g phenols in the real water matrices part of the reaction of o3 with electron rich moieties occurs by an electron transfer mechanism to yield o3 which then gives rise to a high initial oh formation initiation buffle et al 2006 buffle and von gunten 2006 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the generated primary oh can then react with many moieties in dom e g aromatic moieties and aliphatic c h bonds in dom to form o2 and thus promote the radical chain reaction to accelerate o3 decomposition to secondary oh staehelin and hoigné 1985 due to the high oh yield from the fast reaction of phenolic moieties with o3 large amounts of o2 can be quickly produced from the ensuing reaction of oh with promotors during the early phase of ozonation consequently both f oh and f o 2 increases quickly during the initial stage of ozonation fig 5 however as the fast o3 reacting moieties in the water matrices are depleted the reaction of o3 with dom is controlled by reactions that do not lead to o3 and thus primary oh formation therefore oh and o2 are mostly slowly formed by the promotion pathway in the later phase of ozonation nothe et al 2009 staehelin and hoigné 1985 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 consequently both f oh and f o 2 decreased slightly during the later phase of ozonation where o3 decomposition is mainly driven by the slower reaction of o3 with non oh generating dom subunits these observations suggest that due to changes of dom composition during ozonation the mechanism of o3 decomposition e g by direct reactions with dom or by the o2 promoted radical chain reaction can change considerably this change can in turn influence the oh formation and pollutant abatement during water treatment by ozonation and therefore has to be taken into account when interpreting ozonation results pocostales et al 2010 staehelin and hoigné 1985 it has often been shown that o3 refractory micropollutants are more quickly abated during the initial phase of ozonation especially in the instantaneous ozone demand iod period when fast o3 reacting dom is still present in the water matrix than during the later phase when the fast o3 reacting dom is depleted acero and von gunten 2001 guo et al 2021a it has been measured previously with quench flow systems that the rct during the initial phase is very high on the order of 10 6 buffle et al 2006 buffle and von gunten 2006 the significant oh formation in this phase can thus promote the abatement of ozone refractory micropollutants in contrast due to the decrease in oh formation from the o2 promoted radical chain reaction thereafter the abatement of ozone refractory micropollutants is usually slow at the later phase of ozonation 4 conclusions based on a novel approach to measure transient concentrations of o2 this study supports the hypothesis that they play a critical role in promoting o3 decomposition during ozonation by combination of a probe compound based experimental and kinetic model the decomposition kinetics of o3 in synthetic solutions with varying ratios of model promotor and inhibitor compounds can be well simulated in addition the role of o2 for o3 decomposition to oh under realistic ozonation conditions of groundwater and surface water can be quantitatively evaluated which shows that approximately half 45 52 of the overall o3 decomposition occurs through the o2 promoted radical chain reaction these results present a direct evidence that o2 is important for o3 decomposition kinetics and oh formation in synthetic and real

14626,amides are common constituents in natural organic matter and synthetic chemicals in this study we investigated kinetics and mechanisms of the reactions of chlorine with seven amides including acetamide n methylformamide n methylacetamide benzamide n methylbenzamide n propylbenzamide and n benzoylglycyl glycine amide apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of the amides with chlorine at ph 8 are in the range of 5 8 10 3 1 8 m 1s 1 and activation energies in the range of 62 88 kj mol the second order rate constants for the reactions of chlorine with different amides decrease with increasing electron donor character of the substituents on the amide n and n carbonyl c in the amide structures hypochlorite ocl dominates the reactions of chlorine with amides yielding n chloramides with species specific second order rate constants in the range of 7 3 10 3 2 3 m 1s 1 kinetic model simulations suggest that n chlorinated primary amides further react with hocl with second order rate constants in the order of 10 m 1s 1 the chlorination products of amides n chloramides are reactive towards phenolic compounds forming chlorinated phenols via electrophilic aromatic substitution phenol and resorcinol and quinone via electron transfer hydroquinone meanwhile n chloramides were recycled to the parent amides at neutral ph apparent second order rate constants for the reactions between phenols and n chloramides are in the order of 10 4 0 1 m 1s 1 comparable to those with chloramine the findings of this study improve the understanding of the fate of amides and chlorine during chlorination processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine amides n chloramides phenolic compounds second order rate constants activation energies data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction amide type structures are ubiquitous in i natural systems in some amino acids e g asparagine glutamine and in peptide bonds and ii synthetic organic materials e g plastics and chemicals e g pharmaceuticals surfactants pesticides ghose et al 1999 hargreaves 2003 pico et al 2004 amides were also found enriched in dissolved organic matter leenheer and croue 2003 and wastewater effluent organic matter barber et al 2001 because amides are relatively stable structures amide containing synthetic chemicals or metabolites can be detected in surface water and groundwater berens et al 2021 bexfield et al 2021 ferrer et al 2000 kolpin et al 1996 in drinking water treatment acetamide and a range of haloacetamides can be formed and have been identified as emerging disinfection byproducts dbps plewa et al 2008 in general nitrogenous dbps including haloacetamides have been shown to be far more genotoxic and cytotoxic than currently regulated dbps such as trihalomethanes muellner et al 2007 stalter et al 2016 therefore it is crucial to understand the fate of amides in water treatment especially during application of chemical oxidants such as the widely used chlorine to date there is little information on the fate of amides during chlorination mainly due to relatively slow kinetics of the reaction between chlorine and amides the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of chlorine with amides at ph 7 are more than two orders of magnitude lower compared to neutral amines reduced sulfur compounds and activated aromatic compounds deborde and von gunten 2008 in contrast owing to the slow kinetics the presence of amides could potentially control chlorine residual concentrations for long contact times similar to amines chlorination of amides occurs at the nitrogen morris 1967 however because of the electron withdrawing effect of the carbonyl moiety the mechanisms are different from amines an attack by hypochlorite ocl instead of hypochlorous acid hocl is proposed as the predominant mechanism the formation of a hydrogen bond between amido hydrogen and the oxygen in ocl was proposed as the initial step mauger and soper 1946 thomm and wayman 1969 which enables the nitrogen to attack the partially positively charged chlorine which leads to deprotonation and a release of hydroxide mauger and soper 1946 scheme 1 left compared with hocl the oxygen atom in ocl has a greater tendency to form a hydrogen bond because of its nucleophilic character another proposed mechanism suggests that the amido hydrogen dissociates slowly and the anionic structure of the amide resembling an enolate reacts with hocl yielding a n chloramide morris 1978 n chloramides formed during chlorination of amides have been observed to be capable to oxidize both inorganic and organic species such as sulfite thiosulfate and organic sulfur and amine moieties ding et al 2018 prutz 1999 yu and reckhow 2017 therefore amides may serve as potential reservoirs of residual chlorine the aims of this study were to investigate kinetics and mechanisms of the reactions of chlorine with both primary and secondary amides and to elucidate the reactivity of chloramides with phenolic compounds kinetic experiments were conducted i in the ph range 7 to 10 to identify predominant reactive chlorine species ocl vs hocl and ii in the temperature range 5 to 30 c to determine activation energies during chlorination of primary amides the evolutions of chlorine and chlorinated products were monitored experimentally and modeled using kinetic simulations to elucidate reaction mechanisms the influence of bromide in the chlorination of amides was also theoretically assessed lastly kinetics and mechanisms of n chloramide reactions with the electron rich moieties phenol catechol resorcinol and hydroquinone were investigated at ph 7 and 23 c 2 materials and methods chemicals and reagents all chemicals and suppliers are provided in table s1 supporting information si table 1 lists the chemical structures of the seven selected amides including acetamide aa n methylformamide n mfa n methylacetamide n maa benzamide ba n methylbenzamide n mba n propylbenzamide n pba and n benzoylglycyl glycine amide n bgga aa and ba were recrystallized for recrystallization protocols see text s1 si before use due to observed interferences of impurities during kinetics measurements figures s1 and s2 si ultra purified water millipore system 18 2 mω was used to prepare all solutions the concentration of sodium hypochlorite stock solutions was standardized weekly using a shimadzu uv 1800 spectrophotometer ε ocl 292 nm 350 m 1cm 1 johnson and melbourne 1996 wang et al 1994 kinetic experiments for chlorination of amides kinetic experiments were conducted under pseudo first order conditions i e measuring chlorine decrease in excess of amides and or measuring amides decrease in excess of chlorine corbett 1972 in the experiments with excess amides chlorine concentrations were measured via two different methods i by direct photometry at 292 nm for aa n mfa and n maa or ii by colorimetry with n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd for aa ba n mba and n pba baird and bridgewater 2017 in both cases the experiments were conducted in cuvettes hellma analytics with temperature control of the cuvette holder see below for details for colorimetric measurements samples were withdrawn and transferred to a second cuvette for quantification in the experiments with excess chlorine amide concentrations were measured using a thermo scientific hplc uv ultimate 3000 for details see text s2 in the experiments no quenching reagent for chlorine was applied because the quenching reagents e g thiosulfate resorcinol reduce n chloramides back to the parent amides instead reaction solutions were directly prepared in a hplc vial and samples were periodically injected into the hplc system the reaction time was calculated from the holding time in the autosampler to the injection of the compound after injection chlorine is separated quickly from the amide the kinetics of chlorine reactions with amides were assessed at different ph values 7 8 9 and 10 and different temperatures 5 15 23 and 30 c phosphate 50 mm ph 7 and 8 and borate 20 mm ph 9 and 10 were applied to maintain the desired ph within 0 05 units during the experiments in experiments conducted in a cuvette the temperature was controlled using a thermal bath büchi f 108 connected to a cuvette holder in the spectrophotometer in experiments conducted in hplc vials the temperature was controlled by the autosampler ultimate 3000 in experiments to measure chlorine decrease photometrically at low temperatures 5 and 15 c dry air was supplied continuously surrounding the cuvette to avoid water vapor condensation on the cuvette identification of the formation of n cl ba during chlorination of ba the formation of n cl ba was confirmed using an orbitrap lc ms orbitrap exploris 120 thermo fisher by detecting the accurate mass of the n cl ba cation c7h6oncl h and the isotope pattern of the chlorine atom c7h7on35cl and c7h7on37cl at ph 7 and 10 text s3 fig s4 dichloro ba was not detected preparation and quantification of n chloramides n chloramides were prepared by mixing chlorine with a 10 fold molar excess of amides and used after 99 9 of chlorine was consumed n chloroacetamide n cl aa a primary chloramide was prepared in 20 mm borate buffer at ph 10 to avoid further consumption of n cl aa by hypochlorous acid hocl n chlorinated secondary amides were prepared in 50 mm phosphate buffer at ph 8 n chloramides were measured colorimetrically using dpd in presence of iodide which was adapted from halamine measurements baird and bridgewater 2017 iodide doses in the range of 0 02 0 2 mm were applied depending on the rate of color formation maximum absorbance was recorded at 3 min n cl n mba was used as a standard to validate the colorimetric method and to quantify other n chloramides first n cl n mba was converted to n mba with excess sodium thiosulfate and quantified using hplc uv by comparing it with the authentic standard of n mba then the standardized n cl n mba was used to generate a calibration curve with dpd and iodide which agreed well with a calibration curve of monochloramine using the same colorimetric method fig s5 to quantify other n chloramides including n cl aa n cl n mfa n cl n maa and n cl ba the photometric calibration curve of n cl n mba was used by assuming the same absorbance response from different n chloramides with the same concentration to investigate the reaction mechanisms of the chlorination of primary amides aa ba both free chlorine and chlorinated amides were measured by the dpd method first chlorine was measured directly by adding dpd thereafter n cl aa or n cl ba was measured in the same sample by addition of iodide and subtracting the absorbance induced by chlorine kinetics and mechanisms for the reactions of n chloramides with phenolic compounds phenol catechol resorcinol and hydroquinone were investigated for their reactivity with the three different n chloramides n cl aa n cl n maa and n cl n mba the n chloramides were prepared and standardized on a daily basis kinetics experiments for the reactions between n cl aa or n cl n maa and phenolic compounds were conducted with n chloramides in excess by monitoring the abatement of the phenolic compounds by hplc uv for more details see text s2 the kinetics for the reactions between n cl n mba and phenolic compounds were measured with phenols in excess by monitoring the decrease of n cl n mba by hplc uv text s2 the kinetic experiments for the reactions of n chloramides with phenols were conducted in a hplc vial without applying a quenching agent all experiments were conducted in duplicates to understand mechanisms products of the reaction of n chloroacetamide with phenolic compounds were detected using hplc uv text s2 in this part of the study n cl aa was prepared with a chlorine to acetamide molar ratio of 1 1 25 instead of 1 10 to minimize the interference of excess acetamide on the detection of the phenolic reaction products kinetic model to elucidate the reactions occurring during chlorination of primary amides reaction kinetics were simulated by considering the reactions listed in table s2 the kinetic simulations were conducted by solving kinetic equations text s4 using the stiff differential equations solver ode15s in matlab based on gear s method to ensure the quality of calculation absolute error tolerance of each solution component i e species concentration was set at least 4 orders of magnitude below its respective value e g tolerance for ocl was set to 10 10 m when ocl 10 6 m 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of the reactions of chlorine with amides apparent k app second order rate constants for the reactions of chlorine with 7 selected amides at ph 8 were determined in the range of 5 8 10 3 m 1s 1 to 1 8 m 1s 1 under pseudo first order condition by measuring chlorine decrease in excess of the amides tables 1 and s3 species specific second order rate constants k ocl for the reactions of the amides with ocl were obtained at ph 10 pk hocl is 7 54 at 25 c morris 1966 to be in the range of 7 3 10 3 m 1s 1 to 2 3 m 1s 1 table 1 k ocl for n mfa n maa and n mba are similar to k ocl values obtained in previous studies table 1 k ocl values for the selected amides show that electron donating groups e g alkyl group at the amide n and or the n carbonyl c lower the second order rate constants for the reactions with ocl with k ocl aa k ocl n maa k ocl n mfa k ocl n maa and k ocl ba k ocl n mba k ocl n pba figure s6 as discussed above ocl reacts with amides as a nucleophile by forming a hydrogen bond between the oxygen in ocl and amido hydrogen electron donating groups at the amide n and or the n carbonyl c partially compensate for the electron withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group on the amide n yielding a stronger n h bond with a lower tendency to form a hydrogen bond with ocl n bgga k ocl n bgga 2 3 m 1s 1 with 3 amide groups was observed to have an almost 10 fold higher species specific second order rate constant for the reaction with ocl than ba k ocl ba 0 25 m 1s 1 which can be explained by an increased electron withdrawing effect of the amide groups on neighboring amide structures 3 2 activation energies for the reactions of amides with chlorine to facilitate the implementation of second order rate constants for realistic treatment conditions with varying temperatures few c to 30 c temperature dependent kinetics of the reactions of amides with chlorine were investigated under pseudo first order conditions at 5 15 23 and 30 c and at ph 8 table s4 activation energies for these reactions were calculated using the logarithmized form of arrhenius eq 6 arrhenius 1889 logan 1982 6 ln k a p p ln a e a r t where a is the pre exponential factor e a is the activation energy r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and t is the absolute temperature in k e a was obtained by plotting ln k app as a function of 1 t fig 1 a comparison of activation energies for the chlorination of various organic compounds is provided in table 2 for the chlorination of the tested amides e a is in the range of 62 88 kj mol comparable e a 61 69 kj mol were reported for the chlorination of α β unsaturated carbonyls e g tiglic aldehyde trans 2 hexenal marron et al 2021 in comparison the chlorination of neutral amines and reduced sulfur moieties is less sensitive to temperature variation with e a values from 14 kj mol for ametryn to 33 kj mol for cylindrospermopsin rodriguez et al 2007 xu et al 2009 the e a values for the chlorination of phenolic compounds and polycyclic aromatic compounds vary in a wide range from 2 5 kj mol for resorcinol to 58 kj mol for phenol and 59 62 kj mol for biphenyl lee and morris 1962 rebenne et al 1996 snider and alley 1979 amides refer to the sections below and α β unsaturated carbonyls marron et al 2021 mainly react with ocl with relatively low second order rate constants in contrast neutral amines reduced sulfur and activated aromatic compounds deborde and von gunten 2008 mainly react with hocl with higher second order rate constants which potentially explain the observed e a variations among different moieties a weak correlation r2 0 54 was observed when plotting e a vs ln k app which warrants further investigations fig s7 3 3 chlorination of secondary amides second order rate constants for the reactions of chlorine with 4 secondary amides n mfa n maa n mba n pba were determined at different ph values figure s8 the reactions of secondary amides with chlorine exhibited pseudo first order kinetics with either chlorine or amides in excess and measuring the other reaction partner table s3 there are some differences 4 38 in the apparent second order rate constants k app for the two experimental conditions figures s9 such differences are small given the variation of reported second order rate constants in literature of up to a factor of 10 for all tested secondary amides k app increased from ph 7 to 9 with no significant further increase to ph 10 figs 2 a and s8 when plotting k app as a function of the fraction of hypochlorite α ocl only considering hypochlorous acid hocl and ocl here for different ph values good linearities were observed for all tested secondary amides fig 2b this indicates an ocl dominated chlorination of secondary amides these findings support the proposed mechanism discussed in the introduction and shown in scheme 1 left the same trend of ocl as a predominant chlorination species was also observed for n bgga which contains 3 amide n figure s10 3 4 chlorination of primary amides benzamide ba the kinetics of chlorination of ba were investigated at different ph values by measuring chlorine consumption in excess of ba and ba consumption in excess of chlorine pseudo first order kinetics were observed for both experimental conditions with good linearity for ba decrease r2 0 99 and chlorine decrease 0 99 r2 0 97 table s3 consistently higher k app 23 45 were observed when measuring chlorine decrease at different ph values figure s11a when plotting k app as a function of α ocl a better linearity was observed when measuring ba decrease figure s11b nevertheless for the tested conditions ocl seems the predominant species for the reaction of ba with chlorine however the lower linearity between k app and α ocl when measuring chlorine decrease in excess of benzamide indicates that besides ocl other chlorine species might contribute to ba abatement in addition different concentrations 1 9 mm of chlorine were spiked to a 10 mm ba solution in the ph range 7 10 after complete chlorine consumption roughly half of the molar equivalent of ba was consumed figure s12 the molar ratio of 2 to 1 for the reaction between chlorine and ba suggests that the ba chlorination product n cl ba could further react with chlorine the role of chlorine monoxide cl2o and molecular chlorine cl2 for chlorination of ba was also investigated owing to their high second order rate constants for the reactions with different organic functional groups deborde and von gunten 2008 li et al 2020 sivey et al 2010 cl2o and cl2 are usually present at very low concentrations compared to hocl and ocl based on the measured chloride concentration in the reaction solutions and known equilibria for the different chlorine species their concentrations were calculated as a function of ph text s5 the highest concentrations of cl2o and cl2 were calculated at ph 7 and gradually decreasing up to ph 10 fig s13 to assess the role of cl2o the reaction order in chlorine was determined under pseudo first order conditions with varying chlorine concentrations text s6 when cl2o is a predominant chlorine species the reaction rate is proportional to chlorine 2 and therefore second order kinetics relative to the chlorine concentration should be observed li et al 2020 sivey et al 2010 as shown in figure s14 first order with respect to chlorine concentration was observed in the chlorination of ba at ph 7 slope 1 which indicates a minor role of cl2o the role of cl2 for the chlorination of ba was assessed by spiking additional 10 100 mm cl to 3 mm chlorine containing already 6 3 mm cl as background which generated 8 7 10 9 5 7 10 8 m cl2 text s7 accordingly the observed pseudo first order rate constants k obs for benzamide increased from 1 3 10 4 to 1 5 10 4 s 1 fig s15a plotting k obs as a function of cl2 concentration k cl2 ba was calculated to be 433 m 1s 1 fig s15b however considering the low concentrations of cl2 3 4 10 9 m under the tested conditions cl2 plays a negligible role in the chlorination of ba under typical drinking water chlorination conditions e g chlorine 2 mg l as cl2 cl 8 mg l li et al 2020 cl2 has a concentration of less than 10 12 m at neutral ph and its role in the chlorination of amides can be neglected to further elucidate the mechanism of ba chlorination scheme 1 right the formation of n cl ba was first confirmed using high resolution mass spectrometry figure s4 and then the evolution of n cl ba during chlorination of ba at different ph values was monitored with dpd and iodide fig 3 n cl ba was formed and went through a maximum followed by a decrease due to a further reaction with chlorine mauger and soper 1946 in addition it was observed that n cl ba is unstable under the selected experimental conditions fig s16 to better understand the reactions occurring during chlorination of ba scheme 1 right a kinetic simulation of chlorine and n cl ba evolution was performed by considering reactions 1 to 5 fig 3 1 rconh2 ocl rconhcl oh k ocl ba 0 25 m 1s 1 2 rconh2 hocl rconhcl h2o k hocl ba 0 04 m 1s 1 3 rconhcl ocl rconcl2 oh k ocl n cl ba 1 m 1s 1 4 rconhcl hocl rconcl2 h2o k hocl n cl ba 10 m 1s 1 5 rconhcl product kn cl ba 2 4 4 2 s 1 at ph 7 10 among the rate constants k ocl ba was obtained from the measured chlorine decrease in excess ba at ph 10 table s3 kn cl ba was determined experimentally by measuring the n cl ba decrease at different ph values after chlorine was completely consumed fig s16 averaged values of slopes were taken from duplicate experiments at each ph k ocl n cl ba was obtained by fitting to the formation of n cl ba at ph 10 using k ocl n cl ba as a fitting parameter fig s17 when fitting for k ocl n cl ba at ph 10 k hocl ba and k hocl n cl ba are irrelevant for the chlorine and n cl ba evolution lastly with the determined values for k ocl ba k ocl n cl ba and kn cl ba k hocl ba and k hocl n cl ba were obtained by fitting the decrease of chlorine and the formation of n cl ba at ph 7 simultaneously fig s18 as shown in figs s17 and s18 different scenarios were tested to find the optimal values for the rate constants and the fit was selected by visual inspection applying the rate constants for reactions 1 5 table s2 for different ph conditions the experimental and modeled chlorine and n cl ba evolution were in good agreement up to a chlorine consumption of 70 fig 3 the deviation in the later part of curves could be caused by additional reactions which were not considered in this study to be noted ocl dominates the reaction with ba however chlorine addition to ba makes the amide n more acidic and therefore a partial deprotonation may occur leading to a negative charge this enables an electrophilic attack by hocl reaction 4 in analogy a significant depression of the pka values of several orders of magnitude has been calculated for chloramines relative to their amine precursors heeb et al 2017 acetamide the reaction mechanisms of the chlorination of aa were investigated analogously by measuring the chlorine decrease and n cl aa evolution at different ph values fig 4 similarly k ocl aa 0 047 m 1s 1 was obtained from the chlorine decrease in excess of aa at ph 10 table s3 at ph 10 the sum of chlorine and n cl aa concentrations was constant during 60 min and equal to the initial chlorine concentration fig s19 this suggests that n cl aa is stable in presence of ocl and therefore k ocl n cl aa is negligible in addition in contrast to n cl ba a self decay of n cl aa kn cl aa was not observed in the tested ph range 7 10 fig s19 lastly k hocl aa and k hocl n cl aa were determined by simultaneously fitting to chlorine decrease and n cl aa evolution at ph 7 by using k hocl aa and k hocl n cl aa as fitting parameters as shown in figure s20 the scenario analyses suggest optimal values of 0 008 m 1s 1 and 9 m 1s 1 for k hocl aa and k hocl n cl aa respectively applying the obtained rate constants table s2 the chlorine decrease and n cl aa evolution were well estimated for different ph values fig 4 3 5 influence of bromide on the chlorination of amides under oxidative water treatment processes bromide can play a critical role because bromide is converted to reactive bromine species e g hypobromous acid hypobromite hobr obr which react fast with many inorganic and organic compounds heeb et al 2014 hobr reacts with amides with apparent second order rate constants on the order of 1 3 m 1s 1 at ph 7 2 7 5 pattison and davies 2004 the influence of bromide on the chlorination of amides was assessed under typical water treatment conditions with 1 mg l chlorine as cl2 and varying bromide concentrations 10 100 and 500 μg l by comparing the formation yield of chloramide and bromamide text s8 as shown in table s5 when hobr is in excess of amide 40 of amide was estimated to transform to bromamide other than chloramide in the presence of 10 μg l bromide and 87 of amide yielded bromamide with bromide concentration higher than 100 μg l the formation of chloramide becomes gradually more important for chlorine concentrations 1 mg l and dominant when the amide concentration is higher than the bromide concentration table s5 this suggests that the role of bromide has to be assessed during chlorination of amides for practical water treatment conditions 3 6 kinetics and mechanisms of the reactions of n chloramides with phenolic compounds n cl aa n cl n maa and n cl n mba were selected to investigate the kinetics of their reactions with phenolic compounds phenol catechol resorcinol and hydroquinone under pseudo first order conditions table s6 apparent second order rate constants at ph 7 for the reactions of phenols with n chloramides range from 9 7 10 5 to 9 8 10 2 m 1s 1 which are 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than the reactions with chloramines heeb et al 2017 fig 5 comparing among different phenols the k app values for the reactions of n chloramides with different phenols increase in the order of phenol hydroquinone catechol resorcinol which is the same for chloramines heeb et al 2017 as expected resorcinol has the highest reactivity with two hydroxyl groups in meta position and phenol has the lowest reactivity with only one hydroxyl group criquet et al 2015 heeb et al 2017 similar k app values were obtained for both phenol and catechol when reacting with the three tested n chloramides a lower k app value 30 38 fold was observed for resorcinol when reacting with n cl aa in comparison with n cl n maa and n cl n mba and a higher k app value 8 fold was observed for hydroquinone when reacting with n cl n maa in comparison with n cl aa and n cl n mba table s6 these observed differences in the k app values warrant further investigations to obtain mechanistic information on the reactions between n chloramides and phenolic compounds transformation products from the reaction of n cl aa with phenol resorcinol and hydroquinone were analyzed by hplc uv text s2 for analytical method in the reaction of n cl aa with phenol and resorcinol ring chlorinated products were detected which suggests an electrophilic aromatic substitution from the reaction of phenol with n cl aa 4 chlorophenol and 2 chlorophenol were gradually formed as major reaction products followed by formation of 2 4 dichlorophenol and 2 6 dichlorophenol for longer reaction times 10 h figure s21 for the reaction of resorcinol with n cl aa 4 chlororesorcinol and 2 chlororesorcinol were detected with 4 chlororesorcinol as the predominant reaction intermediate during chlorination of resorcinol a ratio of 3 1 was observed for the formation rate of 4 chlororesorcinol relative to 2 chlororesorcinol heasley et al 1989 rebenne et al 1996 further reaction of chlorinated resorcinol with n cl aa leads to the formation of 4 6 dichlororesorcinol and 2 4 dichlororesorcinol fig s22 overall the detected chlorinated phenols and chlorinated resorcinols only account for the partial loss of phenol and resorcinol for instance when 40 16 μm of phenol and resorcinol were abated 2 8 μm chlorinated phenolic products were detected therefore significant fractions of other transformation products including ring cleavage products must be formed which were not identified in this study acero et al 2005a arnold et al 2008 in the reaction of n cl aa with hydroquinone chlorinated hydroquinones were not detected instead p benzoquinone was detected as the only major reaction product which suggests an electron transfer reaction mechanism fig s23 the reaction between n cl aa and catechol was monitored spectrophotometrically and no obvious o quinone peak was observed λmax at 390 nm criquet et al 2015 which is potentially due to relatively slow reaction between n cl aa and catechol and the instability of o quinone overall similar to free chlorine and chloramines criquet et al 2015 heeb et al 2017 phenol and resorcinol react with n chloramides mainly via electrophilic aromatic substitution and hydroquinone reacts mainly via electron transfer besides phenolic transformation products the fate of the n chloramides was also monitored in the reaction of n cl n mba with phenols n cl n mba was chosen in this case because n cl n mba and n mba can be monitored by hplc uv n cl n mba was observed to be fully transformed to n mba after reacting with different phenolic compounds with an excellent mass balance fig s24 scheme 1 therefore cl amides can serve as a temporary reservoir for active chlorine 4 conclusions the kinetics and mechanisms of the chlorination of amides and the reactions of n chloramides with phenolic compounds have been investigated the main outcomes of this study are chlorination of amides is dominated by ocl via forming a hydrogen bond between amido hydrogen and the oxygen in ocl with species specific second order rate constants k ocl in the range of 7 3 10 3 2 3 m 1s 1 an electron donating group at the amide n and or the n carbonyl c partially compensate the electron withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group on the amide n enhancing the strength of the n h bond this leads to a lower tendency to form a hydrogen bond with lower second order rate constant for the reaction with ocl e g k ocl ba k ocl n mba k ocl n pba chlorination of both primary and secondary amides forms n chloramides n chlorinated primary amides undergo further chlorination mainly by reacting with hocl with higher second order rate constants 10 m 1s 1 than the first chlorination step this is due to a weakening of the n h bond and an enhanced reactivity with the electrophilic hocl in the presence of bromide the formation of bromamides in addition of chloramides can be significant due to a higher reactivity of hobr with amides activation energies for the chlorination of amides are in the range of 62 88 kj mol similar to the chlorination of α β unsaturated carbonyls the chlorination of both compound classes is dominated by reaction with ocl in contrast lower activation energies are obtained for moieties such as neutral amines reduced sulfur and activated aromatic compounds for which the reactions occur mainly with hocl n chloramides react with phenol and resorcinol via electrophilic aromatic substitution and with hydroquinone via electron transfer the amides are recycled after reacting with phenols apparent second order rate constant for the reactions of phenolic compounds with n chloramides are in the order of 10 4 0 1 m 1s 1 slightly lower than for chloramines 6 10 4 0 16 m 1s 1 and 3 5 orders of magnitude lower than for chlorine 18 4 103 m 1s 1 criquet et al 2015 heeb et al 2017 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

14626,amides are common constituents in natural organic matter and synthetic chemicals in this study we investigated kinetics and mechanisms of the reactions of chlorine with seven amides including acetamide n methylformamide n methylacetamide benzamide n methylbenzamide n propylbenzamide and n benzoylglycyl glycine amide apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of the amides with chlorine at ph 8 are in the range of 5 8 10 3 1 8 m 1s 1 and activation energies in the range of 62 88 kj mol the second order rate constants for the reactions of chlorine with different amides decrease with increasing electron donor character of the substituents on the amide n and n carbonyl c in the amide structures hypochlorite ocl dominates the reactions of chlorine with amides yielding n chloramides with species specific second order rate constants in the range of 7 3 10 3 2 3 m 1s 1 kinetic model simulations suggest that n chlorinated primary amides further react with hocl with second order rate constants in the order of 10 m 1s 1 the chlorination products of amides n chloramides are reactive towards phenolic compounds forming chlorinated phenols via electrophilic aromatic substitution phenol and resorcinol and quinone via electron transfer hydroquinone meanwhile n chloramides were recycled to the parent amides at neutral ph apparent second order rate constants for the reactions between phenols and n chloramides are in the order of 10 4 0 1 m 1s 1 comparable to those with chloramine the findings of this study improve the understanding of the fate of amides and

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction amide type structures are ubiquitous in i natural systems in some amino acids e g asparagine glutamine and in peptide bonds and ii synthetic organic materials e g plastics and chemicals e g pharmaceuticals surfactants pesticides ghose et al 1999 hargreaves 2003 pico et al 2004 amides were also found enriched in dissolved organic matter leenheer and croue 2003 and wastewater effluent organic matter barber et al 2001 because amides are relatively stable structures amide containing synthetic chemicals or metabolites can be detected in surface water and groundwater berens et al 2021 bexfield et al 2021 ferrer et al 2000 kolpin et al 1996 in drinking water treatment acetamide and a range of haloacetamides can be formed and have been identified as emerging disinfection byproducts dbps plewa et al 2008 in general nitrogenous dbps including haloacetamides have been shown to be far more genotoxic and cytotoxic than currently regulated dbps such as trihalomethanes muellner et al 2007 stalter et al 2016 therefore it is crucial to understand the fate of amides in water treatment especially during application of chemical oxidants such as the widely used chlorine to date there is little information on the fate of amides during chlorination mainly due to relatively slow kinetics of the reaction between chlorine and amides the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of chlorine with amides at ph 7 are more than two orders of magnitude lower compared to neutral amines reduced sulfur compounds and activated aromatic compounds deborde and von gunten 2008 in contrast owing to the slow kinetics the presence of amides could potentially control chlorine residual concentrations for long contact times similar to amines chlorination of amides occurs at the nitrogen morris 1967 however because of the electron withdrawing effect of the carbonyl moiety the mechanisms are different from amines an attack by hypochlorite ocl instead of hypochlorous acid hocl is proposed as the predominant mechanism the formation of a hydrogen bond between amido hydrogen and the oxygen in ocl was proposed as the initial step mauger and soper 1946 thomm and wayman 1969 which enables the nitrogen to attack the partially positively charged chlorine which leads to deprotonation and a release of hydroxide mauger and soper 1946 scheme 1 left compared with hocl the oxygen atom in ocl has a greater tendency to form a hydrogen bond because of its nucleophilic character another proposed mechanism suggests that the amido hydrogen dissociates slowly and the anionic structure of the amide resembling an enolate reacts with hocl yielding a n chloramide morris 1978 n chloramides formed during chlorination of amides have been observed to be capable to oxidize both inorganic and organic species such as sulfite thiosulfate and organic sulfur and amine moieties ding et al 2018 prutz 1999 yu and reckhow 2017 therefore amides may serve as potential reservoirs of residual chlorine the aims of this study were to investigate kinetics and mechanisms of the reactions of chlorine with both primary and secondary amides and to elucidate the reactivity of chloramides with phenolic compounds kinetic experiments were conducted i in the ph range 7 to 10 to identify predominant reactive chlorine species ocl vs hocl and ii in the temperature range 5 to 30 c to determine activation energies during chlorination of primary amides the evolutions of chlorine and chlorinated products were monitored experimentally and modeled using kinetic simulations to elucidate reaction mechanisms the influence of bromide in the chlorination of amides was also theoretically assessed lastly kinetics and mechanisms of n chloramide reactions with the electron rich moieties phenol catechol resorcinol and hydroquinone were investigated at ph 7 and 23 c 2 materials and methods chemicals and reagents all chemicals and suppliers are

methylbenzamide n mba n propylbenzamide n pba and n benzoylglycyl glycine amide n bgga aa and ba were recrystallized for recrystallization protocols see text s1 si before use due to observed interferences of impurities during kinetics measurements figures s1 and s2 si ultra purified water millipore system 18 2 mω was used to prepare all solutions the concentration of sodium hypochlorite stock solutions was standardized weekly using a shimadzu uv 1800 spectrophotometer ε ocl 292 nm 350 m 1cm 1 johnson and melbourne 1996 wang et al 1994 kinetic experiments for chlorination of amides kinetic experiments were conducted under pseudo first order conditions i e measuring chlorine decrease in excess of amides and or measuring amides decrease in excess of chlorine corbett 1972 in the experiments with excess amides chlorine concentrations were measured via two different methods i by direct photometry at 292 nm for aa n mfa and n maa or ii by colorimetry with n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd for aa ba n mba and n pba baird and bridgewater 2017 in both cases the experiments were conducted in cuvettes hellma analytics with temperature control of the cuvette holder see below for details for colorimetric measurements samples were withdrawn and transferred to a second cuvette for quantification in the experiments with excess chlorine amide concentrations were measured using a thermo scientific hplc uv ultimate 3000 for details see text s2 in the experiments no quenching reagent for chlorine was applied because the quenching reagents e g thiosulfate resorcinol reduce n chloramides back to the parent amides instead reaction solutions were directly prepared in a hplc vial and samples were periodically injected into the hplc system the reaction time was calculated from the holding time in the autosampler to the injection of the compound after injection chlorine is separated quickly from the amide the kinetics of chlorine reactions with amides were assessed at different ph values 7 8 9 and 10 and different temperatures 5 15 23 and 30 c phosphate 50 mm ph 7 and 8 and borate 20 mm ph 9 and 10 were applied to maintain the desired ph within 0 05 units during the experiments in experiments conducted in a cuvette the temperature was controlled using a thermal bath büchi f 108 connected to a cuvette holder in the spectrophotometer in experiments conducted in hplc vials the temperature was controlled by the autosampler ultimate 3000 in experiments to measure chlorine decrease photometrically at low temperatures 5 and 15 c dry air was supplied continuously surrounding the cuvette to avoid water vapor condensation on the cuvette identification of the formation of n cl ba during chlorination of ba the formation of n cl ba was confirmed using an orbitrap lc ms orbitrap exploris 120 thermo fisher by detecting the accurate mass of the n cl ba cation c7h6oncl h and the isotope pattern of the chlorine atom c7h7on35cl and c7h7on37cl at ph 7 and 10 text s3 fig s4 dichloro ba was not detected preparation and quantification of n chloramides n chloramides were prepared by mixing chlorine with a 10 fold molar excess of amides and used after 99 9 of chlorine was consumed n chloroacetamide n cl aa a primary chloramide was prepared in 20 mm borate buffer at ph 10 to avoid further consumption of n cl aa by hypochlorous acid hocl n chlorinated secondary amides were prepared in 50 mm phosphate buffer at ph 8 n chloramides were measured colorimetrically using dpd in presence of iodide which was adapted from halamine measurements baird and bridgewater 2017 iodide doses in the range of 0 02 0 2 mm were applied depending on the rate of color formation maximum absorbance was recorded at 3 min n cl n mba was used as a standard to validate the colorimetric method and to quantify other n chloramides first n cl n mba was converted to n mba with excess sodium thiosulfate and quantified using hplc uv by comparing it with the authentic standard of n mba then the standardized n cl n mba was used to generate a calibration curve with dpd and iodide which agreed well with a calibration curve of monochloramine using the same colorimetric method fig s5 to quantify other n chloramides including n cl aa n cl n mfa n cl n maa and n cl ba the photometric calibration curve of n cl n mba was used by assuming the same absorbance response from different n chloramides with the same concentration to investigate the reaction mechanisms of the chlorination of primary amides aa ba both free chlorine and chlorinated amides were measured by the dpd method first chlorine was measured directly by adding dpd thereafter n cl aa or n cl ba was measured in the same sample by addition of iodide and subtracting the absorbance induced by chlorine kinetics and mechanisms for the reactions of n chloramides with phenolic compounds phenol catechol resorcinol and hydroquinone were investigated for their reactivity with the three different n chloramides n cl aa n cl n maa and n cl n mba the n chloramides were prepared and standardized on a daily basis kinetics experiments for the reactions between n cl aa or n cl n maa and phenolic compounds were conducted with n chloramides in excess by monitoring the abatement of the phenolic compounds by hplc uv for more details see text s2 the kinetics for the reactions between n cl n mba and phenolic compounds were measured with phenols in excess by monitoring the decrease of n cl n mba by hplc uv text s2 the kinetic experiments for the reactions of n chloramides with phenols were conducted in a hplc vial without applying a quenching agent all experiments were conducted in duplicates to understand mechanisms products of the reaction of n chloroacetamide with phenolic compounds were detected using hplc uv text s2 in this part of the study n cl aa was prepared with a chlorine to acetamide molar ratio of 1 1 25 instead of 1 10 to minimize the interference of excess acetamide on the detection of the phenolic reaction products kinetic model to elucidate the reactions occurring during chlorination of primary amides reaction kinetics were simulated by considering the reactions listed in table s2 the kinetic simulations were conducted by solving kinetic equations text s4 using the stiff differential equations solver ode15s in matlab based on gear s method to ensure the quality of calculation absolute error tolerance of each solution component i e species concentration was set at least 4 orders of magnitude below its respective value e g tolerance for ocl was set to 10 10 m when ocl 10 6 m 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of the reactions of chlorine with amides apparent k app second order rate constants for the reactions of chlorine with 7 selected amides at ph 8 were determined in the range of 5 8 10 3 m 1s 1 to 1 8 m 1s 1 under pseudo first order condition by measuring chlorine decrease in excess of the amides tables 1 and s3 species specific second order rate constants k ocl for the reactions of the amides with ocl were obtained at ph 10 pk hocl is 7 54 at 25 c morris 1966 to be in the range of 7 3 10 3 m 1s 1 to 2 3 m 1s 1 table 1 k ocl for n mfa n maa and n mba are similar to k ocl values obtained in previous studies table 1 k ocl values for the selected amides show that electron donating groups e g alkyl group at the amide n and or the n carbonyl c lower the second order rate constants for the reactions with ocl with k ocl aa k ocl n maa k ocl n mfa k ocl n maa and k ocl ba k ocl n mba k ocl n pba figure s6 as discussed above ocl reacts with amides as a nucleophile by forming a hydrogen bond between the oxygen in ocl and amido hydrogen electron donating groups at the amide n and or the n carbonyl c partially compensate for the electron withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group on the amide n yielding a stronger n h bond with a lower tendency to form a hydrogen bond with ocl n bgga k ocl n bgga 2 3 m 1s 1 with 3 amide groups was observed to have an almost 10 fold higher species specific second order rate constant for the reaction with ocl than ba k ocl ba 0 25 m 1s 1 which can be explained by an increased electron withdrawing effect of the amide groups on neighboring amide structures 3 2 activation energies for the reactions of amides with chlorine to facilitate the implementation of second order rate constants for realistic treatment conditions with varying temperatures few c to 30 c temperature dependent kinetics of the reactions of amides with chlorine were investigated under pseudo first order conditions at 5 15 23 and 30 c and at ph 8 table s4 activation energies for these reactions were calculated using the logarithmized form of arrhenius eq 6 arrhenius 1889 logan 1982 6 ln k a p p ln a e a r t where a is the pre exponential factor e a is the activation energy r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and t is the absolute temperature in k e a was obtained by plotting ln k app as a function of 1 t fig 1 a comparison of activation energies for the chlorination of various organic compounds is provided in table 2 for the chlorination of the tested amides e a is in the range of 62 88 kj mol comparable e a 61 69 kj mol were reported for the chlorination of α β unsaturated carbonyls e g tiglic aldehyde trans 2 hexenal marron et al 2021 in comparison the chlorination of neutral amines and reduced sulfur moieties is less sensitive to temperature variation with e a values from 14 kj mol for ametryn to 33 kj mol for cylindrospermopsin rodriguez et al 2007 xu et al 2009 the e a values for the chlorination of phenolic compounds and polycyclic aromatic compounds vary in a wide range from 2 5 kj mol for resorcinol to 58 kj mol for phenol and 59 62 kj mol for biphenyl lee and morris 1962 rebenne et al 1996 snider and alley 1979 amides refer to the sections below and α β unsaturated carbonyls marron et al 2021 mainly react with ocl with relatively low second order rate constants in contrast neutral amines reduced sulfur and activated aromatic compounds deborde and von gunten 2008 mainly react with hocl with higher second order rate constants which potentially explain the observed e a variations among different moieties a weak correlation r2 0 54 was observed when plotting e a vs ln k app which warrants further investigations fig s7 3 3 chlorination of secondary amides second order rate constants for the reactions of chlorine with 4 secondary amides n mfa n maa n mba n pba were determined at different ph values figure s8 the reactions of secondary amides with chlorine exhibited pseudo first order kinetics with either chlorine or amides in excess and measuring the other reaction partner table s3 there are some differences 4 38 in the apparent second order rate constants k app for the two experimental conditions figures s9 such differences are small given the variation of reported second order rate constants in literature of up to a factor of 10 for all tested secondary amides k app increased from ph 7 to 9 with no significant further increase to ph 10 figs 2 a and s8 when plotting k app as a function of the fraction of hypochlorite α ocl only considering hypochlorous acid hocl and ocl here for different ph values good linearities were observed for all tested secondary amides fig 2b this indicates an ocl dominated chlorination of secondary amides these findings support the proposed mechanism discussed in the introduction and shown in scheme 1 left the same trend of ocl as a predominant chlorination species was also observed for n bgga which contains 3 amide n figure s10 3 4 chlorination of primary amides benzamide ba the kinetics of chlorination of ba were investigated at different ph values by measuring chlorine consumption in excess of ba and ba consumption in excess of chlorine pseudo first order kinetics were observed for both experimental conditions with good linearity for ba decrease r2 0 99 and chlorine decrease 0 99 r2 0 97 table s3 consistently higher k app 23 45 were observed when measuring chlorine decrease at different ph values figure s11a when plotting k app as a function of α ocl a better linearity was observed when measuring ba decrease figure s11b nevertheless for the tested conditions ocl seems the predominant species for the reaction of ba with chlorine however the lower linearity between k app and α ocl when measuring chlorine decrease in excess of benzamide indicates that besides ocl other chlorine species might contribute to ba abatement in addition different concentrations 1 9 mm of chlorine were spiked to a 10 mm ba solution in the ph range 7 10 after complete chlorine consumption roughly half of the molar equivalent of ba was consumed figure s12 the molar ratio of 2 to 1 for the reaction between chlorine and ba suggests that the ba chlorination product n cl ba could further react with chlorine the role of chlorine monoxide cl2o and molecular chlorine cl2 for chlorination of ba was also investigated owing to their high second order rate constants for the reactions with different organic functional groups deborde and von gunten 2008 li et al 2020 sivey et al 2010 cl2o and cl2 are usually present at very low concentrations compared to hocl and ocl based on the measured chloride concentration in the reaction solutions and known equilibria for the different chlorine species their concentrations were calculated as a function of ph text s5 the highest concentrations of cl2o and cl2 were calculated at ph 7 and gradually decreasing up to ph 10 fig s13 to assess the role of cl2o the reaction order in chlorine was determined under pseudo first order conditions with varying chlorine concentrations text s6 when cl2o is a predominant chlorine species the reaction rate is proportional to chlorine 2 and therefore second order kinetics relative to the chlorine concentration should be observed li et al 2020 sivey et al 2010 as shown in figure s14 first order with respect to chlorine concentration was observed in the chlorination of ba at ph 7 slope 1 which indicates a minor role of cl2o the role of cl2 for the chlorination of ba was assessed by spiking additional 10 100 mm cl to 3 mm chlorine containing already 6 3 mm cl as background which generated 8 7 10 9 5 7 10 8 m cl2 text s7 accordingly the observed pseudo first order rate constants k obs for benzamide increased from 1 3 10 4 to 1 5 10 4 s 1 fig s15a plotting k obs as a function of cl2 concentration k cl2 ba was calculated to be 433 m 1s 1 fig s15b however considering the low concentrations of cl2 3 4 10 9 m under the tested conditions cl2 plays a negligible role in the chlorination of ba under typical drinking water chlorination conditions e g chlorine 2 mg l as cl2 cl 8 mg l li et al 2020 cl2 has a concentration of less than 10 12 m at neutral ph and its role in the chlorination of amides can be neglected to further elucidate the mechanism of ba chlorination scheme 1 right the formation of n cl ba was first confirmed using high resolution mass spectrometry figure s4 and then the evolution of n cl ba during chlorination of ba at different ph values was monitored with dpd and iodide fig 3 n cl ba was formed and went through a maximum followed by a decrease due to a further reaction with chlorine mauger and soper 1946 in addition it was observed that n cl ba is unstable under the selected experimental conditions fig s16 to better understand the reactions occurring during chlorination of ba scheme 1 right a kinetic simulation of chlorine and n cl ba evolution was performed by considering reactions 1 to 5 fig 3 1 rconh2 ocl rconhcl oh k ocl ba 0 25 m 1s 1 2 rconh2 hocl rconhcl h2o k hocl ba 0 04 m 1s 1 3 rconhcl ocl rconcl2 oh k ocl n cl ba 1 m 1s 1 4 rconhcl hocl rconcl2 h2o k hocl n cl ba 10 m 1s 1 5 rconhcl product kn cl ba 2 4 4 2 s 1 at ph 7 10 among the rate constants k ocl ba was obtained from the measured chlorine decrease in excess ba at ph 10 table s3 kn cl ba was determined experimentally by measuring the n cl ba decrease at different ph values after chlorine was completely consumed fig s16 averaged values of slopes were taken from duplicate experiments at each ph k ocl n cl ba was obtained by fitting to the formation of n cl ba at ph 10 using k ocl n cl ba as a fitting parameter fig s17 when fitting for k ocl n cl ba at ph 10 k hocl ba and k hocl n cl ba are irrelevant for the chlorine and n cl ba evolution lastly with the determined values for k ocl ba k ocl n cl ba and kn cl ba k hocl ba and k hocl n cl ba were obtained by fitting the decrease of chlorine and the formation of n cl ba at ph 7 simultaneously fig s18 as shown in figs s17 and s18 different scenarios were tested to find the optimal values for the rate constants and the fit was selected by visual inspection applying the rate constants for reactions 1 5 table s2 for different ph conditions the experimental and modeled chlorine and n cl ba evolution were in good agreement up to a chlorine consumption of 70 fig 3 the deviation in the later part of curves could be caused by additional reactions which were not considered in this study to be noted ocl dominates the reaction with ba however chlorine addition to ba makes the amide n more acidic and therefore a partial deprotonation may occur leading to a negative charge this enables an electrophilic attack by hocl reaction 4 in analogy a significant depression of the pka values of several orders of magnitude has been calculated for chloramines relative to their amine precursors heeb et al 2017 acetamide the reaction mechanisms of the chlorination of aa were investigated analogously by measuring the chlorine decrease and n cl aa evolution at different ph values fig 4 similarly k ocl aa 0 047 m 1s 1 was obtained from the chlorine decrease in excess of aa at ph 10 table s3 at ph 10 the sum of chlorine and n cl aa concentrations was constant during 60 min and equal to the initial chlorine concentration fig s19 this suggests that n cl aa is stable in presence of ocl and therefore k ocl n cl aa is negligible in addition in contrast to n cl ba a self decay of n cl aa kn cl aa was not observed in the tested ph range 7 10 fig s19 lastly k hocl aa and k hocl n cl aa were determined by simultaneously fitting to chlorine decrease and n cl aa evolution at ph 7 by using k hocl aa and k hocl n cl aa as fitting parameters as shown in figure s20 the scenario analyses suggest optimal values of 0 008 m 1s 1 and 9 m 1s 1 for k hocl aa and k hocl n cl aa respectively applying the obtained rate constants table s2 the chlorine decrease and n cl aa evolution were well estimated for different ph values fig 4 3 5 influence of bromide on the chlorination of amides under oxidative water treatment processes bromide can play a critical role because bromide is converted to reactive bromine species e g hypobromous acid hypobromite hobr obr which react fast with many inorganic and organic compounds heeb et al 2014 hobr reacts with amides with apparent second order rate constants on the order of 1 3 m 1s 1 at ph 7 2 7 5 pattison and davies 2004 the influence of bromide on the chlorination of amides was assessed under typical water treatment conditions with 1 mg l chlorine as cl2 and varying bromide concentrations 10 100 and 500 μg l by comparing the formation yield of chloramide and bromamide text s8 as shown in table s5 when hobr is in excess of amide 40 of amide was estimated to transform to bromamide other than chloramide in the presence of 10 μg l bromide and 87 of amide yielded bromamide with bromide concentration higher than 100 μg l the formation of chloramide becomes gradually more important for chlorine concentrations 1 mg l and dominant when the amide concentration is higher than the bromide concentration table s5 this suggests that the role of bromide has to be assessed during chlorination of amides for practical water treatment conditions 3 6 kinetics and mechanisms of the reactions of n chloramides with phenolic compounds n cl aa n cl n maa and n cl n mba were selected to investigate the kinetics of their reactions with phenolic compounds phenol catechol resorcinol and hydroquinone under pseudo first order conditions table s6 apparent second order rate constants at ph 7 for the reactions of phenols with n chloramides range from 9 7 10 5 to 9 8 10 2 m 1s 1 which are 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than the reactions with chloramines heeb et al 2017 fig 5 comparing among different phenols the k app values for the reactions of n chloramides with different phenols increase in the order of phenol hydroquinone catechol resorcinol which is the same for chloramines heeb et al 2017 as expected resorcinol has the highest reactivity with two hydroxyl groups in meta position and phenol has the lowest reactivity with only one hydroxyl group criquet et al 2015 heeb et al 2017 similar k app values were obtained for both phenol and catechol when reacting with the three tested n chloramides a lower k app value 30 38 fold was observed for resorcinol when reacting with n cl aa in comparison with n cl n maa and n cl n mba and a higher k app value 8 fold was observed for hydroquinone when reacting with n cl n maa in comparison with n cl aa and n cl n mba table s6 these observed differences in the k app values warrant further investigations to obtain mechanistic information on the reactions between n chloramides and phenolic compounds transformation products from the reaction of n cl aa with phenol resorcinol and hydroquinone were analyzed by hplc uv text s2 for analytical method in the reaction of n cl aa with phenol and resorcinol ring chlorinated products were detected which suggests an electrophilic aromatic substitution from the reaction of phenol with n cl aa 4 chlorophenol and 2 chlorophenol were gradually formed as major reaction products followed by formation of 2 4 dichlorophenol and 2 6 dichlorophenol for longer reaction times 10 h figure s21 for the reaction of resorcinol with n cl aa 4 chlororesorcinol and 2 chlororesorcinol were detected with 4 chlororesorcinol as the predominant reaction intermediate during chlorination of resorcinol a ratio of 3 1 was observed for the formation rate of 4 chlororesorcinol relative to 2 chlororesorcinol heasley et al 1989 rebenne et al 1996 further reaction of chlorinated resorcinol with n cl aa leads to the formation of 4 6 dichlororesorcinol and 2 4 dichlororesorcinol fig s22 overall the detected chlorinated phenols and chlorinated resorcinols only account for the partial loss of phenol and resorcinol for instance when 40 16 μm of phenol and resorcinol were abated 2 8 μm chlorinated phenolic products were detected therefore significant fractions of other transformation products including ring cleavage products must be formed which were not identified in this study acero et al 2005a arnold et al 2008 in the reaction of n cl aa with hydroquinone chlorinated hydroquinones were not detected instead p benzoquinone was detected as the only major reaction product which suggests an electron transfer reaction mechanism fig s23 the reaction between n cl aa and catechol was monitored spectrophotometrically and no obvious o quinone peak was observed λmax at 390 nm criquet et al 2015 which is potentially due to relatively slow reaction between n cl aa and catechol and the instability of o quinone overall similar to free chlorine and chloramines criquet et al 2015 heeb et al 2017 phenol and resorcinol react with n chloramides mainly via electrophilic aromatic substitution and hydroquinone reacts mainly via electron transfer besides phenolic transformation products the fate of the n chloramides was also monitored in the reaction of n cl n mba with phenols n cl n mba was chosen in this case because n cl n mba and n mba can be monitored by hplc uv n cl n mba was observed to be fully transformed to n mba after reacting with different phenolic compounds with an excellent mass balance fig s24 scheme 1 therefore cl amides can serve as a temporary reservoir for active chlorine 4 conclusions the kinetics and mechanisms of the chlorination of amides and the reactions of n chloramides with phenolic compounds have been investigated the main outcomes of this study are chlorination of amides is dominated by ocl via forming a hydrogen bond between amido hydrogen and the oxygen in ocl with species specific second order rate constants k ocl in the range of 7 3 10 3 2 3 m 1s 1 an electron donating group at the amide n and or the n carbonyl c partially compensate the electron withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group on the amide n enhancing the strength of the n h bond this leads to a lower tendency to form a hydrogen bond with lower second order rate constant for the reaction with ocl e g k ocl ba k ocl n mba k ocl n pba chlorination of both primary and secondary amides forms n chloramides n chlorinated primary amides undergo further chlorination mainly by reacting with hocl with higher second order rate constants 10 m 1s 1 than the first chlorination step this is due to a weakening of the n h bond and an enhanced reactivity with the electrophilic hocl in the presence of bromide the formation of bromamides in addition of chloramides can be significant due to a higher reactivity of hobr with amides activation energies for the chlorination of amides are in the range of 62 88 kj mol similar to the chlorination of α β unsaturated carbonyls the chlorination of both compound classes is dominated by reaction with ocl in contrast lower activation energies are obtained for moieties such as neutral amines reduced sulfur and activated aromatic compounds for which the reactions occur mainly with hocl n chloramides react with phenol and resorcinol via electrophilic aromatic substitution and with hydroquinone via electron transfer the amides are recycled after reacting with phenols apparent second order rate constant for the reactions of phenolic compounds with n chloramides are in the order of 10 4 0 1 m 1s 1 slightly lower than for chloramines 6 10 4 0 16 m 1s 1 and 3 5 orders of magnitude lower than for chlorine 18 4 103 m 1s 1 criquet et al 2015 heeb et al 2017 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

reproduced circumstances under which all three effects of cu on legionella growth i e reduction promotion or no effect were observed the objective of this study was to evaluate the extent to which orthophosphate corrosion inhibitor and water heater anode type can undermine the efficacy of antimicrobial cu for l pneumophila control to understand how these factors interact under a backdrop of complex characteristic of real world systems four controlled semi continuous flow pilot scale water heater systems were operated in parallel testing effects of dosing 1 cu alone 2 phosphate alone 3 cu with phosphate and 4 nothing control results obtained at pilot scale are compared to examination of the strains in pure culture in inert glass vessels using previously published song et al 2021 and newly collected data to gain insight into how factors at play in real world systems can interfere with the antimicrobial capacity of cu the findings can help to improve hot water system design in a manner that more effectively limits l pneumophila proliferation 2 materials and methods 2 1 hot water plumbing system configuration and operation four identical 19 gallon electric water heaters with aluminum al anodes were connected in parallel to blacksburg va usa tap water heated water was continuously recirculated through a 15 ft pex b pipe on each plumbing system fig si 1 influent water to the plumbing systems was delivered by 1 2 cu pipes to four in line gac filters and two ferric oxide brightwell aquatics fort payne al filters in series to reduce disinfectant background metals and phosphate originating from the distribution or building plumbing system i e treated influent water the influent flow rate was set at 0 5 gpm and effluent from the plumbing systems was treated by two

reinforced ¾ inch pvc pipes and pvc fittings water heater influent and effluent lines were equipped with spring check valves prolline memphis tn to prevent cross contamination water flow was controlled by automated timers chrontrol san diego ca and solenoid valves red hat asco st louis mo all four plumbing systems were acclimated for 2 5 years at 37 c to establish mature biofilms before experiments began l pneumophila did not naturally establish during this acclimation period thus two environmental strains of l pneumophila serogroup 1 were inoculated at the beginning of the experimental phase supplemental materials and methods these two strains were previously isolated from a water system associated with a legionnaires disease outbreak in quincy il rhoads et al 2020 as systems acclimated to the inoculation they were flushed 1 day for 1 min at 0 5 gpm for 3 weeks to facilitate the growth of legionella followed by 6 additional weeks of acclimation with auto flush 12

sequence results were mapped to the european workgroup of legionella infection ewgli sbt database for identification ewgli 2019 2 3 bench scale pure culture experiments pure culture experiments were performed to determine strain specific effects of cu and to elucidate the impact of al ions on cu toxicity details of l pneumophila cell preparation cu inactivation experiments and l pneumophila enumeration were described previously song et al 2021 briefly l pneumophila plate cultures bcye 37 c for 72 hr of lab strain 130b serogroup 1 and one outbreak associated strain inoculated into the experimental systems were freshly prepared from freezer stocks stored in buffered yeast extract bye broth with 20 v v glycerol for each experimental run only one inoculated strain was used for follow up bench scale test since both strains were found to be the same sbt bye broth was inoculated with an l pneumophila from the freshly inoculated plates at an initial od600 of 0 2 lin et al 2002 the inoculated bye broth was subsequently incubated at 37 c with agitation for 14 hr to early stationary phase after broth culture cells were pelleted by centrifuging at 5000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was decanted cell pellets were washed twice resuspended and diluted to 3 108 cfu ml using sterilized treated influent water subsequently 3 108 cfu ml aliquots were used for each experimental run unless otherwise noted for cu inactivation tests after cu dosing ligand addition none 1 mg l al and 3 mg l al as al2 so4 3 ph adjustment 7 5 7 0 or 6 5 and 20 minutes mixing the glass bottles acid washed and sterilized were relocated to a biosafety cabinet where l pneumophila was inoculated initial l pneumophila levels were quantified and solutions were transferred to 50 ml glass reactors and incubated at 37 c reactors were inverted for homogenization prior to quantifying culturable l pneumophila at t 10 40 60 120 240 360 and 1440 min in triplicate the cu inactivation data were fitted with chick watson first order inactivation curves and the disinfection constants were estimated by best fit regression using the least squares method 2 4 statistical analysis statistical differences in l pneumophila numbers were determined using anova with post hoc tukey s test or kruskal wallis test with post hoc dunn s test bonferroni correction in r version 3 6 1 significance threshold was set at a p value 0 05 3 results 3 1 baseline conditions inoculation and establishment of l pneumophila after the 2 year baseline phase during which the water heaters were conditioned with local tap water no culturable l pneumophila were detected in the influent or recirculating lines of the water heaters ambient cu in the local tap water during the baseline phase was 30 µg l after the outbreak associated l pneumophila strains were inoculated directly to each water heater and allowed to establish for nine weeks while receiving treated gac and ferric oxide filtered influent water table 1 l pneumophila increased to a stable level across the four systems of about 2 4 105 mpn l approximately 2 logs higher than the inoculated dose with no significant differences among the four replicate systems fig 1 a we discovered at phase al 1200 when influent water monitoring began that l pneumophila of the same sequence type as the inoculated strain st36 colonized the influent water supply at about 1 3 7 7 103 mpn l table si 2 thus the inoculated strain migrated upstream of the one way check valve i e against the direction of flow to colonize the gac filters the treated influent l pneumophila levels were consistently 2 log lower compared to the lowest system effluent samples demonstrating robust growth of l pneumophila in the hot water system tanks and recirculation lines table si 3 3 2 effect of cu dosing on l pneumophila 3 2 1 high cu doses were required to decrease l pneumophila median l pneumophila in the wh control without chemical dosing remained constant over the duration of the experiment around 2 3 105 mpn l figs 1a and si 2 levels of l pneumophila in wh po4 were generally not significantly different from those in wh control except during phase al 100 when it was 0 2 log lower anova test with post hoc tukey test p 0 0019 and in phase al 2000 when it was 0 6 log higher p 0 0001 no antimicrobial effects of cu were observed in wh cu until the target level of 1200 µg l cu phase al 1200 at this point wh cu yielded 0 4 log less l pneumophila than wh control kruskal wallis with post hoc dunn test p 0 01 after increasing the target cu dose to 2000 µg l l pneumophila decreased by an additional 0 5 log 3 2 2 orthophosphate interfered with cu antimicrobial effects the addition of orthophosphate not only eliminated the antimicrobial effects of 1200 and 2000 µg l cu but l pneumophila levels in the wh cu po4 heater were 0 3 0 6 logs higher than wh control in 5 of the 6 phases with an al anode kruskal wallis with post hoc dunn test p 0 05 addition of orthophosphate and cu together also resulted in 0 2 0 4 logs higher l pneumophila relative to the wh po4 system in 2 of the 6 phases with an al anode kruskal wallis with post hoc dunn test p 0 05 this demonstrated a scenario where cu addition can actually increase l pneumophila numbers i e when orthophosphate is also dosed 3 2 3 potential interactions between al anodes cu and orthophosphate al anode biofilm samples collected from wh cu at the end of phase al 2000 were found to contain more than 1 log less l pneumophila 1 104 cfu in2 relative to wh po4 and wh cu po4 1 7 2 3 105 cfu in2 however it is important to note that l pneumophila levels were also very low in wh control biofilm samples 1 104 cfu in2 table si 9 which makes it difficult to pinpoint effects specifically attributable to cu addition 3 2 4 cu speciation and bioavailability total cu was consistently 30 µg l in the wh control and wh po4 systems where no cu was dosed for wh cu and wh cu po4 cu levels were maintained within 35 of the target dose fig 1b in wh cu and wh cu po4 the ph ranged from 6 22 6 73 across all phases table si 4 resulting in 36 65 soluble cu in wh cu but 10 soluble cu in wh cu po4 the mean level of cupric ion cu2 rose to 80 µg l and 150 µg l in wh cu when the target cu concentration was 1200 µg l and 2000 µg l respectively however cu2 was consistently undetectable in wh cu po4 low cu solubility was expected in wh cu po4 due to precipitation of cupric phosphate this particulate form of cu likely also contributed to high variability in total cu measurements fig 1b 3 3 impact of anode type on water chemistry and efficacy of antimicrobial cu 3 3 1 culturable l pneumophila was impacted by anode type the wh control condition afforded the opportunity to examine the effect of the anode type in absence of addition of cu or po4 while there was a trend towards a slight increase 0 5 log in l pneumophila after switching to the mg anode and corresponding decrease back to a level comparable to the al anode after switching to the powered anode these apparent differences were not statistically significant figs 2 a and si 2 in the wh cu condition where cu dosing was maintained at 2000 µg l as the anodes were changed l pneumophila levels increased to a level comparable to wh control after switching from an al to a mg anode this higher level of l pneumophila in the wh cu condition was maintained throughout the 4 months of operation with the mg anode the loss of cu antimicrobial properties during use of mg anodes was likely caused by the increase in ph to above 8 0 due to mg anode rod corrosion soluble cu decreased from 45 to 9 fig 2b table si 4 which is consistent with known effects of ph on cu solubility after switching to the powered anode l pneumophila decreased by 1 log in the wh cu condition and the median l pneumophila was 0 2 log lower than observed during the al 2000 phase kruskal wallis with post hoc dunn test p 0 06 this re emergence of cu antimicrobial properties corresponded with the ph decreasing to 6 4 and soluble cu increasing again to 50 after the mg anodes were replaced with powered anodes the median l pneumophila in wh cu po4 also trended upward after switching to a mg anode but was not significantly different from wh control the levels of l pneumophila dropped and remained similar to wh control after switching to the powered anode but the relative standard deviation was high 101 median l pneumophila measured in wh po4 was consistently similar to wh control while using mg or powered anodes mg anode biofilm samples collected from wh cu at the end of the mg 2000 phase contained more than 1 5 log less l pneumophila relative to mg anode biofilms collected from all other water heaters table si 9 pipe loop biofilm samples collected during phase mg 2000 similarly indicated that wh cu samples contained about 0 5 log less l pneumophila than wh control or wh po4 samples dosing both cu and po4 3 together however increased culturable l pneumophila in the wh cu po4 pipe loop biofilms by 0 5 log compared to the wh control system table si 9 3 3 2 cu deposition corrosion increased anode corrosion rate in addition to impacting the ph as discussed above the type of anode significantly impacted other aspects of the water chemistry with the al anode the effluent increased to 500 µg l al in wh control due to anode rod corrosion fig 2c al levels in wh po4 were comparable to wh control on average but more variable likely due to the precipitates formed with the addition of phosphate in contrast both conditions with cu dosing wh cu and wh cu po4 released much more al 2 4 than wh control during phase al 2000 presumably due to accelerated attack of the al surface from cu deposition corrosion fig 2c likewise when the mg anode was used the total mg in wh cu or wh cu po4 3 was higher 1 5 2 than those in wh control or wh po4 fig 2c the difference could again be attributed to cu deposition corrosion in the treated influent water al was consistently 25 µg l mg was 5829 1616 µg l and was 5808 µg l in 80 of measurements additional evidence of cu deposition corrosion was observed in the galvanic corrosion current measurements between the anode rods and steel tank the sacrificial current increased 10 for the al anode and 1 6 for mg anodes in wh cu compared to wh control table si 5 the higher current in the al system did not translate proportionally to higher al in the bulk water this is expected due to the nature of al corrosion which readily forms aluminum hydroxide that remains attached to the anode rod or will deposit as sediment to the bottom of the water heater tank in practice the increased corrosion rate would theoretically translate to at least a 90 decrease in useful lifespan for the al anode and a 38 decrease in lifespan for the mg anode only traces of evolved hydrogen gas were detectable while using al or powdered anodes table si 6 using a mg anode hydrogen levels were 87 ppm 1 6 10 5 mg l in bulk water sample in wh cu versus 1 11 ppm 2 10 6 mg l in water heater for all other conditions this demonstrates that addition of cu and presence of mg anodes acts synergistically to increase the concentration of hydrogen which is an important microbial electron donor it is noted that the measured hydrogen levels would also be decreased by hydrogen utilizing microbes in the water after switching from al to the mg and powered anodes it took time to flush out labile al from the system when the ph increased to 8 0 with the mg anodes aluminum solubility would be expected to increase from the prior ph 6 0 creating a driving force for dissolution of sediment associated al table si 4 this is consistent with the increased al measured in the systems dosed with orthophosphate wh po4 and wh cu po4 fig 4 3c al solubility subsequently decreased after switching to powered anodes and ph decreased to 7 0 table si 7 as predicted based on solubility levels of fe which could originate from corrosion of the steel tank or leaching from the ferric filters used to remove influent phosphate from the local water supply were comparable in the influent and in the effluent of each system across all anode types table si 6 this suggests but does not prove that all the anodes equally protected the water tank liners from corrosion 3 4 cu solubility predicts antimicrobial effect of cu for the wh cu and wh cu po4 systems the trends in l pneumophila with the different anode types versus wh control were consistent with expectations based on cu solubility as controlled by ph and phosphate the log reduction of l pneumophila relative to the wh control condition was strongly correlated with measured soluble cu fig 3 pearson test r2 0 85 as expected there was no correlation between soluble cu and log difference in l pneumophila for wh cu po4 and wh control likely due to the very low levels of soluble cu data not shown 3 5 exploring limitations to antimicrobial properties of cu 3 5 1 why were such high doses of cu required to reduce l pneumophila in the hot water systems the dose required to achieve measurable l pneumophila reduction in this study was unexpectedly high the maximum difference in l pneumophila culture numbers achieved by cu dosing to the wh cu system compared to wh control was only slightly greater than 1 log despite the very high target cu dose 2000 µg l in our prior bench scale studies using l pneumophila strain 130b in pure culture in inert glass vessels we observed 3 5 log removal after only 6 hours exposure to 800 µg l cu song et al 2021 fig 3 we evaluated two specific hypotheses that potentially explain the much lower than expected antimicrobial effect of cu in the pilot scale plumbing systems versus the earlier bench scale tests using the same tap water 1 water chemistry changes associated with anode rod corrosion may have reduced biocidal forms of cu and 2 the l pneumophila strain dominating the pilot scale systems in this study fundamentally differed in cu tolerance relative to strain 130b used in the bench scale study 3 5 2 al acts as a cu complexation ligand iron and al hydroxide particulates are known to form surface complexes with copper and remove it from solution karthikeyan et al 1997 mcbride 1985 the addition of al during follow up pure culture tests reduced cu toxicity towards l pneumophila when compared to tests without al addition fig 4 a addition of just 800 µg l cu led to a 3 log reduction in l pneumophila strain 130b in pure culture at ph 6 5 when 1000 µg l al as al2 so4 3 was added the cu antimicrobial effect was reduced by 0 6 log when al was increased to 3000 µg l the antimicrobial effects of cu were reduced by 1 9 log fig 4a at ph 7 the addition of 1000 µg l al reduced the antimicrobial effect of 800 μg l cu by 2 5 log all of these trends are consistent with expectations of al binding soluble cu with greater binding at higher ph fig 4b addition of 1 mg l al reduced soluble cu levels by more than 50 at ph 6 5 and more than 80 at ph 7 relative to a control without al fig 4b 3 5 3 different legionella strains respond differently to cu we confirmed that the outbreak associated strain of l pneumophila that colonized the pilot scale water heaters was more tolerant to cu than the lab strain 130b that was used in previous bench scale experiments song et al 2021 in a head to head comparison achieving the same 3 log reduction in l pneumophila required 720 mins exposure to 2000 µg l total cu ph 6 5 1600 µg l soluble cu for the outbreak associated strain but just 210 mins exposure to 800 µg l total cu ph 7 690 µg l soluble cu for strain 130b fig 4c applying the chick watson ct model the l pneumophila strain that colonized the water heaters was 7 more resistant to cu than strain 130b 3 5 4 phosphate precipitates cu and indicates synergistic legionella growth promotion effect to demonstrate how orthophosphate impacts cu antimicrobial capacity we normalized the differences in l pneumophila measured relative to wh control and plotted the data as a function of soluble cu and soluble phosphate fig 5 when soluble cu levels were 300 µg l l pneumophila was consistently lower than in wh control fig 5 when soluble cu levels were 300 µg l and soluble p levels were 300 µg l l pneumophila numbers were not different relative to the wh control however when soluble cu levels were 300 µg l and soluble phosphorus levels were 300 µg l l pneumophila increased relative to the control in four of twelve cases fig 5 three of these four cases were in wh cu po4 while the fourth was in wh po4 lower levels of culturable l pneumophila were observed in anode and recirculation pipe loop biofilms collected from the wh cu system compared to wh control l pneumophila levels were maintained on the anode biofilm but increased in the recirculation pipe loop biofilm in wh cu po4 samples compared to wh control table si 9 the monitoring of general microbial parameters hpc 16s rrna gene total cell count tcc also indicated mixed effects of dosed cu the greatest hpc reduction observed 1 log in the wh cu condition was during the use of the powered anode and dosing of 2000 µg l cu fig si 4 both 16s rrna gene copies and tcc levels increased 0 5 log during use of the al and mg anodes and dosing of 2000 µg l cu when both cu and orthophosphate were dosed there were higher levels of hpc 16s rrna gene copies and tcc levels in phase mg 2000 fig si 4 4 discussion this study provides fundamental insight into how water system design and other factors can act to undermine the efficacy of antimicrobial copper against l pneumophila the pilot scale nature of this study was particularly valuable for assessing the outcomes of interactive effects such as copper dose anode type and orthophosphate addition under conditions representative of real world hot water systems the findings can help to inform improved design of water heater systems and remedial strategies for l pneumophila control 4 1 much lower than expected antimicrobial effects even at very high cu doses the inability of very high levels of cu 1 2 mg l at low ph 7 and low level of orthophosphate 0 2 mg l to eradicate l pneumophila even after months of exposure was striking and unexpected based on our prior bench scale pure culture study song et al 2021 it was expected that a threshold dose of 0 8 mg l in the wh cu system would have begun to have an effect important differences between the experiments in this study compared to our prior bench scale study include 1 the bench scale was carried out in inert glass bottles while this study incorporated various real world complexities associated with pilot scale 2 the bench scale study was carried out in pure culture while the present study was carried out under the more realistic conditions of mixed microbial communities and 3 in the bench scale study l pneumophila were grown to stationary phase in buffer yeast extract medium washed and then immediately placed in the drinking water medium containing the dosed copper while the current experiments were performed using gradually increasing cu levels over 8 months which could have allowed the strains to acclimate to both the drinking water conditions and the copper addition there are many possible mechanisms for the reduced cu antimicrobial efficacy first it was previously shown that factors such as high ph orthophosphate and natural organic matter can reduce antimicrobial effects of cu towards legionella song et al 2021 lin et al 1996 lin et al 2002 but we identified additional factors through this realistic study of a pilot scale system specifically al ions that formed hydroxide gels could have trapped bioavailable cu fig 4 while mg anode corrosion was shown to dramatically increase the ph within the water heater system fig 2 but even using powered anodes which did not release al or raise ph very high levels of cu only achieved 1 2 log reduction of l pneumophila compared to a control without cu dosing fig 2 it was apparent that even cu doses exceeding the 1 mg l epa secondary maximum contaminant level in potable water which may have adverse health aesthetic implications did not completely limit l pneumophila causing us to consider other factors that must have played a role in the observed reduction in antimicrobial capacity of added cu 4 2 strain differences influenced efficacy of cu for l pneumophila control here it was found that the outbreak associated strain inoculated to the water heater systems had a first order inactivation constant 7 lower compared to strain 130b that was used in the pure culture bench scale tests song et al 2021 fig 4 bedard et al 2021 recently demonstrated that l pneumophila isolates vary in their tolerance to cu noting 2 log reduction in culturability after exposure to 5 mg l cu for 600 hrs however the bedard et al test ph was 7 8 which would be expected to reduce cu biocidal effects compared to the lower ph range evaluated herein in the present study only 1 log reduction was achieved after 4 months 2000 hrs exposure 4 3 differences in pure culture vs pilot hot water system experimental conditions influence outcomes of cu dosing besides strain differences it is also important to consider that the pilot scale hot water systems were allowed to establish a robust microbial ecosystem of acclimated biofilm and bulk water microorganisms in fact given that it can take multiple years for a drinking water system to establish mature biofilm buse et al 2019 henne et al 2012 boe hansen et al 2002 this study was unique in that the systems were allowed to acclimate for two years before commencing this study making it much more realistic compared to other controlled lab studies this allowed biofilms to mature which are known to provide a niche for the proliferation of free living amoebae that serve as hosts for l pneumophila replication falkinham 2015 the biofilm itself can also provide shelter to l pneumophila falkinham 2015 schwering et al 2013 thus it is reasonable to hypothesize that the mature biofilm and corresponding amoebae also acted to protect l pneumophila from the antimicrobial action of dosed cu for amoeba in culture hwang et al 2006 demonstrated in bench scale pure culture suspensions that planktonic l pneumophila was inactivated completely 7 2 log reduction within 8 hours after exposure to 1 mg l of cu while the intracellular l pneumophila inside of acanthamoeba polyphaga achieved only 3 log reduction even after 7 days of cu exposure extrapolating their results using same disinfection constant a 7 2 log reduction for the intracellular l pneumophila would be expected to be observed in 16 days the apparent resistance of l pneumophila in the present study far exceeded this estimate thomas et al 2004 showed in one pilot scale system at ph 7 6 that 0 8 mg l of cu had no impact on amoeba acanthamoeba hartmannella and vahlkampfia levels in either planktonic and biofilm samples but the l pneumophila released to the water was still reduced 3 logs below detection limit after 6 days exposure to cu in that study again the apparent tolerance of l pneumophila reported in this study was much higher 4 4 interactive effects of water chemistry water heater system design and drinking water microbiology govern antimicrobial capacity of cu here we reported divergent effects of cu on legionella under realistic conditions simulated by the pilot scale water heater systems as copper sometimes reduced had no impact on or even promoted the growth of legionella relative to the control system with low ambient copper to our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate all three potential outcomes of cu dosing in a head to head multi factorial comparison three out of four cases where cu dosing was associated with increases in l pneumophila relative to the control were observed in the wh cu po4 system this is consistent with observations of buse et al 2014 who showed that effluent from cdc biofilm reactors equipped with coupons of different pipe materials at ph 8 and po4 0 2 mg l contained up to 20 more l pneumophila gene copies when cu coupons were used relative to pvc coupons in a study of simulated cold water pipes at room temperature gião et al 2015 also demonstrated that cu coupons could support more biofilm associated l pneumophila where the levels of phosphate in the test water was not reported it is important to note that the control with extra 3 mg l phosphate alone did not significantly increase l pneumophila compared to the situation with lower phosphate in the control for seven out of eight test phases hence in this case the higher l pneumophila in the wh cu po4 system cannot be attributed to the additional phosphate nutrients as was hypothesized by atkinson et al 2022 and jereb et al 2022 levels of phosphate limitation for l pneumophila have not been identified but they are often 10 µg l for other potable water microbes zhang et al 2008 droogenbroeck laudelout 1967 one study showed that dosing cu shifted the microbial community structure to favor the growth of amoeba hosts buse et al 2014 hypothetically this contributed to the increase of l pneumophila levels through enhanced amoeba protection and intracellular replication another possible cause of cu promoting growth in pilot or full scale systems could be cu deposition corrosion on less noble metals such as al and mg anodes which would promote hydrogen evolution and autotrophic fixation of carbon potentially indirectly promoting the growth of legionella rhoads et al 2017 our study showed that higher levels of hpc tcc and 16s rrna gene levels in hot water systems dosed with cu corresponded with increased hydrogen evolution when mg anodes were used although an increase of l pneumophila was not observed in this case these factors are still not fully understood and more research is needed to better understand the association of l pneumophila growth to the levels of hydrogen gas phosphate levels and amoeba hosts while cu dosing could not eradicate l pneumophila from these hot water systems reduction was still achieved in a manner that demonstrated how anode type and corrosion control agents can act to undermine the capacity of cu to control l pneumophila importantly we confirmed our prior bench scale work that soluble cu is a more accurate indicator for cu antimicrobial effects under the more complex real world conditions associated with the pilot scale systems trends in soluble cu were consistent with reduced antimicrobial impacts in response to phosphate higher ph and al thus if the intention is to rely on cu inactivation for controlling legionella then soluble cu should be monitored in this study 300 µg l soluble cu was consistently associated with significant reduction in l pneumophila relative to a control with no cu dose still it may be challenging to implement cu as an effective biocide while still maintaining total copper below 1 3 2 mg l although such public health standards do not apply to hot water in the us 5 conclusions soluble cu is an effective indicator of cu antimicrobial capacity even in more complex environments represented by realistic hot water plumbing systems in particular dosing of orthophosphate which is widely added by drinking water utilities to control corrosion directly reduces soluble copper and overall antimicrobial capacity in some cases cu added together with orthophosphate to apparently promote the growth of legionella provided an example of at least one circumstance where cu addition can induce interactive effects that elevate legionella compared to a control system with trace cu in this study it was demonstrated for the first time that different water heater sacrificial anode types are subject to different corrosion processes which indirectly influence cu antimicrobial capacity specifically aluminum ions released from aluminum anode corrosion at 1 mg l can form an al oh 3 gel which can remove 80 of the soluble cu from water and reduce cu antimicrobial effects by 2 log at ph 7 corrosion from mg anodes was found to dramatically increase the ph from 6 8 to 8 which correspondingly reduced cu antimicrobial capacity cu deposition further increased the anode corrosion rate and promoted evolution of hydrogen gas which is a potent electron donor that stimulates autotrophic microbial growth especially with a mg anode electric powered anodes did not release metals or alter ph and thus did not diminish cu antimicrobial capacity still across the pilot scale experiments even very high levels of cu 1 2 mg l at low ph 7 failed to fully eradicate culturable legionella the much lower than expected antimicrobial efficacy of cu in the pilot scale hot water plumbing systems was found to be partially explained by the properties of the strain that colonized the systems based on fitting the data to a chick watson disinfection model the outbreak associated strain that was inoculated into the systems was estimated to be 7 times more tolerant to cu compared to the common lab strain applied in the bench scale tests it is important to also recognize that in the pilot scale systems drinking water biofilms and the amoeba hosts that colonize them can further shield legionella

14627,copper cu is sometimes applied as an antimicrobial for controlling legionella in hot water plumbing systems but its efficacy is inconsistent here we examined the effects of cu 0 2 mg l orthophosphate corrosion inhibitor 0 or 3 mg l as phosphate and water heater anodes aluminum magnesium and powered anodes on both bulk water and biofilm associated l pneumophila in pilot scale water heater systems soluble but not total cu was a good predictor of antimicrobial capacity of cu even after months of exposure to very high cu levels 1 2 mg l and low ph 7 which increases solubility and enhances bioavailability of cu culturable l pneumophila was only reduced by 1 log cu antimicrobial capacity was shown to be limited by various factors including binding of cu ions by aluminum hydroxide precipitates released from corrosion of aluminum anodes higher ph due to magnesium anode corrosion and high cu tolerance of the outbreak associated l pneumophila strain that was inoculated into the systems l pneumophila numbers were also higher in several instances when cu was dosed together with orthophosphate e g with an al anode revealing at least one scenario where high levels of total cu appeared to stimulate legionella the controlled pilot scale nature of this study provides new understanding of the limitations of cu as an antimicrobial in real world plumbing systems

antimicrobial to control legionella pneumophila growth in premise i e building plumbing however the antimicrobial effects of cu on legionella pneumophila are variable for reasons that are not fully understood cu that is dosed through cu silver ionization systems or naturally released from cu pipe corrosion has been demonstrated to influence levels of legionella in bench scale and pilot scale experiments lin et al 1996 us epa 2016 as well as in real world hot water plumbing systems such as those encountered in hospitals cachafeiro et al 2007 miuetzner et al 1997 us epa 2016 in many cases total cu levels of 0 2 0 8 mg l which are below the us environmental protection agency epa or world health organization who copper drinking water guidelines of 1 3 2 mg l who 2017 us epa 2015 have measurably decreased levels of legionella cachafeiro et al 2007 lin et al 1996 miuetzner et al 1997 however other studies have shown that cu had no impact on legionella levels bedard et al 2021 lin et

levels were actually associated with higher levels up to 20x of legionella many factors can diminish cu antimicrobial properties including 1 precipitation of cu due to higher ph and phosphate based

reproduced circumstances under which all three effects of cu on legionella growth i e reduction promotion or no effect were observed the objective of this study was to evaluate the extent to which orthophosphate corrosion inhibitor and water heater anode type can undermine the efficacy of antimicrobial cu for l pneumophila control to understand how these factors interact under a backdrop of complex characteristic of real world systems four controlled semi continuous flow pilot scale water heater systems were operated in parallel testing effects of dosing 1 cu alone 2 phosphate alone 3 cu with phosphate and 4 nothing control results obtained at pilot scale are compared to examination of the strains in pure culture in inert glass vessels using previously published song et al 2021 and newly collected data to gain insight into how factors at play in real world systems can interfere with the antimicrobial capacity of cu the findings can help to improve hot water system design in a manner that more effectively limits l pneumophila proliferation 2 materials and methods 2 1 hot water plumbing system configuration and operation four identical 19 gallon electric water heaters with aluminum al anodes were connected in parallel to blacksburg va usa tap water heated water was continuously recirculated through a 15 ft pex b pipe on each plumbing system fig si 1 influent water to the plumbing systems was delivered by 1 2 cu pipes to four in line gac filters and two ferric oxide brightwell aquatics fort payne al filters in series to reduce disinfectant background metals and phosphate originating from the distribution or building plumbing system i e treated influent water the influent flow rate was set at 0 5 gpm and effluent from the plumbing systems was treated by two

reinforced ¾ inch pvc pipes and pvc fittings water heater influent and effluent lines were equipped with spring check valves prolline memphis tn to prevent cross contamination water flow was controlled by automated timers chrontrol san diego ca and solenoid valves red hat asco st louis mo all four plumbing systems were acclimated for 2 5 years at 37 c to establish mature biofilms before experiments began l pneumophila did not naturally establish during this acclimation period thus two environmental strains of l pneumophila serogroup 1 were inoculated at the beginning of the experimental phase supplemental materials and methods these two strains were previously isolated from a water system associated with a legionnaires disease outbreak in quincy il rhoads et al 2020 as systems acclimated to the inoculation they were flushed 1 day for 1 min at 0 5 gpm for 3 weeks to facilitate the growth of legionella followed by 6 additional weeks of acclimation with auto flush 12

additional control wh control table 1 target levels of cu in wh cu and wh cu po4 were achieved by fully dissolving cuso4 sigma aldrich st louis mo in deionized water to create stock solutions followed by orthophosphate does for wh cu po4 injecting cu stock solutions into the influent line with chemical dosing pumps while the solutions were constantly mixed on stir plates and then increasing the injection rate stepwise to achieve target doses of 50 100 300 600 1200 to 2000 µg l phases 2 7 respectively each target cu level was maintained for 1 3 months to achieve stable conditions before each sampling event table 1 after achieving a target cu dose of 2000 µg l water heater anodes were replaced with new magnesium mg rods phase 8 and then electricity powered titanium non sacrificial rods plessisville quebec canada phase 9 and operated with 2000 µg l cu for 3 months with each anode type 2 2 system sampling and analysis 2 2 1 water biofilm sampling strategy each phase included 4 7

removing the anode rods and swabbing the surface 1 in2 in the middle section plumbing system recirculation loop biofilms were sampled at the same time i e twice during the experimental period the exterior of the loops were sanitized with 70 ethanol cut approximately mid way from the tank with similarly sanitized pipe cutters and the inner surfaces 0 68 in2 were swabbed sterile polyester tip or

cole parmer vernon hills il electrical potential and the sacrificial current flowing between the water heater tanks and anodes were measured using a multimeter when anodes were not in electrical

sequence results were mapped to the european workgroup of legionella infection ewgli sbt database for identification ewgli 2019 2 3 bench scale pure culture experiments pure culture experiments were performed to determine strain specific effects of cu and to elucidate the impact of al ions on cu toxicity details of l pneumophila cell preparation cu inactivation experiments and l pneumophila enumeration were described previously song et al 2021 briefly l pneumophila plate cultures bcye 37 c for 72 hr of lab strain 130b serogroup 1 and one outbreak associated strain inoculated into the experimental systems were freshly prepared from freezer stocks stored in buffered yeast extract bye broth with 20 v v glycerol for each experimental run only one inoculated strain was used for follow up bench scale test since both strains were found to be the same sbt bye broth was inoculated with an l pneumophila from the freshly inoculated plates at an initial od600 of 0 2 lin et al 2002 the inoculated bye broth was subsequently incubated at 37 c with agitation for 14 hr to early stationary phase after broth culture cells were pelleted by centrifuging at 5000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was decanted cell pellets were washed twice resuspended and diluted to 3 108 cfu ml using sterilized treated influent water subsequently 3 108 cfu ml aliquots were used for each

bottles acid washed and sterilized were relocated to a biosafety cabinet where l pneumophila was inoculated initial l pneumophila levels were quantified and solutions were transferred to 50 ml glass reactors and incubated at 37 c reactors were inverted for homogenization prior to quantifying culturable l pneumophila at t 10 40 60 120 240 360 and 1440 min in triplicate the cu inactivation data were fitted with chick watson first order inactivation curves and the disinfection constants were estimated by best fit regression using the least squares method 2 4 statistical analysis statistical differences in l pneumophila numbers were determined using anova with post hoc tukey s test or kruskal wallis test with post hoc dunn s test bonferroni correction in r version 3 6 1 significance threshold was set at a p value 0 05 3 results 3 1 baseline conditions inoculation and establishment of l pneumophila after the 2 year baseline phase during which the water heaters were conditioned with local tap water no culturable l pneumophila were detected in the influent or recirculating lines of the water heaters ambient cu in the local tap water during the baseline phase was 30 µg l after the outbreak associated l pneumophila strains were inoculated directly to each water heater and allowed to establish for nine weeks while receiving treated gac and ferric oxide filtered influent water table 1 l pneumophila increased to a stable level across the four systems of about 2 4 105 mpn l approximately 2 logs higher than the inoculated dose with no significant differences among the four replicate systems fig 1 a we discovered at phase al 1200 when influent water monitoring began that l pneumophila of the same sequence type as the inoculated strain st36 colonized the influent water supply at about 1 3 7 7 103 mpn l table si 2 thus the inoculated strain migrated upstream of the one way check valve i e against the direction of flow to colonize the gac filters the treated influent l pneumophila levels were consistently 2 log lower compared to the lowest system effluent samples demonstrating robust growth of l pneumophila in the hot water system tanks and recirculation lines table si 3 3 2 effect of cu dosing on l pneumophila 3 2 1 high cu doses were required to decrease l pneumophila median l pneumophila in the wh control without chemical dosing remained constant over the duration of the experiment around 2 3 105 mpn l figs 1a and si 2 levels of l pneumophila in wh po4 were generally not significantly different from those in wh control except during phase al 100 when it was 0 2 log lower anova test with post hoc tukey test p 0 0019 and in phase al 2000 when it was 0 6 log higher p 0 0001 no antimicrobial effects of cu were observed in wh cu until the target level of 1200 µg l cu phase al 1200 at this point wh cu yielded 0 4 log less l pneumophila than wh control kruskal wallis with post hoc dunn test p 0 01 after increasing the target cu dose to 2000 µg l l pneumophila decreased by an additional 0 5 log 3 2 2 orthophosphate interfered with cu antimicrobial effects the addition of orthophosphate not only eliminated the antimicrobial effects of 1200 and 2000 µg l cu but l pneumophila levels in the wh cu po4 heater were 0 3 0 6 logs higher than wh control in 5 of the 6 phases with an al anode kruskal wallis with post hoc dunn test p 0 05 addition of orthophosphate and cu together also resulted in 0 2 0 4 logs higher l pneumophila relative to the wh po4 system in 2 of the 6 phases with an al anode kruskal wallis with post hoc dunn test p 0 05 this demonstrated a scenario where cu addition can actually increase l pneumophila numbers i e when orthophosphate is also dosed 3 2 3 potential interactions between al anodes cu and orthophosphate al anode biofilm samples collected from wh cu at the end of phase al 2000 were found to contain more than 1 log less l pneumophila 1 104 cfu in2 relative to wh po4 and wh cu po4 1 7 2 3 105 cfu in2 however it is important to note that l pneumophila levels were also very low in wh control biofilm samples 1 104 cfu in2 table si 9 which makes it difficult to pinpoint effects specifically attributable to cu addition 3 2 4 cu speciation and bioavailability total cu was consistently 30 µg l in the wh control and wh po4 systems where no cu was dosed for wh cu and wh cu po4 cu levels were maintained within 35 of the target dose fig 1b in wh cu and wh cu po4 the ph ranged from 6 22 6 73 across all phases table si 4 resulting in 36 65 soluble cu in wh cu but 10 soluble cu in wh cu po4 the mean level of cupric ion cu2 rose to 80 µg l and 150 µg l in wh cu when the target cu concentration was 1200 µg l and 2000 µg l respectively however cu2 was consistently undetectable in wh cu po4 low cu solubility was expected in wh cu po4 due to precipitation of cupric phosphate this particulate form of cu likely also contributed to high variability in total cu measurements fig 1b 3 3 impact of anode type on water chemistry and efficacy of antimicrobial cu 3 3 1 culturable l pneumophila was impacted by anode type the wh control condition afforded the opportunity to examine the effect of the anode type in absence of addition of cu or po4 while there was a trend towards a slight increase 0 5 log in l pneumophila after switching to the mg anode and corresponding decrease back to a level comparable to the al anode after switching to the powered anode these apparent differences were not statistically significant figs 2 a and si 2 in the wh cu condition where cu dosing was maintained at 2000 µg l as the anodes were changed l pneumophila levels increased to a level comparable to wh control after switching from an al to a mg anode this higher level of l pneumophila in the wh cu condition was maintained throughout the 4 months of operation with the mg anode the loss of cu antimicrobial properties during use of mg anodes was likely caused by the increase in ph to above 8 0 due to mg anode rod corrosion soluble cu decreased from 45 to 9 fig 2b table si 4 which is consistent with known effects of ph on cu solubility after switching to the powered anode l pneumophila decreased by 1 log in the wh cu condition and the median l pneumophila was 0 2 log lower than observed during the al 2000 phase kruskal wallis with post hoc dunn test p 0 06 this re emergence of cu antimicrobial properties corresponded with the ph decreasing to 6 4 and soluble cu increasing again to 50 after the mg anodes were replaced with powered anodes the median l pneumophila in wh cu po4 also trended upward after switching to a mg anode but was not significantly different from wh control the levels of l pneumophila dropped and remained similar to wh control after switching to the powered anode but the relative standard deviation was high 101 median l pneumophila measured in wh po4 was consistently similar to wh control while using mg or powered anodes mg anode biofilm samples collected from wh cu at the end of the mg 2000 phase contained more than 1 5 log less l pneumophila relative to mg anode biofilms collected from all other water heaters table si 9 pipe loop biofilm samples collected during phase mg 2000 similarly indicated that wh cu samples contained about 0 5 log less l pneumophila than wh control or wh po4 samples dosing both cu and po4 3 together however increased culturable l pneumophila in the wh cu po4 pipe loop biofilms by 0 5 log compared to the wh control system table si 9 3 3 2 cu deposition corrosion increased anode corrosion rate in addition to impacting the ph as discussed above the type of anode significantly impacted other aspects of the water chemistry with the al anode the effluent increased to 500 µg l al in wh control due to anode rod corrosion fig 2c al levels in wh po4 were comparable to wh control on average but more variable likely due to the precipitates formed with the addition of phosphate in contrast both conditions with cu dosing wh cu and wh cu po4 released much more al 2 4 than wh control during phase al 2000 presumably due to accelerated attack of the al surface from cu deposition corrosion fig 2c likewise when the mg anode was used the total mg in wh cu or wh cu po4 3 was higher 1 5 2 than those in wh control or wh po4 fig 2c the difference could again be attributed to cu deposition corrosion in the treated influent water al was consistently 25 µg l mg was 5829 1616 µg l and was 5808 µg l in 80 of measurements additional evidence of cu deposition corrosion was observed in the galvanic corrosion current measurements between the anode rods and steel tank the sacrificial current increased 10 for the al anode and 1 6 for mg anodes in wh cu compared to wh control table si 5 the higher current in the al system did not translate proportionally to higher al in the bulk water this is expected due to the nature of al corrosion which readily forms aluminum hydroxide that remains attached to the anode rod or will deposit as sediment to the bottom of the water heater tank in practice the increased corrosion rate would theoretically translate to at least a 90 decrease in useful lifespan for the al anode and a 38 decrease in lifespan for the mg anode only traces of evolved hydrogen gas were detectable while using al or powdered anodes table si 6 using a mg anode hydrogen levels were 87 ppm 1 6 10 5 mg l in bulk water sample in wh cu versus 1 11 ppm 2 10 6 mg l in water heater for all other conditions this demonstrates that addition of cu and presence of mg anodes acts synergistically to increase the concentration of hydrogen which is an important microbial electron donor it is noted that the measured hydrogen levels would also be decreased by hydrogen utilizing microbes in the water after switching from al to the mg and powered anodes it took time to flush out labile al from the system when the ph increased to 8 0 with the mg anodes aluminum solubility would be expected to increase from the prior ph 6 0 creating a driving force for dissolution of sediment associated al table si 4 this is consistent with the increased al measured in the systems dosed with orthophosphate wh po4 and wh cu po4 fig 4 3c al solubility subsequently decreased after switching to powered anodes and ph decreased to 7 0 table si 7 as predicted based on solubility levels of fe which could originate from corrosion of the steel tank or leaching from the ferric filters used to remove influent phosphate from the local water supply were comparable in the influent and in the effluent of each system across all anode types table si 6 this suggests but does not prove that all the anodes equally protected the water tank liners from corrosion 3 4 cu solubility predicts antimicrobial effect of cu for the wh cu and wh cu po4 systems the trends in l pneumophila with the different anode types versus wh control were consistent with expectations based on cu solubility as controlled by ph and phosphate the log reduction of l pneumophila relative to the wh control condition was strongly correlated with measured soluble cu fig 3 pearson test r2 0 85 as expected there was no correlation between soluble cu and log difference in l pneumophila for wh cu po4 and wh control likely due to the very low levels of soluble cu data not shown 3 5 exploring limitations to antimicrobial properties of cu 3 5 1 why were such high doses of cu required to reduce l pneumophila in the hot water systems the dose required to achieve measurable l pneumophila reduction in this study was unexpectedly high the maximum difference in l pneumophila culture numbers achieved by cu dosing to the wh cu system compared to wh control was only slightly greater than 1 log despite the very high target cu dose 2000 µg l in our prior bench scale studies using l pneumophila strain 130b in pure culture in inert glass vessels we observed 3 5 log removal after only 6 hours exposure to 800 µg l cu song et al 2021 fig 3 we evaluated two specific hypotheses that potentially explain the much lower than expected antimicrobial effect of cu in the pilot scale plumbing systems versus the earlier bench scale tests using the same tap water 1 water chemistry changes associated with anode rod corrosion may have reduced biocidal forms of cu and 2 the l pneumophila strain dominating the pilot scale systems in this study fundamentally differed in cu tolerance relative to strain 130b used in the bench scale study 3 5 2 al acts as a cu complexation ligand iron and al hydroxide particulates are known to form surface complexes with copper and remove it from solution karthikeyan et al 1997 mcbride 1985 the addition of al during follow up pure culture tests reduced cu toxicity towards l pneumophila when compared to tests without al addition fig 4 a addition of just 800 µg l cu led to a 3 log reduction in l pneumophila strain 130b in pure culture at ph 6 5 when 1000 µg l al as al2 so4 3 was added the cu antimicrobial effect was reduced by 0 6 log when al was increased to 3000 µg l the antimicrobial effects of cu were reduced by 1 9 log fig 4a at ph 7 the addition of 1000 µg l al reduced the antimicrobial effect of 800 μg l cu by 2 5 log all of these trends are consistent with expectations of al binding soluble cu with greater binding at higher ph fig 4b addition of 1 mg l al reduced soluble cu levels by more than 50 at ph 6 5 and more than 80 at ph 7 relative to a control without al fig 4b 3 5 3 different legionella strains respond differently to cu we confirmed that the outbreak associated strain of l pneumophila that colonized the pilot scale water heaters was more tolerant to cu than the lab strain 130b that was used in previous bench scale experiments song et al 2021 in a head to head comparison achieving the same 3 log reduction in l pneumophila required 720 mins exposure to 2000 µg l total cu ph 6 5 1600 µg l soluble cu for the outbreak associated strain but just 210 mins exposure to 800 µg l total cu ph 7 690 µg l soluble cu for strain 130b fig 4c applying the chick watson ct model the l pneumophila strain that colonized the water heaters was 7 more resistant to cu than strain 130b 3 5 4 phosphate precipitates cu and indicates synergistic legionella growth promotion effect to demonstrate how orthophosphate impacts cu antimicrobial capacity we normalized the differences in l pneumophila measured relative to wh control and plotted the data as a function of soluble cu and soluble phosphate fig 5 when soluble cu levels were 300 µg l l pneumophila was consistently lower than in wh control fig 5 when soluble cu levels were 300 µg l and soluble p levels were 300 µg l l pneumophila numbers were not different relative to the wh control however when soluble cu levels were 300 µg l and soluble phosphorus levels were 300 µg l l pneumophila increased relative to the control in four of twelve cases fig 5 three of these four cases were in wh cu po4 while the fourth was in wh po4 lower levels of culturable l pneumophila were observed in anode and recirculation pipe loop biofilms collected from the wh cu system compared to wh control l pneumophila levels were maintained on the anode biofilm but increased in the recirculation pipe loop biofilm in wh cu po4 samples compared to wh control table si 9 the monitoring of general microbial parameters hpc 16s rrna gene total cell count tcc also indicated mixed effects of dosed cu the greatest hpc reduction observed 1 log in the wh cu condition was during the use of the powered anode and dosing of 2000 µg l cu fig si 4 both 16s rrna gene copies and tcc levels increased 0 5 log during use of the al and mg anodes and dosing of 2000 µg l cu when both cu and orthophosphate were dosed there were higher levels of hpc 16s rrna gene copies and tcc levels in phase mg 2000 fig si 4 4 discussion this study provides fundamental insight into how water system design and other factors can act to undermine the efficacy of antimicrobial copper against l pneumophila the pilot scale nature of this study was particularly valuable for assessing the outcomes of interactive effects such as copper dose anode type and orthophosphate addition under conditions representative of real world hot water systems the findings can help to inform improved design of water heater systems and remedial strategies for l pneumophila control 4 1 much lower than expected antimicrobial effects even at very high cu doses the inability of very high levels of cu 1 2 mg l at low ph 7 and low level of orthophosphate 0 2 mg l to eradicate l pneumophila even after months of exposure was striking and unexpected based on our prior bench scale pure culture study song et al 2021 it was expected that a threshold dose of 0 8 mg l in the wh cu system would have begun to have an effect important differences between the experiments in this study compared to our prior bench scale study include 1 the bench scale was carried out in inert glass bottles while this study incorporated various real world complexities associated with pilot scale 2 the bench scale study was carried out in pure culture while the present study was carried out under the more realistic conditions of mixed microbial communities and 3 in the bench scale study l pneumophila were grown to stationary phase in buffer yeast extract medium washed and then immediately placed in the drinking water medium containing the dosed copper while the current experiments were performed using gradually increasing cu levels over 8 months which could have allowed the strains to acclimate to both the drinking water conditions and the copper addition there are many possible mechanisms for the reduced cu antimicrobial efficacy first it was previously shown that factors such as high ph orthophosphate and natural organic matter can reduce antimicrobial effects of cu towards legionella song et al 2021 lin et al 1996 lin et al 2002 but we identified additional factors through this realistic study of a pilot scale system specifically al ions that formed hydroxide gels could have trapped bioavailable cu fig 4 while mg anode corrosion was shown to dramatically increase the ph within the water heater system fig 2 but even using powered anodes which did not release al or raise ph very high levels of cu only achieved 1 2 log reduction of l pneumophila compared to a control without cu dosing fig 2 it was apparent that even cu doses exceeding the 1 mg l epa secondary maximum contaminant level in potable water which may have adverse health aesthetic implications did not completely limit l pneumophila causing us to consider other factors that must have played a role in the observed reduction in antimicrobial capacity of added cu 4 2 strain differences influenced efficacy of cu for l pneumophila control here it was found that the outbreak associated strain inoculated to the water heater systems had a first order inactivation constant 7 lower compared to strain 130b that was used in the pure culture bench scale tests song et al 2021 fig 4 bedard et al 2021 recently demonstrated that l pneumophila isolates vary in their tolerance to cu noting 2 log reduction in culturability after exposure to 5 mg l cu for 600 hrs however the bedard et al test ph was 7 8 which would be expected to reduce cu biocidal effects compared to the lower ph range evaluated herein in the present study only 1 log reduction was achieved after 4 months 2000 hrs exposure 4 3 differences in pure culture vs pilot hot water system experimental conditions influence outcomes of cu dosing besides strain differences it is also important to consider that the pilot scale hot water systems were allowed to establish a robust microbial ecosystem of acclimated biofilm and bulk water microorganisms in fact given that it can take multiple years for a drinking water system to establish mature biofilm buse et al 2019 henne et al 2012 boe hansen et al 2002 this study was unique in that the systems were allowed to acclimate for two years before commencing this study making it much more realistic compared to other controlled lab studies this allowed biofilms to mature which are known to provide a niche for the proliferation of free living amoebae that serve as hosts for l pneumophila replication falkinham 2015 the biofilm itself can also provide shelter to l pneumophila falkinham 2015 schwering et al 2013 thus it is reasonable to hypothesize that the mature biofilm and corresponding amoebae also acted to protect l pneumophila from the antimicrobial action of dosed cu for amoeba in culture hwang et al 2006 demonstrated in bench scale pure culture suspensions that planktonic l pneumophila was inactivated completely 7 2 log reduction within 8 hours after exposure to 1 mg l of cu while the intracellular l pneumophila inside of acanthamoeba polyphaga achieved only 3 log reduction even after 7 days of cu exposure extrapolating their results using same disinfection constant a 7 2 log reduction for the intracellular l pneumophila would be expected to be observed in 16 days the apparent resistance of l pneumophila in the present study far exceeded this estimate thomas et al 2004 showed in one pilot scale system at ph 7 6 that 0 8 mg l of cu had no impact on amoeba acanthamoeba hartmannella and vahlkampfia levels in either planktonic and biofilm samples but the l pneumophila released to the water was still reduced 3 logs below detection limit after 6 days exposure to cu in that study again the apparent tolerance of l pneumophila reported in this study was much higher 4 4 interactive effects of water chemistry water heater system design and drinking water microbiology govern antimicrobial capacity of cu here we reported divergent effects of cu on legionella under realistic conditions simulated by the pilot scale water heater systems as copper sometimes reduced had no impact on or even promoted the growth of legionella relative to the control system with low ambient copper to our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate all three potential outcomes of cu dosing in a head to head multi factorial comparison three out of four cases where cu dosing was associated with increases in l pneumophila relative to the control were observed in the wh cu po4 system this is consistent with observations of buse et al 2014 who showed that effluent from cdc biofilm reactors equipped with coupons of different pipe materials at ph 8 and po4 0 2 mg l contained up to 20 more l pneumophila gene copies when cu coupons were used relative to pvc coupons in a study of simulated cold water pipes at room temperature gião et al 2015 also demonstrated that cu coupons could support more biofilm associated l pneumophila where the levels of phosphate in the test water was not reported it is important to note that the control with extra 3 mg l phosphate alone did not significantly increase l pneumophila compared to the situation with lower phosphate in the control for seven out of eight test phases hence in this case the higher l pneumophila in the wh cu po4 system cannot be attributed to the additional phosphate nutrients as was hypothesized by atkinson et al 2022 and jereb et al 2022 levels of phosphate limitation for l pneumophila have not been identified but they are often 10 µg l for other potable water microbes zhang et al 2008 droogenbroeck laudelout 1967 one study showed that dosing cu shifted the microbial community structure to favor the growth of amoeba hosts buse et al 2014 hypothetically this contributed to the increase of l pneumophila levels through enhanced amoeba protection and intracellular replication another possible cause of cu promoting growth in pilot or full scale systems could be cu deposition corrosion on less noble metals such as al and mg anodes which would promote hydrogen evolution and autotrophic fixation of carbon potentially indirectly promoting the growth of legionella rhoads et al 2017 our study showed that higher levels of hpc tcc and 16s rrna gene levels in hot water systems dosed with cu corresponded with increased hydrogen evolution when mg anodes were used although an increase of l pneumophila was not observed in this case these factors are still not fully understood and more research is needed to better understand the association of l pneumophila growth to the levels of hydrogen gas phosphate levels and amoeba hosts while cu dosing could not eradicate l pneumophila from these hot water systems reduction was still achieved in a manner that demonstrated how anode type and corrosion control agents can act to undermine the capacity of cu to control l pneumophila importantly we confirmed our prior bench scale work that soluble cu is a more accurate indicator for cu antimicrobial effects under the more complex real world conditions associated with the pilot scale systems trends in soluble cu were consistent with reduced antimicrobial impacts in response to phosphate higher ph and al thus if the intention is to rely on cu inactivation for controlling legionella then soluble cu should be monitored in this study 300 µg l soluble cu was consistently associated with significant reduction in l pneumophila relative to a control with no cu dose still it may be challenging to implement cu as an effective biocide while still maintaining total copper below 1 3 2 mg l although such public health standards do not apply to hot water in the us 5 conclusions soluble cu is an effective indicator of cu antimicrobial capacity even in more complex environments represented by realistic hot water plumbing systems in particular dosing of orthophosphate which is widely added by drinking water utilities to control corrosion directly reduces soluble copper and overall antimicrobial capacity in some cases cu added together with orthophosphate to apparently promote the growth of legionella provided an example of at least one circumstance where cu addition can induce interactive effects that elevate legionella compared to a control system with trace cu in this study it was demonstrated for the first time that different water heater sacrificial anode types are subject to different corrosion processes which indirectly influence cu antimicrobial capacity specifically aluminum ions released from aluminum anode corrosion at 1 mg l can form an al oh 3 gel which can remove 80 of the soluble cu from water and reduce cu antimicrobial effects by 2 log at ph 7 corrosion from mg anodes was found to dramatically increase the ph from 6 8 to 8 which correspondingly reduced cu antimicrobial capacity cu deposition further increased the anode corrosion rate and promoted evolution of hydrogen gas which is a potent electron donor that stimulates autotrophic microbial growth especially with a mg anode electric powered anodes did not release metals or alter ph and thus did not diminish cu antimicrobial capacity still across the pilot scale experiments even very high levels of cu 1 2 mg l at low ph 7 failed to fully eradicate culturable legionella the much lower than expected antimicrobial efficacy of cu in the pilot scale hot water plumbing systems was found to be partially explained by the properties of the strain that colonized the systems based on fitting the data to a chick watson disinfection model the outbreak associated strain that was inoculated into the systems was estimated to be 7 times more tolerant to cu compared to the common lab strain applied in the bench scale tests it is important to also recognize that in the pilot scale systems drinking water biofilms and the amoeba hosts that colonize them can further shield legionella

14628,the immobilization of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas by colloidal activated carbon cac barriers has been proposed as a potential in situ method to mitigate the transport of plumes of pfas in the subsurface however if pfas are continuously released from a source zone the adsorptive sites on cac will eventually become saturated upon which point the breakthrough of pfas in the barrier will occur to predict the long term effectiveness of cac barriers it is important to evaluate the factors that may affect the adsorption of pfas on cac in this study the adsorption of 7 pfas on a polymer stabilized cac i e plumestop and on a polymer free cac was investigated using batch experiments the adsorption affinity of pfas to cac was in the following order pfos 6 2 fts pfhxs pfoa pfbs pfpea pfba this result indicates that hydrophobic interaction was the predominant adsorption mechanism and that hydrophilic compounds such as pfba and pfpea will break through cac barriers first the partition coefficient kd for the adsorption of pfas on the polymer stabilized cac was 1 3 3 5 times smaller than the kd for the adsorption of pfas on the polymer free cac suggesting that the polymers decreased the adsorption presumably due to competitive sorption thus the pfas adsorption capacity of plumestop cac barriers is expected to increase once the polymers are biodegraded and or washed away the affinity of pfos and pfoa to cac increased when the ionic strength of the solution increased from 1 to 100 mm or when the concentration of ca2 increased from 0 to 2 mm in contrast less pfos and pfoa were adsorbed in the presence of 1 20 mgc l suwannee river fulvic acid which represented dissolved organic carbon or in the presence of 10 100 mg l diethylene glycol butyl ether dgbe which is an important component in some aqueous film forming foam afff formulations the presence of 0 5 4 8 mg l benzene or 0 5 8 mg l trichloroethylene the co contaminants that may comingle with pfas at afff impacted sites diminished pfos adsorption but had no effect or even slightly enhanced pfoa adsorption when the initial concentration of tce was 8 mg l the kd 514 240 l g for the adsorption of pfos was approximately 20 times lower than that in the tce free system k d 9 579 829 l g the results of this study provided insights into some key factors that may affect the adsorption of pfas in in situ cac barriers keywords per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas adsorption activated carbon in situ remediation 1 introduction owing to their extremely high thermal and chemical stability as well as oil repellency per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas have been used in a wide variety of commercial and industrial products including aqueous film forming foams afff adhesives cosmetics cleaning products as well as coatings for fabrics paper and furniture buck et al 2011 glüge et al 2020 among these applications of pfas the use of afff to extinguish fires at military sites airports petroleum refineries and firefighter training facilities has created sites contaminated with pfas salvatore et al 2022 a recent study identified 3 493 military sites and 519 airports in the us as presumptive pfas contamination locations salvatore et al 2022 in canada of the 2 071 airports surveyed 152 airports were identified as likely being contaminated with pfas milley et al 2018 many of these sites are located near residential areas and pose direct threats to the drinking water resources of nearby residents hu et al 2016 because exposure to pfas has been linked to various health issues dickman and aga 2022 sunderland et al 2019 sims et al 2022 guidelines for pfas are beginning to emerge recently the us environmental protection agency epa has issued interim updated drinking water lifetime health advisory lha levels of 0 004 ng l for perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and 0 020 ng l for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and final lha levels of 2 000 ng l for perfluorobutane sulfonic acid pfbs and 10 ng l for hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid genx u s environmental protection agency 2023 considering that humans and ecosystems can be exposed to pfas in groundwater and that future regulations may enforce remediation of pfas contaminated sites there is an urgent need to develop technologies that can effectively remove pfas from groundwater at afff impacted sites contaminated groundwater can be remediated ex situ or in situ ex situ remediation also known as pump and treat involves extracting groundwater to the surface and treating it followed by discharging the treated water to a publicly owned treatment system contrary to ex situ remediation in situ remediation involves injecting chemical and or biological amendments into the subsurface to initiate reactions that can destroy contaminants in place compared to ex situ remediation in situ remediation is less energy intensive and potentially has a shorter operational timeframe and smaller carbon footprint as such in situ remediation is a preferable method whenever possible suthersan and payne 2005 to date however pfas contaminated groundwater has been primarily treated by ex situ approaches this is because pfas are extremely resistant to chemical and biological degradation and therefore cannot be destroyed in situ under conditions typical of the subsurface ross et al 2018 recently several studies have proposed that pfas in groundwater can be immobilized in situ by stationary adsorption barriers which can be created by injecting particulate or chemical amendments into the subsurface for example aly et al demonstrated that the breakthrough of pfoa and pfos in a one dimensional soil column was delayed by 8 20 pore volumes pv when the soil column was amended with the cationic polymers polyamine pa and polydiallyldimethyl ammonium chloride polydadmac aly et al 2019 subsequent to this study the same research group demonstrated that by injecting a mixture of powdered activated carbon pac and polydadmac into an ottawa sand column the breakthrough of pfos and pfoa in the column was delayed by three orders of magnitude equivalent to 4 000 6 000 pvs liu et al 2020 they also demonstrated that injecting amberlite ira910 ion exchange ix resins stabilized by pluronic f 127 polymer into an ottawa sand column resulted in a uniform adsorption zone that delayed the breakthrough of pfos and pfoa by more than five orders of magnitude equivalent to 5 900 9 240 pvs liu et al 2022 in parallel with bench scale studies there have been efforts to demonstrate the in situ immobilization of pfas in the field mcgregor 2018 carey et al 2019 mcgregor 2020 niarchos et al 2023 mcgregor and benevenuto 2021 mcgregor and zhao 2021 in what appears to have been the first field study on the in situ immobilization of pfas mcgregor demonstrated that an adsorption barrier created by injecting plumestop a colloidal activated carbon cac suspension trademarked by regenesis san clemente ca us into the subsurface successfully contained pfos and pfoa at a contaminated site located in a shallow silty sand aquifer in central canada mcgregor 2018 at this location following the injection of cac into the source zone the concentration of pfos 3 260 ng l and pfoa 1 450 ng l decreased to below detectable levels 20 ng l mcgregor 2018 carey et al 2019 in a separate study mcgregor conducted pilot scale tests to evaluate the in situ immobilization of pfas by plumestop cac calgon wpc powdered activated carbon pac purolite purofine pfa694e ix resin and biochar mcgregor 2020 in each test cell the concentration of all pfas dropped from 140 24 000 ng l to below detectable levels 10 ng l following adsorbent injection plumestop cac was also used in the study by niarchos et al to immobilize pfas in the groundwater at a historical firefighting training area in sweden niarchos et al 2023 following cac injection at this site the total concentration of 11 pfas in the monitoring well downgradient of the cac barrier decreased by as much as 76 niarchos et al 2023 although the bench scale and field scale studies mentioned above indicate that in situ adsorption barriers could potentially be an effective means of containing plumes of pfas it is important to recognize that as with any sorption based technology the breakthrough of pfas will take place once the adsorptive sites in a barrier are exhausted if pfas is continuously released from a source zone upstream in the pilot scale tests conducted by mcgregor mcgregor 2020 it was observed that the concentrations of all pfas in the cell injected with cac have been below detectable levels after over a year mcgregor 2020 however partial or full concentration rebounds were observed in the cells where biochar purofine pfa694e and pac were injected mcgregor 2020 at the site in central canada the concentrations of pfos and pfoa have remained undetected after over six years in all monitoring wells downgradient of the cac barrier personal communication with rick mcgregor while more field studies and longer term pfas monitoring will be required to further evaluate the longevity of in situ adsorption barriers it is reasonable to expect that the retention and breakthrough of pfas in a barrier will be dependent upon several factors including the mass flux of pfas entering the barrier the mass of adsorbent injected and its distribution in the barrier the competition for adsorptive sites among pfas as well as between pfas and co contaminants and the groundwater water chemistry in the pilot scale studies conducted by mcgregor the breakthrough of the shorter chain pfas in the barriers created by biochar purofine pfa694e ix and pac could be due to the low adsorption capacity in some areas within these barriers since the adsorbents were found to preferentially accumulate along a coarse grained sand seam mcgregor 2020 contrary to these adsorbents plumestop which consists of ac colloids stabilized with polymers was distributed uniformly in both the coarse grained sand seam and the fine grained sand area mcgregor 2020 mcgregor 2020 mcgregor also speculated that the breakthrough of the shorter chain pfas could be due to competitive adsorption mcgregor 2020 this hypothesis is consistent with the studies showing that compounds with longer carbon chains e g pfos and pfoa are better removed by ac and ix than those with shorter carbon chains e g pfbs perfluorobutanoic acid pfba and perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea and that longer chain compounds can desorb the shorter chain ones liu et al 2022 niarchos et al 2022 chow et al 2022 park et al 2020 competitive adsorption also could occur between pfas and organic co contaminants such as petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents which could be released during firefighting training activities and nonfluorinated surfactants and solvents which are present alongside pfas in afff formulations moody and field 1999 place and field 2012 guelfo and higgins 2013 to date there have been limited studies on the impact of co contaminants on pfas adsorption guelfo and higgins 2013 siriwardena et al 2019 ji et al 2021 pan et al 2009 zhang et al 2022 guelfo and higgins observed that the nonfluorinated surfactants sodium decyl sulfate sds and n n dimethyldodecylamine n oxide ao either increased had no effect or decreased pfas sorption on soils guelfo and higgins 2013 they also observed that the trichloroethylene tce non aqueous phase liquid napl had a complex influence on pfas sorption on the one hand tce could decrease pfas sorption by competing for the same adsorptive sites on the other hand the napl phase on the soil surface could absorb pfas thereby enhancing pfas partitioning to soil guelfo and higgins 2013 in another study siriwarderna et al observed that the presence of kerosene ethanol and dissolved tce did not appreciably affect the adsorption of pfos but slightly enhanced the adsorption of pfoa on a coal based and a coconut based granular activated carbon gac siriwardena et al 2019 these past studies suggest that it is difficult to predict how co contaminants would affect pfas adsorption since their effects are dependent upon a range of factors including the co contaminant concentration e g non napl versus napl the latter of which could absorb pfas at high concentration surfactants can form semi micelle or micelle thereby enhancing pfas solubility and decreasing their affinity to surfaces adsorbent properties e g surface charge organic carbon content and pfas type e g short chain versus long chain compounds perfluoro carboxylates versus perfluoro sulfonates because the concentration of organic co contaminants at afff impacted sites could be up to a few orders of magnitude greater than those of pfas carey et al 2023 their influence on the retention and breakthrough of pfas in adsorption barriers is likely significant thus additional research is needed to gain insights into how co contaminants may affect the adsorption of pfas on amendments used to create in situ adsorption barriers such insights are important for the design and implementation of the barriers the objective of this study was to investigate the adsorption of pfas on plumestop cac focusing specifically on assessing how adsorption was influenced by the stabilizing polymers co contaminants and solution chemistry to this end a series of batch adsorption experiments were conducted to investigate the adsorption of pfas on two types of cac namely a stabilizer free and a stabilizer containing cac suspension seven pfas were studied including pfba pfpea pfoa pfbs perfluorohexane sulfonic acid pfhxs pfos and 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid 6 2 fts these compounds were chosen because they are currently driving pfas regulations pfos and pfoa are pervasive at afff impacted sites all seven compounds or are highly mobile pfba pfpea pfbs and thus are likely among the first to break through cac barriers carey et al 2023 further the adsorption of pfos and pfoa was investigated in the presence of five co contaminants including benzene tce 1 4 dioxane ethanol and diethylene glycol butyl ether dgbe also known as butyl carbitol benzene tce and 1 4 dioxane could be present at sites where they were used as fuels during firefighting training activities whereas dgbe and other alcohols are important components in some afff formulations kao and prosser 1999 bugna et al 2005 titaley et al 2022 mcguire et al 2014 additionally the effects of three key solution chemistry parameters namely ionic strength ca2 and dissolved organic carbon on the adsorption of pfos and pfoa were investigated 2 materials and method 2 1 chemicals single pfas were purchased from either sigma aldrich pfba pfpea pfoa pfbs pfhxs pfos or toronto research chemicals 6 2 fts while analytical native and isotopically labeled pfas standards were purchased from wellington laboratories guelph canada see table s1 in the supporting information si for the list of native and isotopically labeled pfas suwannee river fulvic acid srfa was purchased from the international humic substances society usa benzene tce 1 4 dioxane dgbe and ethanol were purchased from sigma aldrich all other chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich or fisher scientific methanolic stock solutions of single compound pfas 350 1 100 mg l were prepared by dissolving each compound in lcms grade methanol stock solutions of benzene 479 mg l tce 436 mg l 1 4 dioxane 2 700 mg l and ethanol 1 400 mg l were prepared using 18 2 mω cm milliq water millipore 2 2 adsorbents two cac materials were used in this study both of which were provided by regenesis san clemente california usa the first material was plumestop cac which will be denoted from this point forward as the polymer containing cac this material was a slurry consisting of cac water and organic polymers the organic polymers served as the stabilizing agent which aimed to minimize particle aggregation and enhance cac mobility in in situ applications for this study regenesis also provided a material that only consisted of cac and water denoted as the polymer free cac the adsorption of pfas on these two materials was compared to assess how the presence of the polymers affected the adsorption of pfas by cac while regenesis indicated that the size of the cac particles ranged between 1 and 2 μm it was noticed in our preliminary experiments that when cac containing samples were filtered using a 0 2 μm filter and subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms the backpressure in the lc system increased over time this observation suggests that some cac particles must have passed through the 0 2 μm filter and clogged the analytical column sorengard et al also noticed that some plumestop cac passed through a 0 45 μm filter sorengard et al 2019 their dynamic light scattering analyses revealed that the size of plumestop cac ranged between 0 1 and 1 1 μm with an average particle size being 0 6 μm sorengard et al 2019 the point of zero charge phpzc of the two cac materials was determined using a method described by saeidi et al saeidi et al 2020 2 3 adsorption experiments six point adsorption isotherms for pfas were generated using the bottle point approach the initial concentration of the adsorbate was kept constant while the adsorbent dose was varied in brief experiments were conducted in either polypropylene pp conical centrifuge tubes or glass tubes when benzene or tce was present in the reaction solution that contained 50 73 ml of an aqueous solution of 1 mm nahco3 which served as the background electrolyte and a ph buffer ph 7 5 8 5 a 50 73 μl aliquot of a methanolic single pfas stock was added to each test tube resulting in test tubes that contained the same amount of methanol 0 1 v v and a similar initial pfas concentration that is each reaction solution consisted of only one of the following compounds pfba 0 2 12 μm pfpea 0 1 18 μm pfoa 0 1 28 μm pfbs 0 1 17 μm pfphxs 0 1 40 μm pfos 0 1 30 μm or 6 2 fts 0 2 57 μm these molar concentration values are equivalent to mass concentration values ranging from 350 μg l pfba to 1 100 μg l 6 2 fts because the concentration of pfas in the groundwater at afff impacted sites usually ranges from less than μg l to a few hundred μg l carey et al 2023 the initial pfas concentrations employed in this study represented some of the most contaminated scenarios the initial concentrations were chosen to be high enough such that the amount of pfas remaining in the solution after adsorption i e cw could be measured also cw was targeted to span over an order magnitude so that pfas adsorption could be compared at different cw additionally the initial molar concentrations were aimed to be within a factor of 2 5 of each other to enable the comparison based on a molar basis of the adsorption trend among pfas carey et al reviewed 17 pfas contaminated sites in the us uk and canada carey et al 2023 at these sites the total concentration of btex benzene toluene ethyl benzene xylene ranged from non detect to approximately 6 mg l while the total concentration of tce and other chlorinated solvents was as high as approximately 1 mg l to examine how btex and chlorinated solvents might affect pfos and pfoa adsorption by cac in some experiments the reaction solution contained 0 5 or 4 8 mg l benzene i e 6 4 or 61 6 μm or 0 5 or 8 5 mg l tce i e 3 8 61 6 μm because 1 4 dioxane is usually present at sites contaminated with chlorinated solvents it could be present at pfas contaminated sites as well however little is known about 1 4 dioxane concentration levels in plumes of pfas in this study the effect of 5 4 54 mg l 1 4 dioxane i e 61 6 616 μm on the adsorption of pfos and pfoa by cac was investigated also dgbe and ethanol could be present at afff impacted sites because these two compounds are part of some afff formulations as in the case of 1 4 dioxane the concentration level of dgbe and ethanol in pfas contaminated groundwater is not known herein the concentration of dgbe and ethanol was set to range between 10 100 mg l i e 61 6 616 μm and 2 8 28 mg l i e 61 6 616 μm respectively lastly the effect of 1 20 mgc l srfa on the adsorption of pfos and pfoa was also investigated all organic compounds described above were added to the reaction solution from their respective aqueous stock solutions except for dgbe which was added from the pure 99 dgbe stock to investigate the effect of ionic strength and ca2 on the adsorption of pfos and pfoa 1 100 mm nacl and 0 1 2 mm cacl2 were added to the solution because varying the amount of cacl2 added to the solution also changed the ionic strength the effect of ca2 could be confounded by the effect of ionic strength if the latter is not controlled as such in the experiments investigating the effect of ca2 between 0 and 5 7 mm of nacl was added so that the ionic strength was 7 mm in all experiments adsorption of pfas was initiated by adding different volumes of cac slurry into the test tubes to obtain a cac concentration ranging from 0 11 to 0 7 g l subsequently the test tubes were placed on an orbital shaker after 72 hours an aliquot was withdrawn from each test tube transferred into an ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 230 000 g for 105 min to separate cac from the solution to minimize the loss of pfas to the ultracentrifuge tube wall the tubes were first rinsed with two aliquots of the test solution to saturate the tube wall with pfas before the final aliquot was transferred into the tube and centrifuged following cac separation 250 µl of the supernatant was taken out and subjected to pfas analysis a separate set of experiments was conducted to investigate the kinetics of pfas adsorption on cac in this set of experiments test tubes were taken off of the orbital shaker at t 6 h 24 h 48 h 72 h 120 h and 168 h and the reaction solutions were subjected to centrifugation to separate cac to investigate the affinity of pfas to pp and glass test tubes some reaction solutions did not contain cac i e control experiments all experiments were conducted in duplicate at 22 c and the average pfas concentrations along with their range are presented 2 4 analysis benzene dgbe and tce were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with either flame ionization detection benzene dgbe or electron capture detection tce for the analysis of pfas samples were diluted with methanol and isotopically labeled pfas stock to obtain a final sample composition of 50 50 v v water methanol samples were analyzed on a shimadzu 8030 lc ms ms and the concentrations of pfas were calculated using the isotopic dilution method see si for the details on the instrument conditions and other information related to pfas analysis 2 5 pfas isotherm modeling adsorption isotherm results were fitted using either the linear isotherm model c s k d c w or the freundlich isotherm model c s k f c w n in these equations kd is the linear partition coefficient kf is the freundlich constant mg g mg l n and a measure of the adsorption capacity when cw 1 mg l n is the exponential term indicative of the surface heterogeneity when n 1 the freundlich model becomes the linear model and cs mg g and cw mg l are the equilibrium concentrations of the contaminant in the solid and aqueous phases respectively cw values were obtained from lc ms ms analysis while cs values were calculated based on pfas mass balance c s c 0 c w c c a c with c0 mg l being the initial pfas concentration and ccac being the cac concentration g l it is noted that the langmuir isotherm model was not considered since under the experimental conditions employed in this study the resulting isotherms did not consist of a flat region i e the region where cs remains constant as cw increases required for proper fitting to the langmuir model 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption kinetics less than 10 of the initial pfas was lost from the solution in the absence of the polymer free cac or the polymer containing cac after 168 hours data not shown the results of these control experiments suggest that the loss of pfas in the presence of cac fig s1 was primarily due to adsorption to cac for the shorter chain compounds pfbs and pfba the adsorption equilibrium was established after approximately 24 hours for the longer chain compounds pfos and pfoa their concentration in the solution quickly decreased during the first 24 hours and then gradually decreased further over the subsequent 144 hours considering that over 99 of the initial mass of pfas was adsorbed during the first 48 hours the adsorption of each pfas in the subsequent experiments was evaluated based on a contact time of t 72 hours between the reaction solution and cac 3 2 adsorption trend there is a general consensus that pfas adsorption on ac is mainly driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions du et al 2014 the phpzc of both the polymer containing and polymer free cac was determined to be 11 8 suggesting that the cac surface would have been positively charged under the ph condition i e 7 5 8 5 employed in the adsorption experiments conducted in this study thus the adsorption of pfas on cac must have been partially driven by the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged cac surface and the negatively charged sulfonate and carboxylate functional groups of pfas however it is argued that this electrostatic attraction was not the dominant mechanism in our system as otherwise shorter chain pfas would have been adsorbed to a greater extent than longer chain pfas parker et al 2022 instead the affinity of pfas to the polymer containing cac was in the following order pfos 6 2 fts pfhxs pfoa pfbs pfpea pfba fig 1 this trend suggests that hydrophobic interaction was generally the predominant adsorption mechanism the two longest chain length compounds pfos and 6 2 fts which consist of 8 carbons are the most hydrophobic among the 7 studied pfas and therefore were adsorbed by the polymer containing cac to the greatest extent between pfos and 6 2 fts the former compound exhibited a higher adsorption affinity which could be attributable to the two fully fluorinated carbons i e cf2 cf2 being more hydrophobic than the hydrogenated counterparts i e ch2 ch2 krafft and riess 2015 similarly pfpea having one cf2 longer than pfba was adsorbed by the polymer containing cac to a greater extent whereas pfbs was adsorbed more than pfpea because the so3 headgroup is more hydrophobic than the coo headgroup parker et al 2022 for pfhxs and pfoa their log kow values which is an indicator of hydrophobicity vary widely in the literature log kow 4 30 5 30 for pfoa park et al 2020 arp et al 2006 wang et al 2011 jing et al 2009 and 3 16 5 17 for pfhxs jing et al 2009 gagliano et al 2020 based on their relative retention times 4 9 min for pfhxs and 5 4 min for pfoa on the c18 column in the lc ms ms analysis pfoa might be more hydrophobic than pfhxs xiao et al 2017 however more pfhxs was adsorbed by cac than pfoa fig 1 a trend that contradicts the hydrophobicity of these compounds parker et al demonstrated that the electrostatic attraction to aminopropyl beads was stronger for pfoa than for pfhxs parker et al 2022 thus the fact that more pfhxs was adsorbed by cac than pfoa cannot be explained by electrostatic attraction either while the mechanisms of pfhxs and pfoa adsorption on cac are not entirely clear at this point our results are similar to that of xiao et al who reported that when the adsorbent was gac calgon filtersorb300 the 30 day log kd l kg value of pfhxs 5 09 0 01 was greater than that of pfoa 4 97 0 04 xiao et al 2017 the trend of pfas adsorption on the polymer free cac was generally similar to that on the polymer containing cac except for 6 2 fts fig 1 this compound exhibited a greater adsorption affinity than pfhxs at cw values greater than 3 10 3 mg l but its adsorption affinity was lower when cw 3 10 3 mg l in fig 1 right panel the adsorption isotherm of 6 2 fts crosses that of pfhxs at around cw 3 10 3 mg l when the isotherms describing the adsorption of each compound on the polymer containing cac and on the polymer free cac were compared fig s2 it was revealed that pfba and 6 2 fts exhibited a similar adsorption affinity to these two adsorbents under the studied cw range in contrast pfbs pfhxs pfos pfpea and pfoa exhibited a greater adsorption affinity to the polymer free cac it is speculated that the diminished adsorption in the presence of the polymers might be due to competitive sorption this hypothesis is similar to that of georgi et al who attributed the diminished adsorption of monochlorobenzene mcb on ac colloids stabilized with dodecylbenzene sulfonate sdbs to the competition between mcb and sdbs georgi et al 2015 georgi et al also speculated that the stabilizer would desorb from the ac surface once the cac suspension is diluted by the groundwater georgi et al 2015 the desorption and or degradation of the stabilizing polymers following cac barrier installation would free up adsorptive sites on cac thereby increasing the adsorption of pfas additional research is needed to assess the desorption degradation rate of the polymers used in the polymer containing cac the isotherms of pfbs pfhxs and pfoa seem to be better fitted by the freundlich model r2 0 97 0 99 than by the linear model r2 0 91 0 95 whereas the isotherms of pfpea could be described by either model r2 0 97 or 0 98 table 1 for pfos and 6 2 fts while the r2 values of the freundlich fittings are similar or slightly greater than those of the linear fittings there is high uncertainty associated with the kf values as such it appeared that the pfos and 6 2 fts isotherms could be better described by the linear model note that a major assumption of the freundlich model is that there is a distribution of surface sites with different adsorption affinity and that adsorbates will first occupy high affinity sites i e the strong sites followed by adsorption on low affinity sites since the cs values in this study spanned over less than one order of magnitude fig 1 pfas may have been adsorbed to only the strong sites on the cac surface as such whether the adsorption of pfas on cac obeys the linear or the freundlich model may not be entirely discerned based on the experimental data especially if experimental errors are factored in it is also noted that the isotherm model used to describe pfas adsorption could have implications for the prediction of barrier longevity specifically a parameter that is often employed to describe the transport of contaminants in the subsurface is the retardation coefficient r which can be calculated by the following equations 1 r 1 ρ b θ k d 2 r 1 ρ b θ k f n c w n 1 with ρb being the soil dry bulk density g cm3 θ being the effective porosity cm3 cm3 kd being the linear partition coefficient and kf and n being the freundlich isotherm parameters eq 1 is applicable to contaminants whose adsorption can be described by the linear isotherm model whereas eq 2 is used when the adsorption obeys the freundlich isotherm model assuming a ρb value of 1 65 g cm3 a θ value of 0 35 cm3 cm3 and a cw value of 0 01 mg l the retardation values would be r 1 25 107 based on eq 1 and r 5 94 106 based on eq 2 when using the kd kf and n parameters for pfos on the polymer containing cac table 1 while the two r values differ by less than an order of magnitude it should be noted that r is independent of cw in eq 1 also r is linearly proportional to kd and kf but is exponentially dependent on n as a result r is more sensitive to changes to n i e changes in surface heterogeneity than to kd or kf 3 3 the effect of organics 3 3 1 ethanol and 1 4 dioxane the adsorption isotherms of pfos and pfoa in the presence of varying concentrations of ethanol and 1 4 dioxane are presented in fig 2 and the associated isotherm parameters are presented in table 2 as described above the adsorption of pfos on the polymer free cac could be better described by the linear model kd 9 579 829 l g in the presence of either ethanol or 1 4 dioxane the pfos isotherms also seem to be better fitted to the linear model because of the high uncertainty associated with the kf values table 2 the kd value increased from 7 545 921 l g and 7 698 505 l g in the presence of 61 6 μm of ethanol and 1 4 dioxane respectively to 11 179 835 l g and 10 207 1 427 l g in the presence of 616 μm ethanol and 1 4 dioxane respectively however considering the uncertainty associated with these kd values as well as a lack of a clear trend between these values and the concentration of the co contaminants it could be concluded that 1 4 dioxane and ethanol did not have an appreciable effect on pfos adsorption under the experimental conditions employed in this study similarly there appeared to be no appreciable effect of these two co contaminants on the adsorption of pfoa except for when the concentration of 1 4 dioxane was 308 μm under which condition the kf and n values were slightly higher table 2 siriwardena et al also observed that 1 mg l ethanol i e 22 μm did not appreciably affect the adsorption of pfos on a bituminous coal based filtrasorb f400 calgon and a coconut based cbc olc calgon gac siriwardena et al 2019 on the contrary they reported that the presence of ethanol enhanced the adsorption of pfoa on both adsorbents however this conclusion was based on a single point isotherm experiment whether a similar effect of ethanol would be observed at a range of cw and cs is unclear it should be noted that the effect of 1 4 dioxane and ethanol on the adsorption of pfos and pfoa in our study could have been masked by the effect of methanol whose concentration in the reaction solution 0 1 v v or 17 2 mm was 28 280 times greater than those of 1 4 dioxane and ethanol the concentration of methanol in our reaction solution was in the range similar to that in the pfas adsorption studies by guelfo and higgins 0 04 v v and higgins and luthy 0 2 v v guelfo and higgins 2013 higgins and luthy 2006 in pfas adsorption experiments in this study and in other studies the presence of methanol in the reaction solution is not avoidable because pfas stocks are made by dissolving pfas in methanol 3 3 2 dgbe contrary to 1 4 dioxane and ethanol 61 6 616 μm dgbe significantly suppressed the adsorption of pfos and pfoa fig 3 for pfoa the exponent term n in the freundlich equation decreased from 0 56 0 05 in the absence of dgbe to as low as 0 23 0 05 in the presence of 308 μm dgbe table 2 for pfos its adsorption in the presence of dgbe could be better described by the freundlich model rather than by the linear model with the exponent term n varying between 0 45 0 08 and 0 47 0 03 when the initial concentration of dgbe was 616 μm 47 and 92 of dgbe were removed from the solution at the lowest 0 11 g l and highest 0 7 g l cac concentrations respectively fig s3 collectively these results suggest that dgbe competed with pfos and pfoa for high affinity sites resulting in the adsorption of pfos and pfoa to sites with a wider adsorption energy range according to harding marjanovic et al some afff formulations contain at least 8 w w dgbe harding marjanovic et al 2016 more recently titaley et al reported that the concentration of dgbe in 37 afff formulations ranged from 26 to 420 g l titaley et al 2022 at contaminated sites dgbe is expected to be more mobile than pfas since it is relatively hydrophilic log kow 0 56 hansch et al 1995 dgbe also could be biodegraded under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions harding marjanovic et al 2016 yi et al 2018 it could also volatilize titaley et al 2022 as a result after the release of dbge containing afffs it is expected that the concentration of dgbe in groundwater would decrease due to volatilization biodegradation and dilution by groundwater while little is known about how much dgbe could be present in plumes of pfas it was observed in this study that a dgbe concentration as low as 61 6 μm i e 0 01 g l diminished the adsorption of pfos and pfoa on cac the significant adsorption 47 92 as mentioned above of dbge on cac is somewhat unexpected one possible explanation could be that the adsorption of dgbe on cac was not driven by hydrophobic interactions although the mechanism of dgbe adsorption is not understood at this point the results of this study suggest that the research on the fate and transport of pfas in the subsurface should consider the effect of dgbe as well as other glycols e g ethylene glycol hexylene glycol propylene glycol that may be present in afffs 3 3 3 suwanee river fulvic acid the adsorption of pfos and pfoa decreased as the initial concentration of srfa increased from 1 to 20 mgc l fig 4 and table 3 the kd values of pfos adsorption when srfa 0 5 mgc l and 20 mgc l were 6 856 854 l g and 2 461 527 l g respectively these values represent a decrease of 30 and 75 compared with the kd value 9 579 829 l g measured in the system where srfa was absent the kd values for pfoa were 664 139 l g and 225 64 l g when srfa 0 5 mgc l and 20 mgc l respectively versus kd 824 172 l g when srfa was absent while some isotherms could be better fitted to the freundlich model the isotherm parameters kf and n varied simultaneously as the chemistry of the reaction solution changed hence the linear partition coefficient kd values were compared the inhibitory effect of dom on the adsorption of pfas has been attributable to the blocking of pores particularly macropores thereby precluding pfas from entering into mesopores and micropores however it is speculated that pore blocking by srfa was unlikely appreciable because srfa is not significantly larger than pfos mw 500 da and pfoa mw 414 da the average mw of srfa ranges between 800 and 1 500 da thurman et al 1982 beckett et al 1987 aiken and malcolm 1987 chin et al 1994 reid et al 1990 although one study suggested that 36 based on the mass of dissolved carbon of srfa has an mw smaller than 500 dalton remucal et al 2012 another explanation for the inhibitory effect of srfa could be the competition between srfa and pfos pfoa for the same adsorptive sites on cac this hypothesis is similar to that of yu et al who reported that the effluent organic matter fraction that is 1 000 da significantly inhibited the adsorption of pfos and pfoa on powdered activated carbon yu et al 2012 compared to the effect that dgbe had on the adsorption of pfos pfoa the effect of srfa appeared to be less significant for pfos the kd value measured in the presence of 5 mgc l of srfa 6 856 854 l g was over 2 5 times greater than the kd value 2 603 654 l g measured in the system with an initial dgbe concentration of 61 6 μm which is equivalent to 5 9 mg c l of doc the effect of 5 9 mg c l of dgbe on pfos adsorption was similar to the effect caused by 20 mgc l srfa kd 2 461 654 l g in the case of pfoa 5 9 mgc l dgbe had a greater inhibitory effect kd 57 27 l g even compared to when as much as 20 mg c l srfa was present kd 225 64 l g this greater effect of dgbe on pfos and pfoa adsorption corroborates the hypothesis mentioned earlier that is the adsorption of dgbe might be driven by a mechanism other than hydrophobic interaction 3 3 4 benzene and tce the isotherms of pfos and pfoa in the presence of benzene and tce are presented in fig 5 and the corresponding isotherm parameters are presented in table 4 in all experiments the concentrations of benzene and tce were below the detection limits 5 μg l for benzene 0 5 μg l for tce suggesting that essentially all benzene and tce were adsorbed by cac meanwhile the adsorption of pfos was diminished compared to when benzene and tce were absent as the initial concentration of tce increased from 0 to 0 5 mg l and 8 mg l the kd for pfos decreased from kd 9 579 829 l g to 6 140 1 592 l g and 514 20 l g respectively compared to tce benzene had less of an impact on pfos adsorption the kd values in the presence of 0 5 and 4 8 mg l were 6 932 982 l g and 6634 1963 l g respectively the diminished pfos adsorption by benzene and particularly by 8 mg l tce could be attributable to the competition between pfos and these co contaminants for adsorptive sites somewhat surprisingly the adsorption of pfoa was not affected or was even enhanced by tce and benzene with kd values in the presence of tce or benzene being up to 2 5 times higher fig 5 and table 4 previous studies have suggested that tce napl could absorb contaminants and thus enhance their removal from the aqueous phase guelfo and higgins 2013 jonker and barendregt 2006 jonker et al 2003 although the concentrations of benzene and tce in our study were much lower than their aqueous solubility 1 000 mg l it might be possible that the adsorbed benzene and tce formed a napl phase inside cac pores thereby enhancing pfoa adsorption while it is not possible to prove this hypothesis at this point our result is similar to that of siriwardena et al who also reported that the adsorption of pfoa on gac was enhanced in the presence of 1 mg l tce siriwardena et al 2019 these similar observations indicate that additional research is needed to investigate whether the influence of tce and benzene and other co contaminants is dependent upon each pfas class of pfas 3 4 the effect of ionic strength and ca2 adsorption barriers have been proposed for the in situ immobilization of pfas at coastal sites bangert 2023 while the impact of ionic strength on the adsorption of pfas by soils and inorganic minerals has been studied tang et al 2010 xiao et al 2011 wang et al 2022 wang et al 2012 little is known about how ionic strength affects the adsorption of pfas on ac in this current study it was observed that the affinity of pfos to the polymer free cac was enhanced when the reaction solution contained 100 mm nacl fig 6 at this nacl concentration all cw values for pfos were less than 100 ng l because the quantitation limit of pfos in this study was 50 ng l there is a high uncertainty associated with the cw values of this experiment on the contrary the adsorption of pfos was not appreciably affected by the presence of either 1 mm or 10 mm nacl however there were also high uncertainties associated with the cw values of these experiments which were all less than 500 ng l these high uncertainties might have masked any effect that nacl had on the adsorption of pfos alternatively the minimal effect of nacl in the 1 10 mm concentration range could have been due to pfos molecules already having adequate access to high affinity sites on cac in the absence of nacl in all experiments over 99 9 of pfos was removed even with the lowest cac dosage fig 6 the highest points in the pfos isotherms for pfoa its adsorption on polymer free cac progressively increased as the concentration of nacl increased fig 6 with kd in the presence of 100 mm nacl 6 010 716 l g being over 7 times greater than the kd in the absence of nacl 824 172 l g table 5 as discussed earlier it is expected that electrostatic attractions exist between the positively charged cac surface and the negatively charged pfos and pfoa molecules because an increase in ionic strength would suppress electrostatic attraction saeidi et al 2021 the enhanced pfos and pfoa adsorption as the concentration of nacl increased might be attributable to the salting out effect du et al 2014 while xiao et al suggested that the salting out effect was negligible for the adsorption of pfos and pfoa on kaolinite in the presence of up to 1 mm nacl xiao et al 2011 the salting out effect could be important at higher nacl concentrations e g 10 100 mm nacl similar to the effect of ionic strength the effect of ca2 has been studied only for the adsorption of pfas on sediments and soils but not on ac in these previous studies with soils and sediments the concentration of ca2 was varied by adding different amounts of ca containing salt e g cacl2 to the solution because the addition of salt also impacts the ionic strength of the solution the effect of ca2 could have been confounded by the effect of ionic strength in the current study the ionic strength of the solution was carefully controlled to 7 mm to separate these two effects as can be seen from fig 6 and table 5 the affinity of pfos and pfoa to the polymer free cac progressively increased with increasing ca2 concentration this enhanced adsorption could be attributable to ca2 ions serving as the bridge between the surface and the head group in pfas a hypothesis that was put forward by other researchers wang et al 2022 the positive effect of ca2 on the adsorption of pfas indicates that the breakthrough of pfas in cac barriers will be retarded in groundwater containing high ca2 concentrations in applications where cacl2 is injected into the subsurface to coagulate cac particles and diminish their mobility niarchos et al 2023 the potential added benefit of cacl2 could be a greater pfas immobilization immediately following cac injection however this effect of cacl2 might dissipate over time as the concentration of ca2 decreases to the background level following dilution with groundwater 4 conclusion to date plumestop cac was applied to immobilize plumes of pfas in situ at over a dozen sites around the world including in the us the uk canada and sweden mcgregor 2018 mcgregor 2020 niarchos et al 2023 mcgregor and benevenuto 2021 carey et al 2023 while the longevity of plumestop cac barriers with respect to preventing pfas breakthrough could be on the order of decades carey et al 2023 the retention of pfas by cac barriers will be dependent upon site specific factors such as the hydrogeology of the site the mass of cac injected and its distribution in the subsurface the mass flux of pfas entering the barrier and the chemistry of the groundwater this study investigated several solution parameters that may affect the adsorption of 7 pfas on plumestop cac key findings and their implications are summarized below the adsorption of the 7 studied pfas on cac was driven primarily by hydrophobic interactions suggesting that hydrophilic compounds such as pfba and pfpea will be among the first compounds to break through cac barriers this is consistent with the observation made by niarchos et al who reported that pfpea was the first compound to break through a soil column loaded with cac niarchos et al 2022 niarchos et al also reported that due to competitive sorption pfpea was displaced by longer chain compounds resulting in pfpea concentration overshooting niarchos et al 2022 while shorter chain compounds are less bioaccumulative and therefore are less of a concern e g lha for pfbs set by us epa is 100 000 times greater than the lha for pfos future regulatory limits for these compounds may become more stringent as such the retention and breakthrough of hydrophilic pfas should be considered when designing and implementing in situ cac barriers the adsorption of pfos and pfoa by cac was suppressed by srfa and dgbe notably dgbe which is smaller and more hydrophilic than srfa had a greater inhibitory effect while the mechanism through which dgbe inhibits the adsorption of pfos and pfoa remains to be investigated this result suggests that the effect of dgbe on the fate and transport of pfas in the subsurface should be considered as dgbe is an important component of many afff formulations benzene and tce suppressed pfos adsorption but had no effect or slightly enhanced pfoa adsorption suggesting that the effect of benzene and tce could be specific to each pfas class of pfas because benzene tce and other non fluorinated contaminants could comingle with pfas in the groundwater at afff impacted sites additional research is needed to investigate their effect on the retention and breakthrough of pfas in cac barriers by carefully controlling the ionic strength and the concentration of ca2 in the reaction solution it was observed in this study that these two solution parameters enhanced the adsorption of pfos and pfoa on cac as such cac barriers at coastal sites or at sites where the concentration of ca2 in groundwater is high may have greater longevity whether ionic strength and ca2 also have a positive effect on the adsorption of other pfas by cac remains to be investigated the effect of other multivalent cations e g mg2 al3 fe3 on the adsorption of pfas by cac also should be studied it should be noted that the findings presented above concern the adsorption of pfas on plumestop cac whether these findings extend to

14628,the immobilization of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas by colloidal activated carbon cac barriers has been proposed as a potential in situ method to mitigate the transport of plumes of pfas in the subsurface however if pfas are continuously released from a source zone the adsorptive sites on cac will eventually become saturated upon which point the breakthrough of pfas in the barrier will occur to predict the long term effectiveness of cac barriers it is important to evaluate the factors that may affect the adsorption of pfas on cac in this study the adsorption of 7 pfas on a polymer stabilized cac i e plumestop and on a polymer free cac was investigated using batch experiments the adsorption affinity of pfas to cac was in the following order pfos 6 2 fts pfhxs pfoa pfbs pfpea pfba this result indicates that hydrophobic interaction was the predominant adsorption mechanism and that hydrophilic compounds such as pfba and pfpea will break through cac barriers first the partition coefficient kd for the adsorption of pfas on the polymer stabilized cac was 1 3 3 5 times smaller than the kd for the adsorption of pfas on the polymer free cac suggesting that the polymers decreased the adsorption presumably due to competitive sorption thus the pfas adsorption capacity of plumestop cac barriers is expected to increase once the polymers are biodegraded and or washed away the affinity of pfos and pfoa to cac increased when the ionic strength of the solution increased from 1 to 100 mm or when the concentration of ca2 increased from 0 to 2 mm in contrast less pfos and pfoa were adsorbed in the presence of 1 20 mgc l suwannee river fulvic acid which represented dissolved organic carbon or in the presence of 10 100 mg l diethylene glycol butyl ether dgbe which is an important component in some aqueous film forming foam afff formulations the presence of 0 5 4 8 mg l benzene or 0 5 8 mg l trichloroethylene the co contaminants that may comingle with pfas at afff impacted sites diminished pfos adsorption but had no effect or even slightly enhanced pfoa adsorption when the initial concentration of tce was 8 mg l the kd 514 240 l g for the adsorption of pfos was approximately 20 times lower than that in the tce free system k d 9 579 829 l g the results of this study provided insights into some key factors that may affect the adsorption of pfas in in situ cac barriers keywords per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas adsorption activated carbon in situ remediation 1 introduction owing to their extremely high thermal and chemical stability as well

products as well as coatings for fabrics paper and furniture buck et al 2011 glüge et al 2020 among these applications of pfas the use of afff to extinguish fires at military sites airports petroleum refineries and firefighter training facilities has created sites contaminated with pfas salvatore et al 2022 a recent study identified 3 493 military sites and 519 airports in the us as presumptive pfas contamination locations salvatore et al 2022 in canada of the 2 071 airports surveyed 152 airports were identified as likely being contaminated with pfas milley et al 2018 many of these sites are located near residential areas and pose direct threats to the drinking water resources of nearby residents hu et al 2016 because exposure to pfas has been linked to various health issues dickman and aga 2022 sunderland et al 2019 sims et al 2022 guidelines for pfas are beginning to emerge recently the us environmental protection agency epa has issued interim updated drinking water lifetime health advisory lha levels of 0 004 ng l for perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and 0 020 ng l for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and final lha levels of 2 000 ng l for perfluorobutane sulfonic acid pfbs and 10 ng l for hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid genx u s environmental protection agency 2023 considering that humans and ecosystems can be exposed to pfas in groundwater and that future regulations may enforce remediation of pfas contaminated sites there is an urgent need to develop technologies that can effectively remove pfas from groundwater at afff impacted sites contaminated groundwater can be remediated ex situ or in situ ex situ remediation also known as pump and treat involves extracting groundwater to the surface and treating it followed by discharging the treated water to a publicly owned treatment system contrary to ex situ remediation in situ remediation involves injecting chemical and or biological amendments into the subsurface to initiate reactions that can destroy contaminants in place compared to ex situ remediation in situ remediation is less energy intensive and potentially has a shorter operational timeframe and smaller carbon footprint as such in situ remediation is a preferable method whenever possible suthersan and payne 2005 to date however pfas contaminated groundwater has been primarily treated by ex situ approaches this is because pfas are extremely resistant to chemical and biological degradation and therefore cannot be destroyed in situ under conditions typical of the subsurface ross et al 2018 recently several studies have proposed that pfas in groundwater can be immobilized in situ by stationary adsorption barriers which can be created by injecting particulate or chemical amendments into the subsurface for example aly et al demonstrated that the breakthrough of pfoa and pfos in a one dimensional soil column was delayed by 8 20 pore volumes pv when the soil column was amended with the cationic polymers polyamine pa and polydiallyldimethyl ammonium chloride polydadmac aly et al 2019 subsequent to this study the same research group demonstrated that by injecting a mixture of powdered activated carbon pac and polydadmac into an ottawa sand column the breakthrough of pfos and pfoa in the column was delayed by three orders of magnitude equivalent to 4 000 6 000 pvs liu et al 2020 they also demonstrated that injecting amberlite ira910 ion exchange ix resins stabilized by pluronic f 127 polymer into an ottawa sand column resulted in a uniform adsorption zone that delayed the breakthrough of pfos and pfoa by more than five orders of magnitude equivalent to 5 900 9 240 pvs liu et al 2022 in parallel with bench scale studies there have been efforts to demonstrate the in situ immobilization of pfas in the field mcgregor 2018 carey et al 2019 mcgregor 2020 niarchos et al 2023 mcgregor and benevenuto 2021 mcgregor and zhao 2021 in what appears to have been the first field study on the in situ immobilization of pfas mcgregor demonstrated that an adsorption barrier created by injecting plumestop a colloidal activated carbon cac suspension trademarked by regenesis san clemente ca us into the subsurface successfully contained pfos and pfoa at a contaminated site located in a shallow silty sand aquifer in central canada mcgregor 2018 at this location following the injection of cac into the source zone the concentration of pfos 3 260 ng l and pfoa 1 450 ng l decreased to below detectable levels 20 ng l mcgregor 2018 carey et al 2019 in a separate study mcgregor conducted pilot scale tests to evaluate the in situ immobilization of pfas by plumestop cac calgon wpc powdered activated carbon pac purolite purofine pfa694e ix resin and biochar mcgregor 2020 in each test cell the concentration of all pfas dropped from 140 24 000 ng l to below detectable levels 10 ng l following adsorbent injection plumestop cac was also used in the study by niarchos et al to immobilize pfas in the groundwater at a historical firefighting training area in sweden niarchos et al 2023 following cac injection at this site the total concentration of 11 pfas in the monitoring well downgradient of the cac barrier decreased by as much as 76 niarchos et al 2023 although the bench scale and field scale studies mentioned above indicate that in situ adsorption barriers could potentially be an effective means of containing plumes of pfas it is important to recognize that as with any sorption based technology the breakthrough of pfas will take place once the adsorptive sites in a barrier are exhausted if pfas is continuously released from a source zone upstream in the pilot scale tests conducted by mcgregor mcgregor 2020 it was observed that the concentrations of all pfas in the cell injected with cac have been below detectable levels after over a year mcgregor 2020 however partial or full concentration rebounds were observed in the cells where biochar purofine pfa694e and pac were injected mcgregor 2020 at the site in central canada the concentrations of pfos and pfoa have remained undetected after over six years in all monitoring wells downgradient of the cac barrier personal communication with rick mcgregor while more field studies and longer term pfas monitoring will be required to further evaluate the longevity of in situ adsorption barriers it is reasonable to expect that the retention and breakthrough of pfas in a barrier will be dependent upon several factors including the mass flux of pfas entering the barrier the mass of adsorbent injected and its distribution in the barrier the competition for adsorptive sites among pfas as well as between pfas and co contaminants and the groundwater water chemistry in the pilot scale studies conducted by mcgregor the breakthrough of the shorter chain pfas in the barriers created by biochar purofine pfa694e ix and pac could be due to the low adsorption capacity in some areas within these barriers since the adsorbents were found to preferentially accumulate along a coarse grained sand seam mcgregor 2020 contrary to these adsorbents plumestop which consists of ac colloids stabilized with polymers was distributed uniformly in both the coarse grained sand seam and the fine grained sand area mcgregor 2020 mcgregor 2020 mcgregor also speculated that the breakthrough of the shorter chain pfas could be due to competitive adsorption mcgregor 2020 this hypothesis is consistent with the studies showing that compounds with longer carbon chains e g pfos and pfoa are better removed by ac and ix than those with shorter carbon chains e g pfbs perfluorobutanoic acid pfba and perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea and that longer chain compounds can desorb the shorter chain ones liu et al 2022 niarchos et al 2022 chow et al 2022 park et al 2020 competitive adsorption also could occur between pfas and organic co contaminants such as petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents which could be released during firefighting training activities and nonfluorinated surfactants and solvents which are present alongside pfas in afff formulations moody and field 1999 place and field 2012 guelfo and higgins 2013 to date there have been limited studies on the impact of co contaminants on pfas adsorption guelfo and higgins 2013 siriwardena et al 2019 ji et al 2021 pan et al 2009 zhang et al 2022 guelfo and higgins observed that the nonfluorinated surfactants sodium decyl sulfate sds and n n dimethyldodecylamine n oxide ao either increased had no effect or decreased pfas sorption on soils guelfo and higgins 2013 they also observed that the trichloroethylene tce non aqueous phase liquid napl had a complex influence on pfas sorption on the one hand tce could decrease pfas sorption by competing for the same adsorptive sites on the other hand the napl phase on the soil surface could absorb pfas thereby enhancing pfas partitioning to soil guelfo and higgins 2013 in another study siriwarderna et al observed that the presence of kerosene ethanol and dissolved tce did not appreciably affect the adsorption of pfos but slightly enhanced the adsorption of pfoa on a coal based and a coconut based granular activated carbon gac siriwardena et al 2019 these past studies suggest that it is difficult to predict how co contaminants would affect pfas adsorption since their effects are dependent upon a range of factors including the co contaminant concentration e g non napl versus napl the latter of which could absorb pfas at high concentration surfactants can form semi micelle or micelle thereby enhancing pfas solubility and decreasing their affinity to surfaces adsorbent properties e g surface charge organic carbon content and pfas type e g short chain versus long chain compounds perfluoro carboxylates versus perfluoro sulfonates because the concentration of organic co contaminants at afff impacted sites could be up to a few orders of magnitude greater than those of pfas carey et al 2023 their influence on the retention and breakthrough of pfas in adsorption barriers is likely significant thus additional research is needed to gain insights into how co contaminants may affect the adsorption of pfas on amendments used to create in situ adsorption barriers such insights are important for the design and implementation of the barriers the objective of this study was to investigate the adsorption of pfas on plumestop cac focusing specifically on assessing how adsorption was influenced by the stabilizing polymers co contaminants and solution chemistry to this end a series of batch adsorption experiments were conducted to investigate the adsorption of pfas on two types of cac namely a stabilizer free and a stabilizer containing cac suspension seven pfas were studied including pfba pfpea pfoa pfbs perfluorohexane sulfonic acid pfhxs pfos and 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid 6 2 fts these compounds were chosen because they are currently driving pfas regulations pfos and pfoa are pervasive at afff impacted sites all seven compounds or are highly mobile pfba pfpea pfbs and thus are likely among the first to break through cac barriers carey et al 2023 further the adsorption of pfos and pfoa was investigated in the presence of five co contaminants including benzene tce 1 4 dioxane ethanol and diethylene glycol butyl ether dgbe also known as butyl carbitol benzene tce and 1 4 dioxane could be present at sites where they were used as fuels during firefighting training activities whereas dgbe and other alcohols are important components in some afff formulations kao and prosser 1999 bugna et al 2005 titaley et al 2022 mcguire et al 2014 additionally the effects of three key solution chemistry parameters namely ionic strength ca2 and dissolved organic carbon on the adsorption of pfos and pfoa were investigated 2 materials and method 2 1 chemicals single pfas were purchased from either sigma aldrich pfba pfpea pfoa pfbs pfhxs pfos or toronto research chemicals 6 2 fts while analytical native and isotopically labeled pfas standards were purchased from wellington laboratories guelph canada see table s1 in the supporting information si for the list of native and isotopically labeled pfas suwannee river fulvic acid srfa was purchased from the international humic substances society usa benzene tce 1 4 dioxane dgbe and ethanol were purchased from sigma aldrich all other chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich or fisher scientific methanolic stock solutions of single compound pfas 350 1 100 mg l were prepared by dissolving each compound in lcms grade methanol stock solutions of benzene 479 mg l tce 436 mg l 1 4 dioxane 2 700 mg l and ethanol 1 400 mg l were prepared using 18 2 mω cm milliq water millipore 2 2 adsorbents two cac materials were used in this study both of which were provided by regenesis san clemente california usa the first material was plumestop cac which will be denoted from this point forward as the polymer containing cac this material was a slurry consisting of cac water and organic polymers the organic polymers served as the stabilizing agent which aimed to minimize particle aggregation and enhance cac mobility in in situ applications for this study regenesis also provided a material that only consisted of cac and water denoted as the polymer free cac the adsorption of pfas on these two materials was compared to assess how the presence of the polymers affected the adsorption of pfas by cac while regenesis indicated that the size of the cac particles ranged between 1 and 2 μm it was noticed in our preliminary experiments that when cac containing samples were filtered using a 0 2 μm filter and subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms the backpressure in the lc system increased over time this observation suggests that some cac particles must have passed through the 0 2 μm filter and clogged the analytical column sorengard et al also noticed that some plumestop cac passed through a 0 45 μm filter sorengard et al 2019 their dynamic light scattering analyses revealed that the size of plumestop cac ranged between 0 1 and 1 1 μm with an average particle size being 0 6 μm sorengard et al 2019 the point of zero charge phpzc of the two cac materials was determined using a method described by saeidi et al saeidi et al 2020 2 3 adsorption experiments six point adsorption isotherms for pfas were generated using the bottle point approach the initial concentration of the adsorbate was kept constant while the adsorbent dose was varied in brief experiments were conducted in either polypropylene pp conical centrifuge tubes or glass tubes when benzene or tce was present in the reaction solution that contained 50 73 ml of an aqueous solution of 1 mm nahco3 which served as the background electrolyte and a ph buffer ph 7 5 8 5 a 50 73 μl aliquot of a methanolic single pfas stock was added to each test tube resulting in test tubes that contained the same amount of methanol 0 1 v v and a similar initial pfas concentration that is each reaction solution consisted of only one of the following compounds pfba 0 2 12 μm pfpea 0 1 18 μm pfoa 0 1 28 μm pfbs 0 1 17 μm pfphxs 0 1 40 μm pfos 0 1 30 μm or 6 2 fts 0 2 57 μm these molar concentration values are equivalent to mass concentration values ranging from 350 μg l pfba to 1 100 μg l 6 2 fts because the concentration of pfas in the groundwater at afff impacted sites usually ranges from less than μg l to a few hundred μg l carey et al 2023 the initial pfas concentrations employed in this study represented some of the most contaminated scenarios the initial concentrations were chosen to be high enough such that the amount of pfas remaining in the solution after adsorption i e cw could be measured also cw was targeted to span over an order magnitude so that pfas adsorption could be compared at different cw additionally the initial molar concentrations were aimed to be within a factor of 2 5 of each other to enable the comparison based on a molar basis of the adsorption trend among pfas carey et al reviewed 17 pfas contaminated sites in the us uk and canada carey et al 2023 at these sites the total concentration of btex benzene toluene ethyl benzene xylene ranged from non detect to approximately 6 mg l while the total concentration of tce and other chlorinated solvents was as high as approximately 1 mg l to examine how btex and chlorinated solvents might affect pfos and pfoa adsorption by cac in some experiments the reaction solution contained 0 5 or 4 8 mg l benzene i e 6 4 or 61 6 μm or 0 5 or 8 5 mg l tce i e 3 8 61 6 μm because 1 4 dioxane is usually present at sites contaminated with chlorinated solvents it could be present at pfas contaminated sites as well however little is known about 1 4 dioxane concentration levels in plumes of pfas in this study the effect of 5 4 54 mg l 1 4 dioxane i e 61 6 616 μm on the adsorption of pfos and pfoa by cac was investigated also dgbe and ethanol could be present at afff impacted sites because these two compounds are part of some afff formulations as in the case of 1 4 dioxane the concentration level of dgbe and ethanol in pfas contaminated groundwater is not known herein the concentration of dgbe and ethanol was set to range between 10 100 mg l i e 61 6 616 μm and 2 8 28 mg l i e 61 6 616 μm respectively lastly the effect of 1 20 mgc l srfa on the adsorption of pfos and pfoa was also investigated all organic compounds described above were added to the reaction solution from their respective aqueous stock solutions except for dgbe which was added from the pure 99 dgbe stock to investigate the effect of ionic strength and ca2 on the adsorption of pfos and pfoa 1 100 mm nacl and 0 1 2 mm cacl2 were added to the solution because varying the amount of cacl2 added to the solution also changed the ionic strength the effect of ca2 could be confounded by the effect of ionic strength if the latter is not controlled as such in the experiments investigating the effect of ca2 between 0 and 5 7 mm of nacl was added so that the ionic strength was 7 mm in all experiments adsorption of pfas was initiated by adding different volumes of cac slurry into the test tubes to obtain a cac concentration ranging from 0 11 to 0 7 g l subsequently the test tubes were placed on an orbital shaker after 72 hours an aliquot was withdrawn from each test tube transferred into an ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 230 000 g for 105 min to separate cac from the solution to minimize the loss of pfas to the ultracentrifuge tube wall the tubes were first rinsed with two aliquots of the test solution to saturate the tube wall with pfas before the final aliquot was transferred into the tube and centrifuged following cac separation 250 µl of the supernatant was taken out and subjected to pfas analysis a separate set of experiments was conducted to investigate the kinetics of pfas adsorption on cac in this set of experiments test tubes were taken off of the orbital shaker at t 6 h 24 h 48 h 72 h 120 h and 168 h and the reaction solutions were subjected to centrifugation to separate cac to investigate the affinity of pfas to pp and glass test tubes some reaction solutions did not contain cac i e control experiments all experiments were conducted in duplicate at 22 c and the average pfas concentrations along with their range are presented 2 4 analysis benzene dgbe and tce were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with either flame ionization detection benzene dgbe or electron capture detection tce for the analysis of pfas samples were diluted with methanol and isotopically labeled pfas stock to obtain a final sample composition of 50 50 v v water methanol samples were analyzed on a shimadzu 8030 lc ms ms and the concentrations of pfas were calculated using the isotopic dilution method see si for the details on the instrument conditions and other information related to pfas analysis 2 5 pfas isotherm modeling adsorption isotherm results were fitted using either the linear isotherm model c s k d c w or the freundlich isotherm model c s k f c w n in these equations kd is the linear partition coefficient kf is the freundlich constant mg g mg l n and a measure of the adsorption capacity when cw 1 mg l n is the exponential term indicative of the surface heterogeneity when n 1 the freundlich model becomes the linear model and cs mg g and cw mg l are the equilibrium concentrations of the contaminant in the solid and aqueous phases respectively cw values were obtained from lc ms ms analysis while cs values were calculated based on pfas mass balance c s c 0 c w c c a c with c0 mg l being the initial pfas concentration and ccac being the cac concentration g l it is noted that the langmuir isotherm model was not considered since under the experimental conditions employed in this study the resulting isotherms did not consist of a flat region i e the region where cs remains constant as cw increases required for proper fitting to the langmuir model 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption kinetics less than 10 of the initial pfas was lost from the solution in the absence of the polymer free cac or the polymer containing cac after 168 hours data not shown the results of these control experiments suggest that the loss of pfas in the presence of cac fig s1 was primarily due to adsorption to cac for the shorter chain compounds pfbs and pfba the adsorption equilibrium was established after approximately 24 hours for the longer chain compounds pfos and pfoa their concentration in the solution quickly decreased during the first 24 hours and then gradually decreased further over the subsequent 144 hours considering that over 99 of the initial mass of pfas was adsorbed during the first 48 hours the adsorption of each pfas in the subsequent experiments was evaluated based on a contact time of t 72 hours between the reaction solution and cac 3 2 adsorption trend there is a general consensus that pfas adsorption on ac is mainly driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions du et al 2014 the phpzc of both the polymer containing and polymer free cac was determined to be 11 8 suggesting that the cac surface would have been positively charged under the ph condition i e 7 5 8 5 employed in the adsorption experiments conducted in this study thus the adsorption of pfas on cac must have been partially driven by the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged cac surface and the negatively charged sulfonate and carboxylate functional groups of pfas however it is argued that this electrostatic attraction was not the dominant mechanism in our system as otherwise shorter chain pfas would have been adsorbed to a greater extent than longer chain pfas parker et al 2022 instead the affinity of pfas to the polymer containing cac was in the following order pfos 6 2 fts pfhxs pfoa pfbs pfpea pfba fig 1 this trend suggests that hydrophobic interaction was generally the predominant adsorption mechanism the two longest chain length compounds pfos and 6 2 fts which consist of 8 carbons are the most hydrophobic among the 7 studied pfas and therefore were adsorbed by the polymer containing cac to the greatest extent between pfos and 6 2 fts the former compound exhibited a higher adsorption affinity which could be attributable to the two fully fluorinated carbons i e cf2 cf2 being more hydrophobic than the hydrogenated counterparts i e ch2 ch2 krafft and riess 2015 similarly pfpea having one cf2 longer than pfba was adsorbed by the polymer containing cac to a greater extent whereas pfbs was adsorbed more than pfpea because the so3 headgroup is more hydrophobic than the coo headgroup parker et al 2022 for pfhxs and pfoa their log kow values which is an indicator of hydrophobicity vary widely in the literature log kow 4 30 5 30 for pfoa park et al 2020 arp et al 2006 wang et al 2011 jing et al 2009 and 3 16 5 17 for pfhxs jing et al 2009 gagliano et al 2020 based on their relative retention times 4 9 min for pfhxs and 5 4 min for pfoa on the c18 column in the lc ms ms analysis pfoa might be more hydrophobic than pfhxs xiao et al 2017 however more pfhxs was adsorbed by cac than pfoa fig 1 a trend that contradicts the hydrophobicity of these compounds parker et al demonstrated that the electrostatic attraction to aminopropyl beads was stronger for pfoa than for pfhxs parker et al 2022 thus the fact that more pfhxs was adsorbed by cac than pfoa cannot be explained by electrostatic attraction either while the mechanisms of pfhxs and pfoa adsorption on cac are not entirely clear at this point our results are similar to that of xiao et al who reported that when the adsorbent was gac calgon filtersorb300 the 30 day log kd l kg value of pfhxs 5 09 0 01 was greater than that of pfoa 4 97 0 04 xiao et al 2017 the trend of pfas adsorption on the polymer free cac was generally similar to that on the polymer containing cac except for 6 2 fts fig 1 this compound exhibited a greater adsorption affinity than pfhxs at cw values greater than 3 10 3 mg l but its adsorption affinity was lower when cw 3 10 3 mg l in fig 1 right panel the adsorption isotherm of 6 2 fts crosses that of pfhxs at around cw 3 10 3 mg l when the isotherms describing the adsorption of each compound on the polymer containing cac and on the polymer free cac were compared fig s2 it was revealed that pfba and 6 2 fts exhibited a similar adsorption affinity to these two adsorbents under the studied cw range in contrast pfbs pfhxs pfos pfpea and pfoa exhibited a greater adsorption affinity to the polymer free cac it is speculated that the diminished adsorption in the presence of the polymers might be due to competitive sorption this hypothesis is similar to that of georgi et al who attributed the diminished adsorption of monochlorobenzene mcb on ac colloids stabilized with dodecylbenzene sulfonate sdbs to the competition between mcb and sdbs georgi et al 2015 georgi et al also speculated that the stabilizer would desorb from the ac surface once the cac suspension is diluted by the groundwater georgi et al 2015 the desorption and or degradation of the stabilizing polymers following cac barrier installation would free up adsorptive sites on cac thereby increasing the adsorption of pfas additional research is needed to assess the desorption degradation rate of the polymers used in the polymer containing cac the isotherms of pfbs pfhxs and pfoa seem to be better fitted by the freundlich model r2 0 97 0 99 than by the linear model r2 0 91 0 95 whereas the isotherms of pfpea could be described by either model r2 0 97 or 0 98 table 1 for pfos and 6 2 fts while the r2 values of the freundlich fittings are similar or slightly greater than those of the linear fittings there is high uncertainty associated with the kf values as such it appeared that the pfos and 6 2 fts isotherms could be better described by the linear model note that a major assumption of the freundlich model is that there is a distribution of surface sites with different adsorption affinity and that adsorbates will first occupy high affinity sites i e the strong sites followed by adsorption on low affinity sites since the cs values in this study spanned over less than one order of magnitude fig 1 pfas may have been adsorbed to only the strong sites on the cac surface as such whether the adsorption of pfas on cac obeys the linear or the freundlich model may not be entirely discerned based on the experimental data especially if experimental errors are factored in it is also noted that the isotherm model used to describe pfas adsorption could have implications for the prediction of barrier longevity specifically a parameter that is often employed to describe the transport of contaminants in the subsurface is the retardation coefficient r which can be calculated by the following equations 1 r 1 ρ b θ k d 2 r 1 ρ b θ k f n c w n 1 with ρb being the soil dry bulk density g cm3 θ being the effective porosity cm3 cm3 kd being the linear partition coefficient and kf and n being the freundlich isotherm parameters eq 1 is applicable to contaminants whose adsorption can be described by the linear isotherm model whereas eq 2 is used when the adsorption obeys the freundlich isotherm model assuming a ρb value of 1 65 g cm3 a θ value of 0 35 cm3 cm3 and a cw value of 0 01 mg l the retardation values would be r 1 25 107 based on eq 1 and r 5 94 106 based on eq 2 when using the kd kf and n parameters for pfos on the polymer containing cac table 1 while the two r values differ by less than an order of magnitude it should be noted that r is independent of cw in eq 1 also r is linearly proportional to kd and kf but is exponentially dependent on n as a result r is more sensitive to changes to n i e changes in surface heterogeneity than to kd or kf 3 3 the effect of organics 3 3 1 ethanol and 1 4 dioxane the adsorption isotherms of pfos and pfoa in the presence of varying concentrations of ethanol and 1 4 dioxane are presented in fig 2 and the associated isotherm parameters are presented in table 2 as described above the adsorption of pfos on the polymer free cac could be better described by the linear model kd 9 579 829 l g in the presence of either ethanol or 1 4 dioxane the pfos isotherms also seem to be better fitted to the linear model because of the high uncertainty associated with the kf values table 2 the kd value increased from 7 545 921 l g and 7 698 505 l g in the presence of 61 6 μm of ethanol and 1 4 dioxane respectively to 11 179 835 l g and 10 207 1 427 l g in the presence of 616 μm ethanol and 1 4 dioxane respectively however considering the uncertainty associated with these kd values as well as a lack of a clear trend between these values and the concentration of the co contaminants it could be concluded that 1 4 dioxane and ethanol did not have an appreciable effect on pfos adsorption under the experimental conditions employed in this study similarly there appeared to be no appreciable effect of these two co contaminants on the adsorption of pfoa except for when the concentration of 1 4 dioxane was 308 μm under which condition the kf and n values were slightly higher table 2 siriwardena et al also observed that 1 mg l ethanol i e 22 μm did not appreciably affect the adsorption of pfos on a bituminous coal based filtrasorb f400 calgon and a coconut based cbc olc calgon gac siriwardena et al 2019 on the contrary they reported that the presence of ethanol enhanced the adsorption of pfoa on both adsorbents however this conclusion was based on a single point isotherm experiment whether a similar effect of ethanol would be observed at a range of cw and cs is unclear it should be noted that the effect of 1 4 dioxane and ethanol on the adsorption of pfos and pfoa in our study could have been masked by the effect of methanol whose concentration in the reaction solution 0 1 v v or 17 2 mm was 28 280 times greater than those of 1 4 dioxane and ethanol the concentration of methanol in our reaction solution was in the range similar to that in the pfas adsorption studies by guelfo and higgins 0 04 v v and higgins and luthy 0 2 v v guelfo and higgins 2013 higgins and luthy 2006 in pfas adsorption experiments in this study and in other studies the presence of methanol in the reaction solution is not avoidable because pfas stocks are made by dissolving pfas in methanol 3 3 2 dgbe contrary to 1 4 dioxane and ethanol 61 6 616 μm dgbe significantly suppressed the adsorption of pfos and pfoa fig 3 for pfoa the exponent term n in the freundlich equation decreased from 0 56 0 05 in the absence of dgbe to as low as 0 23 0 05 in the presence of 308 μm dgbe table 2 for pfos its adsorption in the presence of dgbe could be better described by the freundlich model rather than by the linear model with the exponent term n varying between 0 45 0 08 and 0 47 0 03 when the initial concentration of dgbe was 616 μm 47 and 92 of dgbe were removed from the solution at the lowest 0 11 g l and highest 0 7 g l cac concentrations respectively fig s3 collectively these results suggest that dgbe competed with pfos and pfoa for high affinity sites resulting in the adsorption of pfos and pfoa to sites with a wider adsorption energy range according to harding marjanovic et al some afff formulations contain at least 8 w w dgbe harding marjanovic et al 2016 more recently titaley et al reported that the concentration of dgbe in 37 afff formulations ranged from 26 to 420 g l titaley et al 2022 at contaminated sites dgbe is expected to be more mobile than pfas since it is relatively hydrophilic log kow 0 56 hansch et al 1995 dgbe also could be biodegraded under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions harding marjanovic et al 2016 yi et al 2018 it could also volatilize titaley et al 2022 as a result after the release of dbge containing afffs it is expected that the concentration of dgbe in groundwater would decrease due to volatilization biodegradation and dilution by groundwater while little is known about how much dgbe could be present in plumes of pfas it was observed in this study that a dgbe concentration as low as 61 6 μm i e 0 01 g l diminished the adsorption of pfos and pfoa on cac the significant adsorption 47 92 as mentioned above of dbge on cac is somewhat unexpected one possible explanation could be that the adsorption of dgbe on cac was not driven by hydrophobic interactions although the mechanism of dgbe adsorption is not understood at this point the results of this study suggest that the research on the fate and transport of pfas in the subsurface should consider the effect of dgbe as well as other glycols e g ethylene glycol hexylene glycol propylene glycol that may be present in afffs 3 3 3 suwanee river fulvic acid the adsorption of pfos and pfoa decreased as the initial concentration of srfa increased from 1 to 20 mgc l fig 4 and table 3 the kd values of pfos adsorption when srfa 0 5 mgc l and 20 mgc l were 6 856 854 l g and 2 461 527 l g respectively these values represent a decrease of 30 and 75 compared with the kd value 9 579 829 l g measured in the system where srfa was absent the kd values for pfoa were 664 139 l g and 225 64 l g when srfa 0 5 mgc l and 20 mgc l respectively versus kd 824 172 l g when srfa was absent while some isotherms could be better fitted to the freundlich model the isotherm parameters kf and n varied simultaneously as the chemistry of the reaction solution changed hence the linear partition coefficient kd values were compared the inhibitory effect of dom on the adsorption of pfas has been attributable to the blocking of pores particularly macropores thereby precluding pfas from entering into mesopores and micropores however it is speculated that pore blocking by srfa was unlikely appreciable because srfa is not significantly larger than pfos mw 500 da and pfoa mw 414 da the average mw of srfa ranges between 800 and 1 500 da thurman et al 1982 beckett et al 1987 aiken and malcolm 1987 chin et al 1994 reid et al 1990 although one study suggested that 36 based on the mass of dissolved carbon of srfa has an mw smaller than 500 dalton remucal et al 2012 another explanation for the inhibitory effect of srfa could be the competition between srfa and pfos pfoa for the same adsorptive sites on cac this hypothesis is similar to that of yu et al who reported that the effluent organic matter fraction that is 1 000 da significantly inhibited the adsorption of pfos and pfoa on powdered activated carbon yu et al 2012 compared to the effect that dgbe had on the adsorption of pfos pfoa the effect of srfa appeared to be less significant for pfos the kd value measured in the presence of 5 mgc l of srfa 6 856 854 l g was over 2 5 times greater than the kd value 2 603 654 l g measured in the system with an initial dgbe concentration of 61 6 μm which is equivalent to 5 9 mg c l of doc the effect of 5 9 mg c l of dgbe on pfos adsorption was similar to the effect caused by 20 mgc l srfa kd 2 461 654 l g in the case of pfoa 5 9 mgc l dgbe had a greater inhibitory effect kd 57 27 l g even compared to when as much as 20 mg c l srfa was present kd 225 64 l g this greater effect of dgbe on pfos and pfoa adsorption corroborates the hypothesis mentioned earlier that is the adsorption of dgbe might be driven by a mechanism other than hydrophobic interaction 3 3 4 benzene and tce the isotherms of pfos and pfoa in the presence of benzene and tce are presented in fig 5 and the corresponding isotherm parameters are presented in table 4 in all experiments the concentrations of benzene and tce were below the detection limits 5 μg l for benzene 0 5 μg l for tce suggesting that essentially all benzene and tce were adsorbed by cac meanwhile the adsorption of pfos was diminished compared to when benzene and tce were absent as the initial concentration of tce increased from 0 to 0 5 mg l and 8 mg l the kd for pfos decreased from kd 9 579 829 l g to 6 140 1 592 l g and 514 20 l g respectively compared to tce benzene had less of an impact on pfos adsorption the kd values in the presence of 0 5 and 4 8 mg l were 6 932 982 l g and 6634 1963 l g respectively the diminished pfos adsorption by benzene and particularly by 8 mg l tce could be attributable to the competition between pfos and these co contaminants for adsorptive sites somewhat surprisingly the adsorption of pfoa was not affected or was even enhanced by tce and benzene with kd values in the presence of tce or benzene being up to 2 5 times higher fig 5 and table 4 previous studies have suggested that tce napl could absorb contaminants and thus enhance their removal from the aqueous phase guelfo and higgins 2013 jonker and barendregt 2006 jonker et al 2003 although the concentrations of benzene and tce in our study were much lower than their aqueous solubility 1 000 mg l it might be possible that the adsorbed benzene and tce formed a napl phase inside cac pores thereby enhancing pfoa adsorption while it is not possible to prove this hypothesis at this point our result is similar to that of siriwardena et al who also reported that the adsorption of pfoa on gac was enhanced in the presence of 1 mg l tce siriwardena et al 2019 these similar observations indicate that additional research is needed to investigate whether the influence of tce and benzene and other co contaminants is dependent upon each pfas class of pfas 3 4 the effect of ionic strength and ca2 adsorption barriers have been proposed for the in situ immobilization of pfas at coastal sites bangert 2023 while the impact of ionic strength on the adsorption of pfas by soils and inorganic minerals has been studied tang et al 2010 xiao et al 2011 wang et al 2022 wang et al 2012 little is known about how ionic strength affects the adsorption of pfas on ac in this current study it was observed that the affinity of pfos to the polymer free cac was enhanced when the reaction solution contained 100 mm nacl fig 6 at this nacl concentration all cw values for pfos were less than 100 ng l because the quantitation limit of pfos in this study was 50 ng l there is a high uncertainty associated with the cw values of this experiment on the contrary the adsorption of pfos was not appreciably affected by the presence of either 1 mm or 10 mm nacl however there were also high uncertainties associated with the cw values of these experiments which were all less than 500 ng l these high uncertainties might have masked any effect that nacl had on the adsorption of pfos alternatively the minimal effect of nacl in the 1 10 mm concentration range could have been due to pfos molecules already having adequate access to high affinity sites on cac in the absence of nacl in all experiments over 99 9 of pfos was removed even with the lowest cac dosage fig 6 the highest points in the pfos isotherms for pfoa its adsorption on polymer free cac progressively increased as the concentration of nacl increased fig 6 with kd in the presence of 100 mm nacl 6 010 716 l g being over 7 times greater than the kd in the absence of nacl 824 172 l g table 5 as discussed earlier it is expected that electrostatic attractions exist between the positively charged cac surface and the negatively charged pfos and pfoa molecules because an increase in ionic strength would suppress electrostatic attraction saeidi et al 2021 the enhanced pfos and pfoa adsorption as the concentration of nacl increased might be attributable to the salting out effect du et al 2014 while xiao et al suggested that the salting out effect was negligible for the adsorption of pfos and pfoa on kaolinite in the presence of up to 1 mm nacl xiao et al 2011 the salting out effect could be important at higher nacl concentrations e g 10 100 mm nacl similar to the effect of ionic strength the effect of ca2 has been studied only for the adsorption of pfas on sediments and soils but not on ac in these previous studies with soils and sediments the concentration of ca2 was varied by adding different amounts of ca containing salt e g cacl2 to the solution because the addition of salt also impacts the ionic strength of the solution the effect of ca2 could have been confounded by the effect of ionic strength in the current study the ionic strength of the solution was carefully controlled to 7 mm to separate these two effects as can be seen from fig 6 and table 5 the affinity of pfos and pfoa to the polymer free cac progressively increased with increasing ca2 concentration this enhanced adsorption could be attributable to ca2 ions serving as the bridge between the surface and the head group in pfas a hypothesis that was put forward by other researchers wang et al 2022 the positive effect of ca2 on the adsorption of pfas indicates that the breakthrough of pfas in cac barriers will be retarded in groundwater containing high ca2 concentrations in applications where cacl2 is injected into the subsurface to coagulate cac particles and diminish their mobility niarchos et al 2023 the potential added benefit of cacl2 could be a greater pfas immobilization immediately following cac injection however this effect of cacl2 might dissipate over time as the concentration of ca2 decreases to the background level following dilution with groundwater 4 conclusion to date plumestop cac was applied to immobilize plumes of pfas in situ at over a dozen sites around the world including in the us the uk canada and sweden mcgregor 2018 mcgregor 2020 niarchos et al 2023 mcgregor and benevenuto 2021 carey et al 2023 while the longevity of plumestop cac barriers with respect to preventing pfas breakthrough could be on the order of decades carey et al 2023 the retention of pfas by cac barriers will be dependent upon site specific factors such as the hydrogeology of the site the mass of cac injected and its distribution in the subsurface the mass flux of pfas entering the barrier and the chemistry of the groundwater this study investigated several solution parameters that may affect the adsorption of 7 pfas on plumestop cac key findings and their implications are summarized below the adsorption of the 7 studied pfas on cac was driven primarily by hydrophobic interactions suggesting that hydrophilic compounds such as pfba and pfpea will be among the first compounds to break through cac barriers this is consistent with the observation made by niarchos et al who reported that pfpea was the first compound to break through a soil column loaded with cac niarchos et al 2022 niarchos et al also reported that due to competitive sorption pfpea was displaced by longer chain compounds resulting in pfpea concentration overshooting niarchos et al 2022 while shorter chain compounds are less bioaccumulative and therefore are less of a concern e g lha for pfbs set by us epa is 100 000 times greater than the lha for pfos future regulatory limits for these compounds may become more stringent as such the retention and breakthrough of hydrophilic pfas should be considered when designing and implementing in situ cac barriers the adsorption of pfos and pfoa by cac was suppressed by srfa and dgbe notably dgbe which is smaller and more hydrophilic than srfa had a greater inhibitory effect while the mechanism through which dgbe inhibits the adsorption of pfos and pfoa remains to be investigated this result suggests that the effect of dgbe on the fate and transport of pfas in the subsurface should be considered as dgbe is an important component of many afff formulations benzene and tce suppressed pfos adsorption but had no effect or slightly enhanced pfoa adsorption suggesting that the effect of benzene and tce could be specific to each pfas class of pfas because benzene tce and other non fluorinated contaminants could comingle with pfas in the groundwater at afff impacted sites additional research is needed to investigate their effect on the retention and breakthrough of pfas in cac barriers by carefully controlling the ionic strength and the concentration of ca2 in the reaction solution it was observed in this study that these two solution parameters enhanced the adsorption of pfos and pfoa on cac as such cac barriers at coastal sites or at sites where the concentration of ca2 in groundwater is high may have greater longevity whether ionic strength and ca2 also have a positive effect on the adsorption of other pfas by cac remains to be investigated the effect of other multivalent cations e g mg2 al3 fe3 on the adsorption of pfas by cac also should be studied it should be noted that the findings presented above concern the adsorption of pfas on plumestop cac whether these findings extend to

14629,frequent occurrence of trace organic contaminants in aquatic environments such as sulfonamide antibiotics in rivers receiving reclaimed water is concerning natural attenuation by soil and sediment is increasingly relied upon in the case of riverbank filtration for water purification the reliability of antibiotic attenuation has been called into question due to incomplete understanding of their degradation processes this study investigated influence of substrates and redox evolution along infiltration path on biotransformation of sulfonamides eight sand columns length 28 cm with a riverbed sediment layer at 3 8 cm were fed by groundwater sourced tap water spiked with 1 μg l of sulfadiazine sdz sulfamethazine smz and sulfamethoxazole smx each with or without amendments of dissolved organic carbon 5 mg c l of 1 1 yeast and humics or ammonium 5 mg n l two flow rates were tested over 120 days 0 5 ml min and 0 1 ml min iron reducing conditions persisted in all columns for 27 days during the initial high flow period due to respiration of sediment organics evolving to less reducing conditions until the subsequent low flow period to resume more reducing conditions with surplus substrates the spatial and temporal patterns of redox conditions differentiated among columns the removal of sdz and smz in effluents was usually low 15 11 even with carbon addition 14 9 increasing to 33 23 with ammonium addition by contrast smx removal was higher and more consistent among columns 46 21 with the maximum of 64 9 under iron reducing conditions when sulfonamide removal was compared between columns for the same redox zones during infiltration their enhancements were always associated with the availability of dissolved or particulate substrates suggesting co metabolism manipulation of the exposure time to optimal redox conditions with substrate amendments rather than to simply prolong the overall residence time is recommended for nature based solutions to tackle target antibiotics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reclaimed water trace organic contaminant co metabolism redox condition nature based solution managed aquifer recharge 1 introduction reclaimed water or effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtps is a promising water resource for multiple reuse purposes however concerns are rising regarding the impact of reclaimed water reuse on aquatic ecosystems as trace organic contaminants including antibiotics are not fully removed by wwtps christou et al 2017 oberoi et al 2019 discharge of residual antibiotics can increase antibiotic resistance of indigenous microorganisms in the environment pruden 2014 which is likely encountered during both managed and un managed aquifer recharge many european cities have historically relied on riverbank filtration for water supply though uncertain fate of trace organic contaminants has led to consideration of expensive treatment of recovered water hellauer et al 2017 reclaimed water to restore flow in dried river channels in regions suffering from water scarcity like the north china plain zhu and dou 2018 means that infiltration of such contaminants from surface to subsurface environments is occurring and the risk of disturbing the ecological balance of natural systems is alarming ma et al 2015 pruden 2014 during riverbed infiltration or riverbank filtration conventional contaminants such as dissolved organic carbon doc and inorganic nitrogen species in polluted river water can be reliably removed hu et al 2016 lansdown et al 2014 munz et al 2019 shebl et al 2022 however natural attenuation of antibiotics is challenging due to their biotoxicity and high persistence henzler et al 2014 infiltration or recharge process is characterized with steep chemical gradients where redox conditions may change from oxic to nitrate no3 reducing or iron fe reducing conditions within centimeters vertically wang et al 2020 contributing to inconsistent and sometimes contradictory field based observations of redox dependent antibiotic degradation schaper et al 2018 wiese et al 2011 to investigate antibiotic attenuation during infiltration process laboratory column experiments have been conducted to evaluate effects of various environmental conditions and different types of antibiotics baumgarten et al 2011 rauch williams et al 2010 zhao et al 2022 previous experiments have found that surplus substrates in reclaimed water enhanced the removal of trace antibiotics possibly by serveing as co substrates to degrade micropollutants rauch williams et al 2010 however even in well controlled laboratory columns it remains challenging to distinguish influences between substrates and redox conditions because they are closely linked during infiltration process rudolf von rohr et al 2014 schaffer et al 2015 therefore there is a need for column studies that not only can mimic the natural redox gradients encountered at field sites but also allow for identifying the individual contributions of frequently coupled factors such as substrates and redox conditions to address the efficacy of antibiotics removal during river infiltration this study investigated influences of substrates on degradation of trace sulfonamides across a wide range of redox conditions long term column experiments were conducted with detailed documentation of the spatial and temporal evolution of redox state three sulfonamides including sulfamethoxazole smx sulfamethazine smz and sulfadiazine sdz were included due to their wide occurrences in surface water and to some extent groundwater ma et al 2015 frequently reported metabolites of smx biodegradation rodríguez escales and sanchez vila 2016 were also monitored a surplus of doc with mixed yeast and humic acids to mimic complex dissolved organic matter in reclaimed water receiving rivers or ammonium nh4 was tested because both substrates can promote antibiotic biodegradation rauch williams et al 2010 zhao et al 2022 further experiments employed two flow rates at 0 5 and 0 1 ml min respectively to probe substrate availability for a prolonged column residence time removal performance in each redox zone including oxic suboxic defined as do below 10 µm murray and yakushev 2006 no3 reducing and fe reducing conditions was individually evaluated then compared with each other and with degradation kinetics in literature table s5 implications on sulfonamide removal using nature based solutions were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 column experiment eight columns were set up in the laboratory to simulate infiltration of reclaimed water to the shallow aquifer focusing on the attenuation of sulfonamide antibiotics all columns were packed with riverbed sediments collected at the hehe site of the beiyun river in suburban beijing which receives effluents from urban and industrial wwtps total organic carbon content toc of dry weight of sediments was 0 49 and ph was 7 13 more sediment information in ma et al 2021 thickness of the sediment layer in columns was 5 cm with a 2 cm layer of coarse sands 1 2 2 0 mm on the top to prevent floating of fine particles fig 1 under the riverbed sediments a 20 cm layer of fine sands 0 1 0 2 mm was added to mimic the shallow sandy aquifer underneath natural river channels both coarse and fine sands were autoclaved twice before experiments and the columns were wet packed to avoid capture of air bubbles all columns were operated under identical conditions in the dark at room temperature 20 c with the only difference being influent composition table 1 four influent conditions were tested including sed1 2 with no sulfonamide antibiotics as control sed a1 2 with amendments of three sulfonamides sed a c1 2 with sulfonamides and extra doc 1 1 mixture of yeast extract humic acids and sed a n1 2 with sulfonamides and extra nh4 the influent was composed of two solutions solution 1 was danish tap water sourced from groundwater and spiked with phosphorus as a supplementary micronutrient solution 2 was a mixture of sulfonamides with or without primary substrates except for sed1 2 being only tap water after mixing influents were fed to the column continuously from the top to the bottom the final influent concentrations of each sulfonamide doc nh4 and p were 1 μg l 5 mg l 5 mg n l and 0 5 mg l comparable to levels observed for the beiyun river water before introducing the influent a tracer test was conducted in two random columns to assess hydraulic conditions fig s1 sed a1 2 a conservative tracer

tricarb 5110tr perkinelmer the tracer test was repeated in four columns at the end of experiments the effective porosity of columns was not significantly different before 0 43 0 01 and after the 120 day experiment 0 42 0 03 though the longitudinal dispersivity increased from 0 3 to 0 4 cm robbins 1983 overall the average hydraulic retention time was 14 h at the flow rate of 0 5 ml min during the 120 day experiment two scenarios of flow rate were tested with a high rate of 0 5 ml min day 0 100 residence time 14 h and a low rate of 0 1 ml min day 101 120 residence time 62 h the rates were chosen considering the on site measured riverbed infiltration rate from 1 1 10 4 to 2 3 10 4 cm s equivalent to 0 2 to 0 5 ml min for the cross sectional area of 34 2 cm2 of the columns the operation was further divided into three periods considering variations of column effluents including the hf fe period the hf period and the lf period for day 0 27 day 28 100 and day 101 120 respectively table 1 to maintain a steady flow rate the height of effluent ports was adjusted manually once the overlying water started to accumulate probably due to sediment clogging the depth of the overlying water

results 3 1 substrate consumption and sulfonamide removal in column effluents during three periods the effluent concentrations of primary substrates doc and nh4 and sulfonamide antibiotics were compared with those of the influents to evaluate substrate consumption and sulfonamide removal in columns the columns were run at a high flow hf then a low flow lf rate during the first part of the hf period mg l levels of fe were measured in all effluents herein referred to as the hf fe period fig 2 results are described below for the hf fe hf and lf periods table 1 3 1 1 consumption of primary substrates except for sed a c columns concentrations of effluent doc were not significantly different from influent doc concentrations 2 4 0 6 mg l table 1 during the initial hf fe period sed a c columns with yeast and humic acid addition displayed higher doc in effluents 4 1 1 3 mg l while the added c appeared to be consumed completely during the subsequent hf and lf periods because effluent doc decreased to 2 1 0 1 mg l table 1 differences in several optical indices of effluent doc revealed changes in the doc quality suggesting differences in labile carbon consumption among columns table s2 for instance the effluents of sed and sed a columns showed an increasing degree of humification and a continuous consumption of protein like components over time increasing hix and decreasing fmax4 table s2 but these trends were less obvious in the effluents of sed a c and sed a n columns effluent nh4 levels were below 0 3 mg n l in all columns except for sed a n the nh4 addition in sed a n influents led to high effluent concentrations of 3 5 0 3 mg n l during the hf fe period decreasing to 1 1 1 0 mg n l and then to 0 4 0 4 mg n l at the end of the experiment possibly due to the slow enrichment of autotrophic nitrifiers fig 4b consistent with this was a significant no3 accumulation observed in sed a n effluents 0 5 2 1 mg n l in contrast effluent no3 was low in all other columns 0 3 mg n l 3 1 2 from fe reducing to diverse redox suboxic oxic no3 reducing states despite the oxygen saturated influents effluents for all eight columns contained no detectable do but 2 0 3 0 mg l dissolved fe during the initial four weeks the hf fe period do 0 02 mg l fig 2 the fe reducing condition lasted longer to day 45 in sed a c effluents for the rest of the high flow period effluent fe decreased to 0 2 mg l in all columns and effluent do increased from 0 02 to 0 2 1 6 mg l in sed sed a and sed a c columns suggesting a gradual transition to oxic conditions towards the end of the hf period the only exception was sed a n columns where effluent do remained 0 02 mg l and effluent no3 reached 2 1 1 7 mg n l no3 reducing conditions table 1 likely due to more oxygen consumption by nh4 oxidation for the last lf period effluents contained low do with little dissolved fe or no3 except for sed a n columns where effluents continued to display no3 around 2 mg n l 3 1 3 low removal of sdz and smz neither sulfonamides nor their metabolites were detected in the effluents of tap water fed columns sed1 2 fig 2 in antibiotic fed columns the removal of sdz and smz was generally below 24 throughout the three periods but it increased significantly to 35 50 in sed a n columns towards the end of the hf period and lasted through the lf period table 1 overall effluent sdz and smz displayed similar trends over time their removal was comparable between duplicate columns though the last part of the hf period saw large variabilities between two sed a n1 2 columns fig 2 3 1 4 high to low removal of smx substantial smx removal was observed in all columns during the hf fe period 60 fig 2 however there were differences in the production of smx metabolites table 1 fig s3 of the three frequently reported degradation metabolites dea smx was the highest reaching up to 160 ng l in sed a n effluents intermediate in sed a c effluents but not detected in sed a effluents nit smx and ammet in effluents were barely detected 20 ng l notably corresponding to the waning of fe reducing condition and the onset of less reducing conditions smx removal clearly declined in all columns during the rest of hf and throughout lf periods 26 48 towards the end of the hf period smx removal also displayed variabilities between the two sed a n1 2 columns similar to variabilities observed for sdz and smz removal fig 2 concentrations of smx metabolites decreased with time in effluents and were no longer detected during the lf period in any columns the sum of the three metabolites in effluents 0 2 μg l was far below the amount of smx removed 0 46 0 21 μg l suggesting that unknown metabolites were likely present 3 2 depth zonation of redox sulfonamide removal and microbial mass demarcated by sediments 3 2 1 consumption of added c and n mainly occurred in the top sand layer with overlying water abs254 a proxy for doc concentration mrkva 1983 displayed the largest decreases in the top sand layer for sed a c columns 0 3 cm including overlying water fig 3 this was interpreted to indicate that the utilization of the added c substrates was more pronounced in top sands although doc consumption appeared to continue in the sediment layer especially in the earlier days day 19 of the hf fe period and day 46 of the hf period fig 3 in sed a n columns nh4 was also mostly removed in the top sand layer concomitant with the fast depletion of do and the accumulation of no3 fig 3 the added nh4 evolved from 4 mg n l in effluents on day 5 fig s2 to being completely oxidized in top sands on days 112 and 120 fig 3 associated with the built up of no3 in top sands denitrification intensified with time in the sediment layer of sed a n columns 3 2 2 the sediment layer separated an oxic zone from a more reducing zone all columns started oxygen saturated at the very top due to access to air 0 cm fig 3 the steepest redox gradients during infiltration occurred across the sediment layer between 3 8 cm depth from oxic to reducing conditions albeit the extent of reducing conditions evolved differently over time for different columns it is worth noting that the top sands in sed a n columns also developed significant redox stratification with rapid nh4 oxidation and concurrent oxygen consumption as a result the sediments underwent denitrification corresponding to undetectable do throughout the experiment sampled across the sediment layer during the three periods the do no3 and fe data showed that sed a n columns displayed the most reducing conditions followed by sed a c columns and then by the least reducing sed and sed a columns in columns without c or n substrate additions do even broke through sediments towards the end of the hf period days 91 and 98 fig 3 suggesting that oxygen consumption was limited by the slow diagenesis of sediment organic matters when the residence time increased in the lf period days 112 and 120 the bottom sediment returned to more reducing conditions suboxic presumably because the supply of electron donors by sediments could catch up the demand of oxygen consumption 3 2 3 limited removal of sdz and smz occurred mostly in top sands sampled at different column depths over the experiments fig 3 sulfonamide profiles showed that the removal of sdz and smz occurred primarily in the top sand layer 14 20 and was low in both the sediment layer 5 12 and the bottom sand layer 4 13 their highest removal reached 70 in top sands of sed a n columns towards the end of the hf period day 98 further with added n discernable removal was also observed in the sediment layer and bottom sands e g 25 removal on days 91 112 and 120 on day 91 the removal was different for two duplicate sed a n1 2 columns n related processes such as nitrification and denitrification likely played a role in sulfonamide degradation processes discussion 4 1 4 2 3 2 4 most smx removal occurred in sediments with production of unknown metabolites in contrast to little removal of sdz and smz in sediments smx was mostly removed in the sediment layer 24 23 fig 3 followed by the top sand layer 17 14 and then the bottom sand layer 1 13 the most pronounced smx removal occurred in the sediment layer of all columns on day 19 56 16 likely owing to the high dissolved fe concentrations at this time discussion 4 3 during the subsequent hf and lf periods without fe reducing conditions smx removal occurred more evenly across top sands and sediments but exhibited great variabilities which were also reflected by the three measured smx metabolites fig s3 the production of dea smx ammet and nit smx were the highest in sed a n columns especially in top sands where each metabolite reached up to 150 ng l while only dea smx was detected in sed a c columns 70 ng l and sed a columns 40 ng l concentrations of the main metabolite dea smx appeared to increase with that of no2 within 0 1 mg n l then stayed high up to 3 mg n l no2 fig s4 further metabolite concentrations in sediment layers were much higher than those in effluents indicating continued biotransformation of metabolites moving downward in columns for the top sand layer smx removal of sed a columns was always the lowest compared to those of sed a n and sed a c columns suggesting that utilization of primary substrates appears to be a prerequisite for smx degradation 3 2 5 higher biomass but lower microbial diversity in sediments than sands sampled on day 120 at the end of the experiment column sediments contained comparable biomass to the initial riverbed sediments represented by 16s rrna gene copies per gram of solid table 2 despite sterilization prior to experimentation both top and bottom sands developed microbial communities although their biomass densities were 10 100 times lower than that of sediments table s4 measures for the community structure including microbial richness chao and ace shannon diversity and evenness were not significantly different between top and bottom sediments indeed these indices were slightly higher for top sands and the highest for bottom sands table 2 the oligotrophic bottom sand layer displayed a low biomass density but a high community diversity compared to the eutrophic top sand layer during column infiltration in line with the observations of other laboratory columns simulating aquifer recharge process li et al 2013 microbial compositions in both top and bottom sediment samples n 15 shifted from the initial sediments n 3 fig 4a with notable decreases in the relative abundance of several obligate anaerobes such as clostridiales 23 7 to 5 6 and a remarkable increase of aerobes or facultative anaerobes such as bacillales 1 to 25 15 although variabilities were evident among the eight columns fig s6 further microbial community of top sands n 3 displayed a high degree of similarity to that of column sediments except for the two samples from sed a n columns with nh4 addition top sands were enriched with ammonia oxidizing bacteria nitrosomonas spp fig s7 bottom sand samples at the end of the experiment n 15 possessed the most diverse communities overall microbial composition for each depth was not significantly different between columns especially for sed sed a and sed a c columns pairwise permutation manovas p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 sulfonamide removal enhanced by carbon utilization and ammonia oxidation an important feature during river water infiltration is that the redox states often change from oxic conditions at the surface to a range of reducing conditions in the subsurface wang et al 2020 this evolution of redox conditions was encountered in our column experiments fig 3 specifically besides substrates in the source water respiration of sediment organic matter results in oxygen depletion during infiltration followed by denitrification and mn fe reduction kedziorek et al 2008 rudolf von rohr et al 2014 for ease of illustrating the redox dependent removal of sdz smz and smx removal percentages were grouped for top sands sediments and bottom sands fig 5 according to the relevant redox conditions detailed in fig 3 because sulfonamide removal by sorption is negligible in aquifer sands and river sediments bertelkamp et al 2014 ma et al 2021 effects of different substrates on biodegradation of trace sulfonamides were evaluated as follows by comparing columns with and without substrate addition smx removal in top sands was much higher in sed a c columns 26 9 oxic conditions fig 5a than that in sed a columns 4 7 oxic conditions suggesting that its degradation was accelerated by the utilization of added yeast extract and humic acids given that residence time in the top sand layer was 2 h during high flow periods 14 h for the entire column half lives of smx oxic degradation in top sands were estimated to be 0 1 0 2 days and 0 4 9 days for sed a c and sed a columns assuming the first order kinetics table s5 organic matters 7 mg c l in treated wastewater stimulated microbial activities and probably promoted the co metabolic degradation of micropollutants during column infiltration rauch williams et al 2010 the possibility of co metabolic smx biodegradation in surface waters is also supported by experiments lim et al 2008 showing that the removal was enhanced by adding ppm levels of degradable doc from aquatic plant extracts sediment organic matter likely acted as alternative primary substrates for micropollutant co metabolism and enhanced smx degradation as its removal in the oxic sediment layer of sed a columns 16 4 fig 5b was significantly higher than that in oxic top sands 4 7 for sediments under oxic to suboxic conditions the removal reached 23 20 with a maximum of 60 in sed a and sed a c columns microbial respiration in sediments was mainly sustained by bioavailable particulate organics because even in sed a c columns only a small fraction of added c infiltrated into this layer 3 8 cm depth fig 3 at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min oxygen saturated influents supplied 6 mg of o2 per day over the 120 day experiment in columns without extra substrates fed sediment organics provided an equivalent of 234 mg l labile carbon accounting for 14 of initial sediment toc 0 5 of dry weight the oligotrophic bottom sands by and large displayed a low removal 3 13 apart from a slightly higher removal under no3 reducing conditions 10 18 discussion 4 2 in turn highlighting the crucial role of substrates favoring sulfonamide removal notably the removal of sdz and smz was low in both top sands and sediments of the sed a and sed a c columns mean 10 fig 5 it appears that their removal did not respond to c addition or sediment organics under oxic conditions likely due to different degradation pathways with structural differences chen and xie 2018 our data support that nh4 oxidation enhanced the degradation of all three sulfonamides as their removal by top sands was significantly higher in sed a n columns 24 23 fig 5a than that in sed a columns 4 7 it corresponded to the proliferation of nitrifiers to 10 of top sand biomass fig 4b and the estimated half life of first order degradation 0 1 0 3 days during high flow periods was comparable to other nitrifier enriched systems table s5 ammonia monooxygenase amo a key enzyme for ammonia oxidation has been shown to support co metabolic degradation of micropollutants including sulfonamides other pharmaceuticals and pesticides kassotaki et al 2016 yu et al 2018 similarly as observed in sand columns simulating the first meter of riverbank infiltration zhao et al 2022 ammonia oxidizing bacteria comprised 0 2 5 9 of total community and the removal of 32 micropollutants including sulfisoxazole and sulfathiazole significantly decreased upon the inhibition of amo in addition production of dea smx was the highest among the three measured metabolites especially in sed a n top sands fig s3 suggesting deamination as a key biotransformation reaction likewise deaminases also contributed to sulfonamide degradation by nitrifiers zhou et al 2019 taken together this study expands the evidence for improved biodegradation of trace antibiotics by microbial growth substrates at concentrations likely to be encountered in natural aquatic systems especially rivers receiving wwtp effluents it is worth noting that the removal trends of smx sdz and smz were similar in top sands sediments and bottom sands of sed a n columns suggesting that the three sulfonamides likely shared the same degradation pathways when coupled to the nitrification denitrification cycle in contrast addition of yeast extract and humic acids appears to have only accelerated the degradation of smx but not sdz and smz 4 2 degradation and retrosynthesis of sulfonamides coupled to denitrification reactions reversibility in sulfonamide degradation under no3 reducing conditions has been previously reported barbieri et al 2012 nödler et al 2012 this is the reason for large variabilities in the removal percentage of three sulfonamides in sed a n columns fig 5 this reversibility was also likely responsible for the declining removal in sed a n top sands from high flow periods 36 21 fig s5 to the low flow period 1 11 at a lower flow rate on days 112 and 120 a longer residence time in top sands led to not only the improved utilization of nh4 but also prolonged anoxic conditions at the bottom of top sands with no3 exceeding 8 mg n l correspondingly reductive transformation from reversible metabolites to parent sulfonamides likely occurred within 1 3 cm depth figs 3 s3 lowering the net removal of sulfonamides in batch tests to remove sdz smz and smx by the same river sediments ma et al 2021 sulfonamide degradation occurred rapidly with a half life of 0 7 days under denitrifying conditions however the kinetics of retrosynthesis reactions were poorly constrained closely monitoring smx degradation in batch experiments incubated with aquifer sediments barbieri et al 2012 suggested that the kinetics of degradation and retrosynthesis might be of the same order of magnitude under denitrifying conditions with 90 of 1 μg l smx degraded in three days but recovered to 75 over five days in the sediment layer of sed a n columns the net removal of three sulfonamides was low during high flow periods 6 17 fig s5 likely due to the short residence time around 0 1 days however the removal remained low 13 16 during the low flow period with a prolonged residence time of 0 5 days which might have involved fast retrosynthesis reactions 4 3 rapid degradation of smx in sediments under fe reducing conditions in the sediment layer of all antibiotic fed columns under fe reducing conditions fig 5b much higher smx removal 56 16 than those of sdz and smz 10 is worth highlighting this study conducted with river sediments and μg l sulfonamides expands the findings of mohatt et al 2011 that mg l levels of isoxazole containing chemicals including smx sulfisoxazole and 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole were favorably degraded in soil microcosms under fe reducing conditions during the hf fe period 50 of 1 μg l smx was removed in the sediment layer with an approximate retention time of 3 h and the estimated half life was 0 03 0 07 days based on the first order degradation kinetics table s5 in soil microcosms mohatt et al 2011 95 of 6 mg l smx was removed within 12 h under fe reducing conditions while it took 5 14 and 40 days under sulfate reducing aerobic and no3 reducing conditions therefore both studies found that smx dissipated rapidly we are not aware of field experiments that have investigated kinetics of smx degradation under fe reducing conditions but schaper et al 2018 observed a rapid decrease of ppb levels of smx in the hyporheic zone of an urban river with redox states spanning from no3 reducing to fe mn reducing conditions and the half life was estimated as 0 3 0 2 days based on quasi steady state depth profiles within 20 cm of streambeds based on the zero smx dissipation in fe ii only solutions and a rapid removal in suspensions containing both fe ii and goethite mohatt et al 2011 suggested that adsorbed fe ii on mineral surfaces was a stronger reductant than dissolved fe ii and that smx degradation under fe reducing conditions was abiotic however this abiotic degradation might have been mediated indirectly by microbial processes because fe ii species were generated by dissimilatory fe reducing microbes and organic substrates such as sediment organic matter were necessary electron donors lovley and phillips 1986 it is worth noting that during the hf fe periods smx was hardly removed in column bottom sands 2 5 fig 5c despite of fe reducing conditions and possible fe ii adsorption on sand surface fig 3 thus this observation does not support that the degradation of ppb levels of smx with fe ii is a purely abiotic process the limited availability of labile substrates or the low abundance of fe reducers likely hampered the smx degradation in bottom sands 4 4 implications for sulfonamide removal enhancements using nature based solutions engineered biological wastewater treatments are usually not effective in antibiotic removal for example smx removal in activated sludge processes ranged from zero to 64 with a typical hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 30 h chen and xie 2018 high removal has been achieved in laboratory reactors containing high levels of primary substrates in sequencing batch nitrifying reactors when influent nh4 was 1000 mg n l 85 of 100 μg l sdz was removed at a hrt of 24 h wang et al 2020 in another sequencing batch reactor when influent cod was 600 mg l 86 of 10 mg l smx was removed at a hrt of 10 h guo et al 2017 relevant to nature based solutions such as riverbank filtration and soil aquifer treatment these findings suggest two approaches to enhance the attenuation of wastewater sourced micropollutants including substrate supplement and residence time regulation given that nature based solutions with larger physical footprints allow for longer hydraulic retention time than human engineered systems the implication of our finding that ppm levels of substrates can accelerate sulfonamide degradation is that residual doc and ammonium in reclaimed water can be utilized to enhance natural attenuation of antibiotics although we recognize that field conditions are more complex thus this requires validation by field tests lim et al 2008 found a positive correlation between the amount of biodegradable doc in wwtp effluents and the biodegradation rate of some micropollutants in effluent dominated surface waters indicating that upgrading wwtps to decrease effluent doc might not favor the subsequent micropollutant removal in this study substrate poor bottom sands corresponded with negligible sulfonamide removal fig 5c further highlighting the importance of substrate availability as oligotrophic conditions are frequently encountered in sandy aquifer systems goldscheider et al 2006 and the biomass is usually 10 100 times lower than that in surface waters pedersen 2000 it stands to reason that sandy aquifers are not well equipped to promote micropollutant biodegradation there is no guarantee that these emerging contaminants will be naturally purified just by extending subsurface travel time solutions of installing reactive barriers to supply extra substrates have shown promise as in sand columns simulating managed aquifer recharge smx removal increased from 20 to 60 80 with the establishment of compost barriers modrzyński et al 2021 yet rauch williams et al 2010 observed that a specialized microbial community well adapted to oligotrophic conditions was also effective in removing micropollutants in presence of low doc regnery et al 2016 further found that the attenuation of less degradable organic compounds including sulfonamides was enhanced under oxic and carbon depleted conditions established by sequential managed aquifer recharge i e a short riverbank filtration passage followed by subsequent re aeration and artificial recharge however the involved specific microbes and functional enzymes under starving conditions are still poorly understood hellauer et al 2019 further research regarding the role of indigenous microbial communities spanning from surface to oligotrophic subsurface environments in micropollutant degradation is needed during aquifer recharge including riverbank filtration the residence time or hrt affects the removal of both conventional pollutants including doc no3 and sulfate rudolf von rohr et al 2014 shebl et al 2022 and emerging micropollutants including antibiotics this study although hrt of our columns was shorter than those reported in the literature table s5 the kinetics of sulfonamide removal appeared to be comparable for similar redox conditions presumably a longer hrt will increase the overall removal efficiency in our study total removal of the three sulfonamides was 20 in the oxic sediment layer with a hrt of 3 11 h while it reached 36 53 within 48 h in oxic batch tests with the same sediments and no extra carbon addition ma et al 2021 similarly smx removal reached 60 in oxic columns with a long hrt of several days baumgarten et al 2011 regnery et al 2015 it is worth noting that increasing hrt in columns by lowering the flow rate also significantly changed the redox zonation and in turn the sulfonamide removal fig 3 as often observed in the field where hrt and redox conditions are frequently inter related manipulating residence time during aquifer storage by increasing travel distances will also need to cope with different reducing conditions developed during subsurface horizontal flow a lesson learned is that to model the reactive transport of antibiotics at surface water infiltration sites redox dependent kinetics during recharge processes should be considered 5 conclusions long term laboratory column experiments conducted to simulate the natural attenuation of sulfonamide antibiotics during riverbed infiltration found the enhancement of removal of sdz smz and smx by dissolved and particulate substrates these substrates ppm levels of doc or inorganic nitrogen in reclaimed water and sediment organic carbon favored sulfonamide removal indicating co metabolic degradation by heterotrophs or autotrophic nitrifiers three sulfonamides likely shared similar biotransformation pathways under nitrifying and denitrifying no3 reducing conditions but only smx degraded rapidly under fe reducing conditions steep redox gradients developing over a depth interval of several centimeters in riverbed sediments of all columns a condition also frequently encountered at field sites were found to influence the removal efficacy of antibiotics significantly by contrast sulfonamide removal in bottom sands was always low regardless of redox conditions due to limited availability of substrates and low biomass relevant to nature based solutions for water purification supplementation of substrates during infiltration process and regulation of the exposure time to

14629,frequent occurrence of trace organic contaminants in aquatic environments such as sulfonamide antibiotics in rivers receiving reclaimed water is concerning natural attenuation by soil and sediment is increasingly relied upon in the case of riverbank filtration for water purification the reliability of antibiotic attenuation has been called into question due to incomplete understanding of their degradation processes this study investigated influence of substrates and redox evolution along infiltration path on biotransformation of sulfonamides eight sand columns length 28 cm with a riverbed sediment layer at 3 8 cm were fed by groundwater sourced tap water spiked with 1 μg l of sulfadiazine sdz sulfamethazine smz and sulfamethoxazole smx each with or without amendments of dissolved organic carbon 5 mg c l of 1 1 yeast and humics or ammonium 5 mg n l two flow rates were tested over 120 days 0 5 ml min and 0 1 ml min iron reducing conditions persisted in all columns for 27 days during the initial high flow period due to respiration of sediment organics evolving to less reducing conditions until the subsequent low flow period to resume more reducing conditions with surplus substrates the spatial and temporal patterns of redox conditions differentiated among columns the removal of sdz and smz in effluents was usually low 15 11 even with carbon addition 14 9 increasing to 33 23 with ammonium addition by contrast smx removal was higher and more consistent among columns 46 21 with the maximum of 64 9 under iron reducing conditions when sulfonamide removal was compared between columns for the same redox zones during infiltration their enhancements were always associated with the availability of dissolved or particulate substrates suggesting co metabolism manipulation of the exposure time to optimal redox conditions with substrate amendments rather than to simply prolong the overall residence time is recommended for nature based solutions to tackle target antibiotics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reclaimed water trace organic contaminant co metabolism redox condition nature based solution managed aquifer recharge 1 introduction reclaimed water or effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtps is a promising water resource for multiple reuse purposes however concerns are rising regarding the impact of reclaimed water reuse on aquatic ecosystems as trace organic contaminants including antibiotics are not fully removed by wwtps christou et al 2017 oberoi et al 2019 discharge of residual antibiotics can increase antibiotic resistance of indigenous microorganisms in the environment pruden 2014 which is likely encountered during both managed and un managed aquifer recharge many european cities have historically relied on riverbank filtration for water supply though uncertain fate of trace organic contaminants has led to consideration of expensive treatment of recovered water hellauer et al 2017 reclaimed water to restore flow in dried river channels in regions suffering from water scarcity like the north china plain zhu and dou 2018 means that infiltration of such contaminants from surface to subsurface environments is occurring and the risk of disturbing the ecological balance of natural systems is alarming ma et al 2015 pruden 2014 during riverbed infiltration or riverbank filtration conventional contaminants such as dissolved organic carbon doc and inorganic nitrogen species in polluted river water can be reliably removed hu et al 2016 lansdown et al 2014 munz et al 2019 shebl et al 2022 however natural attenuation of antibiotics is challenging due to their biotoxicity and high persistence henzler et al 2014 infiltration or recharge process is characterized with steep chemical gradients where redox conditions may change from oxic to nitrate no3 reducing or iron fe reducing conditions within centimeters vertically wang et al 2020 contributing to inconsistent and sometimes contradictory field based observations of redox dependent antibiotic degradation schaper et al 2018 wiese et al 2011 to investigate antibiotic attenuation during infiltration process laboratory column experiments have been conducted to evaluate effects of various environmental conditions and different types of antibiotics baumgarten et al 2011 rauch williams et al 2010 zhao et al 2022 previous experiments have found that surplus substrates in reclaimed water enhanced the removal of trace antibiotics possibly by serveing as co substrates to degrade micropollutants rauch williams et al 2010 however even in well controlled laboratory columns it remains challenging to distinguish influences between substrates and redox conditions because they are closely linked during infiltration process rudolf von rohr et al 2014 schaffer et al 2015 therefore there is a need for column studies that not only can mimic the natural redox gradients encountered at field sites but also allow for identifying the individual contributions of frequently coupled factors such as substrates and redox conditions to address the efficacy of antibiotics removal during river infiltration this study investigated influences of substrates on degradation of trace sulfonamides across a wide range of redox conditions long term column experiments were conducted with detailed documentation of the spatial and temporal evolution of redox state three sulfonamides including sulfamethoxazole smx sulfamethazine smz and sulfadiazine sdz were included due to their wide occurrences in surface water and to some extent groundwater ma et al 2015 frequently reported metabolites of smx biodegradation rodríguez escales and sanchez vila 2016 were also monitored a surplus of doc with mixed yeast and humic acids to mimic complex dissolved organic matter in reclaimed water receiving rivers or ammonium nh4 was tested because both substrates can promote antibiotic biodegradation rauch williams et al 2010 zhao et al 2022 further experiments employed two flow rates at 0 5 and 0 1 ml min respectively to probe substrate availability for a prolonged column residence time removal performance in each redox zone including oxic suboxic defined as do below 10 µm murray and yakushev 2006 no3 reducing and fe reducing conditions was individually evaluated then compared with each other and with degradation kinetics in literature table s5 implications on sulfonamide removal using nature based solutions were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 column experiment eight columns were set up in the laboratory to simulate infiltration of reclaimed water to the shallow aquifer focusing on the attenuation of sulfonamide antibiotics all columns were packed with riverbed sediments collected at the hehe site of the beiyun river in suburban beijing which receives effluents from urban and industrial wwtps total organic carbon content toc of dry weight of sediments was 0 49 and ph was 7 13 more sediment information in ma et al 2021 thickness of the sediment layer in columns was 5 cm with a 2 cm layer of coarse sands 1 2 2 0 mm on the top to prevent floating of fine particles fig 1 under the riverbed sediments a 20 cm layer of fine sands 0 1 0 2 mm was added to mimic the shallow sandy aquifer underneath natural river channels both coarse and fine sands were autoclaved twice before experiments and the columns were wet packed to avoid capture of air bubbles all columns were operated under identical conditions in the dark at room temperature 20 c with the only difference being influent composition table 1 four influent conditions were tested including sed1 2 with no sulfonamide antibiotics as control sed a1 2 with amendments of three sulfonamides sed a c1 2 with sulfonamides and extra doc 1 1 mixture of yeast extract humic acids and sed a n1 2 with sulfonamides and extra nh4 the influent was composed of two solutions solution 1 was danish tap water sourced from groundwater and spiked with phosphorus as a supplementary micronutrient solution 2 was a mixture of sulfonamides with or without primary substrates except for sed1 2 being only tap water after mixing influents were fed to the column continuously from the top to the bottom the final influent concentrations of each sulfonamide doc nh4 and p were 1 μg l 5 mg l 5 mg n l and 0 5 mg l comparable to levels observed for the beiyun river water before introducing the influent a tracer test was conducted in two random columns to assess hydraulic conditions fig s1 sed a1 2 a conservative tracer

tricarb 5110tr perkinelmer the tracer test was repeated in four columns at the end of experiments the effective porosity of columns was not significantly different before 0 43 0 01 and after the 120 day experiment 0 42 0 03 though the longitudinal dispersivity increased from 0 3 to 0 4 cm robbins 1983 overall the average hydraulic retention time was 14 h at the flow rate of 0 5 ml min during the 120 day experiment two scenarios of flow rate were tested with a high rate of 0 5 ml min day 0 100 residence time 14 h and a low rate of 0 1 ml min day 101 120 residence time 62 h the rates were chosen considering the on site measured riverbed infiltration rate from 1 1 10 4 to 2 3 10 4 cm s equivalent to 0 2 to 0 5 ml min for the cross sectional area of 34 2 cm2 of the columns the operation was further divided into three periods considering variations of column effluents including the hf fe period the hf period and the lf period for day 0 27 day 28 100 and day 101 120 respectively table

dada2 which outputs the abundance of error corrected amplicon sequence variants asvs callahan et al 2016 taxonomy classification of asvs was conducted by searching against the silva non redundant database release 132 further analyses were carried out in r packages phyloseq and ampvis2 andersen et al 2018 mcmurdie and holmes 2013 sequence data are available in ncbi under accession number prjna974252 except for some sand samples with very little dna content microbial communities were evaluated using indices of richness chao and ace shannon s diversity and microbial evenness differences between these indices were assessed using kruskal wallis analysis of variance anova followed by a dunn s test with the holm bonferroni correction a nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis nmds was performed to evaluate differences across samples based on microbial community composition and significant differences pairwise permutation manovas were calculated using the r package rvaidememoire 3 results 3 1 substrate consumption and sulfonamide removal in column effluents during three periods the effluent concentrations of primary substrates doc and nh4 and sulfonamide antibiotics were compared with those of the influents to evaluate substrate consumption and sulfonamide removal in columns the columns were run at a high flow hf then a low flow lf rate during the first part of the hf period mg l levels of fe were measured in all effluents herein referred to as the hf fe period fig 2 results are described below for the hf fe hf and lf periods table 1 3 1 1 consumption of primary substrates except for sed a c columns concentrations of effluent doc were not significantly different from influent doc concentrations 2 4 0 6 mg l table 1 during the initial hf fe period sed a c columns with yeast and humic acid addition displayed higher doc in effluents 4 1 1 3 mg l while the added c appeared to be consumed completely during the subsequent hf and lf periods because effluent doc decreased to 2 1 0 1 mg l table 1 differences in several optical indices of effluent doc revealed changes in the doc quality suggesting differences in labile carbon consumption among columns table s2 for instance the effluents of sed and sed a columns showed an increasing degree of humification and a continuous consumption of protein like components over time increasing hix and decreasing fmax4 table s2 but these trends were less obvious in the effluents of sed a c and sed a n columns effluent nh4 levels were below 0 3 mg n l in all columns except for sed a n the nh4 addition in sed a n influents led to high effluent concentrations of 3 5 0 3 mg n l during the hf fe period decreasing to 1 1 1 0 mg n l and then to 0 4 0 4 mg n l at the end of the experiment possibly due to the slow enrichment of autotrophic nitrifiers fig 4b consistent with this was a significant no3 accumulation observed in sed a n effluents 0 5 2 1 mg n l in contrast effluent no3 was low in all other columns 0 3 mg n l 3 1 2 from fe reducing to diverse redox suboxic oxic no3 reducing states despite the oxygen saturated influents effluents for all eight columns contained no detectable do but 2 0 3 0 mg l dissolved fe during the initial four weeks the hf fe period do 0 02 mg l fig 2 the fe reducing condition lasted longer to day 45 in sed a c effluents for the rest of the high flow period effluent fe decreased to 0 2 mg l in all columns and effluent do increased from 0 02 to 0 2 1 6 mg l in sed sed a and sed a c columns suggesting a gradual transition to oxic conditions towards the end of the hf period the only exception was sed a n columns where effluent do remained 0 02 mg l and effluent no3 reached 2 1 1 7 mg n l no3 reducing conditions table 1 likely due to more oxygen consumption by nh4 oxidation for the last lf period effluents contained low do with little dissolved fe or no3 except for sed a n columns where effluents continued to display no3 around 2 mg n l 3 1 3 low removal of sdz and smz neither sulfonamides nor their metabolites were detected in the effluents of tap water fed columns sed1 2 fig 2 in antibiotic fed columns the removal of sdz and smz was generally below 24 throughout the three periods but it increased significantly to 35 50 in sed a n columns towards the end of the hf period and lasted through the lf period table 1 overall effluent sdz and smz displayed similar trends over time their removal was comparable between duplicate columns though the last part of the hf period saw large variabilities between two sed a n1 2 columns fig 2 3 1 4 high to low removal of smx substantial smx removal was observed in all columns during the hf fe period 60 fig 2 however there were differences in the production of smx metabolites table 1 fig s3 of the three frequently reported degradation metabolites dea smx was the highest reaching up to 160 ng l in sed a n effluents intermediate in sed a c effluents but not detected in sed a effluents nit smx and ammet in effluents were barely detected 20 ng l notably corresponding to the waning of fe reducing condition and the onset of less reducing conditions smx removal clearly declined in all columns during the rest of hf and throughout lf periods 26 48 towards the end of the hf period smx removal also displayed variabilities between the two sed a n1 2 columns similar to variabilities observed for sdz and smz removal fig 2 concentrations of smx metabolites decreased with time in effluents and were no longer detected during the lf period in any columns the sum of the three metabolites in effluents 0 2 μg l was far below the amount of smx removed 0 46 0 21 μg l suggesting that unknown metabolites were likely present 3 2 depth zonation of redox sulfonamide removal and microbial mass demarcated by sediments 3 2 1 consumption of added c and n mainly occurred in the top sand layer with overlying water abs254 a proxy for doc concentration mrkva 1983 displayed the largest decreases in the top sand layer for sed a c columns 0 3 cm including overlying water fig 3 this was interpreted to indicate that the utilization of the added c substrates was more pronounced in top sands although doc consumption appeared to continue in the sediment layer especially in the earlier days day 19 of the hf fe period and day 46 of the hf period fig 3 in sed a n columns nh4 was also mostly removed in the top sand layer concomitant with the fast depletion of do and the accumulation of no3 fig 3 the added nh4 evolved from 4 mg n l in effluents on day 5 fig s2 to being completely oxidized in top sands on days 112 and 120 fig 3 associated with the built up of no3 in top sands denitrification intensified with time in the sediment layer of sed a n columns 3 2 2 the sediment layer separated an oxic zone from a more reducing zone all columns started oxygen saturated at the very top due to access to air 0 cm fig 3 the steepest redox gradients during infiltration occurred across the sediment layer between 3 8 cm depth from oxic to reducing conditions albeit the extent of reducing conditions evolved differently over time for different columns it is worth noting that the top sands in sed a n columns also developed significant redox stratification with rapid nh4 oxidation and concurrent oxygen consumption as a result the sediments underwent denitrification corresponding to undetectable do throughout the experiment sampled across the sediment layer during the three periods the do no3 and fe data showed that sed a n columns displayed the most reducing conditions followed by sed a c columns and then by the least reducing sed and sed a columns in columns without c or n substrate additions do even broke through sediments towards the end of the hf period days 91 and 98 fig 3 suggesting that oxygen consumption was limited by the slow diagenesis of sediment organic matters when the residence time increased in the lf period days 112 and 120 the bottom sediment returned to more reducing conditions suboxic presumably because the supply of electron donors by sediments could catch up the demand of oxygen consumption 3 2 3 limited removal of sdz and smz occurred mostly in top sands sampled at different column depths over the experiments fig 3 sulfonamide profiles showed that the removal of sdz and smz occurred primarily in the top sand layer 14 20 and was low in both the sediment layer 5 12 and the bottom sand layer 4 13 their highest removal reached 70 in top sands of sed a n columns towards the end of the hf period day 98 further with added n discernable removal was also observed in the sediment layer and bottom sands e g 25 removal on days 91 112 and 120 on day 91 the removal was different for two duplicate sed a n1 2 columns n related processes such as nitrification and denitrification likely played a role in sulfonamide degradation processes discussion 4 1 4 2 3 2 4 most smx removal occurred in sediments with production of unknown metabolites in contrast to little removal of sdz and smz in sediments smx was mostly removed in the sediment layer 24 23 fig 3 followed by the top sand layer 17 14 and then the bottom sand layer 1 13 the most pronounced smx removal occurred in the sediment layer of all columns on day 19 56 16 likely owing to the high dissolved fe concentrations at this time discussion 4 3 during the subsequent hf and lf periods without fe reducing conditions smx removal occurred more evenly across top sands and sediments but exhibited great variabilities which were also reflected by the three measured smx metabolites fig s3 the production of dea smx ammet and nit smx were the highest in sed a n columns especially in top sands where each metabolite reached up to 150 ng l while only dea smx was detected in sed a c columns 70 ng l and sed a columns 40 ng l concentrations of the main metabolite dea smx appeared to increase with that of no2 within 0 1 mg n l then stayed high up to 3 mg n l no2 fig s4 further metabolite concentrations in sediment layers were much higher than those in effluents indicating continued biotransformation of metabolites moving downward in columns for the top sand layer smx removal of sed a columns was always the lowest compared to those of sed a n and sed a c columns suggesting that utilization of primary substrates appears to be a prerequisite for smx degradation 3 2 5 higher biomass but lower microbial diversity in sediments than sands sampled on day 120 at the end of the experiment column sediments contained comparable biomass to the initial riverbed sediments represented by 16s rrna gene copies per gram of solid table 2 despite sterilization prior to experimentation both top and bottom sands developed microbial communities although their biomass densities were 10 100 times lower than that of sediments table s4 measures for the community structure including microbial richness chao and ace shannon diversity and evenness were not significantly different between top and bottom sediments indeed these indices were slightly higher for top sands and the highest for bottom sands table 2 the oligotrophic bottom sand layer displayed a low biomass density but a high community diversity compared to the eutrophic top sand layer during column infiltration in line with the observations of other laboratory columns simulating aquifer recharge process li et al 2013 microbial compositions in both top and bottom sediment samples n 15 shifted from the initial sediments n 3 fig 4a with notable decreases in the relative abundance of several obligate anaerobes such as clostridiales 23 7 to 5 6 and a remarkable increase of aerobes or facultative anaerobes such as bacillales 1 to 25 15 although variabilities were evident among the eight columns fig s6 further microbial community of top sands n 3 displayed a high degree of similarity to that of column sediments except for the two samples from sed a n columns with nh4 addition top sands were enriched with ammonia oxidizing bacteria nitrosomonas spp fig s7 bottom sand samples at the end of the experiment n 15 possessed the most diverse communities overall microbial composition for each depth was not significantly different between columns especially for sed sed a and sed a c columns pairwise permutation manovas p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 sulfonamide removal enhanced by carbon utilization and ammonia oxidation an important feature during river water infiltration is that the redox states often change from oxic conditions at the surface to a range of reducing conditions in the subsurface wang et al 2020 this evolution of redox conditions was encountered in our column experiments fig 3 specifically besides substrates in the source water respiration of sediment organic matter results in oxygen depletion during infiltration followed by denitrification and mn fe reduction kedziorek et al 2008 rudolf von rohr et al 2014 for ease of illustrating the redox dependent removal of sdz smz and smx removal percentages were grouped for top sands sediments and bottom sands fig 5 according to the relevant redox conditions detailed in fig 3 because sulfonamide removal by sorption is negligible in aquifer sands and river sediments bertelkamp et al 2014 ma et al 2021 effects of different substrates on biodegradation of trace sulfonamides were evaluated as follows by comparing columns with and without substrate addition smx removal in top sands was much higher in sed a c columns 26 9 oxic conditions fig 5a than that in sed a columns 4 7 oxic conditions suggesting that its degradation was accelerated by the utilization of added yeast extract and humic acids given that residence time in the top sand layer was 2 h during high flow periods 14 h for the entire column half lives of smx oxic degradation in top sands were estimated to be 0 1 0 2 days and 0 4 9 days for sed a c and sed a columns assuming the first order kinetics table s5 organic matters 7 mg c l in treated wastewater stimulated microbial activities and probably promoted the co metabolic degradation of micropollutants during column infiltration rauch williams et al 2010 the possibility of co metabolic smx biodegradation in surface waters is also supported by experiments lim et al 2008 showing that the removal was enhanced by adding ppm levels of degradable doc from aquatic plant extracts sediment organic matter likely acted as alternative primary substrates for micropollutant co metabolism and enhanced smx degradation as its removal in the oxic sediment layer of sed a columns 16 4 fig 5b was significantly higher than that in oxic top sands 4 7 for sediments under oxic to suboxic conditions the removal reached 23 20 with a maximum of 60 in sed a and sed a c columns microbial respiration in sediments was mainly sustained by bioavailable particulate organics because even in sed a c columns only a small fraction of added c infiltrated into this layer 3 8 cm depth fig 3 at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min oxygen saturated influents supplied 6 mg of o2 per day over the 120 day experiment in columns without extra substrates fed sediment organics provided an equivalent of 234 mg l labile carbon accounting for 14 of initial sediment toc 0 5 of dry weight the oligotrophic bottom sands by and large displayed a low removal 3 13 apart from a slightly higher removal under no3 reducing conditions 10 18 discussion 4 2 in turn highlighting the crucial role of substrates favoring sulfonamide removal notably the removal of sdz and smz was low in both top sands and sediments of the sed a and sed a c columns mean 10 fig 5 it appears that their removal did not respond to c addition or sediment organics under oxic conditions likely due to different degradation pathways with structural differences chen and xie 2018 our data support that nh4 oxidation enhanced the degradation of all three sulfonamides as their removal by top sands was significantly higher in sed a n columns 24 23 fig 5a than that in sed a columns 4 7 it corresponded to the proliferation of nitrifiers to 10 of top sand biomass fig 4b and the estimated half life of first order degradation 0 1 0 3 days during high flow periods was comparable to other nitrifier enriched systems table s5 ammonia monooxygenase amo a key enzyme for ammonia oxidation has been shown to support co metabolic degradation of micropollutants including sulfonamides other pharmaceuticals and pesticides kassotaki et al 2016 yu et al 2018 similarly as observed in sand columns simulating the first meter of riverbank infiltration zhao et al 2022 ammonia oxidizing bacteria comprised 0 2 5 9 of total community and the removal of 32 micropollutants including sulfisoxazole and sulfathiazole significantly decreased upon the inhibition of amo in addition production of dea smx was the highest among the three measured metabolites especially in sed a n top sands fig s3 suggesting deamination as a key biotransformation reaction likewise deaminases also contributed to sulfonamide degradation by nitrifiers zhou et al 2019 taken together this study expands the evidence for improved biodegradation of trace antibiotics by microbial growth substrates at concentrations likely to be encountered in natural aquatic systems especially rivers receiving wwtp effluents it is worth noting that the removal trends of smx sdz and smz were similar in top sands sediments and bottom sands of sed a n columns suggesting that the three sulfonamides likely shared the same degradation pathways when coupled to the nitrification denitrification cycle in contrast addition of yeast extract and humic acids appears to have only accelerated the degradation of smx but not sdz and smz 4 2 degradation and retrosynthesis of sulfonamides coupled to denitrification reactions reversibility in sulfonamide degradation under no3 reducing conditions has been previously reported barbieri et al 2012 nödler et al 2012 this is the reason for large variabilities in the removal percentage of three sulfonamides in sed a n columns fig 5 this reversibility was also likely responsible for the declining removal in sed a n top sands from high flow periods 36 21 fig s5 to the low flow period 1 11 at a lower flow rate on days 112 and 120 a longer residence time in top sands led to not only the improved utilization of nh4 but also prolonged anoxic conditions at the bottom of top sands with no3 exceeding 8 mg n l correspondingly reductive transformation from reversible metabolites to parent sulfonamides likely occurred within 1 3 cm depth figs 3 s3 lowering the net removal of sulfonamides in batch tests to remove sdz smz and smx by the same river sediments ma et al 2021 sulfonamide degradation occurred rapidly with a half life of 0 7 days under denitrifying conditions however the kinetics of retrosynthesis reactions were poorly constrained closely monitoring smx degradation in batch experiments incubated with aquifer sediments barbieri et al 2012 suggested that the kinetics of degradation and retrosynthesis might be of the same order of magnitude under denitrifying conditions with 90 of 1 μg l smx degraded in three days but recovered to 75 over five days in the sediment layer of sed a n columns the net removal of three sulfonamides was low during high flow periods 6 17 fig s5 likely due to the short residence time around 0 1 days however the removal remained low 13 16 during the low flow period with a prolonged residence time of 0 5 days which might have involved fast retrosynthesis reactions 4 3 rapid degradation of smx in sediments under fe reducing conditions in the sediment layer of all antibiotic fed columns under fe reducing conditions fig 5b much higher smx removal 56 16 than those of sdz and smz 10 is worth highlighting this study conducted with river sediments and μg l sulfonamides expands the findings of mohatt et al 2011 that mg l levels of isoxazole containing chemicals including smx sulfisoxazole and 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole were favorably degraded in soil microcosms under fe reducing conditions during the hf fe period 50 of 1 μg l smx was removed in the sediment layer with an approximate retention time of 3 h and the estimated half life was 0 03 0 07 days based on the first order degradation kinetics table s5 in soil microcosms mohatt et al 2011 95 of 6 mg l smx was removed within 12 h under fe reducing conditions while it took 5 14 and 40 days under sulfate reducing aerobic and no3 reducing conditions therefore both studies found that smx dissipated rapidly we are not aware of field experiments that have investigated kinetics of smx degradation under fe reducing conditions but schaper et al 2018 observed a rapid decrease of ppb levels of smx in the hyporheic zone of an urban river with redox states spanning from no3 reducing to fe mn reducing conditions and the half life was estimated as 0 3 0 2 days based on quasi steady state depth profiles within 20 cm of streambeds based on the zero smx dissipation in fe ii only solutions and a rapid removal in suspensions containing both fe ii and goethite mohatt et al 2011 suggested that adsorbed fe ii on mineral surfaces was a stronger reductant than dissolved fe ii and that smx degradation under fe reducing conditions was abiotic however this abiotic degradation might have been mediated indirectly by microbial processes because fe ii species were generated by dissimilatory fe reducing microbes and organic substrates such as sediment organic matter were necessary electron donors lovley and phillips 1986 it is worth noting that during the hf fe periods smx was hardly removed in column bottom sands 2 5 fig 5c despite of fe reducing conditions and possible fe ii adsorption on sand surface fig 3 thus this observation does not support that the degradation of ppb levels of smx with fe ii is a purely abiotic process the limited availability of labile substrates or the low abundance of fe reducers likely hampered the smx degradation in bottom sands 4 4 implications for sulfonamide removal enhancements using nature based solutions engineered biological wastewater treatments are usually not effective in antibiotic removal for example smx removal in activated sludge processes ranged from zero to 64 with a typical hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 30 h chen and xie 2018 high removal has been achieved in laboratory reactors containing high levels of primary substrates in sequencing batch nitrifying reactors when influent nh4 was 1000 mg n l 85 of 100 μg l sdz was removed at a hrt of 24 h wang et al 2020 in another sequencing batch reactor when influent cod was 600 mg l 86 of 10 mg l smx was removed at a hrt of 10 h guo et al 2017 relevant to nature based solutions such as riverbank filtration and soil aquifer treatment these findings suggest two approaches to enhance the attenuation of wastewater sourced micropollutants including substrate supplement and residence time regulation given that nature based solutions with larger physical footprints allow for longer hydraulic retention time than human engineered systems the implication of our finding that ppm levels of substrates can accelerate sulfonamide degradation is that residual doc and ammonium in reclaimed water can be utilized to enhance natural attenuation of antibiotics although we recognize that field conditions are more complex thus this requires validation by field tests lim et al 2008 found a positive correlation between the amount of biodegradable doc in wwtp effluents and the biodegradation rate of some micropollutants in effluent dominated surface waters indicating that upgrading wwtps to decrease effluent doc might not favor the subsequent micropollutant removal in this study substrate poor bottom sands corresponded with negligible sulfonamide removal fig 5c further highlighting the importance of substrate availability as oligotrophic conditions are frequently encountered in sandy aquifer systems goldscheider et al 2006 and the biomass is usually 10 100 times lower than that in surface waters pedersen 2000 it stands to reason that sandy aquifers are not well equipped to promote micropollutant biodegradation there is no guarantee that these emerging contaminants will be naturally purified just by extending subsurface travel time solutions of installing reactive barriers to supply extra substrates have shown promise as in sand columns simulating managed aquifer recharge smx removal increased from 20 to 60 80 with the establishment of compost barriers modrzyński et al 2021 yet rauch williams et al 2010 observed that a specialized microbial community well adapted to oligotrophic conditions was also effective in removing micropollutants in presence of low doc regnery et al 2016 further found that the attenuation of less degradable organic compounds including sulfonamides was enhanced under oxic and carbon depleted conditions established by sequential managed aquifer recharge i e a short riverbank filtration passage followed by subsequent re aeration and artificial recharge however the involved specific microbes and functional enzymes under starving conditions are still poorly understood hellauer et al 2019 further research regarding the role of indigenous microbial communities spanning from surface to oligotrophic subsurface environments in micropollutant degradation is needed during aquifer recharge including riverbank filtration the residence time or hrt affects the removal of both conventional pollutants including doc no3 and sulfate rudolf von rohr et al 2014 shebl et al 2022 and emerging micropollutants including antibiotics this study although hrt of our columns was shorter than those reported in the literature table s5 the kinetics of sulfonamide removal appeared to be comparable for similar redox conditions presumably a longer hrt will increase the overall removal efficiency in our study total removal of the three sulfonamides was 20 in the oxic sediment layer with a hrt of 3 11 h while it reached 36 53 within 48 h in oxic batch tests with the same sediments and no extra carbon addition ma et al 2021 similarly smx removal reached 60 in oxic columns with a long hrt of several days baumgarten et al 2011 regnery et al 2015 it is worth noting that increasing hrt in columns by lowering the flow rate also significantly changed the redox zonation and in turn the sulfonamide removal fig 3 as often observed in the field where hrt and redox conditions are frequently inter related manipulating residence time during aquifer storage by increasing travel distances will also need to cope with different reducing conditions developed during subsurface horizontal flow a lesson learned is that to model the reactive transport of antibiotics at surface water infiltration sites redox dependent kinetics during recharge processes should be considered 5 conclusions long term laboratory column experiments conducted to simulate the natural attenuation of sulfonamide antibiotics during riverbed infiltration found the enhancement of removal of sdz smz and smx by dissolved and particulate substrates these substrates ppm levels of doc or inorganic nitrogen in reclaimed water and sediment organic carbon favored sulfonamide removal indicating co metabolic degradation by heterotrophs or autotrophic nitrifiers three sulfonamides likely shared similar biotransformation pathways under nitrifying and denitrifying no3 reducing conditions but only smx degraded rapidly under fe reducing conditions steep redox gradients developing over a depth interval of several centimeters in riverbed sediments of all columns a condition also frequently encountered at field sites were found to influence the removal efficacy of antibiotics significantly by contrast sulfonamide removal in bottom sands was always low regardless of redox conditions due to limited availability of substrates and low biomass relevant to nature based solutions for water purification supplementation of substrates during infiltration process and regulation of the exposure time to optimal redox conditions along flow path hold promise for rapid and effective removal of trace organic contaminants although further research is recommended to closely track their dissipation at field
