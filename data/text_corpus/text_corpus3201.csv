16005,antibiotics are often applied in aquaculture to prevent fish diseases these substances can cause disturbances on receiving waters when not properly eliminated from the aquaculture effluents in this work ozone o3 was investigated as a possible oxidizing agent to remove fishery antibiotics from aquaculture effluents florfenicol ff oxytetracycline otc sulfadimethoxine sdm sulfamethoxazole smx and trimethoprim tmp batch experiments were performed using ultrapure water and aquaculture effluents spiked with a mixture of target antibiotics at relatively high concentrations 10 mg l 1 each otc smx and tmp were fully removed 30 min regardless of the tested conditions mainly by o3 direct attack in contrast ff was partially removed in 30 min 10 and 60 in aquaculture effluents and ultrapure water respectively but only in the presence of hydroxyl radicals ho the ff concentrations reaching levels below the detection limits in ultrapure water after 60 min in the case of sdm its degradation was highly influenced by the selected water matrix but with removals always higher than 68 in continuous flow experiments applying more environmentally relevant antibiotic concentrations 100 ng l 1 each and low o3 doses 1 5 mg l 1 ozonation highly removed 98 all tested antibiotics from aquaculture effluents with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 10 min except ff 68 although by products were detected in treated samples zebrafish danio rerio embryotoxicity tests did not show a toxicity increase by applying this ozonation treatment ozonation is thus a possible solution to remove antibiotics from aquaculture effluents still full scale studies in aquaculture farms are needed and generation of ho may be favoured to readily oxidize the ff antibiotic graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water pollution aquaculture antibiotics ozone zebrafish 1 introduction in the last few years the global fish consumption has increased more than that of any other animal protein food e g meat dairy and milk and aquaculture is one of the fastest growing food producing sectors fao 2020 intensive aquaculture typically involves many cultured organisms in confined areas which can promote the dissemination of parasites and bacterial infections and consequently considerable economic losses for the sector lulijwa et al 2020 rigos et al 2010 in this context to tackle infections and their undesirable effects antibiotics such as tetracyclines trimethoprim tmp sulfonamides quinolones β lactams fluoroquinolones and phenicols have been widely supplied in aquaculture gorito et al 2022 the excessive application of antibiotics in aquaculture can bring serious threats to the environment and human health such as their spread in the different environmental compartments and the possible proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria and their related genes arb args which is one of the main challenges that humans face today preena et al 2020 schar et al 2020 zheng et al 2021 indeed high levels of arb have been described in and around aquaculture farms choi et al 2020 antibiotics are generally added directly to the water through food pellets and thus both the unconsumed fraction of antibiotics and the excreta of farming organisms end up in outlet waters leal et al 2017 pereira et al 2013 serrano 2005 moreover water treatment equipment installed in aquaculture farms is not commonly adequate for removing antibiotics which are highly stable camera roda et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 one alternative process that has been used to improve water quality in aquaculture is ozonation high removal rates of pathogens organic matter solids colour and inorganic species can be achieved with this treatment powell and scolding 2018 schroeder et al 2011 tango and gagnon 2003 however specific information regarding antibiotics removal in aquaculture is still very scarce only two studies were found in the scopus database using the keywords ozone ozonation antibiotics and aquaculture choi et al 2020 kye et al 2020 in these two studies ozone o3 significantly removed the fishery antibiotics amoxicillin choi et al 2020 oxytetracycline otc choi et al 2020 and oxolinic acid choi et al 2020 kye et al 2020 but florfenicol ff was very refractory to the treatment choi et al 2020 kye et al 2020 one of the main drawbacks of ozonation is the formation of oxidation by products that might have toxicological effects similar or even higher than those of parent compounds prieto rodríguez et al 2013 for instance bromate ion is a known ozonation by product of toxicological concern originated from o3 reaction with bromide naturally found in water matrices camera roda et al 2019 gorito et al 2021 thus both physico chemical and toxicological criteria are crucial to conclude about ozonation efficiency and quality of treated water garcía cambero et al 2019 prieto rodríguez et al 2013 specifically for aquaculture guaranteeing the quality of ozonated effluents is essential when these effluents are discharged into the environment or recirculated to feed the aquaculture facilities despite that studies involving aquaculture effluents are only focused on antibiotics degradation without assessment of toxicity and or general quality of the treated effluent choi et al 2020 kye et al 2020 as is also the case of many other studies dealing with ozonation for the removal of antibiotics from different water matrices in this work the possibility of applying ozonation to aquaculture effluents aiming at the removal of different antibiotics commonly used in these farms ff otc sulfadimethoxine sdm sulfamethoxazole smx and tmp table 1 was investigated firstly the degradation of target compounds was studied in batch mode where different parameters such as the role of hydroxyl radicals ho and water matrix were evaluated afterwards the removal of target antibiotics was also assessed in a continuous flow mode for which more realistic conditions were applied environmentally relevant antibiotic concentrations low o3 concentration and short hydraulic retention time hrt the potential toxicity effects of the continuous ozonated effluents were then estimated using zebrafish embryo assays 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all reference antibiotic standards ff otc sdm smx and tmp as well as the internal standard sdm d6 were purchased from

were then diluted to 10 and 1 mg l 1 for mass spectrometry analysis optimization a working solution containing all antibiotic standards 2 5 mg l 1 was also prepared by dilution in meoh which was used to spike the aqueous matrix for the ozonation experiments likewise a working solution of sdm d6 5 mg l 1 was prepared to be added to each sample before the solid phase extraction spe procedure meoh

ozonation following the experiments described above section 2 3 2 2 7 statistical analysis removal of antibiotics by ozonation was compared by single factor analysis of variance anova followed by post hoc tukey s test using the software spss version 25 0 for windows the significance level was set to 0 05 in toxicity assays mortality and hatching data are presented as cumulative frequency the data

done using either the chi square test or the fisher exact test with a bonferroni correction to identify their origin the median time to hatching ht50 was estimated using the probit method finney 1971 the statistical analyses were performed in spss 27 against a significance level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of antibiotics 3 1 1 batch mode ozonation experiments fig 1 a shows the normalized concentrations of the target antibiotics spiked in ultrapure water 10 mg l 1 of each antibiotic in the ozonation experiments 60 min 50 g nm 3 ph 6 among the five tested antibiotics ff otc sdm smx and tmp only sdm was not completely removed in 60 min asdm p 0 05 i e sdm was the only compound with a concentration higher than the detection limit after 60 min of ozonation otc and smx were the compounds with faster degradation showing removals of 85 and 74 respectively in 10 min of contact time with o3 these antibiotics and tmp were not detected in any of the 30 min treated samples regarding ff a slower degradation was observed but it was fully removed after 60 min in the case of sdm a fast removal is depicted in the first 10 min of reaction followed by a slower removal after that period a maximum removal of 82 being achieved in 60 min of ozonation it is well known that organic contaminants can be removed in ozonation by direct and indirect modes depending on whether direct attack of o3 or reaction with generated radicals in particular ho respectively occurs peleg 1976 as can be seen in table 1 all the studied antibiotics have reaction rate kinetic constants above 105 m 1 s 1 with o3 k o3 except ff 10 m 1 s 1 this observation agrees with the slower degradation observed for ff in fig 1a the k o3 are higher for the other antibiotics because the amino groups are expected to activate the aromatic rings and double bonds of the chemical structures ben et al 2012 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in fact sulfonamides tetracyclines and tmp are antibiotics for which ozonation has demonstrated high removal efficiencies mainly by direct oxidation gireli et al 2019 ikehata et al 2006 kuang et al 2013 lin et al 2009 wang et al 2011 whereas poor removals have been reported for ff choi et al 2020 khan et al 2020 kye et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 thus the degradation of ff observed in fig 1a closed circles seems to be related to an indirect oxidation pathway by the reaction with ho to infer about the role of ho and other possible radicals in the degradation of these antibiotics meoh was added to ultrapure water in the second set of experiments fig 1b the removal of ff was negligible 5 indicating that the indirect oxidation pathway is crucial for its removal as confirmed by the significant differences of anova analysis between ultrapure water with and without addition of scavenger bff fig 1b it is known that ho is generated after a series of reactions which starts with the primary reaction between o3 and hydroxide ions present in water eqs s1 14 in supplementary material meaning that the formation of ho can be accelerated by increasing the ph von gunten 2003 in the present study a ph of 6 was sufficient to remove ff in 60 min of ozonation fig 1a unlike ff otc smx and tmp were removed in less time in the presence of meoh but the differences were not significant fig 1a vs 1b p 0 05 in any case the radical scavenger consumes ho and without regenerating the superoxide radical ion o2 the o3 decomposition may be retarded eqs s4 and s7 respectively thus o3 being available for direct attack langlais et al 1991 anova analysis also suggested that ho did not affect sdm degradation asdm fig 1b thus these results confirmed that otc smx tmp and sdm are preferentially removed by direct oxidation a set of additional experiments without meoh was performed with ff alone and adding each one of the other antibiotics to ff in ultrapure water fig s1a supplementary material interestingly these other antibiotics affected the ff degradation when simultaneously present in the solution perhaps due to the readily o3 consumption by direct attack of either parent otc smx tmp and sdm or their intermediate compounds complementary experiments with sdm also suggested that the co existence of the other four antibiotics affected its own removal fig s1b supplementary material perhaps by generating by products that can react with sdm beyond the chemical properties of the compounds the water matrix can also affect the degradation of antibiotics as shown in fig 1c the matrix under analysis i e aquaculture effluents impacted considerably the sdm removal bsdm the degradation of sdm increased approximately 20 when the aquaculture effluent was tested instead of ultrapure water however the potential interference of ho favoured by the higher ph of aquaculture effluent 8 vs 6 does not justify this enhancement since these reactive species did not have a remarkable removal effect in the smd removal fig 1b these results are in accordance with a recent study on ozonation of sdm shad et al 2018 where the important role of the water matrix in its degradation was also highlighted the co existence of cations and anions e g fe3 cu2 nh4 hco3 and no3 in the aqueous medium may play a catalytic role in ozonation of sdm shad et al 2018 which might result in its larger removal in the aquaculture effluents fig 1c furthermore ff degradation was also affected by water matrix cff following the tendency of the experiments carried out in the presence of meoh fig 1c despite the ph of this matrix ph of 8 being more favourable to the decomposition of o3 into ho the matrix constituents may have acted as inhibitors of the formation of ho or instead they might have consumed the generated radicals this also supports the higher removal of sdm in the more complex matrix since such ho inhibitors can reduce the decay of o3 leading to an accelerated degradation of sdm which is mainly removed by o3 direct attack the complexity and diversity of water matrices turn difficult to predict their impact as initiator promoter or inhibitor during ozonation cai and lin 2016 lado ribeiro et al 2019 as such the fraction of o3 and ho and other possible reactive radicals which effectively oxidizes the antibiotics is highly dependent on the action of all co existing substances in the water matrix staehelin and hoigne 1985 thus the collected aquaculture effluent with physico chemical characterization shown in table s1 supplementary material probably suppressed the effect of ho on ff removal which did not exceeded 40 in contrast otc smx tmp and sdm were efficiently eliminated from the aquaculture effluent in 60 min to levels below method detection limits moreover it is also perceptible that aquaculture effluents had good water quality indicators table s1 supplementary material and therefore a more complex matrix i e with higher organic content and or ammonia concentration among others could affect antibiotics kinetic degradation since a higher competition could occur between the species susceptible to oxidation by o3 3 1 2 continuous flow mode ozonation experiments the degradation of antibiotics in continuous flow ozonation was investigated for an hrt of 10 min corresponding to a ts of 33 min applying an o3 concentration of 1 5 mg l 1 as referred above these selected conditions were based on the information available in the literature regarding ozonation at full scale aquaculture systems for disinfection gonçalves and gagnon 2011 summerfelt 2003 summerfelt and hochheimer 1997 and our previous study focused on ozonation for the removal of several other organic micropollutants from surface water gorito et al 2021 for these experiments the aquaculture effluent was spiked with 100 ng l 1 of each antibiotic ff otc sdm smx and tmp i e the spiked level was considerably lower than in batch experiments hundreds of ng l 1 instead of tens of mg l 1 mimicking concentrations frequently detected in aquaculture effluents pereira et al 2015 tetzner and rath 2018 zou et al 2011 in fig 2 closed circles top axis it is possible to verify some deviations between the predicted and achieved concentrations of these spiked compounds i e ranging from 80 to 220 ng l 1 which can be for instance related to the occurrence of the antibiotics in the collected effluent table s2 supplementary material matrix effects or other possible interferences removals above 98 were observed for tmp sdm otc smx whereas ff did not surpass 68 fig 2 grey bars p 0 05 therefore in these experiments ff was the only compound recalcitrant to o3 its degradation being highly influenced by the presence of ho as confirmed in the previous sub section the action of ho will depend on the composition of the matrix to be treated and thus it is very difficult to predict the removal extent of ff the degradation of ff in aquaculture waters has been also investigated by applying uv and uv photocatalysis removals in the ranges of 4 85 and 98 100 being respectively registered gorito et al 2022 thus combining uv or h2o2 with ozonation can be an interesting alternative in future works to enhance the production of ho and consequently the more efficient degradation of ff however the respective costs should also be considered when selecting one of these alternatives cuerda correa et al 2020 3 2 influence of continuous ozonation on the general quality of aquaculture effluent among the target ions ammonium bromate bromide calcium chloride magnesium nitrate nitrite phosphate potassium sodium and sulphate nitrite and ammonium were never detected while magnesium was always below the method quantification limit 0 4 mg l 1 table s1 supplementary material before treatment calcium chloride nitrate phosphate potassium sodium and sulphate ions were detected at concentrations of respectively 0 2 6 3 3 8 3 2 1 3 6 3 and 1 1 mg l 1 table s1 supplementary material values which were similar after ozonation except a slight difference for potassium ion 0 3 mg l 1 moreover bromide ions were oxidized to bromates after reaction with o3 fig s2 supplementary material likewise if nitrites were present above the detection limits in the aquaculture effluent it would also be expectable that they were oxidised to nitrates baozhen et al 1989 lin and wu 1996 as expected results of ions analysis suggested that apart from bromides and bromates ozonation had a low impact on the ionic composition of the spiked aquaculture effluent the aquaculture effluent had a very low organic load cod was lower than the method detection limit 3 5 mg l 1 and doc was quantified at approximately 2 mg l 1 table s1 supplementary material the protein rich wastes from aquaculture systems typically have cod doc and ammonia concentrations often higher than those detected in the current study however the selected aquaculture farm is characterized by low rates of fish production with an adequate distribution of organisms by ample ponds and the water supplied to this farm comes from a location very close to the source of the river which probably contributed to these originally unexpected values still doc slightly decreased 4 after ozonation typically o3 is a powerful oxidant of aromatic compounds still it reacts slowly with low molecular weight carboxylic acids that are often formed from these parent compounds which can lead to the accumulation of several by products that cannot be easily oxidized by molecular o3 moreira et al 2015 in any case the theoretical doc due to the five mps corresponds to less than 0 3 of the initial doc content since they are present at very low concentrations fig 2 regarding the particulate matter o3 eliminated approximately 60 of tss 3 3 toxicity evaluation before and after continuous ozonation bromates 6 ug l 1 and antibiotics by products figs s2 and s3 supplementary material were detected by lc ms ms in the samples collected from the continuous ozonation reactor highlighting the importance of toxicological evaluation zebrafish is a very popular model vertebrate used to evaluate the toxicity of water and it was used here to verify the potential risks of removing antibiotics from aquaculture effluents with o3 the assays carried out in this work fulfilled all the validation criteria of the oecd guidelines 212 and 236 oecd 1998 2013 namely at the end of the exposure period the negative control group had a low mortality 10 and a hatching success above 80 while embryos exposed to 3 4 dichloroaniline positive control registered a mortality above 30 fig 3 these results allowed to completely validate the applied methodology results for mortality and hatching obtained for the treated and non treated aquaculture effluent are presented in fig 3 focusing on the mortality fig 3a no significant mortality was elicited either by the aquaculture effluent the spiked effluent or the ozonated effluent treatment for the negative control and the tested effluent squares and triangles fig 3a mortality occurred mostly during the first 48 h of exposure which is in accordance with the expected outcome of these types of toxicological assays the first 48 h of zebrafish development are critical not only all the major gastrulation and segmentation processes occur in this period but also defence mechanisms against external contamination are not fully maturated at this time frame chen et al 2020 fischer et al 2013 kimmel et al 1995 hatching fig 3b occurred mainly between 48 hpf and 72hpf as described in the literature kimmel et al 1995 however significant differences among experimental conditions were found in the time to hatching compared to the controls chi square 66 0 degrees of freedom df 6 p 0 00001 the subsequent pairwise comparisons showed that hatching was significantly anticipated in the spiked aquaculture effluent chi square 24 8 df 2 p 0 00001 and the treated aquaculture effluent chi square 39 4 df 2 p 0 00001 table 2 shows the median time to hatching ht50 obtained for each experimental condition according to these results embryos exposed to the spiked effluent took 10 h less than the control to hatch while those exposed to the treated effluent took 13 h less the implications of premature hatching are yet to be fully understood it has been observed previously that premature hatching in zebrafish may occur upon exposure to ionic stress ord 2019 hypoxia small et al 2020 or toxic substances such as tributyltin liang et al 2017 the work of ord 2019 seems to support that premature hatching may be an adaptive response allowing for animals to escape unfavourable conditions in contrast the investigation of leite ferreira et al 2019 suggests differential sensitivity to alcohol of premature and late hatching zebrafish larvae with stronger responses of premature larvae to high exposure concentrations compared to late hatching ones further investigations will help understanding the implications of such anticipation in relation to treatment benefits to water quality statistically significant differences among test conditions were observed for the rate of malformations chi square 72 9 df 3 p 0 00001 fig 4 the pairwise comparisons indicated a significantly higher proportion of abnormal embryos at 168 hpf in the aquaculture effluent fisher exact test p 0 00001 compared to control embryos and the spiked aquaculture effluent fisher exact test p 0 0005 compared to controls fig 4d yolk sac malformations side wide position and skeletal deformities were the most prevalent abnormalities found all interfering with larvae swimming and thus their ability to feed and escape predators fig 4a b c though less prevalent alterations in the blood circulation and heartbeat could also be observed data not shown nevertheless in the group exposed to the effluent treated with continuous ozonation the rate of malformations was very low and comparable to the control group fisher exact test p 0 672 overall the results suggest that the ozonation treatment would effectively reduce the toxicity of the aquaculture effluent improving water quality for the development of the embryos therefore the by products generated during ozonation were not harmful to zebrafish bromate was detected at 6 µg l 1 in treated effluent samples however in marine aquaculture o3 may result in bromate concentrations considerable higher because of the large amount of bromide in seawater 60 mg l 1 camera roda et al 2019 kye et al 2020 investigation on toxicity effects of bromate ions in zebrafish are still scarce but studies for sodium and potassium bromate have reported embryotoxic effects only at very high concentrations 1 g l 1 teixidó et al 2015 wang et al 2016 it is important to refer that zebrafish toxicity tests for ozonated aquaculture effluents were performed in this study for the first time with encouraging results 4 conclusions batch ozonation experiments with antibiotics at 10 mg l 1 each 60 min of treatment showed that this process was efficient for removing tmp otc and smx from aqueous matrices 30 min and that direct o3 attack is the main degradation pathway in contrast ff was not removed by direct o3 attack however the results of this work reveal that ff can be successfully oxidized by the indirect reaction pathway i e through ho generation sdm was fully eliminated from the aquaculture effluent but its degradation was highly influenced by the selected water matrix additionally in continuous flow ozonation experiments with antibiotics at 100 ng l 1 each 10 min of treatment all antibiotics were successfully removed from the aquaculture effluent 98 except ff 68 thus ff removal should be enhanced by promoting the formation of ho complementary analysis showed that bromates 6 µg l 1 and other reaction by products are formed in the medium during ozonation treatment however endpoints of the zebrafish assays mortality hatching and malformations did not reveal toxicity after o3 treatment molecular biochemical and genetic biomarkers e g genotoxicity oxidative stress endocrine disruption and neurotoxicity can also be used to assess the possible toxicity effects on zebrafish and thus more specific analysis can be addressed in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

16005,antibiotics are often applied in aquaculture to prevent fish diseases these substances can cause disturbances on receiving waters when not properly eliminated from the aquaculture effluents in this work ozone o3 was investigated as a possible oxidizing agent to remove fishery antibiotics from aquaculture effluents florfenicol ff oxytetracycline otc sulfadimethoxine sdm sulfamethoxazole smx and trimethoprim tmp batch experiments were performed using ultrapure water and aquaculture effluents spiked with a mixture of target antibiotics at relatively high concentrations 10 mg l 1 each otc smx and tmp were fully removed 30 min regardless of the tested conditions mainly by o3 direct attack in contrast ff was partially removed in 30 min 10 and 60 in aquaculture effluents and ultrapure water respectively but only in the presence of hydroxyl radicals ho the ff concentrations reaching levels below the detection limits in ultrapure water after 60 min in the case of sdm its degradation was highly influenced by the selected water matrix but with removals always higher than 68 in continuous flow experiments applying more environmentally relevant antibiotic concentrations 100 ng l 1 each and low o3 doses 1 5 mg l 1 ozonation highly removed 98 all tested antibiotics from aquaculture effluents with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 10 min except ff 68 although by products were detected in treated samples zebrafish danio rerio embryotoxicity tests did not show a toxicity increase by applying this ozonation treatment ozonation is thus a possible solution to remove antibiotics from aquaculture effluents still full scale studies in aquaculture farms are needed and generation of ho may be favoured to readily oxidize the ff antibiotic graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water pollution aquaculture antibiotics ozone zebrafish 1 introduction in the last few years the global fish consumption has increased more than that of any other animal protein food e g meat dairy and milk and aquaculture is one of the fastest growing food producing sectors fao 2020 intensive aquaculture typically involves many cultured organisms in confined areas which can promote the dissemination of parasites and bacterial infections and consequently considerable economic losses for the sector lulijwa et al 2020 rigos et al 2010 in this context to tackle infections and their undesirable effects antibiotics such as tetracyclines trimethoprim tmp sulfonamides quinolones β lactams fluoroquinolones and phenicols have been widely supplied in aquaculture gorito et al 2022 the excessive application of antibiotics in aquaculture can bring serious threats to the environment and human health such as their spread in the different environmental compartments and the possible proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria and their related genes arb args which is one of the main challenges that humans face today preena et al 2020 schar et al 2020 zheng et al 2021 indeed high levels of arb have been described in and around aquaculture farms choi et al 2020 antibiotics are generally added directly to the water through food pellets and thus both the unconsumed fraction of antibiotics and the excreta of farming organisms end up in outlet waters leal et al 2017 pereira et al 2013 serrano 2005 moreover water treatment equipment installed in aquaculture farms is not commonly adequate for removing antibiotics which are highly stable camera roda et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 one alternative process that has been used to improve water quality in aquaculture is ozonation high removal rates of pathogens organic matter solids colour and inorganic species can be achieved with this treatment powell and scolding 2018 schroeder et al 2011 tango and gagnon 2003 however specific information regarding antibiotics removal in aquaculture is still very scarce only two studies were found in the scopus database using the keywords ozone ozonation antibiotics and aquaculture choi et al 2020 kye et al 2020 in these two studies ozone o3 significantly removed the fishery antibiotics amoxicillin choi et al 2020 oxytetracycline otc choi et al 2020 and oxolinic acid choi et al 2020 kye et al 2020 but florfenicol ff was very refractory to the treatment choi et al 2020 kye et al 2020 one of the main drawbacks of ozonation is the formation of oxidation by products that might have toxicological effects similar or even higher than those of parent compounds prieto rodríguez et al 2013 for instance bromate ion is a known ozonation by product of toxicological concern originated from o3 reaction with bromide naturally found in water matrices camera roda et al 2019 gorito et al 2021 thus both physico chemical and toxicological criteria are crucial to conclude about ozonation efficiency and quality of treated water garcía cambero et al 2019 prieto rodríguez et al 2013 specifically for aquaculture guaranteeing the quality of ozonated effluents is essential when these effluents are discharged into the environment or recirculated to feed the aquaculture facilities despite that studies involving aquaculture effluents are only focused on antibiotics degradation without assessment of toxicity and or general quality of the treated effluent choi et al 2020 kye et al 2020 as is also the case of many other studies dealing with ozonation for the removal of antibiotics from different water matrices in this work the possibility of applying ozonation to aquaculture effluents aiming at the removal of different antibiotics commonly used in these farms ff otc sulfadimethoxine sdm sulfamethoxazole smx and tmp table 1 was investigated firstly the degradation of target compounds was studied in batch mode where different parameters such as the role of hydroxyl radicals ho and water matrix were evaluated afterwards the removal of target antibiotics was also assessed in a continuous flow mode for which more realistic conditions were applied environmentally relevant antibiotic concentrations low o3 concentration and short hydraulic retention time hrt the potential toxicity effects of the continuous ozonated effluents were then estimated using zebrafish embryo assays 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all reference antibiotic standards ff otc sdm smx and tmp as well as the internal standard sdm d6 were purchased from

normalized concentrations of the target antibiotics spiked in ultrapure water 10 mg l 1 of each antibiotic in the ozonation experiments 60 min 50 g nm 3 ph 6 among the five tested antibiotics ff otc sdm smx and tmp only sdm was not completely removed in 60 min asdm p 0 05 i e sdm was the only compound with a concentration higher than the detection limit after 60 min of ozonation otc and smx were the compounds with faster degradation showing removals of 85 and 74 respectively in 10 min of contact time with o3 these antibiotics and tmp were not detected in any of the 30 min treated samples regarding ff a slower degradation was observed but it was fully removed after 60 min in the case of sdm a fast removal is depicted in the first 10 min of reaction followed by a slower removal after that period a maximum removal of 82 being achieved in 60 min of ozonation it is well known that organic contaminants can be removed in ozonation by direct and indirect modes depending on whether direct attack of o3 or reaction with generated radicals in particular ho respectively occurs peleg 1976 as can be seen in table 1 all the studied antibiotics have reaction rate kinetic constants above 105 m 1 s 1 with o3 k o3 except ff 10 m 1 s 1 this observation agrees with the slower degradation observed for ff in fig 1a the k o3 are higher for the other antibiotics because the amino groups are expected to activate the aromatic rings and double bonds of the chemical structures ben et al 2012 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in fact sulfonamides tetracyclines and tmp are antibiotics for which ozonation has demonstrated high removal efficiencies mainly by direct oxidation gireli et al 2019 ikehata et al 2006 kuang et al 2013 lin et al 2009 wang et al 2011 whereas poor removals have been reported for ff choi et al 2020 khan et al 2020 kye et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 thus the degradation of ff observed in fig 1a closed circles seems to be related to an indirect oxidation pathway by the reaction with ho to infer about the role of ho and other possible radicals in the degradation of these antibiotics meoh was added to ultrapure water in the second set of experiments fig 1b the removal of ff was negligible 5 indicating that the indirect oxidation pathway is crucial for its removal as confirmed by the significant differences of anova analysis between ultrapure water with and without addition of scavenger bff fig 1b it is known that ho is generated after a series of reactions which starts with the primary reaction between o3 and hydroxide ions present in water eqs s1 14 in supplementary material meaning that the formation of ho can be accelerated by increasing the ph von gunten 2003 in the present study a ph of 6 was sufficient to remove ff in 60 min of ozonation fig 1a unlike ff otc smx and tmp were removed in less time in the presence of meoh but the differences were not significant fig 1a vs 1b p 0 05 in any case the radical scavenger consumes ho and without regenerating the superoxide radical ion o2 the o3 decomposition may be retarded eqs s4 and s7 respectively thus o3 being available for direct attack langlais et al 1991 anova analysis also suggested that ho did not affect sdm degradation asdm fig 1b thus these results confirmed that otc smx tmp and sdm are preferentially removed by direct oxidation a set of additional experiments without meoh was performed with ff alone and adding each one of the other antibiotics to ff in ultrapure water fig s1a supplementary material interestingly these other antibiotics affected the ff degradation when simultaneously present in the solution perhaps due to the readily o3 consumption by direct attack of either parent otc smx tmp and sdm or their intermediate compounds complementary experiments with sdm also suggested that the co existence of the other four antibiotics affected its own removal fig s1b supplementary material perhaps by generating by products that can react with sdm beyond the chemical properties of the compounds the water matrix can also affect the degradation of antibiotics as shown in fig 1c the matrix under analysis i e aquaculture effluents impacted considerably the sdm removal bsdm the degradation of sdm increased approximately 20 when the aquaculture effluent was tested instead of ultrapure water however the potential interference of ho favoured by the higher ph of aquaculture effluent 8 vs 6 does not justify this enhancement since these reactive species did not have a remarkable removal effect in the smd removal fig 1b these results are in accordance with a recent study on ozonation of sdm shad et al 2018 where the important role of the water matrix in its degradation was also highlighted the co existence of cations and anions e g fe3 cu2 nh4 hco3 and no3 in the aqueous medium may play a catalytic role in ozonation of sdm shad et al 2018 which might result in its larger removal in the aquaculture effluents fig 1c furthermore ff degradation was also affected by water matrix cff following the tendency of the experiments carried out in the presence of meoh fig 1c despite the ph of this matrix ph of 8 being more favourable to the decomposition of o3 into ho the matrix constituents may have acted as inhibitors of the formation of ho or instead they might have consumed the generated radicals this also supports the higher removal of sdm in the more complex matrix since such ho inhibitors can reduce the decay of o3 leading to an accelerated degradation of sdm which is mainly removed by o3 direct attack the complexity and diversity of water matrices turn difficult to predict their impact as initiator promoter or inhibitor during ozonation cai and lin 2016 lado ribeiro et al 2019 as such the fraction of o3 and ho and other possible reactive radicals which effectively oxidizes the antibiotics is highly dependent on the action of all co existing substances in the water matrix staehelin and hoigne 1985 thus the collected aquaculture effluent with physico chemical characterization shown in table s1 supplementary material probably suppressed the effect of ho on ff removal which did not exceeded 40 in contrast otc smx tmp and sdm were efficiently eliminated from the aquaculture effluent in 60 min to levels below method detection limits moreover it is also perceptible that aquaculture effluents had good water quality indicators table s1 supplementary material and therefore a more complex matrix i e with higher organic content and or ammonia concentration among others could affect antibiotics kinetic degradation since a higher competition could occur between the species susceptible to oxidation by o3 3 1 2 continuous flow mode ozonation experiments the degradation of antibiotics in continuous flow ozonation was investigated for an hrt of 10 min corresponding to a ts of 33 min applying an o3 concentration of 1 5 mg l 1 as referred above these selected conditions were based on the information available in the literature regarding ozonation at full scale aquaculture systems for disinfection gonçalves and gagnon 2011 summerfelt 2003 summerfelt and hochheimer 1997 and our previous study focused on ozonation for the removal of several other organic micropollutants from surface water gorito et al 2021 for these experiments the aquaculture effluent was spiked with 100 ng l 1 of each antibiotic ff otc sdm smx and tmp i e the spiked level was considerably lower than in batch experiments hundreds of ng l 1 instead of tens of mg l 1 mimicking concentrations frequently detected in aquaculture effluents pereira et al 2015 tetzner and rath 2018 zou et al 2011 in fig 2 closed circles top axis it is possible to verify some deviations between the predicted and achieved concentrations of these spiked compounds i e ranging from 80 to 220 ng l 1 which can be for instance related to the occurrence of the antibiotics in the collected effluent table s2 supplementary material matrix effects or other possible interferences removals above 98 were observed for tmp sdm otc smx whereas ff did not surpass 68 fig 2 grey bars p 0 05 therefore in these experiments ff was the only compound recalcitrant to o3 its degradation being highly influenced by the presence of ho as confirmed in the previous sub section the action of ho will depend on the composition of the matrix to be treated and thus it is very difficult to predict the removal extent of ff the degradation of ff in aquaculture waters has been also investigated by applying uv and uv photocatalysis removals in the ranges of 4 85 and 98 100 being respectively registered gorito et al 2022 thus combining uv or h2o2 with ozonation can be an interesting alternative in future works to enhance the production of ho and consequently the more efficient degradation of ff however the respective costs should also be considered when selecting one of these alternatives cuerda correa et al 2020 3 2 influence of continuous ozonation on the general quality of aquaculture effluent among the target ions ammonium bromate bromide calcium chloride magnesium nitrate nitrite phosphate potassium sodium and sulphate nitrite and ammonium were never detected while magnesium was always below the method quantification limit 0 4 mg l 1 table s1 supplementary material before treatment calcium chloride nitrate phosphate potassium sodium and sulphate ions were detected at concentrations of respectively 0 2 6 3 3 8 3 2 1 3 6 3 and 1 1 mg l 1 table s1 supplementary material values which were similar after ozonation except a slight difference for potassium ion 0 3 mg l 1 moreover bromide ions were oxidized to bromates after reaction with o3 fig s2 supplementary material likewise if nitrites were present above the detection limits in the aquaculture effluent it would also be expectable that they were oxidised to nitrates baozhen et al 1989 lin and wu 1996 as expected results of ions analysis suggested that apart from bromides and bromates ozonation had a low impact on the ionic composition of the spiked aquaculture effluent the aquaculture effluent had a very low organic load cod was lower than the method detection limit 3 5 mg l 1 and doc was quantified at approximately 2 mg l 1 table s1 supplementary material the protein rich wastes from aquaculture systems typically have cod doc and ammonia concentrations often higher than those detected in the current study however the selected aquaculture farm is characterized by low rates of fish production with an adequate distribution of organisms by ample ponds and the water supplied to this farm comes from a location very close to the source of the river which probably contributed to these originally unexpected values still doc slightly decreased 4 after ozonation typically o3 is a powerful oxidant of aromatic compounds still it reacts slowly with low molecular weight carboxylic acids that are often formed from these parent compounds which can lead to the accumulation of several by products that cannot be easily oxidized by molecular o3 moreira et al 2015 in any case the theoretical doc due to the five mps corresponds to less than 0 3 of the initial doc content since they are present at very low concentrations fig 2 regarding the particulate matter o3 eliminated approximately 60 of tss 3 3 toxicity

the potential risks of removing antibiotics from aquaculture effluents with o3 the assays carried out in this work fulfilled all the validation criteria of the oecd guidelines 212 and 236 oecd 1998 2013 namely at the end of the exposure period the negative control group had a low mortality 10 and a hatching success above 80 while embryos exposed to 3 4 dichloroaniline positive control registered a mortality above 30 fig 3 these results allowed to completely validate the applied methodology results for mortality and hatching obtained for the treated and non treated aquaculture effluent are presented in fig 3 focusing on the mortality fig 3a no significant mortality was elicited either by the aquaculture effluent the spiked effluent or the ozonated effluent treatment for the negative control and the tested effluent squares and triangles fig 3a mortality occurred mostly during the first 48 h of exposure which is in accordance with the expected outcome of these types of toxicological assays the first 48 h of zebrafish development are critical not only all the major gastrulation and segmentation processes occur in this period but also defence mechanisms against external contamination are not fully maturated at this time frame chen et al 2020 fischer et al 2013 kimmel et al 1995 hatching fig 3b occurred mainly between 48 hpf and 72hpf as described in the literature kimmel et al 1995 however significant differences among experimental conditions were found in the time to hatching compared to the controls chi square 66 0 degrees of freedom df 6 p 0 00001 the subsequent pairwise comparisons showed that hatching was significantly anticipated in the spiked aquaculture effluent chi square 24 8 df 2 p 0 00001 and the treated aquaculture effluent chi square 39 4 df 2 p 0 00001 table 2 shows the median time to hatching ht50 obtained for each experimental condition according to these results embryos exposed to the spiked effluent took 10 h less than the control to hatch while those exposed to the treated effluent took 13 h less the implications of premature hatching are yet to be fully understood it has been observed previously that premature hatching in zebrafish may occur upon exposure to ionic stress ord 2019 hypoxia small et al 2020 or toxic substances such as tributyltin liang et al 2017 the work of ord 2019 seems to support that premature hatching may be an adaptive response allowing for animals to escape unfavourable conditions in contrast the investigation of leite ferreira et al 2019 suggests differential sensitivity to alcohol of premature and late hatching zebrafish larvae with stronger responses of premature larvae to high exposure concentrations compared to late hatching ones further investigations will help understanding the implications of such anticipation in relation to treatment benefits to water quality statistically significant differences among test conditions were observed for the rate of malformations chi square 72 9 df 3 p 0 00001 fig 4 the pairwise comparisons indicated a significantly higher proportion of abnormal embryos at 168 hpf in the aquaculture effluent fisher exact test p 0 00001 compared to control embryos and the spiked aquaculture effluent fisher exact test p 0 0005 compared to controls fig 4d yolk sac malformations side wide position and skeletal deformities were the most prevalent abnormalities found all interfering with larvae swimming and thus their ability to feed and escape predators fig 4a b c though less prevalent alterations in the blood circulation and heartbeat could also be observed data not shown nevertheless in the group exposed to the effluent treated with continuous ozonation the rate of malformations was very low and comparable to the control group fisher exact test p 0 672 overall the results suggest that the ozonation treatment would effectively reduce the toxicity of the aquaculture effluent improving water quality for the development of the embryos therefore the by products generated during ozonation were not harmful to zebrafish bromate was detected at 6 µg l 1 in treated effluent samples however in marine aquaculture o3 may result in bromate concentrations considerable higher because of the large amount of bromide in seawater 60 mg l 1 camera roda et al 2019 kye et al 2020 investigation on toxicity effects of bromate ions in zebrafish are still scarce but studies for sodium and potassium bromate have reported embryotoxic effects only at very high concentrations 1 g l 1 teixidó et al 2015 wang et al 2016 it is important to refer that zebrafish toxicity tests for ozonated aquaculture effluents were performed in this study for the first time with encouraging results 4 conclusions batch ozonation experiments with antibiotics at 10 mg l 1 each 60 min of treatment showed that this process was efficient for removing tmp otc and smx from aqueous matrices 30 min and that direct o3 attack is the main degradation pathway in contrast ff was not removed by direct o3 attack however the results of this work reveal that ff can be successfully oxidized by the indirect reaction pathway i e through ho generation sdm was fully eliminated from the aquaculture effluent but its degradation was highly influenced by the selected water matrix additionally in continuous flow ozonation experiments with antibiotics at 100 ng l 1 each 10 min of treatment all antibiotics were successfully removed from the aquaculture effluent 98 except ff 68 thus ff removal should be enhanced by promoting the formation of ho complementary analysis showed that bromates 6 µg l 1 and other reaction by products are formed in the medium during ozonation treatment however endpoints of the zebrafish assays mortality hatching and malformations did not reveal toxicity after o3 treatment molecular biochemical and genetic biomarkers e g genotoxicity oxidative stress endocrine disruption and neurotoxicity can also be used to assess the possible toxicity effects on zebrafish and thus more specific analysis can be addressed in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

16006,ammonia recovery from centrate of an anaerobic digester was investigated using an onsite bipolar electrodialysis bp ed pilot scale plant coupled to two liquid liquid membrane contactor llmc modules to investigate the process performance and robustness the pilot plant was operated at varying current densities load ratio current to nitrogen loading and in continuous and intermittent current donnan mode a higher load ratio led to higher total ammonium nitrogen tan sum of ammonia and ammonium removal efficiency whereas the increase in the applied current did not have a significant impact the tan removal efficiency continuous current application resulted in the higher tan removal compared with the donnan dialysis mode the lowest specific energy consumption of 6 3 kwh kgn 1 was recorded in the donnan mode with the load ratio of 1 4 at 200 l h 1 flowrate and current density of 75 a m 2 lower energy demand observed in the donnan mode was likely due to the lower scaling and fouling of the ion exchange membranes nevertheless scaling and fouling limited the operation of the bp ed stack in all operational modes which had to be interrupted by the daily cleaning procedures the llmc module enabled a highly selective recovery of ammonia as ammonium sulfate nh4 2so4 with the concentration of ammonia ranging from 19 to 33 gn l 1 however the analysis of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass in the obtained nh4 2so4 product revealed the presence of 212 253 ng l 1 of 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonate fts a common substitute of legacy pfas given the very low concentrations of 6 2 fts i e 2 ng l 1 encountered in the concentrated stream 6 2 fts was likely released from the teflon based components in the sulfuric acid dosage line thus careful selection of the pilot plant tubing pumps and other components is required to avoid any risks associated with the pfas presence and ensure safe use of the final product as fertilizer graphical abstarct image graphical abstract keywords bipolar membrane electrodialysis pilot scale ammonia recovery membrane stripping pfas 1 introduction nitrogen removal from wastewater is one of the most energy intensive processes in conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps as 77 of their total electric energy consumption is used for aeration during the activated sludge process including nitrification mccarty et al 2011 svardal and kroiss 2011 the nitrification denitrification process which converts ammonia to n2 requires around 42 45 mj kgn 1 maurer et al 2003 mulder 2003 in addition wwtps account for 2 8 3 2 of the global anthropogenic emission of n2o a greenhouse gas with a 298 times higher global warming potential than that of co2 law et al 2012 n2o emissions therefore account for 83 of the overall plant carbon footprint of wwtps daelman et al 2013 at the same time production of ammonia from n2 through haber bosch process requires 37 45 mj kgn 1 maurer et al 2003 and is responsible for 1 2 of the primary global energy consumption kitano et al 2012 tallaksen et al 2015 for all these reasons the recovery of nitrogen from wastewater as a useful fertilizer can help to reduce the enormous energy and environmental footprint of an out of balance nitrogen cycle rockström et al 2009 a substantial fraction of the global macronutrient requirements can be recovered from waste streams as it contains up to 100 of phosphorus and potassium and up to 50 of nitrogen batstone et al 2015 for the recovery of total ammonium nitrogen tan sum of ammonia and ammonium nitrogen from these waste streams several technologies have been tested at bench scale such as forward osmosis membrane filtration membrane distillation ion exchange and electrodialysis ed maurer et al 2006 zarebska et al 2015 ed has gained significant attention in recent years as it can produce a concentrated and relatively pure product stream at lower energy consumption compared to other membrane based technologies kuntke et al 2018 maurer et al 2006 van linden et al 2020 xie et al 2016 the ed process relies on charge based fractionation of ions using ion exchange membranes iems ed employs both anion exchange membranes aems and cation exchange membranes cems to concentrate anions and cations when ed is applied to an ammonium ammonia rich waste stream positively charged ammonium nh4 and other cations are forced to move through a cation exchange membrane cem into a concentrate stream by applying an electrical current this ed principle for ammonium removal has been investigate for different wastewater urine pronk et al 2006 rodríguez arredondo et al 2017 supernatant of anaerobic digester or centrate thompson brewster et al 2017 ward et al 2018 and swine manure ippersiel et al 2012 mondor et al 2009 2008 the products of this ed process are a concentrate salt solution with ammonium concentrate and a partially desalinated wastewater diluate one of the limitations identified in an ed system based on cems aems was that the ph of the concentrate solution was not high enough to convert ionic ammonium nh4 to volatile nh3 ippersiel et al 2012 rodrigues et al 2020a proposed using bipolar membranes bpms instead of aems to enable selective ammonia recovery in a stacked bipolar electrodialysis bp ed system a bpm consists of a cation and an anion exchange layer that allow for transport of protons and hydroxyl ions which are produced at the junction of both layers through the dissociation of water the produced protons and hydroxyl ions lead to an acidic diluate ph 6 and an alkaline concentrate stream ph 8 thereby ammonium can be removed from the diluate and recovered from the concentrate stream huang and xu 2006 pärnamäe et al 2021 rodrigues et al 2020a in their minimal bp ed design and using a synthetic wastewater rodrigues et al 2020a achieved a 80 tan at 100 a m 2 while consuming 18 3 kj gn 1 of electrical energy in a laboratory scale 6 cell pairs system larger scale application of ed is usually achieved by stacking multiple cell pairs diluate and concentrate defined by cems aems and or bpms on top of each other recently a pilot scale ed unit 30 cell pairs of cems aems was presented for the treatment supernatant from a domestic anaerobic digester centrate which achieved a concentrated product of nh4 7 1 g l 1 and k 2 5 g l 1 at an energy input of 4 9 1 5 kwh kgn 1 ward et al 2018 unfortunately this concentrated nh4 product contained high concentrations of sodium making it less suitable as fertilizer under alkaline conditions selective ammonia nh3 recovery from the concentrate stream can be achieved by nh3 stripping for example by using a liquid liquid membrane contactor llmc module the llmc module uses hydrophobic gas permeable hollow fibres to recover nh3 gas into an acid solution the driving force for nh3 transport is the difference in concentrations between the two solutions concentrate and acid rodríguez arredondo et al 2017 ulbricht et al 2013 another major bottleneck for the application of bp ed like systems for tan recovery from wastewater is the risk of fouling and scaling on the iems scaling of the iems lead to an increased energy consumption due to the increasing membrane resistance and eventually operational failure of the ed systems strategies for scaling mitigation include pretreatment by coagulation filtration ion exchange struvite precipitation hao et al 2015 ward et al 2018 zamora et al 2017 chemical or mechanical cleaning and donnan dialysis rijnaarts et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2021 a recent study demonstrated that donnan dialysis delayed the scaling and formation of calcite on cems allowing for a longer operation of a laboratory scale ed system without the interruption for cleaning rodrigues et al 2021 under suitable conditions donnan dialysis can exchange na k mg2 and ca2 from the concentrate stream with ammonium from the diluate stream leading to a higher tan recovery rodrigues et al 2020b furthermore the centrate of anaerobic digester typically contains a significant load of organic pollutants with per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass being of particular concern due to their persistency toxicity mobility and bioaccumulation potential zhou et al 2019 pfass are frequently detected in both biosolids and digestate from wwtps in europe and elsewhere brambilla et al 2016 clarke and smith 2011 venkatesan and halden 2013 given the very low pka values pka 2 and high ion mobility of the negatively charged linear chain pfas radjenovic et al 2020 they will be transported in the electric field sörengård et al 2019 and thus may electromigrate through the ion exchange membranes including bpms blommaert et al 2020 also due to the relative volatility of some pfass e g pfoa and shorter chain perfluorocarboxylic acids witteveen bos and tte consultant 2016 their fate within the llmc module should be evaluated in this study we present the operational results of a pilot scale life newbies nitrogen extraction from water by an innovative electrochemical system installation based on bp ed comprised of 65 cell pairs coupled to two llmc modules and treating centrate of the anaerobic digester the pilot was operated either in continuous mode constant current and donnan mode intermittent current to investigate the impact of donnan dialysis on the process performance in terms of ammonia recovery membrane scaling fouling and energy consumption in addition we have investigated the impact of long term membrane scaling fouling on the bp ed performance applied cleaning strategies to remove scaling fouling and tested the effect of the applied cleaning strategies on membrane selectivity and resistance the primary objective was to demonstrate the feasibility of using bp ed and llmc for selective extraction and recovery of ammonia from anaerobic digestate and determine the optimum operational conditions to achieve satisfactory nh4 n product concentration and energy consumption to understand the potential hazard posed by pfas in the recovery of ammonia from waste streams using the bp ed llmc we studied the fate of legacy pfas namely c4 c8 perfluorocarboxylic

the newbies pilot plant was anaerobic digester centrate obtained after centrifuging the mixed liquor effluent of the anaerobic digester of a wwtp treating municipal wastewater centrifugation of the mixed liquor effluent of the anaerobic digester was done with the addition of kemira superfloc sd 6081 coagulant the wwtp is located in girona catalonia spain with a design capacity of 27 500 inhabitants equivalent and 55 000 m3 d 1 the primary and secondary sludge are treated in two mesophilic digesters operating at 35 c after digestion the digestate is centrifuged and the reject water i e centrate is directed to the inlet of the plant for its treatment the characteristics of the centrate are summarized in the supplementary material fig s1 and table s1 fig 1 shows the schematic of the newbies pilot installation the centrate was collected in a 10 m3 tank that allowed settling hrt 12 h of the suspended solids fig 1 and thus minimized the clogging of the 10 µm filters installed at the entrance of the pilot plant the centrate was then introduced into the bp ed stack diluate compartment using a membrane pump dda 200 4 grundfos nederland b v almere the netherlands due to the applied current ammonium and other cations were transported through a cem to a concentrate compartment concentrate the concentrate was recirculated using another membrane pump dda 200 4 the bp ed module of

recorded operational data volume conductivity ph applied current and voltage 2 2 operating conditions the pilot plant was operated either with intermittent current donnan mode or constant current continuous mode besides these two operational modes we studied the performance of the system at two load ratios l n 1 4 and 1 8 and three current densities j a m 2 50 75 and 100 a m 2 the ln is defined as the ratio between the applied j and total ammonia nitrogen tan feeding rate both expressed as current rodríguez arredondo et al 2017 l n j a m c t a n f e e d i n f l o w q f e e d f where c t a n f e e d i n f l o w is the molar concentration of tan in the centrate mol m 3 q f e e d is the feed inflow rate m3 s 1 f the faraday constant 96 485 c mol 1 and a m is the surface area of the cation exchange membrane 3 15 m2 l n equal to 1 is when the tan loading and the applied current are equal sufficient l n 1 means that there is more tan than the current can transport deficit whereas a l n 1 means that there is more current than tan excess rodríguez arredondo et al 2017 table 1 summarizes the operating conditions conducted at the newbies pilot plant in the donnan mode current was applied intermittently current switched on for 20 s and off for 60 s defining one donnan cycle in this mode the centrate was only supplied to the pilot during the 20 s in a cycle when current is supplied therefore the flow rate of the feed pump was adjusted to achieve the ln as intended when calculated over a complete duration of one donnan cycle two values of l n were applied 1 4 low and 1 8 high by varying the applied j 50 75 and 100 a m 2 and the feed pump flow rate 100 132 150 and 200 l h 1 these values were selected to be similar to and slightly higher than the l n of 1 3 that has been determined as theoretically ideal to achieve a high ammonia removal efficiency kuntke et al 2018 rodríguez arredondo et al 2017 experiments in the donnan mode were operated for 24 h and in continuous mode for 6 h to ensure equal amount of electric charge was applied during each experiment data from the runs conducted in donnan mode are calculated as average per minute because of the large difference in the values in the on and off time the experiment d75 low was repeated to demonstrate the reproducibility of the results calculations of the key performance indicators kpis of the pilot plant such as ammonia removal efficiency re specific energy consumption se kwh kgn 1 and ammonia transport over the llmc modules are summarized in the supplementary material text s1 fouling and scaling in the bp ed stack were removed using a cleaning in place cip strategy described in the supplementary material text s2 after completing the pilot experiment the bp ed stack was disassembled

method are described in the supplementary material text s4 tables s2 and s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 newbies pilot system performance in order to evaluate the pilot bp ed system performance the system was operated in either continuous mode or donnan mode and at two different load ratios ln of 1 8 or 1 4 3 1 1 tan removal increases with increasing load ratio and decreases over the course of one experiment fig 2 shows that the tan removal in the pilot scale bp ed for continuous a and donnan mode b the tan removal efficiency in continuous and donnan mode depended on both the applied j and the ln which is in accordance with earlier results and the ln model higher ln leads to higher tan removal efficiencies desloover et al 2012 kuntke et al 2018 rodríguez arredondo et al 2017 a higher current density did not directly increase the tan removal efficiency but increased the amount of treated centrate resulting in a higher treatment capacity for example when the bp ed system was operated in donnan mode at 50 a m 2 runs d50 low and d50 high conducted with an ln of 1 4 and 1 8 resulted in 41 8 and 58 1 of tan removal after 2 h of operation respectively at the same current density in continuous mode a higher ln of 1 8 c50 high yielded higher tan removal 52 9 57 4 whereas in the case of lower ln of 1 4 c50 low it was 34 5 35 5 in the first 1 h of operation fig 2 also shows that the tan removal decreased over the operational time in all runs with the highest tan removal achieved at the beginning of each run the replicate experiments d75 low1 and d75 low2 show almost identical removal efficiencies figs 2 and s2 conductivity and ph values in diluate and concentrate stream respectively table s5 the tan removal decrease was a consequence of membrane fouling and scaling that gradually worsened the reactor performance and had a detrimental impact on the removal and recovery of ammonia rodrigues et al 2021 nonetheless the employed cleaning strategy of the diluate and concentrate compartment restored the functioning of the system at least to some extend after each run 3 1 2 tan removal rate flowed the expected pattern especially in donnan mode a higher current leads to a higher tan removal rate table 2 shows the obtained tan removal rates in general the tan removal rate was higher in continuous mode than in donnan mode the difference in the operational mode leads to a difference in the membrane transport i e ion migration and diffusion processes rodrigues et al 2021 2020b in the continuous mode at an applied current density of 50 a m 2 and a ln of 1 8 the bp ed system was able to remove up to 562 4 gn d 1 with a corresponding tan transport rate of 178 8 gn m 2 d 1 in the donnan mode at an applied current density of 50 a m 2 and a ln of 1 8 the bp ed system was able to remove up to 131 2 gn d 1 with a corresponding tan transport rate of 41 7 gn m 2 d 1 although these amounts and removal rates are slightly lower than the rates reported in literature at similar current densities to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that such a large scale system was operated at realistic conditions complex wastewater onsite a wwtp while rodrigues et al 2020 reported a removal rate of 363 gn m 2 d 1 using synthetic wastewater and a laboratory scale version of this technology at 50 a m 2 rodrigues et al 2020a ward et al 2018 reported 100 gn m 2 d 1 0 3 mol nh4 m 2 h 1 in a similar sized ed system 3 6 m2 cems operated in the laboratory using digestate after struvite precipitation at 20 a m 2 ward et al 2018 the observed tan transport numbers range between 0 4 and 0 1 which is lower than the transport number reported for ed based systems 0 6 0 4 rodrigues et al 2020a ward et al 2018 the tan transport numbers decrease considerably during each experiment fig s3 these results indicate that next to scaling of the iems also nh3 diffusion or ionic short circuits may have impacted the system performance he and cussler 1992 veerman et al 2008 vorobiev et al 2002 in general the bp ed cell voltage fig 3 and therefore the specific energy demand obtained during the intermittent i e donnan mode of operation was found to be lower than in the continuous mode the lowest energy consumption 6 3 and 6 5 kwh kgn 1 were obtained in runs d75 low1 and d75 low2 respectively i e donnan mode ln 1 4 75 a m 2 200 l h 1 table 1 although this run resulted in the somewhat lower tan removal efficiency compared to the runs conducted at higher ln it is likely that the application of higher feed flowrate was beneficial for the removal of scale from the system thus leading to a lower total cell potential and power consumption previous study with pilot scale ed treatment of centrate reported an even lower energy consumption 4 9 kwh kgn 1 ward et al 2018 this was likely due to less scaling of the membranes and the lower applied current density 20 a m 2 in order to prevent the scaling in the ed system ward et al pretreated the centrate in a struvite crystallizer system which reduced the amount of mg2 and phosphate ward et al 2018 also the bpms used in the newbies pilot have a higher ohmic resistance as they need an additional electric potential for the dissociation of water pärnamäe et al 2021 3 2 water transport over the llmc limited the obtainable ammonia product concentration the obtained product concentrations of 19 33 gn l 1 2 3 wt table 2 were less than half the concentration reached using a higher concentrated h2so4 96 naoh solution 50 and a heat assisted up to 50 c llmc process i e 2 1 m nh4 2so4 56 gn l 1 ulbricht et al 2013 recently ammonia recovery using membrane contactors focused specifically on treating concentrated highly alkaline streams originating from wwtp vecino et al 2019 used a two step hf llmc to recover ammonia from zeolite regeneration brine nh3 4 5 g l 1 and naoh 80 g l 1 achieving high removals 94 and high nitrogen concentration 7 8 wt 80 gn l 1 using phosphoric acid vecino et al 2019 using nitric acid vecino et al 2020 reached up to 10 1 wt nitrogen accounting for both nh4 n and no3 n using llmc and further increased the product concentration to 15 6 wt nitrogen using a subsequent electrodialysis step vecino et al 2020 the work of vecino also showed the need for ammonia pre concentration ion exchange using zeolite and pre treatment granular activated carbon for organic matter removal vecino et al 2020 2019 the bp ed llmc process presented in this work only requires settling and a prefilter furthermore nitric acid and phosphoric acid are expensive compared to sulfuric acid due to energy intensive production process hno3 and raw material scarcity rock phosphate rockström et al 2009 water transport across the membrane contactor severely affects the obtainable nutrient concentration ulbricht et al 2013 therefore ammonia recovery using llmc can be optimized i e number of units alignment configuration flow conditions direction and acid choice to maximize the nutrient content of the product stream reig et al 2021 nonetheless recent work showed the effectiveness of ammonium sulfate fertilizer 21 gn l 1 recovered with a bp ed llmc system rodrigues et al 2022 rodrigues et al demonstrated comparable performances of bp ed llmc recovered fertilizers to the performance of commercial fertilizer in growth experiments with spinach and radish 3 2 1 operation mode donnan or continuous affects the scaling and transport of multivalent cation ions in the pilot scale bp ed the initial concentrations of ca2 65 4 mg l 1 and mg2 21 6 mg l 1 in the centrate were significantly lower compared to the ammonia concentration 485 mg l 1 table s1 however the impact of donnan mode on the removal of divalent cations i e ca2 mg2 was significant for example the removal of ca2 and mg2 at the end of the runs in the donnan mode was 76 and 57 for the applied l n of 1 4 d50 low whereas in the continuous mode the values were 37 and 30 c50 low respectively fig s2 likewise at the higher l n of 1 8 the removal efficiency of ca2 and mg2 at the end of the runs in the donnan mode was 85 and 64 and in the continuous mode it was 56 and 39 respectively fig s2 donnan dialysis is particularly effective for the removal and recovery of multivalent ions and cations of higher charge tend to concentrate preferentially over those of lower charge wallace 1967 3 2 2 analysis of the reusability of the ion exchange membranes after several months of operation the ed stacks were disassembled scaling was detected in the concentrate flow compartments fully covering the spacers separating the cem and bpm and completely filling the flow compartments in cell pairs from the cem side to the bpm side fig s4 in the case of the iems fouling is dependent on the charge of the membrane with aem being significantly more prone to fouling and scaling compared with cems due to their lower ion exchange capacity mondor et al 2009 in the conventional ed stack treating swine manure scaling of cems was negligible which was interpreted by the low contribution of ca2 to overall ion transport due to the higher mobility of nh4 and k mondor et al 2009 2008 in other studies caco3 was identified to be the dominant scalant for cems ayala bribiesca et al 2006 bazinet and araya farias 2005 similar to the newbies pilot plant where scaling of cems by the formed caco3 was significant moreover the deposits in those studies were formed in the interior of the membrane and could only be removed in the laboratory cleaning procedure to test if an acid cleaning procedure is effective in removing this scaling and leaving the membranes intact for reuse the membranes were removed from the stack and cleaned by soaking in 1 m hcl acid for three days this cleaning with acid removed completely the scale from the membranes fig s4c after cleaning both cems and bpms were subjected to selectivity and resistance tests in an external test cell to determine if their performance was affected by the cleaning procedure for the cem the voltage drop was 300 mv at an applied current of 110 ma 225 a m 2 for the pristine membrane and remained comparable at 310 mv for the used membrane after cleaning for the bpm the voltage drop at 110 ma 225 a m 2 was increased from 980 mv pristine to 1007 mv for the used membrane after cleaning the water splitting efficiency determined as the ph difference between the anode and cathode compartment remained unaffected after cleaning overall it can be concluded that the performance of the cem and bpm can be almost restored to pristine conditions 96 of the performance 3 2 3 presence and fate of pfass during ammonia recovery by bp ed from anaerobic digester centrate the analysis of the target pfas table s4 in the diluate and cation concentrate at the beginning and end of each run did not indicate a distinct decrease and increase respectively in their concentration in either of the current modes tested thus the migration diffusion of the pfas through the ion exchange membranes could not be confirmed fig s5 nevertheless the samples taken at t1 and t2 were grab samples and may not be representative of the entire system also differences in the total volume of the cation concentrate 8 l and the diluate 660 l as well as slight changes in the volume during the operation of the ed system due to electro osmosis make it difficult to make an accurate mass balance of the pfas according to the design of the ed unit fig 1 the negatively charged perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas would have to migrate across the bpms to reach the cation concentrate stream although the configuration of a bpm minimizes the transport of the charged species sata 2007 ions with a charge opposite of the fixed charge of the adjacent membrane layer e g negatively charged pfas facing the cation exchange layer of bpm can enter the membrane through diffusion and or migration depending on the current density applied blommaert et al 2020 the ion transport across the bpms is expected to decrease with the increasing molecular weight mw of the ion blommaert et al 2020 however c4 c8 pfcas and 6 2 fts are linear chain molecules with very low steric hindrance table s5 and may be adsorbed inside the membrane and not just on its surface migration over the ion exchange membrane may be less challenging than expected based on their mw roman et al 2019 the concentrations of the c4 c8 pfcas in the cation concentrate were significant in both continuous current and donnan mode i e 10 8 69 1 ng l 1 and 15 3 26 9 ng l 1 respectively fig s5b the cation concentrate did not contain any perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas in the continuous current mode and very low amounts of pfbs 1 8 0 2 ng l 1 pfhxs 1 6 0 6 ng l 1 and pfos 5 3 2 1 ng l 1 in donnan mode fig s5d previously adsorption of pfos and other sulfonates onto the membrane and other parts of the filtration system e g spacers was observed in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis liu et al 2021 and may be responsible for lower concentrations of pfsas nevertheless it is unclear whether the pfcas and pfsas are present in the cation concentrate due to their crossover from the diluate fig 4 or may be released from the fluoropolymers used in the production of bpms and cems thus the fate and behavior of the pfas within the ed unit requires further study under a more controlled conditions of a lab scale set up in continuous current mode the product contained 7 4 ng l 1 20 7 ng l 1 and 55 5 ng l 1 of pfoa pfhxa and pfba whereas in the donnan mode their concentrations were similar 11 0 ng l 1 18 6 ng l 1 and 68 8 ng l 1 respectively fig 4 6 2 fts was present in very low concentrations in the cation concentrate in both modes i e 1 9 and 1 7 ng l 1 in the continuous and donnan mode respectively nevertheless the product contained 6 2 fts in up to 253 5 ng l 1 in continuous current mode and 212 2 ng l 1 in donnan mode fig 4 given that the llmc membrane 3 m liqui cel is based on polypropylene fibers 3m 2021 elevated concentrations of 6 2 fts detected in the product are likely a consequence of its release from the teflon based components in the sulfuric acid dosage line e g tubing membrane based acid dosing pump for example 6 2 fts is often used as an alternative for pfos or pfoa as a polymer processing aid in the synthesis of fluoropolymers buck et al 2011 also low ng l 1 concentrations of pfcas were likely released in a similar manner although due to their moderate volatility their cross over through the gas permeable membrane cannot be excluded the evidence presented in this study in terms of pfcas and 6 2 fts presence in the product obtained during the nutrient recovery from centrate indicates that the ed nutrient recovery requires a careful selection of the tubing and pump connecting to the llmc modules due to the addition of pfos in the stockholm convention and other regulations 6 2 fts has been adopted as an alternative product in the market however several studies reported biotransformation of 6 2 fts to shorter chain acids such as 5 3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid 5 3 ftca perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea pfhxa and pfba zhang et al 2016 in the restriction report of european chemical agency echa on pfhxs its salts and pfhxs related substances 6 2 fts was reported acutely toxic echa 2021 the concentration of ammonia obtained in the final product of the ed stack was ranging from 19 to 33 gn l 1 table 2 thus the obtained nh4 2so4 product would likely be diluted 500 to 1000 times prior to its application is a fertilizer mohammad et al 1999 yi et al 2019 although the encountered low ng l 1 concentrations of pfass may not pose a risk for such application 6 2 fts would diluted to 0 25 5 ng l 1 their presence in the final product likely due to the leaching of the teflon based components in the system still merits attention due to their bioaccumulation in agricultural products bao et al 2020 4 conclusions the study demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of ammonia recovery from real wastewater using a pilot plant bp ed llmc system treating 150 l of anaerobic digester centrate per hour the operational stability of the pilot plant system during multiple cip cycles was successfully demonstrated showing that scaling of the ion exchange membranes may be resolved by using automated cleaning strategies bp ed coupled to llmc was capable of selective and efficient recovery of ammonia from anaerobic digester centrate in on site conditions the optimum operation of the pilot plant unit in terms of ammonia recovery and energy consumption was achieved in the intermittent current mode that takes advantage of the donnan dialysis and favors the exchange of ammonia over cations the newbies pilot plant could recover 235 7 gn d 1 consuming 6 3 kwh kgn 1 nevertheless given that there was no centrate pretreatment other than gravitational settling high concentrations of ca2 led to intense scaling of the cems in both continuous current and donnan mode thus successful application of this technology in full scale facilities may be hampered by the requirement for chemical additives for the regeneration of the membranes and difficulties with the continuous operation of the reactor due to the necessity to implement cleaning procedures besides the conducted acid rinse complementary strategies for the on site control of cems fouling and scaling may include pre treatment to remove ca2 and other ions that may precipitate e g mg2 using struvite crystallization the presence of 212 253 ng l 1 of 6 2 fts in the obtained ammonium sulfate product suggested its release from the teflon based components in the sulfuric acid dosage line which was an unexpected result and difficult to be foreseen in more fundamental studies conducted at laboratory scale thus careful selection of the pilot plant tubing pumps and other components is required to avoid any risks associated with the pfas presence and ensure safe use of the final product as fertilizer declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16006,ammonia recovery from centrate of an anaerobic digester was investigated using an onsite bipolar electrodialysis bp ed pilot scale plant coupled to two liquid liquid membrane contactor llmc modules to investigate the process performance and robustness the pilot plant was operated at varying current densities load ratio current to nitrogen loading and in continuous and intermittent current donnan mode a higher load ratio led to higher total ammonium nitrogen tan sum of ammonia and ammonium removal efficiency whereas the increase in the applied current did not have a significant impact the tan removal efficiency continuous current application resulted in the higher tan removal compared with the donnan dialysis mode the lowest specific energy consumption of 6 3 kwh kgn 1 was recorded in the donnan mode with the load ratio of 1 4 at 200 l h 1 flowrate and current density of 75 a m 2 lower energy demand observed in the donnan mode was likely due to the lower scaling and fouling of the ion exchange membranes nevertheless scaling and fouling limited the operation of the bp ed stack in all operational modes which had to be interrupted by the daily cleaning procedures the llmc module enabled a highly selective recovery of ammonia as ammonium sulfate nh4 2so4 with the concentration of ammonia ranging from 19 to 33 gn l 1 however the analysis of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass in the obtained nh4 2so4 product revealed the presence of 212 253 ng l 1 of 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonate fts a common substitute of legacy pfas given the very low concentrations of 6 2 fts i e 2 ng l 1 encountered in the concentrated stream 6 2 fts was likely released from the teflon based components in the sulfuric acid dosage line thus careful selection of the pilot plant tubing pumps and other components is required to avoid any risks associated with the pfas presence and ensure safe use of the final product as fertilizer graphical abstarct image graphical abstract keywords bipolar membrane electrodialysis pilot scale ammonia recovery membrane stripping pfas 1 introduction nitrogen removal from wastewater is one of the most energy intensive processes in conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps as 77 of their total electric energy consumption is used for aeration during the activated sludge process including nitrification mccarty et al 2011 svardal and kroiss 2011 the nitrification denitrification process which converts ammonia to n2 requires around 42 45 mj kgn 1 maurer et al 2003 mulder 2003 in addition wwtps account for 2 8 3 2 of the global anthropogenic emission of n2o a greenhouse gas with a 298 times higher global warming potential than that of co2 law et al 2012 n2o emissions therefore account for 83 of the overall plant carbon footprint of wwtps daelman et al 2013 at the same time production of ammonia from n2 through haber bosch process requires 37 45 mj kgn 1 maurer et al 2003 and is responsible for 1 2 of the primary global energy consumption kitano et al 2012 tallaksen et al 2015 for all these reasons the recovery of nitrogen from wastewater as a useful fertilizer can help to reduce the enormous energy and environmental footprint of an out of balance nitrogen cycle rockström et al 2009 a substantial fraction of the global macronutrient requirements can be recovered from waste streams as it contains up to 100 of phosphorus and potassium and up to 50 of nitrogen batstone et al 2015 for the recovery of total ammonium nitrogen tan sum of ammonia and ammonium nitrogen from these waste streams several technologies have been tested at bench scale such as forward osmosis membrane filtration membrane distillation ion exchange and electrodialysis ed maurer et al 2006 zarebska et al 2015 ed has gained significant attention in recent years as it can produce a concentrated and relatively pure product stream at lower energy consumption compared to other membrane based technologies kuntke et al 2018 maurer et al 2006 van linden et al 2020 xie et al 2016 the ed process relies on charge based fractionation of ions using ion exchange membranes iems ed employs both anion exchange membranes aems and cation exchange membranes cems to concentrate anions and cations when ed is applied to an ammonium ammonia rich waste stream positively charged ammonium nh4 and other cations are forced to move through a cation exchange membrane cem into a concentrate stream by applying an electrical current this ed principle for ammonium removal has been investigate for different wastewater urine pronk et al 2006 rodríguez arredondo et al 2017 supernatant of anaerobic digester or centrate thompson brewster et al 2017 ward et al 2018 and swine manure ippersiel et al 2012 mondor et al 2009 2008 the products of this ed process are a concentrate salt solution with ammonium concentrate and a partially desalinated wastewater diluate one of the limitations identified in an ed system based on cems aems was that the ph of the concentrate solution was not high enough to convert ionic ammonium nh4 to volatile nh3 ippersiel et al 2012 rodrigues et al 2020a proposed using bipolar membranes bpms instead of aems to enable selective ammonia recovery in a stacked bipolar electrodialysis bp ed system a bpm consists of a cation and an anion exchange layer that allow for transport of protons and hydroxyl ions which are produced at the junction of both layers through the dissociation of water the produced protons and hydroxyl ions lead to an acidic diluate ph 6 and an alkaline concentrate stream ph 8 thereby ammonium can be removed from the diluate and recovered from the concentrate stream huang and xu 2006 pärnamäe et al 2021 rodrigues et al 2020a in their minimal bp ed design and using a synthetic wastewater rodrigues et al 2020a achieved a 80 tan at 100 a m 2 while consuming 18 3 kj gn 1 of electrical energy in a laboratory scale 6 cell pairs system larger scale application of ed is usually achieved by stacking multiple cell pairs diluate and concentrate defined by cems aems and or bpms on top of each other recently a pilot scale ed unit 30 cell pairs of cems aems was presented for the treatment supernatant from a domestic anaerobic digester centrate which achieved a concentrated product of nh4 7 1 g l 1 and k 2 5 g l 1 at an energy input of 4 9 1 5 kwh kgn 1 ward et al 2018 unfortunately this concentrated nh4 product contained high concentrations of sodium making it less suitable as fertilizer under alkaline conditions selective ammonia nh3 recovery from the concentrate stream can be achieved by nh3 stripping for example by using a liquid liquid membrane contactor llmc module the llmc module uses hydrophobic gas permeable hollow fibres to recover nh3 gas into an acid solution the driving force for nh3 transport is the difference in concentrations between the two solutions concentrate and acid rodríguez arredondo et al 2017 ulbricht et al 2013 another major bottleneck for the application of bp ed like systems for tan recovery from wastewater is the risk of fouling and scaling on the iems scaling of the iems lead to an increased energy consumption due to the increasing membrane resistance and eventually operational failure of the ed systems strategies for scaling mitigation include pretreatment by coagulation filtration ion exchange struvite precipitation hao et al 2015 ward et al 2018 zamora et al 2017 chemical or mechanical cleaning and donnan dialysis rijnaarts et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2021 a recent study demonstrated that donnan dialysis delayed the scaling and formation of calcite on cems allowing for a longer operation of a laboratory scale ed system without the interruption for cleaning rodrigues et al 2021 under suitable conditions donnan dialysis can exchange na k mg2 and ca2 from the concentrate stream with ammonium from the diluate stream leading to a higher tan recovery rodrigues et al 2020b furthermore the centrate of anaerobic digester typically contains a significant load of organic pollutants with per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass being of particular concern due to their persistency toxicity mobility and bioaccumulation potential zhou et al 2019 pfass are frequently detected in both biosolids and digestate from wwtps in europe and elsewhere brambilla et al 2016 clarke and smith 2011 venkatesan and halden 2013 given the very low pka values pka 2 and high ion mobility of the negatively charged linear chain pfas radjenovic et al 2020 they will be transported in the electric field sörengård et al 2019 and thus may electromigrate through the ion exchange membranes including bpms blommaert et al 2020 also due to the relative volatility of some pfass e g pfoa and shorter chain perfluorocarboxylic acids witteveen bos and tte consultant 2016 their fate within the llmc module should be evaluated in this study we present the operational results of a pilot scale life newbies nitrogen extraction from water by an innovative electrochemical system installation based on bp ed comprised of 65 cell pairs coupled to two llmc modules and treating centrate of the anaerobic digester the pilot was operated either in continuous mode constant current and donnan mode intermittent current to investigate the impact of donnan dialysis on the process performance in terms of ammonia recovery membrane scaling fouling and energy consumption in addition we have investigated the impact of long term membrane scaling fouling on the bp ed performance applied cleaning strategies to remove scaling fouling and tested the effect of the applied cleaning strategies on membrane selectivity and resistance the primary objective was to demonstrate the feasibility of using bp ed and llmc for selective extraction and recovery of ammonia from anaerobic digestate and determine the optimum operational conditions to achieve satisfactory nh4 n product concentration and energy consumption to understand the potential hazard posed by pfas in the recovery of ammonia from waste streams using the bp ed llmc we studied the fate of legacy pfas namely c4 c8 perfluorocarboxylic

the newbies pilot plant was anaerobic digester centrate obtained after centrifuging the mixed liquor effluent of the anaerobic digester of a wwtp treating municipal wastewater centrifugation of the mixed liquor effluent of the anaerobic digester was done with the addition of kemira superfloc sd 6081 coagulant the wwtp is located in girona catalonia spain with a design capacity of 27 500 inhabitants equivalent and 55 000 m3 d 1 the primary and secondary sludge are treated in two mesophilic digesters operating at 35 c after digestion the digestate is centrifuged and the reject water i e centrate is directed to the inlet of the plant for its treatment the characteristics of the centrate are summarized in the supplementary material fig s1 and table s1 fig 1 shows the schematic of the newbies pilot installation the centrate was collected in a 10 m3 tank that allowed settling hrt 12 h of the suspended solids fig 1 and thus minimized the clogging of the 10 µm filters installed at the entrance of the pilot plant the centrate was then introduced into the bp ed stack diluate compartment using a membrane pump dda 200 4 grundfos nederland b v almere the netherlands due to the applied

cation exchange membrane 3 15 m2 l n equal to 1 is when the tan loading and the applied current are equal sufficient l n 1 means that there is more tan than the current can transport deficit whereas a l n 1 means that there is more current than tan excess rodríguez arredondo et al 2017 table 1 summarizes the operating conditions conducted at the newbies pilot plant in the donnan mode current was applied intermittently current switched on for 20 s and off for 60 s defining one donnan cycle in this mode the centrate was only supplied to the pilot during the 20 s in a cycle when current is supplied therefore the flow rate of the feed pump was adjusted to achieve the ln as intended when calculated over a complete duration of one donnan cycle two values of l n were applied 1 4 low and 1 8 high by varying the applied j 50 75 and 100 a m 2 and the feed pump flow rate 100 132 150 and 200 l h 1 these values were selected to be similar to and slightly higher than the l n of 1 3 that has been determined as theoretically ideal to achieve a high ammonia removal efficiency kuntke et al 2018 rodríguez arredondo et al 2017 experiments in the donnan mode were operated for 24 h and in continuous mode for 6 h to ensure equal amount of electric charge was applied during each experiment data from the runs conducted in donnan mode are calculated as average per minute because of the large difference in the values in the on and off time the experiment d75 low was repeated to demonstrate the reproducibility of the results calculations of the key performance indicators kpis of the

method are described in the supplementary material text s4 tables s2 and s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 newbies pilot system performance in order to evaluate the pilot bp ed system performance the system was operated in either continuous mode or donnan mode and at two different load ratios ln of 1 8 or 1 4 3 1 1 tan removal increases with increasing load ratio and decreases over the course of one experiment fig 2 shows that the tan removal in the pilot scale bp ed for continuous a and donnan mode b the tan removal efficiency in continuous and donnan mode depended on both the applied j and the ln which is in accordance with earlier results and the ln model higher ln leads to higher tan removal efficiencies desloover et al 2012 kuntke et al 2018 rodríguez arredondo et al 2017 a higher current density did not directly increase the tan removal efficiency but increased the amount of treated centrate resulting in a higher treatment capacity for example when the bp ed system was operated in donnan mode at 50 a m 2 runs d50 low and d50 high conducted with an ln of 1 4 and 1 8 resulted in 41 8 and 58 1 of tan removal after 2 h of operation respectively at the same current density in continuous mode a higher ln of 1 8 c50 high yielded higher tan removal 52 9 57 4 whereas in the case of lower ln of 1 4 c50 low it was 34 5 35 5 in the first 1 h of operation fig 2 also shows that the tan removal decreased over the operational time in all runs with the highest tan removal achieved at the beginning of each run the replicate experiments d75 low1 and d75 low2 show almost identical removal efficiencies figs 2 and s2 conductivity and ph values in diluate and concentrate stream respectively table s5 the tan removal decrease was a consequence of membrane fouling and scaling that gradually worsened the reactor performance and had a detrimental impact on the removal and recovery of ammonia rodrigues et al 2021 nonetheless the employed cleaning strategy of the diluate and concentrate compartment restored the functioning of the system at least to some extend after each run 3 1 2 tan removal rate flowed the expected pattern especially in donnan mode a higher current leads to a higher tan removal rate table 2 shows the obtained tan removal rates in general the tan removal rate was higher in continuous mode than in donnan mode the difference in the operational mode leads to a difference in the membrane transport i e ion migration and diffusion processes rodrigues et al 2021 2020b in the continuous mode at an applied current density of 50 a m 2 and a ln of 1 8 the bp ed system was able to remove up to 562 4 gn d 1 with a corresponding tan transport rate of 178 8 gn m 2 d 1 in the donnan mode at an applied current density of 50 a m 2 and a ln of 1 8 the bp ed system was able to remove up to 131 2 gn d 1 with a corresponding tan transport rate of 41 7 gn m 2 d 1 although these amounts and removal rates are slightly lower than the rates reported in literature at similar current densities to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that such a large scale system was operated at realistic conditions complex wastewater onsite a wwtp while rodrigues et al 2020 reported a removal rate of 363 gn m 2 d 1 using synthetic wastewater and a laboratory scale version of this technology at 50 a m 2 rodrigues et al 2020a ward et al 2018 reported 100 gn m 2 d 1 0 3 mol nh4 m 2 h 1 in a similar sized ed system 3 6 m2 cems operated in the laboratory using digestate after struvite precipitation at 20 a m 2 ward et al 2018 the observed tan transport numbers range between 0 4 and 0 1 which is lower than the transport number reported for ed based systems 0 6 0 4 rodrigues et al 2020a ward et al 2018 the tan transport numbers decrease considerably during each experiment fig s3 these results indicate that next to scaling of the iems also nh3 diffusion or ionic short circuits may have impacted the system performance he and cussler 1992 veerman et al 2008 vorobiev et al 2002 in general the bp ed cell voltage fig 3 and therefore the specific energy demand obtained during the intermittent i e donnan mode of operation was found to be lower than in the continuous mode the lowest energy consumption 6 3 and 6 5 kwh kgn 1 were obtained in runs d75 low1 and d75 low2 respectively i e donnan mode ln 1 4 75 a m 2 200 l h 1 table 1 although this run resulted in the somewhat lower tan removal efficiency compared to the runs conducted at higher ln it is likely that the application of higher feed flowrate was beneficial for the removal of scale from the system thus leading to a lower total cell potential and power consumption previous study with pilot scale ed treatment of centrate reported an even lower energy consumption 4 9 kwh kgn 1 ward et al 2018 this was likely due to less scaling of the membranes and the lower applied current density 20 a m 2 in order to prevent the scaling in the ed system ward et al pretreated the centrate in a struvite crystallizer system which reduced the amount of mg2 and phosphate ward et al 2018 also the bpms used in the newbies pilot have a higher ohmic resistance as they need an additional electric potential for the dissociation of water pärnamäe et al 2021 3 2 water transport over the llmc limited the obtainable ammonia product concentration the obtained product

nitrogen using a subsequent electrodialysis step vecino et al 2020 the work of vecino also showed the need for ammonia pre concentration ion exchange using zeolite and pre treatment granular activated carbon for organic matter removal vecino et al 2020 2019 the bp ed llmc process presented in this work only requires settling and a prefilter furthermore nitric acid and phosphoric acid are expensive compared to sulfuric acid due to energy intensive production process hno3 and raw material scarcity rock phosphate rockström et al 2009 water transport across the membrane contactor severely affects the obtainable nutrient concentration ulbricht et al 2013 therefore ammonia recovery using llmc can be optimized i e number of units alignment configuration flow conditions direction and acid choice

the removal of ca2 and mg2 at the end of the runs in the donnan mode was 76 and 57 for the applied l n of 1 4 d50 low whereas in the continuous mode the values were 37 and 30 c50 low respectively fig s2 likewise at the higher l n of 1 8 the removal efficiency of ca2 and mg2 at the end of the runs in the donnan mode was 85 and 64 and in the continuous mode it was 56 and 39 respectively fig s2 donnan dialysis is particularly effective for the removal and recovery of multivalent ions and cations of higher charge tend to concentrate preferentially over those of lower charge wallace 1967 3 2 2 analysis of the reusability of the ion exchange membranes after several months of operation the ed stacks were disassembled scaling was detected in the concentrate flow compartments fully covering the spacers separating the cem and bpm and completely filling the flow compartments in cell pairs from the cem side to the bpm side fig s4 in the case of the iems fouling is dependent on the charge of the membrane with aem being significantly more prone to fouling and scaling compared with cems due to their lower ion exchange capacity mondor et al 2009 in the conventional ed stack treating swine manure scaling of cems was negligible which was interpreted by the low contribution of ca2 to overall ion transport due to the higher mobility of nh4 and k mondor et al 2009 2008 in other studies caco3 was identified to be the dominant scalant for cems ayala bribiesca et al 2006 bazinet and araya farias 2005 similar to the newbies pilot plant where scaling of cems by the formed caco3 was significant moreover the deposits in those studies were formed in the interior of the membrane and could only be removed in the laboratory cleaning procedure to test if an acid cleaning procedure is effective in removing this scaling and leaving the membranes intact for reuse the membranes were removed from the stack and cleaned by soaking in 1 m hcl acid for three days this cleaning with acid removed completely the scale from the membranes fig s4c after cleaning both cems and bpms were subjected to selectivity and resistance tests in an external test cell to determine if their performance was affected by the cleaning procedure for the cem the voltage drop was 300 mv at an applied current of 110 ma 225 a m 2 for the pristine membrane and remained comparable at 310 mv for the used membrane after cleaning for the bpm the voltage drop at 110 ma 225 a m 2 was increased from 980 mv pristine to 1007 mv for the used membrane after cleaning the water splitting efficiency determined as the ph difference between the anode and cathode compartment remained unaffected after cleaning overall it can be concluded that the performance of the cem and bpm can be almost restored to pristine conditions 96 of the performance 3 2 3 presence and fate of pfass during ammonia recovery by bp ed from anaerobic digester centrate the analysis of the target pfas table s4 in the diluate and cation concentrate at the beginning and end of each run did not indicate a distinct decrease and increase respectively in their concentration in either of the current modes tested thus the migration diffusion of the pfas through the ion exchange membranes could not be confirmed fig s5 nevertheless the samples taken at t1 and t2 were grab samples and may not be representative of the entire system also differences in the total volume of the cation concentrate 8 l and the diluate 660 l as well as slight changes in the volume during the operation of the ed system due to electro osmosis make it difficult to make an accurate mass balance of the pfas according to the design of the ed unit fig 1 the negatively charged perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas would have to migrate across the bpms to reach the cation concentrate stream although the configuration of a bpm minimizes the transport of the charged species sata 2007 ions with a charge opposite of the fixed charge of the adjacent membrane layer e g negatively charged pfas facing the cation exchange layer of bpm can enter the membrane through diffusion and or migration depending on the current density applied blommaert et al 2020 the ion transport across the bpms is expected to decrease with the increasing molecular weight mw of the ion blommaert et al 2020 however c4 c8 pfcas and 6 2 fts are linear chain molecules with very low steric hindrance table s5 and may be adsorbed inside the membrane and not just on its surface migration over the ion exchange membrane may be less challenging than expected based on their mw roman et al 2019 the concentrations of the c4 c8 pfcas in the cation concentrate were significant in both continuous current and donnan mode i e 10 8 69 1 ng l 1 and 15 3 26 9 ng l 1 respectively fig s5b the cation concentrate did not contain any perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas in the continuous current mode and very low amounts of pfbs 1 8 0 2 ng l 1 pfhxs 1 6 0 6 ng l 1 and pfos 5 3 2 1 ng l 1 in donnan mode fig s5d previously adsorption of pfos and other sulfonates onto the membrane and other parts of the filtration system e g spacers was observed in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis liu et al 2021 and may be responsible for lower concentrations of pfsas nevertheless it is unclear whether the pfcas and pfsas are present in the cation concentrate due to their crossover from the diluate fig 4 or may be released from the fluoropolymers used in the production of bpms and cems thus the fate and behavior of the pfas within the ed unit requires further study under a more controlled conditions of a lab scale set up in continuous current mode the product contained 7 4 ng l 1 20 7 ng l 1 and 55 5 ng l 1 of pfoa pfhxa and pfba whereas in the donnan mode their concentrations were similar 11 0 ng l 1 18 6 ng l 1 and 68 8 ng l 1 respectively fig 4 6 2 fts was present in very low concentrations in the cation concentrate in both modes i e 1 9 and 1 7 ng l 1 in the continuous and donnan mode respectively nevertheless the product contained 6 2 fts in up to 253 5 ng l 1 in continuous current mode and 212 2 ng l 1 in donnan mode fig 4 given that the llmc membrane 3 m liqui cel is based on polypropylene fibers 3m 2021 elevated concentrations of 6 2 fts detected in the product are likely a consequence of its release from the teflon based components in the sulfuric acid dosage line e g tubing membrane based acid dosing pump for example 6 2 fts is often used as an alternative for pfos or pfoa as a polymer processing aid in the synthesis of fluoropolymers buck et al 2011 also low ng l 1 concentrations of pfcas were likely released in a similar manner although due to their moderate volatility their cross over through the gas permeable membrane cannot be excluded the evidence presented in this study in terms of pfcas and 6 2 fts presence in the product obtained during the nutrient recovery from centrate indicates that the ed nutrient recovery requires a careful selection of the tubing and pump connecting to the llmc modules due to the addition of pfos in the stockholm convention and other regulations 6 2 fts has been adopted as an alternative product in the market however several studies reported biotransformation of 6 2 fts to shorter chain acids such as 5 3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid 5 3 ftca perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea pfhxa and pfba zhang et al 2016 in the restriction report of european chemical agency echa on pfhxs its salts and pfhxs related substances 6 2 fts was reported acutely toxic echa 2021 the concentration of ammonia obtained in the final product of the ed stack was ranging from 19 to 33 gn l 1 table 2 thus the obtained nh4 2so4 product would likely be diluted 500 to 1000 times prior to its application is a fertilizer mohammad et al 1999 yi et al 2019 although the encountered low ng l 1 concentrations of pfass may not pose a risk for such application 6 2 fts would diluted to 0 25 5 ng l 1 their presence in the final product likely due to the leaching of the teflon based components in the system still merits attention due to their bioaccumulation in agricultural products bao et al 2020 4 conclusions the study demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of ammonia recovery from real wastewater using a pilot plant bp ed llmc system treating 150 l of anaerobic digester centrate per hour the operational stability of the pilot plant system during multiple cip cycles was successfully demonstrated showing that scaling of the ion exchange membranes may be resolved by using automated cleaning strategies bp ed coupled to llmc was capable of selective and efficient recovery of ammonia from anaerobic digester centrate in on site conditions the optimum operation of the pilot plant unit in terms of ammonia recovery and energy consumption was achieved in the intermittent current mode that takes advantage of the donnan dialysis and favors the exchange of ammonia over cations the newbies pilot plant could recover 235 7 gn d 1 consuming 6 3 kwh kgn 1 nevertheless given that there was no centrate pretreatment other than gravitational settling high concentrations of ca2 led to intense scaling of the cems in both continuous current and donnan mode thus successful application of this technology in full scale facilities may be hampered by the requirement for chemical additives for the regeneration of the membranes and difficulties with the continuous operation of the reactor due to the necessity to implement cleaning procedures besides the conducted acid rinse complementary strategies for the on site control of cems fouling and scaling may include pre treatment to remove ca2 and other ions that may precipitate e g mg2 using struvite crystallization the presence of 212 253 ng l 1 of 6 2 fts in the obtained ammonium sulfate product suggested its release from the teflon based components in the sulfuric acid dosage line which was an unexpected result and difficult to be foreseen in more fundamental studies conducted at laboratory scale thus careful selection of the pilot plant tubing pumps and other components is required to avoid any risks associated with the pfas presence and ensure safe use of the final product as fertilizer declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16007,human astrovirus hastv composes of classic hastv serotypes 1 8 and recently discovered novel hastv mlb and hastv va strains a number of studies have demonstrated that wastewater analysis is an effective approach to understand the prevalence and diversity of enteric viruses in local population however a comprehensive analysis of classic and novel hastvs in sewage is still lacking in this study sewage samples were collected monthly from jinan china during 2018 2019 quantification of hastv genomes was performed by real time quantitative pcr different from previous studies which focused on partial orf1b or orf2 gene complete orf2 region of hastv was amplified from sewage concentrates and amplicons were subjected to next generation sequencing ngs and genetic analysis this methodology allowed detection of 18 astroviruses of which 7 hastv 1 2 4 5 va1 va2 and va3 were detected in all sewage samples a new strain va6 mapped to the hmo clade was identified in 20 8 of samples with 82 4 83 3 nucleotide identities to the closest strain va5 the viral load of classic mlb and va clades in sewage samples ranged from 3 7 104 to 4 6 107 3 4 104 to 3 9 106 and 3 3 104 to 4 1 106 copies per liter respectively phylogenetic analysis based on complete orf2 region reflected local hastvs within each genotype constituted multiple co circulating lineages existence of several new lineages composed exclusively or predominantly of chinese sequences was observed as well these results demonstrate sewage contains astroviruses with considerable high diversities ngs based environmental surveillance greatly improves the understanding of hastv circulation and should be encouraged graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords human astrovirus environmental surveillance next generation sequencing phylogeny diversity 1 introduction astroviruses are nonenveloped single stranded positive sense rna viruses that belong to the astroviridae family they are classified into two genera as mamastrovirus mastv and avastrovirus aastv infecting mammals and birds respectively méndez and arias 2013 human astroviruses hastv are a highly prevalent but understudied group of enteric viruses kolawole et al 2019 they have been recognized as one of the leading causes of acute gastroenteritis in children accounting for 2 9 of infections kolawole et al 2019 besides they have been reported to be associated with cns complications such as meningitis encephalitis and acute flaccid paralysis afp in immunocompromised children vu et al 2016 hastv genome is typically between 6 2 and 7 9 kb in length containing three open reading frames orfs orf1a and 1b encoding nonstructural proteins and orf2 encoding capsid proteins jiang et al 1993 according to the classification system proposed by the ictv astroviridae study group in 2010 bosch et al 2012 the classification of astrovirus was based on orf2 region with 75 amino acid similarity within the same species also a variant can be defined if sharing 93 nucleotide similarity to the reference or prototype strain of each species traditionally hastvs were classified into 8 serotypes hastv 1 to hastv 8 now termed classic hastv recent application of next generation sequencing ngs has leading to the finding of various novel astroviruses which were genetically highly divergent from the classic hastvs bosch et al 2014 currently hastvs are classified within 4 species mastv 1 hastv 1 8 mastv 6 mlb1 3 mastv 8 va2 va4 and va5 and mastv 9 va1 and va3 boujon et al 2017 in china a national based prospective surveillance of all age patients with acute diarrhea between 2009 and 2018 showed that hastv was ranked the top four viral pathogen after rotavirus a norovirus and adenovirus with a positive rate of 7 18 wang et al 2021 however limited information is available regarding hastv diversity in china a population based study in rural china revealed that hastvs accounted for 2 99 69 2306 of diarrhea episodes in two counties during 2011 2013 with only 4 genotypes of 1 2 5 and 6 observed wang et al 2020 another study conducted in shanghai during 2017 2018 showed 5 22 42 804 of outpatients with acute diarrhea were positive with hastv including hastv 1 n 40 and hastv 5 n 2 lu et al 2021 limited data from clinical surveillance make it difficult to understand the actual circulation and diversity of hastvs since enteric viruses can be excreted from infected individuals into sewage examination on domestic sewage could be an effective approach to understand the actual prevalence of these viruses a number of studies have demonstrated the feasibility and value of environmental surveillance in surveying and tracing poliovirus hovi et al 2012 nonpolio enterovirus ozawa et al 2019 ivanova et al 2019 and gastroenteritis viruses iwai et al 2009 hata et al 2015 iaconelli et al 2017 for astrovirus a few studies have been successfully conducted in south africa nadan et al 2003 france arraj et al 2008 hungary meleg et al 2006 japan hata et al 2015 china zhou et al 2014 tao et al 2019 etc to describe the viral diversity in sewage and phylogenetic characterization however these studies employed traditional cloning and sanger sequencing method which is labor intensive and low throughput recently the increasing development of ngs technology has prompted great research progress in the area of viral metagenomics in this study an ngs method to capture complete orf2 sequences of hastvs in sewage was developed the diversity and phylogenetic characterization of classic and novel hastvs in jinan sewage during 2018 2019 were investigated to favor the finding of possible novel strains and improve our knowledge on hastv circulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewage collection and concentration jinan is the capital city of shandong province china with urban population of 6 76 million 2020 census data sewage samples were collected monthly from a sewage treatment plant in jinan between january 2018 to december 2019 one liter of influent was collected in a sterile sampling bottle and transported under cold condition to the laboratory the electronegative charged membrane based adsorption elution method berg et al 1971 tao et al 2020 was used for sewage concentration briefly 1 l of sewage was centrifuged at 3000 g for 30 min the supernatant was added with 2 5 m mgcl2 to a final concentration of 0 05 m and 0 5 m hcl was added to adjust to ph 3 5 the solution was then filtered through a cellulose acetate membrane pore size 10 μm diameter 124 mm advantec japan and a mixed cellulose ester mce membrane pore size 0 45 μm diameter 142 mm advantec japan the former was used to remove impurities that might block the latter which can absorb viruses in the supernatant the mce membrane was cut into small pieces and soaked with 10 ml of 3 0 beef extract solution ph 8 5 after ultrasonication for 3 min centrifugation at 3600 g for 30 min and filtration pore size 0 22 μm millipore usa the filtrated solution was ready for detection 2 2 rna extraction and real time quantitative pcr qpcr viral nucleic acid was extracted from the sewage concentrate using magmax pathogen rna dna kit thermo fisher lithuania taqman based qpcr for classic hastvs hastv va and hastv mlb was performed separately with agpath id one step rt pcr reagents applied biosystems foster city usa in abi7500 instrument primers and probes are listed in table s1 two microliters of sample rna were added to achieve a final volume of 25 μl each sample was tested in triplicate the amplification conditions were 45 c for 10 min 95 c for 10 min and followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 45 s quantification of pepper mild mottle virus pmmov rna in sewage was performed as internal control kitamura et al 2020 2 3 orf2 rt pcr viral nucleic acid was extracted from the sewage concentrate as described above the primers for amplification of full length orf2 coding region were designed on the basis of complete genome sequences deposited in genbank as shown in table 1 primer pair hastv4296f hastv6705r was designed for classic hastvs primer pair va4212f va6501r was designed for novel hastv strains va1 to va5 primers mlb3807f mlb1 6113r and mlb23 6081r were designed to be used in one reaction for novel hastv mlb strains rna from each sewage sample was examined by 3 rt pcr reactions with above primer sets using the superscript iv one step rt pcr system thermo fisher usa the following pcr program was used 50 for 30 min 98 for 2 min 98 c for 10 s 63 c for 10 s 72 c for 2 5 min for 40 cycles and 72 c for 5 min 2 4 ngs library preparation and sequencing orf2 pcr products were subjected to bgi shenzhen guangdong province china for library preparation and sequencing using the dnbseq platform ngs assay was performed separately for each amplicon briefly pcr amplicons were fragmented with a covaris ultrasonic sample processor covaris ma usa size selection of 300 400 bp was performed with agencourt ampure xp medium beads beckman coulter ma usa a tailing mix and rna index adapters were added by incubation to carry out end repair pcr amplification was conducted on the obtained fragments and pcr products were subjected to heat denaturation followed by circularization using the splint oligo sequence the final library was amplified with phi29 to make dna nanoballs dnbs which were compacted on high density patterned nanoarray and sequenced by combinatorial probe anchor synthesis cpas after sequencing clean reads were obtained by removing reads containing adaptors reads containing poly n 10 and low quality reads from raw data de novo assembly of the clean data was conducted in clc genomics workbench 12 0 clc bio qiagen hilden germany using the default options contigs 200 bp in length and with 10 coverage were queried for sequence similarity using blast against a local database that contained 1289 astrovirus sequences obtained in genbank nucleotide database with sequence length ranging from 2000 bp to 9000 bp as of october 25 2021 an additional resequencing assembly of the clean reads was carried out to obtain consensuses which were mapped to the complete orf2 coding sequences of all astrovirus genotypes observed in the above de novo assembly 2 5 homologous comparison and phylogenetic analysis the complete orf2 sequences obtained from both de novo assembly and mapping were forwarded to sequence analysis all full length orf2 sequences n 178 belonging to the identified hastv genotypes were downloaded from genbank and incorporated into the homologous and phylogenetic analysis as references multiple sequence alignment was performed using clustalw and sequence similarities were calculated by the bioedit software version 7 0 5 3 hall 1999 phylogenetic analysis was performed by mega 11 0 software tamura et al 2021 using the neighbor joining method with a kimura 2 parameter model and 1000 bootstrap replications 2 6 nucleotide sequence accession numbers the complete orf2 sequences of environmental hastvs n 273 described in this report were deposited in the genbank database under the accession numbers om468611 om468883 3 results 3 1 quantification of hastv genomes in wastewater all 24 sewage samples collected between january 2018 to december 2019 were positive for hastv rna by qpcr assay the concentrations of classic hastv hastv va and hastv mlb ranged from 3 7 104 october 2018 to 4 6 107 january 2018 3 3 104 january 2019 to 4 1 106 march 2018 and 3 4 104 may 2019 to 3 9 106 november 2018 copies per liter respectively fig 1 a geometric means of viral concentrations in sewage were calculated for classic hastv hastv va and hastv mlb in each season fig 1b and the samples collected in spring showed the highest concentration of 2 4 106 6 1 105 and 1 4 106 for the 3 clades respectively as internal quality control pmmov was tested positive in all samples with the concentration ranging from 2 3 107 to 7 4 108 copies per liter these relatively stable and high values suggest that sewage was concentrated at high efficiencies 3 2 orf2 amplification of hastv rna from sewage hastv nucleic acid was successfully amplified in all 24 samples by conventional rt pcr reactions pcr reaction using primer set for classic hastv hastv mlb and hastv va resulted in a positivity of 100 0 24 24 79 2 19 24 and 62 5 15 24 respectively sewage samples collected in june 2018 september october 2018 and january february 2019 showed negative pcr results for hastv mlb samples in june 2018 september october 2018 december 2018 february 2019 april 2019 and november december 2019 showed negative pcr results for hastv va all 58 amplicons were analyzed by ngs separately a total of 684 820 266 clean reads were generated for all samples with an average of 11 807 245 reads per sample amplicons using primer set for classic hastv hastv mlb and hastv va generated 243 874 793 286 579 839 and 154 365 634 clean reads with 193 091 806 79 2 185 056 578 64 6 and 54 278 828 35 2 reads mapped to astrovirus respectively proportions of reads mapped to astrovirus in each sample are illustrated in fig 2 amplicons generated by classic hastv hastv mlb and hastv va reactions had 13 4 99 4 23 4 92 3 and 5 4 74 1 of reads mapped to astrovirus respectively sequencing reads that did not match an astrovirus sequence were mostly bacterial sequences such as alistipes senegalensis alistipes shahii etc and some unknown sequences suggesting the occurrence of non specific amplification 3 3 genotype diversity of classic mlb and va hastvs by analyzing the 58 amplicons a total of 18 astroviruses were detected from all 24 sewage samples including classic hastv genotypes 1 2 3 4 5 and 8 hastv mlb strains 1 and 2 hastv va strains 1 6 and non human mastv feline canine porcine and rodent asv of these 7 hastv 1 2 4 5 va1 va2 and va3 were detected in all sewage samples va6 is a newly identified strain in this study it was observed in february to may in 2018 and march may to july and september in 2019 ten full length orf2 sequences of va6 were obtained in this study they had 98 1 99 9 nucleotide identities among themselves and 82 9 83 2 and 82 3 83 3 nucleotide identities with two va5 reference strains va5 human gambia 102 139 2009 and bf34 respectively no closer genetic relationship can be found with the other strains or genotypes according to the above mentioned classification criteria we proposed the new strain va6 for the 24 amplicons generated by using classic hastv primer set all above mentioned 18 astroviruses were observed among the 193 091 806 reads that mapped to astroviruses 80 02 belonged to classic hastv 19 30 belonged to hastv va 0 64 belonged to non human mastv and the rest 0 0064 belonged to hastv mlb as shown in fig 3 a and 3b hastv 1 2 4 5 va1 va2 and va3 were detected in all months and hastv 5 1 and 2 were the most abundant which accounting for 27 87 23 45 and 14 97 of total astrovirus reads hastv 3 and 8 was the less common classic hastv which detected in 54 17 13 24 and 25 00 6 24 of samples and accounted for 0 42 and 0 62 of astrovirus reads respectively for the 19 amplicons generated by using hastv mlb primer set only 11 astroviruses were identified from ngs data among the 185 056 578 reads mapped to astrovirus 98 53 belonged to hastv mlb strains 1 and 2 1 24 belonged to classic hastv genotypes 1 5 0 23 belonged to non human mastv feline and rodent astv and the rest 0 0038 belonged to hastv va strains 2 and 3 fig 3c and d mlb1 was detected in all 19 amplicons accounting for 98 18 of total astrovirus reads yet mlb2 only detected in 37 5 9 24 of sewage samples accounting for 0 35 of astrovirus reads for the 15 amplicons generated by using hastv va primer set 11 astroviruses were identified from ngs data among the 54 278 828 reads mapped to astrovirus 99 99 belonged to hastv va strains 1 6 0 010 belonged to classic hastv genotypes 1 2 4 and 5 and the rest 0 00010 belonged to non human mastv rodent astv fig 3e and f as the most abundant strains va1 va2 and va3 were detected in all 15 amplicons accounting for 13 84 46 93 and 36 00 of total astrovirus reads respectively va4 va5 and va6 were detected less frequently in 53 33 8 15 66 67 10 15 and 60 0 9 15 of amplicons 3 4 homologous comparison and phylogenetic analysis by de novo and resequencing assembly a total of 273 full length orf2 sequences of hastvs were obtained in this study belonging to hastv 1 n 26 hastv 2 n 24 hastv 3 n 10 hastv 4 n 22 hastv 5 n 22 hastv 8 n 5 mlb1 n 20 mlb2 n 1 va1 n 35 va2 n 38 va3 n 38 va4 n 8 va5 n 14 and va6 n 10 to study the genetic relationship of hastv in this study with those from other parts of the world homologous comparison and phylogenetic analysis based on complete orf2 sequences were conducted using the above 273 local sequences and 178 reference sequences from genbank generally within each classic genotypes or novel strains there was a clear trend that shandong sequences had higher similarities with each other than with foreign sequences especially for hastv 2 96 7 100 0 vs 82 0 100 0 hastv 4 97 2 100 0 vs 88 5 98 1 hastv 5 97 4 100 0 vs 92 1 99 7 va2 98 4 100 0 vs 95 5 96 8 and va3 97 2 100 0 vs 95 2 98 1 fig 4 interestingly 7 local hastv 2 sequences om468637 om468642 which were obtained during january july in 2018 had 100 similarity with a reference strain klf hastv2 005 2019 mw485042 which was recovered from a diarrheal stool sample in coastal kenya in 2019 also 11 local mlb1 sequences om468722 om468723 om468725 om468727 om468729 om468731 om468733 om468737 om468738 from sewage samples collected in 6 months in 2018 and 5 months in 2019 shared 100 similarity with a reference strain fj222451 isolated from a child with acute diarrhea in australia in 1999 finkbeiner et al 2008a the close relationship among these sequences implies the occurrence of long distance spread phylogenetic analysis revealed 3 major clades of classic hastv hastv mlb and hastv va which were further classified into 14 phylogenetic groups fig 5 each group designated a classic hastv genotype or a novel strain for the clades of hastv va and mlb1 strains shandong sequences accounted for the majority of branches with only a small proportion of reference sequences from other parts of the world were presented in particular va6 was a newly proposed strain in this study and this clade consisted of chinese sequences exclusively the lack of reference sequences for va strains leaded to the result that most clusters or lineages were composed of sequences in this study for the clades of hastv 1 2 3 5 and 8 local sequences segregated into 2 or more genetic lineages suggesting cocirculation of multiple transmission chains of these genotypes in local population undoubtedly in accordance with the results of homologous analysis the mentioned hastv 2 and mlb1 local sequences showed close phylogenetic relationship with corresponding reference sequences in the tree 4 discussion sewage contains multiple organisms such as bacteria archaea eukaryotes plants and insects and their associated viruses in metagenomics ngs mngs analysis on raw sewage human viruses accounted for a very small proportion of total reads ng et al 2012 yang et al 2021 which was inadequate for further analysis of diversity and phylogeny for a certain virus whereas pcr amplification targeting viral genes from complex environment samples will provide a pure sample for ngs analysis a few studies have employed amplicon based ngs in investigating enteric viruses such as adenovirus norovirus sapovirus and enterovirus etc in sewage iaconelli et al 2017 suffredini et al 2018 fumian et al 2019 mancini et al 2019 tao et al 2020 among these only one such study focused on hastv prevost et al 2015 with just 4 genotypes identified yet which could be explained by the procedure of pooling amplicons by season and the relative low sequencing depth of pyrosequencing our study reflects sewage contains astroviruses with considerable high diversities and demonstrate ngs based environmental surveillance greatly improved the understanding of hastv circulation in this study complete orf2 amplification is an important factor leading to the improvement of the methodology all previous studies on environmental hastv using either cloning sanger sequencing method or ngs approach were based on amplification of partial orf1b or orf2 genes these studies aimed at different genomic regions which caused difficulties on integrating the results it is well recognized that the complete orf2 variability is the basis for classification and phylogenetic analysis of astroviruses bosch et al 2014 in this study ngs sequencing of complete orf2 amplicons from sewage was performed and a large amount of data was generated it is reasonable to believe that this methodology will improve the research on diversity evolution and classification of astroviruses in the long term astrovirus are quite diverse to date there are 19 genotype species of mastv and another 14 species being proposed donato and vijaykrishna 2017 hastv is also a group with great diversity besides the traditional 8 serotypes hastv 1 to 8 8 novel hastvs i e mlbs and vas have been detected successively by using metagenomics approach or by conserved sequence primers since 2008 finkbeiner et al 2008b these novel hastvs were identified generally from stool specimens from diarrhea or acute flaccid paralysis patients or from cerebrospinal fluid specimens from patients suffering meningitis or encephalitis during surveillance studies with limited clinical samples collected boujon et al 2017 considering the low prevalence of novel hastv in human population and the high genetic divergence that might lead to off target in pcr detection it is reasonable to believe that more currently circulating novel hastvs are awaiting classification in this study by using the new primer sets we observed a novel strain va6 presenting in 60 0 of sewage samples except for mlb3 which was identified only in 3 nations of india gambia and kenya all other previous reported novel hastvs mlb1 2 and va1 to 5 have been detected in this study this finding not only demonstrates the feasibility of the method developed in this study but also expands our knowledge of the diversity of novel hastvs circulating in local population astroviruses infect a wide range of mammalian and avian hosts current hastvs are classified into 4 species of mastv 1 6 8 and 9 with high genetic divergence among themselves actually novel hastvs are phylogenetically more related to animal astroviruses than to classic hastvs suggesting interspecies transmission events during virus evolution vu et al 2016 in particular hastv va strains belong to the human mink and ovine like hmo clade which also contains astroviruses affecting at least 10 animal species such as sheep mink bovine bat porcine fox feline and canine etc boujon et al 2017 this study identified 4 kinds of animal astroviruses among which canine and feline astrovirus were present in 87 5 and 37 5 of sewage samples respectively fig 3 this is not surprising in that domestic animals such as cats and dogs are in intimate contact with humans it is therefore likely that their feces were excreted into sewage network and astroviruses affecting them were detected however the exact origin of these animal astroviruses is not clear and whether these animal astroviruses can evolve and find their way to affecting humans is a worthy subject for further study initially as a supplementary method to afp surveillance environmental surveillance has proven its sensitivity and efficacy in identifying poliovirus transmission in the absence of detected afp cases lickness et al 2020 then environmental surveillance expanded its scope to other enteric viruses and most recently sars cov 2 la rosa et al 2020 several studies have reported the detection of viral rna in sewage before clinical identification smyth et al 2022 or in the early stage of local outbreaks monge et al 2018 nabi et al 2020 and revealed the close genetic relationship between clinical and sewage viruses tao et al 2011 reflecting the significance of environmental surveillance in early warning and the realistic values for evaluating the circulation of corresponding viral pathogens besides multiple technical advantages of environmental surveillance have been revealed in this study first testing of sewage samples is very efficient economical and convenient since the cost of amplicon based ngs has reduced to 100 dollars per sample in mainland china a single sewage specimen is able to provide dramatic genetic data of circulating viruses at a low cost with no requirement for collecting a number of clinical specimens second combined with ngs environmental surveillance is an effective approach in discovering novel pathogens such as new strain new species or even new genus lastly surveillance on sewage has unique strengths in investigating genetic diversity of circulating pathogens especially for the viruses whose infection is generally asymptomatic in china diarrhea is an important public health problem a total of 1335 598 cases of infectious diarrhea were reported in 2021 cholera dysentery and enteric fever were excluded division of infectious disease 2022 hence environmental surveillance on diarrhea viruses is an important tool to supplement clinical surveillance and has a broad application prospect it should be noted that as one sewage sample may contain several astrovirus genotypes the orf2 sequences obtained in this study could be artifacts caused by pcr or fragmentation in the ngs protocol to rule out this possibility recombination analysis via similarity plot were undertaken the results showed that no recombination events were observed for all orf2 sequences in this study except for a sequence named hastv 8 sewage jn chn 105 2018 which had highest similarities with hastv 2 sequences at nt positions 387 657 fig s1 whether or not this is an experimental artifact or a nature recombinant is unclear from the current data further studies are needed to provide more solid evidence the present study is subjected to some limitations as shown in the fig 2c the sensitivity and specificity of primer pairs for hastv va were not satisfied only 35 2 of clean reads were mapped to astrovirus indicating non specific amplification accounts for the major proportion of the pcr products nevertheless considering the extremely low abundance of hastv in sewage the effect of non specific amplification could be ignored also mastv consists of multiple genotype species which can affect many mammalian species this study only focused on hastvs and did not explore animal astroviruses detection of 4 animal astroviruses in this study resulted from pcr amplification using primers designed for hastvs which are not likely to be suitable for animal astroviruses to investigate the diversity of human and animal astroviruses in sewage development of multiple primer sets for various mastv species is needed this will be an interesting aspect of future research to understand astrovirus ecology in urban environments 5 conclusion in this study an ngs based method was developed for detection and identification of hastv rna in sewage samples by using this method 18 astroviruses including a novel strain va6 have been identified from sewage samples collected between 2018 and 2019 our results demonstrate sewage contains astroviruses with considerable high diversities ngs based environmental surveillance greatly improves our understanding of hastv circulation and should be encouraged declaration of competing interest

16007,human astrovirus hastv composes of classic hastv serotypes 1 8 and recently discovered novel hastv mlb and hastv va strains a number of studies have demonstrated that wastewater analysis is an effective approach to understand the prevalence and diversity of enteric viruses in local population however a comprehensive analysis of classic and novel hastvs in sewage is still lacking in this study sewage samples were collected monthly from jinan china during 2018 2019 quantification of hastv genomes was performed by real time quantitative pcr different from previous studies which focused on partial orf1b or orf2 gene complete orf2 region of hastv was amplified from sewage concentrates and amplicons were subjected to next generation sequencing ngs and genetic analysis this methodology allowed detection of 18 astroviruses of which 7 hastv 1 2 4 5 va1 va2 and va3 were detected in all sewage samples a new strain va6 mapped to the hmo clade was identified in 20 8 of samples with 82 4 83 3 nucleotide identities to the closest strain va5 the viral load of classic mlb and va clades in sewage samples ranged from 3 7 104 to 4 6 107 3 4 104 to 3 9 106 and 3 3 104 to 4 1 106 copies per liter respectively phylogenetic analysis based on complete orf2 region reflected local hastvs within each genotype constituted multiple co circulating lineages existence of several new lineages composed exclusively or predominantly of chinese sequences was observed as well these results demonstrate sewage contains astroviruses with considerable high diversities ngs based environmental surveillance greatly improves the understanding of hastv circulation and should be encouraged graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords human astrovirus environmental surveillance next generation sequencing phylogeny diversity 1 introduction astroviruses are nonenveloped single stranded positive sense rna viruses that belong to the astroviridae family they are classified into two genera as mamastrovirus mastv and avastrovirus aastv infecting mammals and birds respectively méndez and arias 2013 human astroviruses hastv are a highly prevalent but understudied group of enteric viruses kolawole et al 2019 they have been recognized as one of the leading causes of acute gastroenteritis in children accounting for 2 9 of infections kolawole et al 2019 besides they have been reported to be associated with cns complications such as meningitis encephalitis and acute flaccid paralysis afp in immunocompromised children vu et al 2016 hastv genome is typically between 6 2 and 7 9 kb in length containing three open reading frames orfs orf1a and 1b encoding nonstructural proteins and orf2 encoding capsid proteins jiang et al 1993 according to the classification system proposed by the ictv astroviridae study group in 2010 bosch et al 2012 the classification of astrovirus was based on orf2 region with 75 amino acid similarity within the same species also a variant can be defined if sharing 93 nucleotide similarity to the reference or prototype strain of each species traditionally hastvs were classified into 8 serotypes hastv 1 to hastv 8 now termed classic hastv recent application of next generation sequencing ngs has leading to the finding of various novel astroviruses which were genetically highly divergent from the classic hastvs bosch et al 2014 currently hastvs are classified within 4 species mastv 1 hastv 1 8 mastv 6 mlb1 3 mastv 8 va2 va4 and va5 and mastv 9 va1 and va3 boujon et al 2017 in china a national based prospective surveillance of all age patients with acute diarrhea between 2009 and 2018 showed that hastv was ranked the top four viral pathogen after rotavirus a norovirus and adenovirus with a positive rate of 7 18 wang et al 2021 however limited information is available regarding hastv diversity in china a population based study in rural china revealed that hastvs accounted for 2 99 69 2306 of diarrhea episodes in two counties during 2011 2013 with only 4 genotypes of 1 2 5 and 6 observed wang et al 2020 another study conducted in shanghai during 2017 2018 showed 5 22 42 804 of outpatients with acute diarrhea were positive with hastv including hastv 1 n 40 and hastv 5 n 2 lu et al 2021 limited data from clinical surveillance make it difficult to understand the actual circulation and diversity of hastvs since enteric viruses can be excreted from infected individuals into sewage examination on domestic sewage could be an effective approach to understand the actual prevalence of these viruses a number of studies have demonstrated the feasibility and value of environmental surveillance in surveying and tracing poliovirus hovi et al 2012 nonpolio enterovirus ozawa et al 2019 ivanova et al 2019 and gastroenteritis viruses iwai et al 2009 hata et al 2015 iaconelli et al 2017 for astrovirus a few studies have been successfully conducted in south africa nadan et al 2003 france arraj et al 2008 hungary meleg et al 2006 japan hata et al 2015 china zhou et al 2014 tao et al 2019 etc to describe the viral diversity in sewage and phylogenetic characterization however these studies employed traditional cloning and sanger sequencing method which is labor intensive and low throughput recently the increasing development of ngs technology has prompted great research progress in the area of viral metagenomics in this study an ngs method to capture complete orf2 sequences of hastvs in sewage was developed the diversity and phylogenetic characterization of classic and novel hastvs in jinan sewage during 2018 2019 were investigated to favor the finding of possible novel strains and improve our knowledge on hastv circulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewage collection and concentration jinan is the capital city of shandong province china with urban population of 6 76 million 2020 census data sewage samples were collected monthly from a sewage treatment plant in jinan between january 2018 to december 2019 one liter of influent was collected in a sterile sampling bottle and transported under cold condition to the laboratory the electronegative charged membrane based adsorption elution method berg et al 1971 tao et al 2020 was used for sewage concentration briefly 1 l of sewage was centrifuged at 3000 g for 30 min the supernatant was added with 2 5 m mgcl2 to a final concentration of 0 05 m and 0 5 m hcl was added to adjust to ph 3 5 the solution was then filtered through a cellulose acetate membrane pore size 10 μm diameter 124 mm advantec japan and a mixed cellulose ester mce membrane pore size 0 45 μm diameter 142 mm advantec japan the former was used to remove impurities that might block the latter which can absorb viruses in the supernatant the mce

control kitamura et al 2020 2 3 orf2 rt pcr viral nucleic acid was extracted from the sewage concentrate as described above the primers for amplification of full length orf2 coding region were designed on the basis of complete genome sequences deposited in genbank as shown in table 1 primer pair hastv4296f hastv6705r was designed for classic hastvs primer pair va4212f va6501r was designed for novel hastv strains va1 to va5 primers mlb3807f mlb1 6113r and mlb23 6081r were designed to be used in one reaction for novel hastv mlb strains rna from each sewage sample was examined by 3 rt pcr reactions with above primer sets using the superscript iv one step rt pcr system thermo fisher usa the following pcr program was used 50 for 30 min 98 for 2 min 98 c for 10 s 63 c for 10 s 72 c for 2 5 min for 40 cycles and 72 c for 5 min 2 4 ngs library preparation and sequencing orf2 pcr products were subjected to bgi shenzhen guangdong province china for library preparation and sequencing using the dnbseq platform ngs assay was performed separately for each amplicon briefly pcr amplicons were fragmented with a covaris ultrasonic sample processor covaris ma usa size selection of 300 400 bp was performed with agencourt ampure xp medium beads beckman coulter ma usa a tailing mix and rna index adapters were added by incubation to carry out end repair pcr amplification was conducted on the obtained fragments and pcr products were subjected to heat denaturation followed by circularization using the splint oligo sequence the final library was amplified with phi29 to make dna nanoballs dnbs which were compacted on high density patterned nanoarray and sequenced by combinatorial probe anchor synthesis cpas after sequencing clean reads were obtained by removing reads containing adaptors reads containing poly n 10 and low quality reads from raw data de novo assembly of the clean data was conducted in clc genomics workbench 12 0 clc bio qiagen hilden germany using the default options contigs 200 bp in length and with 10 coverage were queried for sequence similarity using blast against a local database that contained 1289 astrovirus sequences obtained in genbank nucleotide database with sequence length ranging from 2000 bp to 9000 bp as of october 25 2021 an additional resequencing assembly of the clean reads was carried out to obtain consensuses which were mapped to the complete orf2 coding sequences of all astrovirus genotypes observed in the above de novo assembly 2 5 homologous comparison and phylogenetic analysis the complete orf2 sequences obtained from both de novo assembly and mapping were forwarded to sequence analysis all full length orf2 sequences n 178 belonging to the identified hastv genotypes were downloaded from genbank and incorporated into the homologous and phylogenetic analysis as references multiple sequence alignment was performed using clustalw and sequence similarities were calculated by the bioedit software version 7 0 5 3 hall 1999 phylogenetic analysis was performed by mega 11 0 software tamura et al 2021 using the neighbor joining method with a kimura 2 parameter model and 1000 bootstrap replications 2 6 nucleotide sequence accession numbers the complete orf2 sequences of environmental hastvs n 273 described in this report were deposited in the genbank database under the accession numbers om468611 om468883 3 results 3 1 quantification of hastv genomes in wastewater all 24 sewage samples collected between january 2018 to december 2019 were positive for hastv rna by qpcr assay the concentrations of classic hastv hastv va and hastv mlb ranged from 3 7 104 october 2018 to 4 6 107 january 2018 3 3 104 january 2019 to 4 1 106 march 2018 and 3 4 104 may 2019 to 3 9 106 november 2018 copies per liter respectively fig 1 a geometric means of viral concentrations in sewage were calculated for classic hastv hastv va and hastv mlb in each season fig 1b and the samples collected in spring showed the highest concentration of 2 4 106 6 1 105 and 1 4 106 for the 3 clades respectively as internal quality control pmmov was tested positive in all samples with the concentration ranging from 2 3 107 to 7 4 108 copies per liter these relatively stable and high values suggest that sewage was concentrated at high efficiencies 3 2 orf2 amplification of hastv rna from sewage hastv nucleic acid was successfully amplified in all 24 samples by conventional rt pcr reactions pcr reaction using primer set for classic hastv hastv mlb and hastv va resulted in a positivity of 100 0 24 24 79 2 19 24 and 62 5 15 24 respectively sewage samples collected in june 2018 september october 2018 and january february 2019 showed negative pcr results for hastv mlb samples in june 2018 september october 2018 december 2018 february 2019 april 2019 and november december 2019 showed negative pcr results for hastv va all 58 amplicons were analyzed by ngs separately a total of 684 820 266 clean reads were generated for all samples with an average of 11 807 245 reads per sample amplicons using primer set for classic hastv hastv mlb and hastv va generated 243 874 793 286 579 839 and 154 365 634 clean reads with 193 091 806 79 2 185 056 578 64 6 and 54 278 828 35 2 reads mapped to astrovirus respectively proportions of reads mapped to astrovirus in each sample are illustrated in fig 2 amplicons generated by classic hastv hastv mlb and hastv va reactions had 13 4 99 4 23 4 92 3 and 5 4 74 1 of reads mapped to astrovirus respectively sequencing reads that did not match an astrovirus sequence were mostly bacterial sequences such as alistipes senegalensis alistipes shahii etc and some unknown sequences suggesting the occurrence of non specific amplification 3 3 genotype diversity of classic mlb and va hastvs by analyzing the 58 amplicons a total of 18 astroviruses were detected from all 24 sewage samples including classic hastv genotypes 1 2 3 4 5 and 8 hastv mlb strains 1 and 2 hastv va strains 1 6 and non human mastv feline canine porcine and rodent asv of these 7 hastv 1 2 4 5 va1 va2 and va3 were detected in all sewage samples va6 is a newly identified strain in this study it was observed in february to may in 2018 and march may to july and september in 2019 ten full length orf2 sequences of va6 were obtained in this study they had 98 1 99 9 nucleotide identities among themselves and 82 9 83 2 and 82 3 83 3 nucleotide identities with two va5 reference strains va5 human gambia 102 139 2009 and bf34 respectively no closer genetic relationship can be found with the other strains or genotypes according to the above mentioned classification criteria we proposed the new strain va6 for the 24 amplicons generated by using classic hastv primer set all above mentioned 18 astroviruses were observed among the 193 091 806 reads that mapped to astroviruses 80 02 belonged to classic hastv 19 30 belonged to hastv va 0 64 belonged to non human mastv and the rest 0 0064 belonged to hastv mlb as shown in fig 3 a and 3b hastv 1 2 4 5 va1 va2 and va3 were detected in all months and hastv 5 1 and 2 were the most abundant which accounting for 27 87 23 45 and 14 97 of total astrovirus reads hastv 3 and 8 was the less common classic hastv which detected in 54 17 13 24 and 25 00 6 24 of samples and accounted for 0 42 and 0 62 of astrovirus reads respectively for the 19 amplicons generated by using hastv mlb primer set only 11 astroviruses were identified from ngs data among the 185 056 578 reads mapped to astrovirus 98 53 belonged to hastv mlb strains 1 and 2 1 24 belonged to classic hastv genotypes 1 5 0 23 belonged to non human mastv feline and rodent astv and the rest 0 0038 belonged to hastv va strains 2 and 3 fig 3c and d mlb1 was detected in all 19 amplicons accounting for 98 18 of total astrovirus reads yet mlb2 only detected in 37 5 9 24 of sewage samples accounting for 0 35 of astrovirus reads for the 15 amplicons generated by using hastv va primer set 11 astroviruses were identified from ngs data among the 54 278 828 reads mapped to astrovirus 99 99 belonged to hastv va strains 1 6 0 010 belonged to classic hastv genotypes 1 2 4 and 5 and the rest 0 00010 belonged to non human mastv rodent astv fig 3e and f as the most abundant strains va1 va2 and va3 were detected in all 15 amplicons accounting for 13 84 46 93 and 36 00 of total astrovirus reads respectively va4 va5 and va6 were detected less frequently in 53 33 8 15 66 67 10 15 and 60 0 9 15 of amplicons 3 4 homologous comparison and phylogenetic analysis by de novo and resequencing assembly a total of 273 full length orf2 sequences of hastvs were obtained in this study belonging to hastv 1 n 26 hastv 2 n 24 hastv 3 n 10 hastv 4 n 22 hastv 5 n 22 hastv 8 n 5 mlb1 n 20 mlb2 n 1 va1 n 35 va2 n 38 va3 n 38 va4 n 8 va5 n 14 and va6 n 10 to study the genetic relationship of hastv in this study with those from other parts of the world homologous comparison and phylogenetic analysis based on complete orf2 sequences were conducted using the above 273 local sequences and 178 reference sequences from genbank generally within each classic genotypes or novel strains there was a clear trend that shandong sequences had higher similarities with each other than with foreign sequences especially for hastv 2 96 7 100 0 vs 82 0 100 0 hastv 4 97 2 100 0 vs 88 5 98 1 hastv 5 97 4 100 0 vs 92 1 99 7 va2 98 4 100 0 vs 95 5 96 8 and va3 97 2 100 0 vs 95 2 98 1 fig 4 interestingly 7 local hastv 2 sequences om468637 om468642 which were obtained during january july in 2018 had 100 similarity with a reference strain klf hastv2 005 2019 mw485042 which was recovered from a diarrheal stool sample in coastal kenya in 2019 also 11 local mlb1 sequences om468722 om468723 om468725 om468727 om468729 om468731 om468733 om468737 om468738 from sewage samples collected in 6 months in 2018 and 5 months in 2019 shared 100 similarity with a reference strain fj222451 isolated from a child with acute diarrhea in australia in 1999 finkbeiner et al 2008a the close relationship among these sequences implies the occurrence of long distance spread phylogenetic analysis revealed 3 major clades of classic hastv hastv mlb and hastv va which were further classified into 14 phylogenetic groups fig 5 each group designated a classic hastv genotype or a novel strain for the clades of hastv va and mlb1 strains shandong sequences accounted for the majority of branches with only a small proportion of reference sequences from other parts of the world were presented in particular va6 was a newly proposed strain in this study and this clade consisted of chinese sequences exclusively the lack of reference sequences for va strains leaded to the result that most clusters or lineages were composed of sequences in this study for the clades of hastv 1 2 3 5 and 8 local sequences segregated into 2 or more genetic lineages suggesting cocirculation of multiple transmission chains of these genotypes in local population undoubtedly in accordance with the results of homologous analysis the mentioned hastv 2 and mlb1 local sequences showed close phylogenetic relationship with corresponding reference sequences in the tree 4 discussion sewage contains multiple organisms such as bacteria archaea eukaryotes plants and insects and their associated viruses in metagenomics ngs mngs analysis on raw sewage human viruses accounted for a very small proportion of total reads ng et al 2012 yang et al 2021 which was inadequate for further analysis of diversity and phylogeny for a certain virus whereas pcr amplification targeting viral genes from complex environment samples will provide a pure sample for ngs analysis a few studies have employed amplicon based ngs in investigating enteric viruses such as adenovirus norovirus sapovirus and enterovirus etc in sewage iaconelli et al 2017 suffredini et al 2018 fumian et al 2019 mancini et al 2019 tao et al 2020 among these only one such study focused on hastv prevost et al 2015 with just 4 genotypes identified yet which could be explained by the procedure of pooling amplicons by season and the relative low sequencing depth of pyrosequencing our study reflects sewage contains astroviruses with considerable high diversities and demonstrate ngs based environmental surveillance greatly improved the understanding of hastv circulation in this study complete orf2 amplification is an important factor leading to the improvement of the methodology all previous studies on environmental hastv using either cloning sanger sequencing method or ngs approach were based on amplification of partial orf1b or orf2 genes these studies aimed at different genomic regions which caused difficulties on integrating the results it is well recognized that the complete orf2 variability is the basis for classification and phylogenetic analysis of astroviruses bosch et al 2014 in this study ngs sequencing of complete orf2 amplicons from sewage was performed and a large amount of data was generated it is reasonable to believe that this methodology will improve the research on diversity evolution and classification of astroviruses in the long term astrovirus are quite diverse to date there are 19 genotype species of mastv and another 14 species being proposed donato and vijaykrishna 2017 hastv is also a group with great diversity besides the traditional 8 serotypes hastv 1 to 8 8 novel hastvs i e mlbs and vas have been detected successively by using metagenomics approach or by conserved sequence primers since 2008 finkbeiner et al 2008b these novel hastvs were identified generally from stool specimens from diarrhea or acute flaccid paralysis patients or from cerebrospinal fluid specimens from patients suffering meningitis or encephalitis during surveillance studies with limited clinical samples collected boujon et al 2017 considering the low prevalence of novel hastv in human population and the high genetic divergence that might lead to off target in pcr detection it is reasonable to believe that more currently circulating novel hastvs are awaiting classification in this study by using the new primer sets we observed a novel strain va6 presenting in 60 0 of sewage samples except for mlb3 which was identified only in 3 nations of india gambia and kenya all other previous reported novel hastvs mlb1 2 and va1 to 5 have been detected in this study this finding not only demonstrates the feasibility of the method developed in this study but also expands our knowledge of the diversity of novel hastvs circulating in local population astroviruses infect a wide range of mammalian and avian hosts current hastvs are classified into 4 species of mastv 1 6 8 and 9 with high genetic divergence among themselves actually novel hastvs are phylogenetically more related to animal astroviruses than to classic hastvs suggesting interspecies transmission events during virus evolution vu et al 2016 in particular hastv va strains belong to the human mink and ovine like hmo clade which also contains astroviruses affecting at least 10 animal species such as sheep mink bovine bat porcine fox feline and canine etc boujon et al 2017 this study identified 4 kinds of animal astroviruses among which canine and feline astrovirus were present in 87 5 and 37 5 of sewage samples respectively fig 3 this is not surprising in that domestic animals such as cats and dogs are in intimate contact with humans it is therefore likely that their feces were excreted into sewage network and astroviruses affecting them were detected however the exact origin of these animal astroviruses is not clear and whether these animal astroviruses can evolve and find their way to affecting humans is a worthy subject for further study initially as a supplementary method to afp surveillance environmental surveillance has proven its sensitivity and efficacy in identifying poliovirus transmission in the absence of detected afp cases lickness et al 2020 then environmental surveillance expanded its scope to other enteric viruses and most recently sars cov 2 la rosa et al 2020 several studies have reported the detection of viral rna in sewage before clinical identification smyth et al 2022 or in the early stage of local outbreaks monge et al 2018 nabi et al 2020 and revealed the close genetic relationship between clinical and sewage viruses tao et al 2011 reflecting the significance of environmental surveillance in early warning and the realistic values for evaluating the circulation of corresponding viral pathogens besides multiple technical advantages of environmental surveillance have been revealed in this study first testing of sewage samples is very efficient economical and convenient since the cost of amplicon based ngs has reduced to 100 dollars per sample in mainland china a single sewage specimen is able to provide dramatic genetic data of circulating viruses at a low cost with no requirement for collecting a number of clinical specimens second combined with ngs environmental surveillance is an effective approach in discovering novel pathogens such as new strain new species or

china diarrhea is an important public health problem a total of 1335 598 cases of infectious diarrhea were reported in 2021 cholera dysentery and enteric fever were excluded division of infectious disease 2022 hence environmental surveillance on diarrhea viruses is an important tool to supplement clinical surveillance and has a broad application prospect it should be noted that as one sewage sample may contain several astrovirus genotypes the orf2 sequences obtained in this study could be artifacts caused by pcr or fragmentation in the ngs protocol to rule out this possibility recombination analysis via similarity plot were undertaken the results showed that no recombination events were observed for all orf2 sequences in this study except for a sequence named hastv 8 sewage jn chn 105 2018 which had highest similarities with hastv 2 sequences at nt positions 387 657 fig s1 whether or not this is an experimental artifact or a nature recombinant is unclear from the current data further studies are needed to provide more solid evidence the present study is subjected to some limitations as shown in the fig 2c the sensitivity and specificity of primer pairs for hastv va were not satisfied only 35 2 of clean reads were mapped to astrovirus indicating non specific amplification accounts for the major proportion of the pcr products nevertheless considering the extremely low abundance of hastv in sewage the effect of non specific amplification could be ignored also mastv consists of multiple genotype species which can affect many mammalian species this study only focused on hastvs and did not explore animal astroviruses detection of 4 animal astroviruses in this study resulted from pcr amplification using primers designed for hastvs which are not likely to be suitable for animal astroviruses to investigate the diversity of human and animal astroviruses in sewage development of multiple primer sets for various mastv species is needed this will be an interesting aspect of future research to understand astrovirus ecology in urban environments 5 conclusion in this study an ngs based method was developed for detection and identification of hastv rna in sewage samples by using this method 18 astroviruses including a novel strain va6 have been identified from sewage samples collected between 2018 and 2019 our results demonstrate sewage contains astroviruses with considerable high diversities ngs based environmental surveillance greatly improves our understanding of hastv circulation and should be encouraged declaration of competing interest

16008,bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of persistent legacy contaminants have been intensively characterized but little is known on the contaminants of emerging concern cecs in freshwater food webs herein we comprehensively screened cecs with a focus on polar substances and further evaluated their trophic transfer behavior in selected items from the food web of lake templin germany weselected one plankton two mussel and nine fish samples covering three trophic levels with an effective multi residue sample preparation method and high resolution mass spectrometry based target suspect and non target screening we characterized 477 targets and further screened unknown features in complex biota matrices of the 477 targets 145 were detected and quantified in at least one species 0 02 3640 ng g dry weight additionally the suspect and non target analysis with experimental mass spectra libraries and in silico techniques metfrag and sirius4 csi fingerid enabled further identification of 27 unknown compounds with 19 confirmed by reference standards overall the detected compounds belong to a diverse group of chemicals including 71 pharmaceuticals 27 metabolites 26 pesticides 16 per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass 4 plasticizers 3 flame retardants 11 other industrial chemicals and 14 others moreover we determined the trophic magnification factor tmf of 34 polar cecs with 80 detection frequency among which 6 pfass including perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos perfluorodecanoic acid pfda perfluorohexane sulfonic acid pfhxs perfluorotridecanoic acid pftra

polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass endocrine disrupting compounds and others dulio et al 2018 us epa 2019 these chemicals and their metabolites are currently not well regulated cecs are new challenges for human health and environmental quality indeed many cecs and their metabolites have been ubiquitously detected in the environment particularly in surface water arinaitwe et al 2021 munz et al 2017 peng et al 2018 groundwater burke et al 2016 kiefer et al 2021 reemtsma et al 2013 soil and sediment chiaia hernández et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 with concentrations in the ng l to μg l range despite trace levels in the surrounding environment they can accumulate in aquatic organisms de solla et al 2016 munz et al 2018 pico et al 2019 valdés et al 2014 for example munz et al detected 63 cecs in the invertebrate gammarus sp from wastewater impacted streams munz et al 2018 pico et al 2019 found 76 cecs in fish from four spanish rivers cecs may pose potential risks to the environment and human health once cecs enter an organism they may induce adverse effects and further undergo trophic transfer along the food web for example the accumulation of endocrine disruptors in aquatic wild life such as mollusk and alligators could lead to reproductive abnormalities resulting in a substantial population decline sumpter and johnson 2005 therefore it is essential to evaluate the bioaccumulation potential and trophic transfer behavior of organic chemicals along the food web the trophic transfer risks are usually determined by trophic magnification factors tmfs which are calculated from the slope of logarithmically transformed concentrations of chemicals versus the trophic level of organisms in the food web borgå et al 2012 conder et al 2012 kidd et al 2018 current trophic transfer research has mainly focused on non polar legacy compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs figueiredo et al 2014 kosfeld et al 2021 kwon et al 2006 maul et al 2006 polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes lapointe et al 2020 ma et al 2013 and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt blair et al 2013 due to their high hydrophobicity and known biomagnification potential in contrast less research has been conducted on the trophic transfer of polar cecs in freshwater ecosystems compared to non polar compounds polar cecs should be considered equivalent in terms of toxicological significance due to their higher bioavailability in water systems polar cecs are often hydrophilic and comprise various functional moieties that diversify their uptake and interaction pathways within organisms therefore it is challenging to predict the trophic transfer potential of polar cecs based on past knowledge of hydrophobic legacy compounds thus it is needed to investigate polar cecs along the food web in a natural environmental scenario recent studies have reported the trophic transfer of some cecs including antibiotics ppcps and pfass fang et al 2014 houde et al 2008 jartun et al 2019 liu et al 2018a loi et al 2011 martin et al 2004 simmonet laprade et al 2019 yang et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 for example zhou et al investigated the trophic transfer of 24 antibiotics in the freshwater food web in lake taihu china zhou et al 2020 yang et al studied the trophic transfer of 30 ppcps in urbanized rivers yang et al 2020 other studies focused on the trophic transfer of up to 30 pfass in aquatic food webs chen et al 2018 fang et al 2014 houde et al 2008 jartun et al 2019 loi et al 2011 martin et al 2004 mazzoni et al 2020 simmonet laprade et al 2019 xu et al 2014 these studies are informative but mostly focus on specific chemical classes through target screening the lack of an analytical approach has hampered the comprehensive screening of cecs to further explore the trophic transfer behavior under field conditions high resolution mass spectrometry hrms based suspect and non target screening offers a promising approach to simultaneously identify a broad range of cecs hollender et al 2017 it has been applied in abiotic environmental samples such as wastewater surface water hollender et al 2017 groundwater kiefer et al 2021 soil and sediment chiaia hernández et al 2020 but rarely for complex biota matrices especially for multiple species it is challenging to develop an analytical approach which covers a broad range of polarity and diversity of chemical structures in various biota matrices the present study aimed to comprehensively screen potential polar cecs in freshwater biota and evaluate their trophic transfer behavior in a freshwater food web various species at three trophic levels were selected including one plankton two mussels and nine fish samples from the food web of lake templin near potsdam in germany the derived food web samples were evaluated and proven to successfully capture the trophic magnification potential of pops with well known biomagnification properties e g pcbs mercury methyl mercury in a previous investigation kosfeld et al 2021 supporting the use of these samples in this study to characterize the trophic transfer of other substances such as cecs after confirming the suitability of the food web samples we optimized a sample preparation method and an analytical workflow to comprehensively screen polar cecs in the different biota types through an integrated target suspect and non target approach we then quantified the known polar cecs and identified unknowns in different species finally we characterized the trophic transfer potential of the identified polar cecs this is the first study of an integrated target suspect and non target approach to thoroughly evaluate the trophic transfer of various polar cecs in a freshwater food web 2 materials and methods fig 1 outlines the overall workflow for this study 2

collected in lake templin near potsdam germany in 2018 kosfeld et al 2021 si1st b fig s1 after collection the plankton fraction 200 µm was freeze dried zebra mussels were transferred into rearing aquaria for 24 to 48 h for gut clearance followed by immediate freezing sorting small size 2 cm big size 2 cm shelling and subsequent cryo storage using liquid nitrogen fish white bream roach bleak perch asp pike and pikeperch were dissected into fillet and carcass and then frozen with liquid nitrogen details on the sampling site selection and the food web sample information are provided in si1st b and si1st c table s2 and figs s1 and s2 all biota samples were cryo stored 150 c before sample preparation frozen biota samples were manually crushed cryo milled and freeze dried composite whole body tissue samples were grouped according to their pre determined species and sizes different to a previous analysis of the same sample set for legacy pops from lake templin kosfeld et al 2021 we combined perch and perch 1 into one perch sample pike and pike 1 into one pike sample as well as pikeperch a and b into one pikeperch sample in this study due to the limited biomass accordingly we used mean values of d15n to analyze the trophic position of perch pike and pikeperch respectively to reduce the analytical challenges that come along with complex biota matrices we preliminarily screened chemicals in passive samplers to get a first overview of cecs in the lake empore styrenedivinylbenzene sdb passive sampler disks covered by a polyethersulfone pes membrane were placed in the northern middle and southern parts of the lake respectively then the list of the masses detected in the passive sampler extracts was used as a suspect list to support the suspect and non target analysis of contaminants in complex biota samples 2 3 water lipid and protein content determination of biota the water content was gravimetrically determined by freeze drying the biota samples lipids

the same extraction step was repeated once and the supernatants were pooled after extraction all samples were frozen at 20 c for 48 h and then centrifuged to remove the precipitates the supernatants were concentrated under nitrogen to about 0 5 ml using a vacuum concentrator eppendorf concentrator plus at 30 c the extracts were reconstituted to 1 ml by adding a mixture of acetonitrile methanol 1

quantification target quantification was performed with the software tracefinder 4 1 or 5 1 thermo scientific target analytes were quantified based on the retention time rt ms ms fragments and a linear calibration curve weighting 1 x of the reference standards n 477 using the peak area ratio of the respective reference standard and istd of the analyte for targets without their own istd an alternative istd was selected based on a similar elution rt and concentrations were further corrected based on the corresponding relative recovery details on the quantification method and quality control are given in si1st e fig s3 the target and internal standard chemicals are listed in si2nd a and b 2 7 suspect and non target screening 2 7 1 raw data pre processing compound discoverer 3 1 cd thermo scientific was used for the suspect and non target screening three suspect lists of the norman suspect list mass exchange database 40 000 substances from https www norman network com q suspect list exchange a suspect mass list from the initial screening of passive samplers 5000 substances and an in house eawag database with reference standards 500 substances were imported into the cd workflow in addition ms ms spectra databases including mzcloud eu massbank massbank of north america mona and eawag massbank were added to the workflow for structural identification before analyzing the data from the biota samples we processed the hrms ms raw data of a calibration standard solution containing about 200 target substances to optimize the parameters of the cd workflow after the workflow validation the acquired hrms ms raw data of biota samples were pre processed peak picking retention time alignment grouping of isotopologues and adducts and compounds across samples finally a feature matrix table containing compound ids molecular formula ion intensities sample ids and groups was generated as a result of the performed workflow the workflow chart and detailed parameter settings for each step are provided in si1st f fig s4 and tables s6 22 the suspect chemicals are listed in si2nd c and d 2 7 2 feature prioritization strategies the features obtained from raw data pre processing were prioritized based on the following steps 1 high intensity peaks were selected based on the inclusion criteria i 5 min rt 30 min ii peak intensity 105 iii ratio of samples and all controls blanks 5 then multiple filtering strategies were applied to pick out features in parallel as described in the following steps 2a 2b and 2c 2a the resulting features from step 1 were compared with suspect list databases and the matched features opted in 2b the features with characteristic mass spectra of halogens i e cl br f were selected and 2c the features with an increasing intensity trend along the food web were considered indicative of biomagnification and therefore selected 3 the matched features from 2a 2b and 2c were manually checked to filter out bad peak shapes 4 finally the resulting features were stored for further structural elucidation and identification the schematic representation and the number of prioritized features at each step are given in si1st g 2 7 3 structural elucidation and confirmation the final prioritized features were annotated based on matching ms ms spectra of mzcloud and massbank libraries in cd3 1 for features that did not match a library spectrum structure proposals were assigned using in silico fragmentation spectra of pubchem lite compounds with metfrag cl2 4 5 from r package resolution ruttkies et al 2016 or the machine learning based tool sirius4 csi fingerid 4 0 1 dührkop et al 2015 the top 10 candidates were checked manually and an initial confidence level was assigned finally if commercially available the standards were purchased to confirm or reject the identification confirmed structures level 1 were achieved by matching rt and ms ms with reference standards schymanski et al 2014 probable structures level 2 were assigned and achieved by matching major fragments with ms ms libraries while tentative structures level 3 were proposed based on the ms ms interpretation prioritized features with exact mass and unequivocal molecular formula were assigned to unknowns as level 4 finally features with no structure and no unequivocal molecular formula were assigned to unknowns of interest as level 5 2 8 trophic level characterization and trophic magnification factors the trophic levels of aquatic biota were determined from stable isotope ratios of carbon δ13c and nitrogen δ15n the δ13c and δ15n values of all the pretreated samples were determined by agroisolab gmbh jülich germany after lipid extraction the detailed analysis of δ13c and δ15n values can be found elsewhere kosfeld et al 2021 the trophic level of one organism was calculated based on the previously established method post 2002 eq 1 1 t r o p h i c l e v e l δ 15 n p r e d a t o r δ 15 n b a s e l i n e δ 15 n λ δ15nbaseline is the δ15n value of the baseline organism mussels in this study δ15npredator is the δ15n value of each consumer the λ represents the trophic level of the baseline organisms λ 2 in this study kosfeld et al 2021 δ15n is a nitrogen isotope trophic increment which was set to 2 3 according to the analysis by mccutchan et al 2003 the trophic magnification factor tmf was calculated based on the trophic level of a given organism eqs 2 and 3 2 t m f 10 b 3 l o g c b i o b t r o p h i c l e v e l a where cbio is the chemical concentration in the organisms of a given trophic level b is the slope of the linear regression of the log transformed cbio a is the constant of the linear regression a tmf 1 suggests biomagnification along the food web to account for differences in lipid or protein content for the different species we further normalized the biota concentrations based on their defined lipid or protein contents in the organisms and then determined their tmflip or tmfprotein respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison and performance of analytical methods sample preparation is a crucial step for the comprehensive screening of chemicals in complex matrices we optimized and compared two extraction methods sse and quechers to achieve an optimal performance for a broad coverage of chemicals in plankton mussel and fish samples the recoveries and loqs were not significantly different between sse and quechers finally we choose the sse method for all the field samples because more interferences for the mass spectrometric detection were expected from the salts used in the quechers method the detailed method performance in terms of the relative recovery absolute recovery matrix factor and loq are given in si1st e fig s3 and si2nd a the sse method was successfully applied for the field biota samples to quantify 477 target compounds with a wide range of physicochemical properties log d ow ranging from 3 9 to 6 9 at ph 7 si2nd a and b the average absolute recoveries in plankton mussels and fish were similar and about 52 fig 2 the average matrix factors in plankton mussels and fish was 0 52 0 58 and 0 66 the matrix factor of most compounds 406 of 477 substances was below 1 indicating ion suppression therefore the matrix should be considered as a major factor influencing the analytical performance nevertheless we used the isotope labeled internal standards to account for this effect and achieved acceptable relative recoveries 70 130 for the quantification of over 80 of the target compounds fig 2 indicating a broad coverage of substances the concentration of the remaining target compounds with a relative recovery of less than 70 or over 130 have higher uncertainty and should be more carefully interpreted this uncertainty might be due to the lack of an own isotope labeled internal standard although the matrix factor was used to correct the relative recovery loqs ranging from 0 05 to 5 70 ng g dry weight dw equivalent to 0 23 to 28 5 ng g wet weight based on the average water content of 78 were achieved for 477 compounds in the three different biota matrices showing excellent sensitivity for a diverse set of chemicals in complex matrices the detailed parameters of method performance including loqs absolute recoveries relative recoveries and matrix factors of 477 target substances in three different biota matrices are provided in the second supporting information document si2nd a overall the loqs were better or comparable to those reported in other studies which determined 84 substances with loqs ranging from 0 1 to 380 ng g wet weight in aquatic amphipods munz et al 2018 and 217 substances with loqs ranging from 0 2 to 1100 ng g wet weight in fish and sea eagles dürig et al 2020 3 2 internal concentrations of target substances in the biota combining stable isotope analyses and chemical analyses of biota can reveal the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of contaminants within the food web the detailed value of δ15n and δ13c are provided in si1st table s2 and fig s2 based on δ15n values from 14 7 0 1 to 22 0 0 1 fig 3 a the trophic levels of all organisms followed the ascending order of plankton mussel small mussel size 2 cm white bream roach size 35 36 cm small roach size 9 11 cm bleak small perch size 7 10 cm asp pike perch size 28 32 cm and pikeperch fig 3 a to obtain realistic trophic positions we applied the increment of 2 3 proposed by kosfeld et al 2021 which is comparable to that δ15n 2 0 in stream ecosystems jardine et al 2013 but lower than the conventional value δ15n 3 4 for aquatic organisms in freshwater systems because trophic positions directly influence the calculation of tmfs the applied increment has to be considered when interpreting tmfs in section 3 4 below of 477 target compounds 145 were detected and quantified above loq in at least one species these chemicals include 68 pharmaceuticals 25 pesticides 16 pfass 25 metabolites and 11 others the concentrations of all detected compounds in different biota samples are given in si2nd e in total 13 of 145 detected chemicals were found across all biota including 4 formylaminoantipyrine methyl 1h benzotriazole benzotriazole fosinopril lidocaine perfluorodecanoic acid pfda perfluorohexane sulfonic acid pfhxs perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos perfluorotetradecanoic acid pftea perfluorotridecanoic acid pftra pregabalin progesterone and terbutryn it is worth noting that illicit drugs and sweeteners were mostly found in plankton and mussels and rarely detected in fish among these chemical categories pfass showed the highest total concentrations 9401 ng g dw followed by pharmaceuticals 6578 ng g dw metabolites 1527 ng g dw pesticides 960 ng g dw and others 330 ng g dw fig 3 b the 25 metabolites include 12 pharmaceutical metabolites 12 pesticide metabolites and 1 illicit drug metabolite these results emphasize the importance of monitoring contaminant metabolites which can be present at higher concentrations than their parent compounds and may be bioactive or even more toxic than parent compounds cwiertny et al 2014 fu et al 2020 qu et al 2013 the different groups of chemicals enter the freshwater system through different pathways a large number of pharmaceuticals n 68 were detected in biota probably due to the effluent discharge from the largest wwtp of the city of berlin upstream of the lake templin indeed an earlier study on streams influenced by wwtp discharge in switzerland has found higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals in gammarids caught downstream of the wwtps than upstream munz et al 2018 in contrast the presence of pesticides including herbicides fungicides insecticides and biocides in biota across different trophic levels was likely due to emission from agricultural or urbanized areas wittmer et al 2010 pfass may come from different pathways such as wwtp effluents industrial emissions or agricultural runoff the widespread occurrence of pfas has been reported in many environmental compartments including sediment soil aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates giesy and kannan 2001 koch et al 2019 liu et al 2018 teunen et al 2021 tian et al 2020 the metabolites in the biota samples could either be attributed to uptake from water or biotransformation in the organisms or both 5 of the 25 detected metabolites including diuron desdimethyl flufenacet oxa metazachlor oxa methiocarb sulfone phenol and n 2 4 dimethylphenyl n methylformamidine were detected in the organisms but not in the passive sampler samples indicating biotransformation in the organisms the remaining 20 metabolites were also detected in passive sampler samples suggesting that they most probably were assimilated from the water phase 3 3 identification of unknown features in the biota via suspect and non target screening beyond target analysis the suspect and non target screening allowed further identification of 27 compounds we applied rigorous prioritization strategies to focus on the most relevant features from about one million unknown features in 12 aquatic species 36 extract samples 3 replicates details of feature prioritization and filtering in si1st g and fig s5 of the 27 features 17 were initially assigned to the confidence level 2a based on matches with library spectra and 10 were assigned to the confidence level 3 based on in silico predictions from at least one algorithm metfrag or sirius csi fingerid next commercially available reference standards n 22 no available standards for the other 5 features were purchased to confirm the initial identifications finally 15 features initially at level 2a were confirmed and assigned to confidence level 1 and one feature at level 2a was rejected table 1 resulting in a 94 successful confirmation rate in addition 4 features initially at level 3 were confirmed as level 1 by reference standards and 2 features were rejected table 1 i e a 67 of successful confirmation rate overall 19 out of the 22 newly purchased reference standards were confirmed and three rejected the detailed information for each confirmed substance and their ms ms spectra are provided in si1st h and si1st i figs s6 s53 despite the complex matrices and broad analyte coverage of the target analysis 477 compounds our results present a very high success rate 86 of structural confirmation of contaminants at level 1 besides the rigorous prioritization strategies the experimental ms ms spectral databases such as massbank are crucial for initial identification since 94 of the database matched features were further successfully confirmed using reference standards also 67 of the features initially assigned to level 3 based on the in silico prediction techniques metfrag and csi fingerid were successfully confirmed as level 1 using reference standards these results highlight how the high quality ms ms spectral libraries and in silico prediction techniques play a crucial role in identification of unknown organic substances nevertheless the use of reference standards remains the gold standard for unambiguous final structural confirmation the identified non targets mainly include plasticizers flame retardants other industrial chemicals and pharmaceutical metabolites this observation could be attributed to the enormous use of plasticizers and flame retardants in plastics toys textiles furniture buildings and other materials plasticizers and flame retardants are released to the environment through leaching abrasion and evaporation hence they have been previously detected in various environmental matrices including wastewater surface water groundwater air and particulate material reemtsma et al 2008 additionally plasticizers and flame retardants are found to accumulate in biota in fact the chemicals triisobutyl phosphate tibp tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate tbep and tris 2 chlorethyl phosphate tcep found in the freshwater biota analyzed in this study table 1 were previously detected in arctic fish birds and mammals from diverse habitats hallanger et al 2015 as well as tropical fishes from the philippines kim et al 2011 collection of samples close to wwtp discharge resulted in higher concentrations of flame retardants and plasticizers e g tbep in both marine and freshwater biota sundkvist et al 2010 in addition this study also identified other polar cecs through suspect and non target screening such as industrial chemicals a flavoring agent and pharmaceutical metabolites for instance to our knowledge the flavoring agent sulfurol was detected for the first time in freshwater organisms 3 4 biomagnification and biodilution of the identified substances in the food web to evaluate the biomagnification or biodilution potential of the confirmed chemicals from the target suspect and non target approaches we calculated the tmfs of the chemicals in the food web to ensure minimal uncertainty in the food web we only calculated the tmfs of chemicals n 34 29 targets and 5 non targets with a detection frequency greater than 80 across all samples si1st j table s23 among these 34 contaminants 12 including 6 pfass 5 pharmaceuticals and 1 metabolite showed significant biomagnification or biodilution patterns p 0 05 fig 4 the remaining compounds showed no significant pattern p 0 05 si1st table s23 the tmfs of six pfass i e pfos pfda pfhxs pftra pftea and perfluoroundecanoic acid pfuna ranged from 1 8 to 4 2 fig 4 a indicating a biomagnification potential from plankton to fish in the selected freshwater food web in contrast to the well known lipophilic bioaccumulation mechanism of hydrophobic compounds pfass are suggested to enter the food web by binding to proteins especially water soluble proteins such as serum proteins e g serum albumin forsthuber et al 2020 zhang et al 2009 therefore we further calculated the protein based tmfs based on the protein normalized concentrations of pfass in the organisms si1st tables s24 and s25 we found that the protein based tmfs of pfass are similar to the dry weight based tmfs indicating a consistent calculation of biomagnification potential the biomagnification of long chain pfass c8 in the food web is in agreement with previous observations fang et al 2014 houde et al 2008 kosfeld et al 2021 and pfos can even be used as a benchmark chemical franklin 2016 kosfeld et al 2021 for example miranda et al found biomagnification of pfos etfosa and pfna in a tropical estuarine food web of bivalve crustacean and fish miranda et al 2021 similarly gao et al found biomagnification of pfhxs and pfos in an antarctic food web gao et al 2020 as pfass have different isomers in linear and branched forms these isomers may have distinct bioaccumulation and biomagnification potential due to different hydrophobicity persistence and molecular structure for example the linear pfos isomer was found to be more strongly biomagnified than the branched isomers probably due to the preferential interaction of linear isomers with cell membranes fang et al 2014 houde et al 2008 in the current study for the total of linear and branched pfos a dry weight based tmf of 4 2 2 3 7 5 was calculated the tmf of the linear pfos was determined to be 3 0 1 8 4 8 dry weight equivalent to 5 4 2 6 11 3 wet weight in a previous analysis of the same sample set from lake templin kosfeld et al 2021 the tmf of pfos in the examined food web is slightly higher than previously reported 2 9 1 6 wet weight chen et al 2018 fang et al 2014 houde et al 2008 jartun et al 2019 loi et al 2011 martin et al 2004 mazzoni et al 2020 simmonet laprade et al 2019a simonnet laprade et al 2019b xu et al 2014 which might be attributed to biotransformation of precursors of pfos simonnet laprade et al 2019b conversion of other pfass such as perfluorooctanesulfonamide fosa to pfos has been reported in rainbow trout brandsma et al 2011 in fact fosa was detected in the food web in this study and its internal concentrations decreased from mussel to fish samples si1st k fig s54 indicating biotransformation of fosa in fish similarly fosa has been shown to be transformed to pfos in freshwater fish babut et al 2017 simmonet laprade et al 2019a and presumably also in other animals galatius et al 2013 ross et al 2012 concurrently the pfos tissue concentration increased from mussel to fish which may be not only due to biomagnification but also to the phylogenetic difference in the ability to biotransform fosa to pfos therefore fosa may serve as another source of pfos in the food web leading to a higher tmf of pfos in contrast to the pfass the tmfs of five pharmaceuticals phenazone progesterone venlafaxine levamisole and lidocaine and one personal care product metabolite galaxolidone ranged from 0 4 to 0 6 fig 4 b and 4 c suggesting a biodilution potential in the food web the observed trophic dilution tmf 1 0 of pharmaceuticals in the food web is in agreement with previous reports covering different levels of complexity of the food web at various locations haddad et al 2018 xie et al 2017 for example xie et al detected eight pharmaceuticals in 14 aquatic species including plankton invertebrates and fish collected in taihu lake china and found a biodilution pattern for all detected pharmaceuticals i e roxithromycin propranolol diclofenac ibuprofen ofloxacin norfloxacin ciprofloxacin and tetracycline xie et al 2017 similarly biodilution was observed for four other pharmaceuticals sertraline citalopram caffeine and roxithromycin in a food web consisting of plankton three invertebrate species and nine fish species yang et al 2020 the trophic biodilution of pharmaceuticals might be attributed to a series of factors including accumulation mechanisms chemical properties and metabolic capacity in general aquatic species at a higher trophic level have metabolic enzymes similar to that of humans the enzymatic activities of cytochrome p450 oxidases cyps and conjugate transferases are widely shared between humans and aquatic animals including fish and invertebrates katagi 2010 kosfeld et al 2020 4 conclusions the targeted approach enabled the quantification of a broad range of cecs n 145 in various freshwater food web species revealing an effective target analysis strategy to simultaneously monitor many polar cecs including pfass in various complex biota matrices the suspect and non target screening identified 27 unknown compounds with 19 confirmed by reference standards level 1 this finding highlights the successful application of suspect and non target screening in identifying unknown compounds in aquatic biota biomagnification was observed mostly for pfass while biodilution mostly occurred for pharmaceuticals indicating the varying trophic transfer of polar cecs in a freshwater food web these results call for more detailed analyses to further elucidate the possible emissions of pfass into lake templin and their

16008,bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of persistent legacy contaminants have been intensively characterized but little is known on the contaminants of emerging concern cecs in freshwater food webs herein we comprehensively screened cecs with a focus on polar substances and further evaluated their trophic transfer behavior in selected items from the food web of lake templin germany weselected one plankton two mussel and nine fish samples covering three trophic levels with an effective multi residue sample preparation method and high resolution mass spectrometry based target suspect and non target screening we characterized 477 targets and further screened unknown features in complex biota matrices of the 477 targets 145 were detected and quantified in at least one species 0 02 3640 ng g dry weight additionally the suspect and non target analysis with experimental mass spectra libraries and in silico techniques metfrag and sirius4 csi fingerid enabled further identification of 27 unknown compounds with 19 confirmed by reference standards overall the detected compounds belong to a diverse group of chemicals including 71 pharmaceuticals 27 metabolites 26 pesticides 16 per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass 4 plasticizers 3 flame retardants 11 other industrial chemicals and 14 others moreover we determined the trophic magnification factor tmf of 34 polar cecs with 80 detection frequency among which 6 pfass including perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos perfluorodecanoic acid pfda perfluorohexane sulfonic acid pfhxs perfluorotridecanoic acid pftra

resolution mass spectrometry food web polar compounds pfass biomagnification 1 introduction contaminants of emerging concern cecs include pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass endocrine disrupting compounds and others dulio et al 2018 us epa 2019 these chemicals and their metabolites are currently not well regulated cecs are new challenges for human health and environmental quality indeed many cecs and their metabolites have been ubiquitously detected in the environment particularly in surface water arinaitwe et al 2021 munz et al 2017 peng et al 2018 groundwater burke et al 2016 kiefer et al 2021 reemtsma et al 2013 soil and sediment chiaia hernández et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 with concentrations in the ng l to μg l range despite trace levels in the surrounding environment they can accumulate in aquatic organisms de solla et al 2016 munz et al 2018 pico et al 2019 valdés et al 2014 for example munz et al detected 63 cecs in the invertebrate gammarus sp from wastewater impacted streams munz et al 2018 pico et al 2019 found 76 cecs in fish from four spanish rivers cecs may pose potential risks to the environment and human health once cecs enter an organism they may induce adverse effects and further undergo trophic transfer along the food web for example the accumulation of endocrine disruptors in aquatic wild life such as mollusk and alligators could lead to reproductive abnormalities resulting in a substantial population decline sumpter and johnson 2005 therefore it is essential to evaluate the bioaccumulation potential and trophic transfer behavior of organic chemicals along the food web the trophic transfer risks are usually determined by trophic magnification factors tmfs which are calculated from the slope of logarithmically transformed concentrations of chemicals versus the trophic level of organisms in the food web borgå et al 2012 conder et al 2012 kidd et al 2018 current trophic transfer research has mainly focused on non polar legacy compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs figueiredo et al 2014 kosfeld et al 2021 kwon et al 2006 maul et al 2006 polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes lapointe et al 2020 ma et al 2013 and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt blair et al 2013 due to their high hydrophobicity and known biomagnification potential in contrast less research has been conducted on the trophic transfer of polar cecs in freshwater ecosystems compared to non polar compounds polar cecs should be considered equivalent in terms of toxicological significance due to their higher bioavailability in water systems polar cecs are often hydrophilic and comprise various functional moieties that diversify their uptake and interaction pathways within organisms therefore it is challenging to predict the trophic transfer potential of polar cecs based on past knowledge of hydrophobic legacy compounds thus it is needed to investigate polar cecs along the food web in a natural environmental scenario recent studies have reported the trophic transfer of some cecs including antibiotics ppcps and pfass fang et al 2014 houde et al 2008 jartun et al 2019 liu et al 2018a loi et al 2011 martin et al 2004 simmonet laprade et al 2019 yang et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 for example zhou et al investigated the trophic transfer of 24 antibiotics in the freshwater food web in lake taihu china zhou et al 2020 yang et al studied the trophic transfer of 30 ppcps in urbanized rivers yang et al 2020 other studies focused on the trophic transfer of up to 30 pfass in aquatic food webs chen et al 2018 fang et al 2014 houde et al 2008 jartun et al 2019 loi et al 2011 martin et al 2004 mazzoni et al 2020 simmonet laprade et al 2019 xu et al 2014 these studies are informative but mostly focus on specific chemical classes through target screening the lack of an analytical approach has hampered the comprehensive screening of cecs to further explore the trophic transfer behavior under field conditions high resolution mass spectrometry hrms based suspect and non target screening offers a promising approach to simultaneously identify a broad range of cecs hollender et al 2017 it has been applied in abiotic environmental samples such as wastewater surface water hollender et al 2017 groundwater kiefer et al 2021 soil and sediment chiaia hernández et al 2020 but rarely for complex biota matrices especially for multiple species it is challenging to develop an analytical approach which covers a broad range of polarity and diversity of chemical structures in various biota matrices the present study aimed to comprehensively screen potential polar cecs in freshwater biota and evaluate their trophic transfer behavior in a freshwater food web various species at three trophic levels were selected including one plankton two mussels and nine fish samples from the food web of lake templin near potsdam in germany the derived food web samples were evaluated and proven to successfully capture the trophic magnification potential of pops with well known biomagnification properties e g pcbs mercury methyl mercury in a previous investigation kosfeld et al 2021 supporting the use of these samples in this study to characterize the trophic transfer of other substances such as cecs after confirming the suitability of the food web samples we optimized a sample preparation method and an analytical workflow to comprehensively screen polar cecs in the different biota types through an integrated target suspect and non target approach we then quantified the known polar cecs and identified unknowns in different species finally we characterized the trophic transfer potential of the identified polar cecs this is the first study of an integrated target suspect and non target approach to thoroughly evaluate the trophic transfer of various polar cecs in a freshwater food web 2 materials and methods fig 1 outlines the overall workflow for this study 2

collected in lake templin near potsdam germany in 2018 kosfeld et al 2021 si1st b fig s1 after collection the plankton fraction 200 µm was freeze dried zebra mussels were transferred into rearing aquaria for 24 to 48 h for gut clearance followed by immediate freezing sorting small size 2 cm big size 2 cm shelling and subsequent cryo storage using liquid nitrogen fish white bream roach bleak perch asp pike and pikeperch were dissected into fillet and carcass and then frozen with liquid nitrogen details on the sampling site selection and the food web sample information are provided in si1st b and si1st c table s2 and figs s1 and s2 all biota samples were cryo stored 150 c before sample preparation frozen biota samples were manually crushed cryo milled and freeze dried composite whole body tissue samples were grouped according to their pre determined species and sizes different to a previous analysis of the same sample set for legacy pops from lake templin kosfeld et al 2021 we combined perch and perch 1 into one perch sample pike and pike 1 into one pike sample as well as pikeperch a and b into one pikeperch sample in this study due to the limited biomass accordingly we used mean values of d15n to analyze the trophic position of perch pike and pikeperch respectively to reduce the analytical challenges that come along with complex biota matrices we preliminarily screened chemicals in passive samplers to get a first overview of cecs in the lake empore styrenedivinylbenzene sdb passive sampler disks covered by a polyethersulfone pes membrane were placed in the northern middle and southern parts of the lake respectively then the list of the masses detected in the passive sampler extracts was used as a suspect list to support the suspect and non target analysis of contaminants in complex biota samples 2 3 water lipid and protein content determination of biota the water content was gravimetrically determined by freeze drying the biota samples lipids

the same extraction step was repeated once and the supernatants were pooled after extraction all samples were frozen at 20 c for 48 h and then centrifuged to remove the precipitates the supernatants were concentrated under nitrogen to about 0 5 ml using a vacuum concentrator eppendorf concentrator plus at 30 c the extracts were reconstituted to 1 ml by adding a mixture of acetonitrile methanol 1

quantification target quantification was performed with the software tracefinder 4 1 or 5 1 thermo scientific target analytes were quantified based on the retention time rt ms ms fragments and a linear calibration curve weighting 1 x of the reference standards n 477 using the peak area ratio of the respective reference standard and istd of the analyte for targets without their own istd an alternative istd was selected based on a similar elution rt and concentrations were further corrected based on the corresponding relative recovery details on the quantification method and quality control are given in si1st e fig s3 the target and internal standard chemicals are listed in si2nd a and b 2 7 suspect and non target screening 2 7 1 raw data pre processing compound discoverer 3 1 cd thermo scientific was used for the suspect and non target screening three suspect lists of the norman suspect list mass exchange database 40 000 substances from https www norman network com q suspect list exchange a suspect mass list from the initial screening of passive samplers 5000 substances and an in house eawag database with reference standards 500 substances were imported into the cd workflow in addition ms ms spectra databases including mzcloud eu massbank massbank of north america mona and eawag massbank were added to the workflow for structural identification before analyzing the data from the biota samples we processed the hrms ms raw data of a calibration standard solution containing about 200 target substances to optimize the parameters of the cd workflow after the workflow validation the acquired hrms ms raw data of biota samples were pre processed peak picking retention time alignment grouping of isotopologues and adducts and compounds across samples finally a feature matrix table containing compound ids molecular formula ion intensities sample ids and groups was generated as a result of the performed workflow the workflow chart and detailed parameter settings for each step are provided in si1st f fig s4 and tables s6 22 the suspect chemicals are listed in si2nd c and d 2 7 2 feature prioritization strategies the features obtained from raw data pre processing were prioritized based on the following steps 1 high intensity peaks were selected based on the inclusion criteria i 5 min rt 30 min ii peak intensity 105 iii ratio of samples and all controls blanks 5 then multiple filtering strategies were applied to pick out features in parallel as described in the following steps 2a 2b and 2c 2a the resulting features from step 1 were compared with suspect list databases and the matched features opted in 2b the features with characteristic mass spectra of halogens i e cl br f were selected and 2c the features with an increasing intensity trend along the food web were considered indicative of biomagnification and therefore selected 3 the matched features from 2a 2b and 2c were manually checked to filter out bad peak shapes 4 finally the resulting features were stored for further structural elucidation and identification the schematic representation and the number of prioritized features at each step are given in si1st g 2 7 3 structural elucidation and confirmation the final prioritized features were annotated based on matching ms ms spectra of mzcloud and massbank libraries in cd3 1 for features that did not match a library spectrum structure proposals were assigned using in silico fragmentation spectra of pubchem lite compounds with metfrag cl2 4 5 from r package resolution ruttkies et al 2016 or the machine learning based tool sirius4 csi fingerid 4 0 1 dührkop et al 2015 the top 10 candidates were checked manually and an initial confidence level was assigned finally if commercially available the standards were purchased to confirm or reject the identification confirmed structures level 1 were achieved by matching rt and ms ms with reference standards schymanski et al 2014 probable structures level 2 were assigned and achieved by matching major fragments with ms ms libraries while tentative structures level 3 were proposed based on the ms ms interpretation prioritized features with exact mass and unequivocal molecular formula were assigned to unknowns as level 4 finally features with no structure and no unequivocal molecular formula were assigned to unknowns of interest as level 5 2 8 trophic level characterization and trophic magnification factors the trophic levels of aquatic biota were determined from stable isotope ratios of carbon δ13c and nitrogen δ15n the δ13c and δ15n values of all the pretreated samples were determined by agroisolab gmbh jülich germany after lipid extraction the detailed analysis of δ13c and δ15n values can be found elsewhere kosfeld et al 2021 the trophic level of one organism was calculated based on the previously established method post 2002 eq 1 1 t r o p h i c l e v e l δ 15 n p r e d a t o r δ 15 n b a s e l i n e δ 15 n λ δ15nbaseline is the δ15n value of the baseline organism mussels in this study δ15npredator is the δ15n value of each consumer the λ represents the trophic level of the baseline organisms λ 2 in this study kosfeld et al 2021 δ15n is a nitrogen isotope trophic increment which was set to 2 3 according to the analysis by mccutchan et al 2003 the trophic magnification factor tmf was calculated based on the trophic level of a given organism eqs 2 and 3 2 t m f 10 b 3 l o g c b i o b t r o p h i c l e v e l a where cbio is the chemical concentration in the organisms of a given trophic level b is the slope of the linear regression of the log transformed cbio a is the constant of the linear regression a tmf 1 suggests biomagnification along the food web to account for differences in lipid or protein content for the different species we further normalized the biota concentrations based on their defined lipid or protein contents in the organisms and then determined their tmflip or tmfprotein respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison and performance of analytical methods sample preparation is a crucial step for the comprehensive screening of chemicals in complex matrices we optimized and compared two extraction methods sse and quechers to achieve an optimal performance for a broad coverage of chemicals in plankton mussel and fish samples the recoveries and loqs were not significantly different between sse and quechers finally we choose the sse method for all the field samples because more interferences for the mass spectrometric detection were expected from the salts used in the quechers method the detailed method performance in terms of the relative recovery absolute recovery matrix factor and loq are given in si1st e fig s3 and si2nd a the sse method was successfully applied for the field biota samples to quantify 477 target compounds with a wide range of physicochemical properties log d ow ranging from 3 9 to 6 9 at ph 7 si2nd a and b the average absolute recoveries in plankton mussels and fish were similar and about 52 fig 2 the average matrix factors in plankton mussels and fish was 0 52 0 58 and 0 66 the matrix factor of most compounds 406 of 477 substances was below 1 indicating ion suppression therefore the matrix should be considered as a major factor influencing the analytical performance nevertheless we used the isotope labeled internal standards to account for this effect and achieved acceptable relative recoveries 70 130 for the quantification of over 80 of the target compounds fig 2 indicating a broad coverage of substances the concentration of the remaining target compounds with a relative recovery of less than 70 or over 130 have higher uncertainty and should be more carefully interpreted this uncertainty might be due to the lack of an own isotope labeled internal standard although the matrix factor was used to correct the relative recovery loqs ranging from 0 05 to 5 70 ng g dry weight dw equivalent to 0 23 to 28 5 ng g wet weight based on the average water content of 78 were achieved for 477 compounds in the three different biota matrices showing excellent sensitivity for a diverse set of chemicals in complex matrices the detailed parameters of method performance including loqs absolute recoveries relative recoveries and matrix factors of 477 target substances in three different biota matrices are provided in the second supporting information document si2nd a overall the loqs were better or comparable to those reported in other studies which determined 84 substances with loqs ranging from 0 1 to 380 ng g wet weight in aquatic amphipods munz et al 2018 and 217 substances with loqs ranging from 0 2 to 1100 ng g wet weight in fish and sea eagles dürig et al 2020 3 2 internal concentrations of target substances in the biota combining stable isotope analyses and chemical analyses of biota can reveal the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of contaminants within the food web the detailed value of δ15n and δ13c are provided in si1st table s2 and fig s2 based on δ15n values from 14 7 0 1 to 22 0 0 1 fig 3 a the trophic levels of all organisms followed the ascending order of plankton mussel small mussel size 2 cm white bream roach size 35 36 cm small roach size 9 11 cm bleak small perch size 7 10 cm asp pike perch size 28 32 cm and pikeperch fig 3 a to obtain realistic trophic positions we applied the increment of 2 3 proposed by kosfeld et al 2021 which is comparable to that δ15n 2 0 in stream ecosystems jardine et al 2013 but lower than the conventional value δ15n 3 4 for aquatic organisms in freshwater systems because trophic positions directly influence the calculation of tmfs the applied increment has to be considered when interpreting tmfs in section 3 4 below of 477 target compounds 145 were detected and quantified above loq in at least one species these chemicals include 68 pharmaceuticals 25 pesticides 16 pfass 25 metabolites and 11 others the concentrations of all detected compounds in different biota samples are given in si2nd e in total 13 of 145 detected chemicals were found across all biota including 4 formylaminoantipyrine methyl 1h benzotriazole benzotriazole fosinopril lidocaine perfluorodecanoic acid pfda perfluorohexane sulfonic acid pfhxs perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos perfluorotetradecanoic acid pftea perfluorotridecanoic acid pftra pregabalin progesterone and terbutryn it is worth noting that illicit drugs and sweeteners were mostly found in plankton and mussels and rarely detected in fish among these chemical categories pfass showed the highest total concentrations 9401 ng g dw followed by pharmaceuticals 6578 ng g dw metabolites 1527 ng g dw pesticides 960 ng g dw and others 330 ng g dw fig 3 b the 25 metabolites include 12 pharmaceutical metabolites 12 pesticide metabolites and 1 illicit drug metabolite these results emphasize the importance of monitoring contaminant metabolites which can be present at higher concentrations than their parent compounds and may be bioactive or even more toxic than parent compounds cwiertny et al 2014 fu et al 2020 qu et al 2013 the different groups of chemicals enter the freshwater system through different pathways a large number of pharmaceuticals n 68 were detected in biota probably due to the effluent discharge from the largest wwtp of the city of berlin upstream of the lake templin indeed an earlier study on streams influenced by wwtp discharge in switzerland has found higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals in gammarids caught downstream of the wwtps than upstream munz et al 2018 in contrast the presence of pesticides including herbicides fungicides insecticides and biocides in biota across different trophic levels was likely due to emission from agricultural or urbanized areas wittmer et al 2010 pfass may come from different pathways such as wwtp effluents industrial emissions or agricultural runoff the widespread occurrence of pfas has been reported in many environmental compartments including sediment soil aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates giesy and kannan 2001 koch et al 2019 liu et al 2018 teunen et al 2021 tian et al 2020 the metabolites in the biota samples could either be attributed to uptake from water or biotransformation in the organisms or both 5 of the 25 detected metabolites including diuron desdimethyl flufenacet oxa metazachlor oxa methiocarb sulfone phenol and n 2 4 dimethylphenyl n methylformamidine were detected in the organisms but not in the passive sampler samples indicating biotransformation in the organisms the remaining 20 metabolites were also detected in passive sampler samples suggesting that they most probably were assimilated from the water phase 3 3 identification of unknown features in the biota via suspect and non target screening beyond target analysis the suspect and non target screening allowed further identification of 27 compounds we applied rigorous prioritization strategies to focus on the most relevant features from about one million unknown features in 12 aquatic species 36 extract samples 3 replicates details of feature prioritization and filtering in si1st g and fig s5 of the 27 features 17 were initially assigned to the confidence level 2a based on matches with library spectra and 10 were assigned to the confidence level 3 based on in silico predictions from at least one algorithm metfrag or sirius csi fingerid next commercially available reference standards n 22 no available standards for the other 5 features were purchased to confirm the initial identifications finally 15 features initially at level 2a were confirmed and assigned to confidence level 1 and one feature at level 2a was rejected table 1 resulting in a 94 successful confirmation rate in addition 4 features initially at level 3 were confirmed as level 1 by reference standards and 2 features were rejected table 1 i e a 67 of successful confirmation rate overall 19 out of the 22 newly purchased reference standards were confirmed and three rejected the detailed information for each confirmed substance and their ms ms spectra are provided in si1st h and si1st i figs s6 s53 despite the complex matrices and broad analyte coverage of the target analysis 477 compounds our results present a very high success rate 86 of structural confirmation of contaminants at level 1 besides the rigorous prioritization strategies the experimental ms ms spectral databases such as massbank are crucial for initial identification since 94 of the database matched features were further successfully confirmed using reference standards also 67 of the features initially assigned to level 3 based on the in silico prediction techniques metfrag and csi fingerid were successfully confirmed as level 1 using reference standards these results highlight how the high quality ms ms spectral libraries and in silico prediction techniques play a crucial role in identification of unknown organic substances nevertheless the use of reference standards remains the gold standard for unambiguous final structural confirmation the identified non targets mainly include plasticizers flame retardants other industrial chemicals and pharmaceutical metabolites this observation could be attributed to the enormous use of plasticizers and flame retardants in plastics toys textiles furniture buildings and other materials plasticizers and flame retardants are released to the environment through leaching abrasion and evaporation hence they have been previously detected in various environmental matrices including wastewater surface water groundwater air and particulate material reemtsma et al 2008 additionally plasticizers and flame retardants are found to accumulate in biota in fact the chemicals triisobutyl phosphate tibp tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate tbep and tris 2 chlorethyl phosphate tcep found in the freshwater biota analyzed in this study table 1 were previously detected in arctic fish birds and mammals from diverse habitats hallanger et al 2015 as well as tropical fishes from the philippines kim et al 2011 collection of samples close to wwtp discharge resulted in higher concentrations of flame retardants and plasticizers e g tbep in both marine and freshwater biota sundkvist et al 2010 in addition this study also identified other polar cecs through suspect and non target screening such as industrial chemicals a flavoring agent and pharmaceutical metabolites for instance to our knowledge the flavoring agent sulfurol was detected for the first time in freshwater organisms 3 4 biomagnification and biodilution of the identified substances in the food web to evaluate the biomagnification or biodilution potential of the confirmed chemicals from the target suspect and non target approaches we calculated the tmfs of the chemicals in the food web to ensure minimal uncertainty in the food web we only calculated the tmfs of chemicals n 34 29 targets and 5 non targets with a detection frequency greater than 80 across all samples si1st j table s23 among these 34 contaminants 12 including 6 pfass 5 pharmaceuticals and 1 metabolite showed significant biomagnification or biodilution patterns p 0 05 fig 4 the remaining compounds showed no significant pattern p 0 05 si1st table s23 the tmfs of six pfass i e pfos pfda pfhxs pftra pftea and perfluoroundecanoic acid pfuna ranged from 1 8 to 4 2 fig 4 a indicating a biomagnification potential from plankton to fish in the selected freshwater food web in contrast to the well known lipophilic bioaccumulation mechanism of hydrophobic compounds pfass are suggested to enter the food web by binding to proteins especially water soluble proteins such as serum proteins e g serum albumin forsthuber et al 2020 zhang et al 2009 therefore we further calculated the protein based tmfs based on the protein normalized concentrations of pfass in the organisms si1st tables s24 and s25 we found that the protein based tmfs of pfass are similar to the dry weight based tmfs indicating a consistent calculation of biomagnification potential the biomagnification of long chain pfass c8 in the food web is in agreement with previous observations fang et al 2014 houde et al 2008 kosfeld et al 2021 and pfos can even be used as a benchmark chemical franklin 2016 kosfeld et al 2021 for example miranda et al found biomagnification of pfos etfosa and pfna in a tropical estuarine food web of bivalve crustacean and fish miranda et al 2021 similarly gao et al found biomagnification of pfhxs and pfos in an antarctic food web gao et al 2020 as pfass have different isomers in linear and branched forms these isomers may have distinct bioaccumulation and biomagnification potential due to different hydrophobicity persistence and molecular structure for example the linear pfos isomer was found to be more strongly biomagnified than the branched isomers probably due to the preferential interaction of linear isomers with cell membranes fang et al 2014 houde et al 2008 in the current study for the total of linear and branched pfos a dry weight based tmf of 4 2 2 3 7 5 was calculated the tmf of the linear pfos was determined to be 3 0 1 8 4 8 dry weight equivalent to 5 4 2 6 11 3 wet weight in a previous analysis of the same sample set from lake templin kosfeld et al 2021 the tmf of pfos in the examined food web is slightly higher than previously reported 2 9 1 6 wet weight chen et al 2018 fang et al 2014 houde et al 2008 jartun et al 2019 loi et al 2011 martin et al 2004 mazzoni et al 2020 simmonet laprade et al 2019a simonnet laprade et al 2019b xu et al 2014 which might be attributed to biotransformation of precursors of pfos simonnet laprade et al 2019b conversion of other pfass such as perfluorooctanesulfonamide fosa to pfos has been reported in rainbow trout brandsma et al 2011 in fact fosa was detected in the food web in this study and its internal concentrations decreased from mussel to fish samples si1st k fig s54 indicating biotransformation of fosa in fish similarly fosa has been shown to be transformed to pfos in freshwater fish babut et al 2017 simmonet laprade et al 2019a and presumably also in other animals galatius et al 2013 ross et al 2012 concurrently the pfos tissue concentration increased from mussel to fish which may be not only due to biomagnification but also to the phylogenetic difference in the ability to biotransform fosa to pfos therefore fosa may serve as another source of pfos in the food web leading to a higher tmf of pfos in contrast to the pfass the tmfs of five pharmaceuticals phenazone progesterone venlafaxine levamisole and lidocaine and one personal care product metabolite galaxolidone ranged from 0 4 to 0 6 fig 4 b and 4 c suggesting a biodilution potential in the food web the observed trophic dilution tmf 1 0 of pharmaceuticals in the food web is in agreement with previous reports covering different levels of complexity of the food web at various locations haddad et al 2018 xie et al 2017 for example xie et al detected eight pharmaceuticals in 14 aquatic species including plankton invertebrates and fish collected in taihu lake china and found a biodilution pattern for all detected pharmaceuticals i e roxithromycin propranolol diclofenac ibuprofen ofloxacin norfloxacin ciprofloxacin and tetracycline xie et al 2017 similarly biodilution was observed for four other pharmaceuticals sertraline citalopram caffeine and roxithromycin in a food web consisting of plankton three invertebrate species and nine fish species yang et al 2020 the trophic biodilution of pharmaceuticals might be attributed to a series of factors including accumulation mechanisms chemical properties and metabolic capacity in general aquatic species at a higher trophic level have metabolic enzymes similar to that of humans the enzymatic activities of cytochrome p450 oxidases cyps and conjugate transferases are widely shared between humans and aquatic animals including fish and invertebrates katagi 2010 kosfeld et al 2020 4 conclusions the targeted approach enabled the quantification of a broad range of cecs n 145 in various freshwater food web species revealing an effective target analysis strategy to simultaneously monitor many polar cecs including pfass in various complex biota matrices the suspect and non target screening identified 27 unknown compounds with 19 confirmed by reference standards level 1 this finding highlights the successful application of suspect and non target screening in identifying unknown compounds in aquatic biota biomagnification was observed mostly for pfass while biodilution mostly occurred for pharmaceuticals indicating the varying trophic transfer of polar cecs in a freshwater food web these results call for more detailed analyses to further elucidate the possible emissions of pfass into lake templin and their

16009,anodic oxidation has emerged as a promising treatment technology for the removal of a broad range of organic pollutants from wastewaters hydroxyl radicals are the primary species generated in anodic oxidation systems to oxidize organics in this review the methods of identifying hydroxyl radicals and the existing debates and misunderstandings regarding the validity of experimental results are discussed consideration is given to the methods of quantification of hydroxyl radicals in anodic oxidation systems with particular attention to approaches used to compare the electrochemical performance of different anodes in addition we describe recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of hydroxyl radical generation at the surface of most commonly used anodes and the utilization of hydroxyl radical in typical electrochemical reactors this review shows that the key challenges facing anodic oxidation technology are related to i the elimination of mistakes in identifying hydroxyl radicals ii the establishment of an effective hydroxyl radical quantification method iii the development of cost effective anode materials with high corrosion resistance and high electrochemical activity and iv the optimization of electrochemical reactor design to maximise the utilization efficiency of hydroxyl radicals graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anodic oxidation hydroxyl radicals generation mechanism quantification 1 introduction extremely diverse types of organic compounds are contained in domestic and industrial wastewaters as a result of the intensification of industrial activities and population growth in recent decades moreira et al 2017 although the traditional wastewater treatment technologies of biological transformation physico chemical separation and chemical oxidation are able to remove the majority of organics to a degree that meets the local discharge requirements nguyen et al 2021 shahedi et al 2020 some biorefractory organic pollutants continue to be difficult to remove and require new approaches electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaop based on anodic oxidation have emerged as an alternative to deal with these persistent organic contaminants brillas and martínez huitle 2015 martinez huitle and panizza 2018 radjenovic et al 2020 the number of papers published in the anodic oxidation field and related to environmental engineering and water resources has increased enormously since 2004 in part no doubt due to the increased urgency in developing methods for the removal of toxic organic compounds from waters and wastewaters fig 1 anodic oxidation can produce active species such as the sulfate radical so4 sulfite radical so3 carbonate radical co3 chlorine radical cl oxychloride radical clo superoxide anion radical o2 hydroxyl radical oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 each of which to varying degrees is capable of completely and or partially degrading the organic compounds into co2 and or biodegradable by products giannakis et al 2021 peng et al 2020 xiong et al 2021 among these radicals oh is the primary oxidant of interest as it is generated directly from water oxidation with no chemical addition necessary and is recognised to be one of the most powerful oxidants that are generated in electrochemical systems wang et al 2020b indirect oh identification methods including electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy following addition of a spin trap uv fluorescence probing and selective quenching have been developed and employed in anodic oxidation processes due to the short lifetime of oh 10 6 10 3 s in water wang et al 2020b some controvery remains however with regard to the validity specificity and precision of these methods for example the validity of the epr test has been questioned due to the possible occurrence of either the forrester hepburn mechanism or inverted spin trapping in both cases a radical adduct r oh is formed which is identical to that formed by oh attack on the original spin trap with dmpo and coumarin and p chlorobenzoic acid found to be unsuitable for use in anodic oxidation studies for these reasons jing and chaplin 2017 pei et al 2020 recently suggested that the complications associated with use of the epr method for quantification of oh generation rate in anodic oxidation reactors could be avoided by using high concentrations of dmpo 180 mm and by restricting the trapping time ideally to 60 s furthermore some studies used tert butanol as the scavenger of freely diffusing oh in the bulk phase kim et al 2012 yang et al 2011 while some authors believed that tert butanol can both react with oh on the catalyst surface and in bulk solution zhao et al 2017 these issues related to anode oxidation should be thoroughly discussed to eliminate uncertainty and guarantee the validity of these methods the electrode materials used in anodic oxidation play a critical role in the rate and extent of degradation of organic pollutants with suggestions that different oh generation mechanisms apply depending on the lattice structure the grain size the crystal plane and the interaction between the functional groups on the electrode surface and that of organic compounds martinez huitle and ferro 2006 martínez huitle et al 2015 the oh production process will be further complicated by consideration of other factors such as the ph the type and concentration of electrolyte the potential applied and the status of the electrode surface some progress has been made recently to increase the rate of oh generation on the anode surface leading to a better understanding of oh generation mechanisms for instance the oxygen evolution reaction oer potential has always been recognized as a critical index with which to evaluate the oh generation performance of the electrode with a higher oer potential suggesting a faster generation rate of oh and consequently higher electrochemical activity martinez huitle and ferro 2006 recently it has been suggested that the generation of oh on the surface of the boron doped diamond bdd electrode is an outer sphere electron transfer process and nearly independent of both the nature of functional groups present and the ph while the generation of o2 follows an inner sphere electron transfer pathway henke et al 2018 jaimes et al 2017 indicating that the oer potential might be an inappropriate indicator of capacity for oh generation it has also been shown that the surfaces of highly hydrophobic anode materials such as pbo2 can selectively restrain inner sphere oxidation of h2o to o2 thus promoting the outer sphere oxidation process to generate oh he et al 2018 zhuo et al 2017 the structure of the electrochemical reactor used is of crucial importance to the efficacy of organic pollutant oxidation since it influences the mass transfer process and more importantly the energy consumption many studies have indicated that the electrochemical reaction rate is controlled by the rate of mass transfer with the tardiness of this rate in traditional flow by reactors hindering the potential for large scale application of such reactors chaplin 2014 in comparison use of a flow through configuration leading to convection enhanced mass transport of pollutants to the electrode shows considerable potential for scale up chaplin 2014 some progress with different designs has also been achieved recently a three dimensional 3 d electrochemical system in which an ion exchange membrane is sandwiched between the anode and cathode has been proposed and shown to be capable of treating low ionic strength wastewater with high electrical efficiency since the presence of the ion exchange membrane results in a significant decrease in the system resistance meng et al 2019 zou et al 2019 furthermore a flow anode system in which hydroxyl radicals can be generated at 1 5 v vs she enabling the degradation of organics with ultra low energy consumption has been developed based on the above membrane system xie et al 2021b while many excellent review papers have been published in regard to electrochemical oxidation systems bergmann et al 2014 fernandes et al 2015 martinez huitle and ferro 2006 martínez huitle et al 2015 wang and stahl 2020 wang et al 2020b we focus in this review on the nature and extent of oh generated at the anode surface in anodic oxidation systems based on the above considerations we discuss methods of identifying and quantifying oh generation in anodic oxidation systems and review recent developments in understanding of the oh generation mechanisms in anodic oxidation reactors we also give attention to developments in design of anodic oxidation reactors with a view to facilitating the wider application of anodic oxidation in wastewater treatment 2 oh generation mechanism in anodic oxidation systems oh a strong oxidant generated at the surface of the anode can completely and or partially degrade organic compounds into co2 and or biodegradable by products according to the different types of oh formed on the anode surface active and non active electrodes are established depending on the nature of different electrode materials martinez huitle and ferro 2006 on the surface of both active and non active electrodes water molecules are oxidized to initially form adsorbed or synonomously surface bound oh siahrostami et al 2020 eq 1 1 m h 2 o m oh h e where represents an anode surface site for active electrodes such as those constructed from mixed metal oxides also known as dimensionally stable anodes dsa where oxides of elements such as ruthenium iridium and platinum are coated on supports such as titanium plate or grid chemisorbed active oxygen denoted here as mo can be generated on the electrode surface through the interaction between the adsorbed oh and the anode subsequently mo acts as a mediator to selectively oxidize the organic compounds r at the electrode surface eqs 2 3 2 m oh mo h e 3 mo r m ro evidence for the formation of the mo m redox pair was provided by the detection of 18o within iro2 fierro et al 2007 ruo2 and niooh electrodes comninellis 1994 from 18o enriched water showing that the lattice oxygen at the outer surface of the oxide electrode was involved in the oxygen exchange reaction fierro et al 2007 nevertheless due to the limited oxidation power of mo at these active electrode surface sites partial mineralization of organic pollutants is highly likely which will result in the formation of toxic by products during treatment for example i propanol can be oxidized at 1 6 v vs rhe at the surface of the iro2 ti electrode yielding acetone as a final product with a selectivity exceeding 90 while co2 was the final product under similar experiment conditions when using a bdd electrode fóti et al 1999 besides most active electrode materials involve the use of noble metals which are uneconomical and expensive accordingly most of the active electrode materials are unlikely to find practical application for large scale water treatment in terms of the non active electrodes such as boron doped diamond electrode bdd oxides of sn sno2 pb pbo2 and magnéli phase titanium suboxide tino2n 1 the formed oh is likely to desorb and transform to the solvated hydroxyl radical eq 4 oh aq due to the relatively weak interaction between oh and the non active electrode surface thus these hydroxyl radicals can indiscriminately and completely oxidize organic compounds to co2 eq 5 4 m oh m o h aq 5 o h aq r m c o 2 h 2 o h e where represents an anode surface site in practice however none of electrode materials exhibit exclusive active or non active behaviours just the predominance of one over the other some studies have shown that the bdd anode shows dual behaviour in some cases de araújo et al 2014 garcia segura et al 2015 the hydroxyl radical oh aq h2o2 and o2 are the products of the one two and four electron oxidation processes shown in eqs 6 8 with the free energy of the intermediates oh o and ooh critical determinants of the particular product s formed shi et al 2017 when δgoh is close to or exceeds 2 73 ev the energy required for water oxidation to result in formation of oh aq fig 2 the one electron oxidation process is likely to form oh aq malik et al 2020 when δgoh 2 73 ev and δgo 3 5 ev the energy required for water oxidation to result in formation of h2o2 the two electron oxidation process for h2o2 generation should be dominant malik et al 2020 when δgoh 2 73 ev and δgo 3 5 ev o2 formation is expected to dominate malik et al 2020 the δgoh of anodes determines whether the surface bound oh or oh aq generation is thermodynamically favorable at the anode surface anodes with low δgoh values have a strong tendency to form surface bound oh while anodes with high oer potentials usually possess a strong ability to generate oh aq since δgoh of these anode is close to 2 73 ev higher oer potentials which make the generation of o2 more difficult can increase the faradaic efficiency of oh aq production inhibition of o2 generation at the anode surface and or decrease in the value of δgoh by manipulation of the intrinsic surface electronic configuration can be considered effective means of designing anodes that are well suited to generation of oh aq 6 h 2 o o h aq h e e 0 2 73 v 7 2 h 2 o h 2 o 2 2 h e e 0 1 76 v 8 h 2 o o 2 4 h e e 0 1 23 v it has long been accepted that the generation and utilization of oh aq via the desorption of oh is necessary in anodic oxidation systems thus non active electrodes with high oer potentials are typically used however high energy consumption is inevitable when operating at anode potentials sufficiently large to generate oh aq garcia segura et al 2018 martínez huitle and panizza 2018 the generation of oh is recognized to require much lower energy compared to that of oh aq malik et al 2020 shi et al 2017 siahrostami et al 2017 for instance siahrostami et al 2017 investigated the selectivity of different electrodes toward the formation of oh aq and showed that the δg oh values of iro2 0 2 ev fig 2a and rho2 1 1 ev are much smaller than δg oh 2 73 ev for these materials in addition shi et al 2017 analyzed the catalytic properties towards h2o2 evolution on wo3 and sno2 electrodes suggesting that the δg oh values of wo3 and sno2 are 1 7 fig 2b and 2 0 ev respectively however utilization of the surface located oh has typically been small due to the mass transfer limitations inherent in traditional electrochemical reactors recently some effort has been paid to the utilization of the surface located oh bin saiman et al 2012 liu et al 2019a with these studies showing that the energy consumed in such a process is comparable to that used in conventional decontamination techniques miklos et al 2018 for instance tio2 particles were facet tailored by liu et al 2019 to oxidize phenols with results showing that phenols were degraded mainly by surface bound oh and direct electron transfer on the tio2 ti electrode with a 001 polar facet bin saiman et al 2012 utilized au pd nanoparticles as heterogeneous catalysts to oxidize toluene with results indicating that surface bound oxygen centred radicals played a critical role in activating toluene 3 identification methods of oh 3 1 epr method electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy is a widely applied method to confirm the presence and in some cases quantify the rate of formation of oh via use of a spin trap wang et al 2020b epr is a spectroscopic method in which a static magnetic field and microwaves with a frequency between 0 04 25 cm 1 are used to observe the behavior of the unpaired electrons the degeneracy of the electron spin states is lifted when an unpaired electron is placed in a magnetic field creating two spin states ms 1 2 thus providing detailed information on structure and bonding of paramagnetic species bonke et al 2021 the nitrone 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo is the most common spin trap for oh since it has high selectivity and can react with oh to form a dmpo oh adduct that is detectable by epr wang et al 2020b the intensity ratio of the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh are 1 2 2 1 as shown in fig 3 pei et al 2020 however the false positive detection of oh which has been reported in electrochemical oxidation and biochemical processes may occur due to both the inverted spin trapping phenomenon and the forrester hepburn mechanism wang et al 2020b the inverted spin trapping phenomenon involves the formation of dmpo via a direct electron transfer det oxidation process with the dmpo oh spin adduct subsequently formed via nucleophilic addition of hydroxyl ions eq 9 jing and chaplin 2017 conversely the forrester hepburn mechanism is initiated by nucleophilic attack by hydroxyl ions followed by loss of an electron to an oxidant such as oxygen eq 10 jing and chaplin 2017 in addition dmpo undergoes det oxidation at 1 72 v vs she pei et al 2020 fig 4 a and the dmpo oh adduct is electrochemically unstable and can be further oxidized by det and oh mediated oxidation processes under anodic polarization conditions fig 4b wang et al 2020b resulting in low confidence in epr data obtained in anodic oxidation systems the possible dmpo transformation pathways in anodic oxidation systems proposed by pei et al 2020 are shown in fig 4c 9 dmpo e dmp o o h dmpo oh 10 dmpo o h dmpo o h e dmpo oh recently pei et al 2020 investigated the validity of the epr method for identification of oh in anodic oxidation systems and indicated that the acidic boundary layer formed near the surface of the anode can inhibit the reactions that occur in the inverted spin trapping phenomenon and the forrester hepburn mechanism as such these investigators concluded that the validity of the epr method can be guaranteed by careful control of dmpo concentration and trapping time for instance an extremely high concentration of dmpo 125 mm and a fast spin trapping time 300 s are required to effectively spin trap oh at a current density of 10 ma cm 2 fig 3 pei et al 2020 these investigators advise that the minimum dmpo concentration should be estimated based on the current density before starting experiments and recommend that the trapping time should be less than 300 s before epr measurement in order to minimize the occurrence of side reactions pei et al 2020 although the epr method may be applicable to oh identification in anodic oxidation systems provided certain conditions are met it should be noted that some studies suggest that dmpo reacts with surface bound oh rather than free oh in bulk solution grela et al 1996 while others suggest that dmpo reacts with both oh at the surface of the electrode and in bulk solution dvoranová et al 2014 a negative aspect of using the epr method to identify oh in anodic oxidation systems is that the price of dmpo is relatively high compared to electrochemically active oh probes and as is clear from the above discussion the experimental conditions when using dmpo in anodic oxidation systems should be strictly controlled for example studies should be undertaken at a reduced temperature e g in an ice bath since dmpo is easily oxidized by oxygen or other oxidants at room temperature in summary epr spectroscopy has the unique capability of providing direct evidence for oh generation in anodic oxidation systems while other methods are indirect and ambiguous 3 2 quenching methods quenching tests are used to inhibit the reactions between oh and the target organic compound by adding scavengers into anodic oxidation system wang et al 2020b the concentration and reaction rate with oh of these scavengers should be much higher than that of the target organic compound in order to guarantee their effectiveness the purposes of a quenching test are to investigate the contribution of oh towards the degradation of the target organic compound and to distinguish the type of oh present by comparing the changes of removal rate before and after the addition of scavengers a summary of common oh scavengers that are used in anodic oxidation systems is provided in table 1 among these scavengers tert butanol and methanol are typically used to distinguish the contribution of oh aq and so4 song et al 2017 zou et al 2019 however zhao et al 2017 suggested that tert butanol can be easily adsorbed on the surface of znfe2o4 cu3 particles and therefore used as the surface bound scavenger in contrast barazesh et al 2016 indicated that the surface bound oh present at the bdd anode surface was unable to be scavenged by saturated tert butanol in addition ling et al 2016 indicated that methanol can be used as a quencher for oh both in the bulk solution and on the surface of tio2 while wu et al 2019 and liang et al 2013 suggested that methanol may not accumulate on the surface of catalyst and can only be used as an oh aq scavenger a similar divergence of results is also observed when using hydrophobic n butanol as the oh scavenger liu et al 2019a used n butanol as the oh aq scavenger due to the low molecular affinity of hydrophobic n butanol toward hydrophilic tio2 surfaces while xu and wang 2012 indicated that n butanol is an effective scavenger for both oh aq and surface bound oh although ki is a commonly used surface bound oh scavenger wang et al 2020b the mechanism by which i ions inhibit the reaction between particular target organic compounds and surface bound oh is unclear in addition most of these scavengers can be oxidized via direct electron transfer det processes the excessive addition of these scavengers can inhibit both oh and det oxidation processes thus leading to an overestimated contribution of oh to the degradation of organics and an underestimated contribution of det processes for instance methanol can be oxidized via det processes below 1 0 v vs she dong et al 2010 dubale et al 2020 while methanol is always used as the oh scavenger in anodic oxidation systems with much higher anode potentials applied inhibiting both oh and det oxidation processes baek et al 2021 song et al 2018 in addition xie et al 2022 indicated that the addition of ki as the surface bound hydroxyl radical scavenger can suppress both oh and det oxidation processes although scavenging methods have been widely adopted in homogenous systems such as the low ph fenton process they may be problematic when being used in heterogeneous systems typical of electrochemical and photocatalytic processes due to the complications and uncertainties arising from the possible consumption of the quenching agent by det processes for anodic oxidation where the anode is polarized at high overpotential anions present in the supporting electrolyte can also be oxidized leading to the formation of active intermediates with these species potentially exerting a complex influence on the production and identification of electro produced oh in particular anions such as cl co3 2 po4 3 and so4 2 can be oxidized at the active sites on the anode surface to generate other oxidants such as chlorine percarbonates perphosphates and persulfates bagastyo et al 2013 thus inhibiting the generation of oh due to the limited active sites on the anode surface besides co3 2 hco3 and po4 3 can act as oh scavengers to form other free radicals such as co3 hco3 and po4 2 ghatak 2014 son et al 2006 staehelin and hoigne 1985 in view of the considerable divergence in interpretation of the results of tests using these various oh scavengers an urgent need exists to better understand the mechanism of interaction of these scavengers with both oh aq and surface bound oh 3 3 uv and fluorescence probe method the uv fluorescence probe method is usually used to detect the production of the oh adduct or the disappearance of the probe in solution via conventional analytical techniques such as high performance liquid chromatography and uv spectrophotometry an hplc system can separate organic compounds as a result of their relative affinity for either the mobile or stationary phases with the concentration of the compounds present in the mobile phase subsequently determined via a method such as uv or fluorescence spectroscopy particular organic compounds may be retarded to varying degrees while passing through the porous stationary phase with the extent of their retardation and thus their residence time on the column dependent on their chemical structure size and or charge the detection unit can be calibrated to recognize the organics leaving the column with signals converted and recorded by a data management system uv spectrophotometry is based on the absorption of ultraviolet light or visible light by organics which undergoes either excitation or de excitation resulting in the production of distinct spectra various organic probes such as coumarin nakabayashi and nosaka 2013 salicylic acid jen et al 1998 luminol hirakawa and nosaka 2002 1 4 dioxane kishimoto and sugimura 2010 1 propanol overend and paraskevopoulos 1978 methylene blue wei and feng 2017 p chlorobenzoic acid yang et al 2016b terephthalic acid ta rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 and p benzoquinone shi et al 2015 have been used in the anodic oxidation system however most of these probes can be oxidized by direct electron transfer or forrester hepburn processes leading to the false positive detection of oh jing and chaplin 2017 wang et al 2020b jing and chaplin 2017 investigated the validity of using five commonly used oh probes coumarin ta benzoic acid p chlorobenzoic acid and 1 4 benzoquinone and indicated that ta is the most appropriate oh probe compound in anodic oxidation systems it should be noted that ta can also be oxidized via direct electron transfer when the anode potential exceeds 2 76 v vs she therefore the false positive detection of oh using ta as the probe might also occur when the anode potential is too high jing and chaplin 2017 developed the following criteria for choosing appropriate oh probes 1 the probe compound should react with oh at diffusion limited rates 2 the probe compound should be electrochemically stable towards direct electron transfer processes 3 the probe compound should be sufficiently soluble in solution and 4 the probe compound should yield a stable and soluble redox product that is detectable by conventional analytical techniques although ta is recognized as the most appropriate oh probe compound the solubility of ta is very limited in acidic solution and varies significantly at room temperature depending on the ph of the solution terephthalate has higher solubility than ta and generates the same oh adduct product and as such has been suggested as a reasonable alternative to ta lv et al 2017 wang et al 2020a yuan et al 2018 4 the quantification of oh the amount of oh generated is usually quantified by using the above mentioned reactive probe molecules jing et al investigated the validity of using these hydroxyl radical probes in anodic oxidation systems and indicated that ta which can react with oh to form detectable 2 hydroxyl terephthalic acid with high fluorescence response and is resistant to direct oxidation processes is the most appropriate oh probe compound jing and chaplin 2017 thus the fluorescence intensity of 2 hydroxyl terephthalic acid hta has been extensively used to calculate the rate of generation of oh fig 5 a he et al 2015 liao et al 2014 qiao et al 2018 however hta is relatively unstable and can be further oxidized into other products nayak and chaplin 2018 therefore use of the fluorescence intensity of hta to characterize the oh generation rate is inappropriate if the anodic oxidation ability is high enough to induce the further degradation of hta for example he et al 2018 found that an electrochemical cell utilizing an n pbo2 anode exhibited a higher hta fluorescence intensity with electrolysis time compared to that obtained with a bdd electrode fig 5b but yielded comparable degradation performance of paracetamol fig 5c and suggested oxidation of hta at the bdd anode surface may have accounted for this observation further evidence of this effect has been provided by gayen et al 2018 who prepared three reactive electrochemical membranes rems a pure magnéli phase tino2n 1 n 4 6 rem a bi doped sno2 tino2n 1 rem obtained by a pulsed laser deposition method bdto pld and a bi doped sno2 tino2n 1 rem obtained by pulsed electrodeposition followed by thermal oxidation bdto edt in comparison with the ta removal performances of the bi doped rems the pure tino2n 1 rem exhibited the lowest degradation performance of ta fig 6 a but the highest rate of generation of hta fig 6b gayen et al 2018 with these results indicating that a greater amount of hta was further degraded by bdto pld and bdto edt rems than was the case for the pure tino2n 1 rem the time dependent change in concentration of hta accounting for both formation and degradation processes can be expressed by eq 11 11 d hta dt k ta oh ta oh k hta oh hta oh k det hta where ta oh and hta represent the concentrations of ta oh and hta on the anode surface respectively at time t kta oh represents the second order reaction rate constant of ta with oh 4 0 106 m3 mol 1 s 1 khta oh represents the second order reaction rate constant of hta with oh and kdet represents the direct electron transfer reaction rate constant of hta with the anode under ideal conditions ta rapidly diffuses to the anode surface where it reacts with oh to form hta which then rapidly diffuses into solution such that the surface concentration of hta is close to zero and further oxidation of hta prevented in this case the formation rate of hta will be proportional to the surface concentration of oh present at time t eq 12 12 d hta dt k ta oh ta oh in actuality however the concentration of hta on the anode surface is unlikely to be equal to zero with the extent of accumulation of hta at the anode surface depending on the relative rates of generation and degradation of hta additionally it should be recognized that the reaction rate is always limited by mass transfer in traditional electrochemical systems the surface concentration of ta will become zero when the applied current is large enough to generate sufficient oh to oxidize ta with any superfluous oh further oxidizing hta or forming other products such as oxygen in this case the surface concentration of oh present at time t is not proportional to the rate of formation of hta therefore the detection of hta is generally considered to be an indication of oh formation only rather than a quantitative measure of the amount of oh generated the methodology that is most widely used to quantify the amount of oh generated in anodic oxidation systems involves determination of the steady state surface concentrations of oh oh ss using the expression shown in eq 13 gayen et al 2018 nayak and chaplin 2018 13 oh ss k ta k ta oh where kta is the nominal surface area normalized observed rate constant for ta oxidation in single pass mode the value of kta can be calculated by eq 14 14 k ta c 0 c e v c 0 s t where c0 is the feed concentration of ta ce is the permeate concentration of ta s is the geometric area of anode t is the time of oxidation process and v is the solution volume in batch mode the value of kta can be expressed by eq 15 15 k ta ln c t c 0 v t s although this methodology cannot accurately measure the amount of oh generated it does represent a means of obtaining a quantitative measure of the lower bounds oh generated since there is a lack of clarity on both the exact proportion of oh reacting with ta and whether the det process is involved in the oxidation of hta this method is also applicable to other oh probes that do not suffer from complications associated with possible occurrence of det processes however it should be noted that the steady state surface concentrations of oh represents the variety of hydroxyl radicals present in the electrochemical system including surface bound oh and oh physisorbed as well as free oh aq in solution since ta can react with all these kinds of hydroxyl radicals to form hta liu et al 2019a mahé et al 2013 proposed a systematic method to quantify the generation of oh resulting from the cathodic reduction of oxygen by coupling electrochemical measurements and the detection of the produced species by chemiluminescence with phthalhydrazide as the luminescent probe with this method exhibiting a detection limit for hydroxyl radicals ranging from 7 4 nm at ph 3 to 6 2 nm at ph 8 1 mahé et al 2013 this method has been used extensively for quantification of oh generation rate in natural and engineered systems miller et al 2011 he et al 2014 qiu et al 2015 xing et al 2018 would seem to hold particular promise for use in anodic oxidation systems though attention should be given to the possible direct oxidation of phthalhydrazide at the anode in order to distinguish the contributions to the removal of organics by different kinds of hydroxyl radicals oh scavengers mentioned in table 1 can be used the degradation rates of reactive probe molecules in the presence of high concentrations of surface bound and free hydroxyl radical scavengers can be used to quantify the contribution of det oxidation kdet song et al 2018 in this instance the degradation rate of organic compounds can be expressed by eq 16 16 d r dt r k r oh oh surface k r oh oh aqueous k det r k r r where r is the concentration of reactive probe molecules in mol l 1 kr oh is the second order reaction rate constant of r with oh aqueous kr oh is the second order reaction rate constant of r with oh surface kdet is the direct oxidation rate constant and kr is the apparent degradation rate of r thus the concentration of surface located and aqueous hydroxyl radicals can be calculated using eq 17 17 k r oh oh surface k r oh oh aqueous k r k det according to the different values of kr when surface bound or free oh scavengers are separately added into the electrochemical oxidation system the concentrations of surface bound and free oh can be calculated respectively this method is suited to use with a wider range of reactive probe molecules for which both det and oh oxidation occur simultaneously however this method only works when the concentration of oh scavengers is much higher than the reactive probe molecules though it should be recognised that the presence of excess concentrations of oh scavengers in anodic oxidation systems also inhibits the det oxidation of reactive probe molecules since most of the oh scavengers are not resistant to transformation via det with this effect leading to an underestimation in kdet value and an overestimation in oh ss value in addition both of the above two methods use the apparent degradation rate of r kr to calculate to the amount of oh generated but the value of kr is significantly influenced by the mass transfer process therefore the calculated concentrations of oh reflect not only the oh generation capacity of anodes but also the mass transfer rate of electrochemical cells in other words the value of oh ss calculated in a flow through cell is higher than that in a flow by cell under the same experimental conditions the oh concentrations calculated by the above methods are summarized in table 2 kinetic modelling using packages such as kintecus kintek explorer etc has emerged as a powerful tool that shows the significance of competing processes as determinants of steady state concentrations in anode oxidation and other systems chen et al 2021 garg et al 2020 lizhang et al 2016 yuan et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 for example kapałka et al 2009 developed a model to describe the oh concentration profile at the surface of the bdd electrode in the presence and absence of organic compounds this model only considered the charge transfer controlled region in which reaction rate is controlled by applied current the steady state surface concentration of oh during oxidation of organic compounds r was calculated by eq 18 18 oh ss j f z k r oh c r d oh where j is the applied current f is the c mol 1 is the faraday constant z is the number of exchanged electrons cr is the surface concentration of r and d oh m2 s 1 is the diffusion coefficient of oh it should be noted that this model was established under the hypothesis that only oh mediated oxidation processes contributed to the removal of organic compounds ignoring the det oxidation of organic compounds leads to overestimated oh ss values fig 7 a compared to the experimental data table 2 with results showing simulated concentration profiles of hydroxyl radicals in fig 7a that are several orders of magnitude higher than the experimentally determined concentration of hydroxyl radicals table 2 additionally lan et al 2018 developed a mathematical model for electroxidation of target pharmaceuticals which can be used to predict the temporal variation in concentration of organics with electroxidation time this model considered both the det and oh mediated oxidation processes with model results showing excellent agreement with experiment fig 7b unfortunately this model is unable to predict the oh ss values since it did not involve the second order reaction rate constant of r with oh although progress has been achieved it would be useful to develop a model that can be widely applied to various electrodes to predict the oh concentration a sound understanding of oh generation mechanisms on the surfaces of various electrodes is an essential precondition for effective and practical modelling the following subsection provides more details on the oh generation mechanisms 5 regulation of oh generation in anodic systems a typical electrochemical oxidation system consists of an anode and a cathode oh can be formed at the surface of the anode when an appropriate potential is applied with the generation and utilization of oh affected by various factors such as anode materials electrochemical reactors and solution matrix in this section we provide a comprehensive review of the oh generation mechanisms and regulation on the surface of four non active anodes various alternate configurations of anodic oxidation systems and the influence of operating parameters 5 1 oh generation by different anode materials oh mediated oxidation processes are responsible for the partial and in some instances complete degradation of organic pollutants into co2 and h2o as such the rate of generation and the electrochemical activity of oh formed on the anode surface are critical determinants of the electrochemical performance of anode materials researchers have investigated the oh generation performance of various materials including metals szpyrkowicz et al 2005 metal oxides huang et al 2018 schranck et al 2018 and carbon based materials periyasamy and muthuchamy 2018 yang 2018 since active electrodes are unable to generate sufficient oh compared to inactive electrodes four inactive anode materials pbo2 sno2 boron doped diamond bdd and tino2n 1 with high oh generation rates and electrochemical activity are comprehensively reviewed below 5 1 1 bdd electrode the bdd electrode which consists of non active sp3 diamond carbon and amorphous sp2 non diamond carbon ayres et al 2016 is a promising anode with excellent electrochemical properties and stability bdd film electrodes are usually prepared via a cvd method using si plate as the substrate da silva et al 2019 some other substrates such as nb brito et al 2018 and ta liu et al 2018 have also been used to prepare bdd electrodes with these electrodes demonstrating higher oer potential and increased effective active surface area in addition further enhancement in active surface area has been achieved by use of porous substrates leading to a faster apparent generation rate of oh braga et al 2012 he et al 2019 the generation mechanisms of oh on bdd electrode are related to the boron content the sp3 sp2 ratio and the functional groups on the bdd anode surface ivandini and einaga 2017 a higher boron content decreases the oer potential of the bdd electrode while a higher sp3 sp2 ratio in the bdd electrode has been shown to enhance the production of oh de araújo et al 2014 souza et al 2016 and increase the oer potential espinoza et al 2018 some experimental results have suggested that the oer potentials of bdd electrodes decreased from 2 74 v to 2 29 v vs she when the hydrogen terminated surface sites were oxidized to oxygen terminated surface sites chaplin et al 2013 however alternative results indicate that the generation of oh on the bdd electrode surface is nearly independent of the functional groups and the ph value while the electrochemical current arising from o2 generation differs strongly between bdd electrodes with different surface functionalizations henke et al 2018 suggesting that the formation of oh from the electrolysis of water is an outer sphere electron transfer process while the generation of o2 follows an inner sphere electron transfer pathway henke et al 2018 attributed this difference to the fact that a hydrophobic bdd surface can prevent water molecules from entering the inner sphere thereby inhibiting o2 generation and enhancing oh formation therefore it is to be expected that a highly hydrophobic anode surface will selectively restrain the inner sphere oxidation of h2o to o2 thus promoting the outer sphere oxidation process to generate oh henke et al 2018 fig 8 a c shows prevalent functional groups on the hydrogen terminated oxygen terminated and polyfluorinated molecular ligands terminated surface of bdd electrode the polyfluorinated molecular ligands terminated surface exhibits a selective outer sphere electron transfer production of oh due to its high hydrophobicity furthermore liu et al 2021a presented oxygen generation and oh production mechanisms on the surface of different element n p s and f doped diamond anodes electrodes based on density functional theory fig 8 with results indicating that oxygen evolution is an inner sphere reaction related to the intrinsic surface electronic configuration and a high oxygen overpotential is beneficial for increasing the faradaic efficiency of oh production in addition jaimes et al 2017 investigated the relationship between the formation of oh and the adsorption of h2o on the bdd anode surface suggesting that weak adsorption of h2o on the active sites can decrease the overpotential to generate oh on the other hand the presence of high concentrations of anions such as cl so4 2 and co3 2 will inhibit the generation of oh almassi et al 2018 and as such can accelerate or decrease the cod removal of some organic compounds depending on the reactivity between the active oxidants and specific organic compounds bu et al 2018 klidi et al 2019 klidi et al 2018 5 1 2 pbo2 electrode the pbo2 anode possesses a comparable capacity of generating oh to that of the bdd electrode but the mechanisms of generating oh on the pbo2 surface are not well understood pavlov and monahov 1996 investigated the generation mechanisms of oh on the pbo2 anode in h2so4 solution and suggested that the generation of oh and oxygen share the same active sites on the hydrated pbo oh 2 layer that formed on the pbo2 anode surface via the reaction shown in eq 19 when anodic polarization is applied 19 pb o 2 h 2 o pbo oh 2 at potentials between 1 0 φ 1 3v vs hg hg2so4 the generation of oh is the dominant reaction via the oxidation of the gel layer cong and wu 2007 liu et al 2021b pavlov and monahov 1996 as shown in eq 20 20 pbo oh 2 h 2 o pbo oh 2 o h h e when the potential is greater than 1 3v the oh that formed on the active sites will be further oxidized into oxygen pavlov and monahov 1996 the above oh and oxygen generation mechanisms are illustrated in fig 9 in addition the electrodeposition of bi3 on the pbo2 anode surface can enhance the surface hydration of the pbo2 electrode resulting in an increase in the amount of oh generated on the pbo2 anode surface shmychkova et al 2015 however some experimental results suggested that a highly hydrophobic surface can also promote the generation of oh he et al 2018 yang et al 2020 and increase the oer overpotential zhuo et al 2017 to enhance the capacity of generating oh with high activity various dopants such as co dai et al 2016c ce yao et al 2019b ni sun et al 2021 xia et al 2015 nb yang et al 2016a mo bi rong et al 2021 yao et al 2019a and la dai et al 2016a have been introduced into the pbo2 electrode interestingly the optimal doping mass fraction of these elements on the pbo2 electrode is always 1 wt for example dai et al 2016b prepared a 1 wt mo doped pbo2 electrode to oxidize cinnamic acid and obtained the highest oer overpotential and a high cinnamic acid 85 51 and cod 25 79 removal efficiencies however the mechanism of the increased oer overpotential on the pbo2 electrode doped by the elements mentioned above was not elaborated clearly 5 1 3 sno2 electrode pure sno2 is an n type semiconductor material with a band gap of 3 5 ev that exhibits a reasonable conductivity only at high temperatures kötz et al 1991 various metallic elements such as sb yang et al 2017 pd li et al 2017 co wang et al 2007 and ni yang et al 2012 have been investigated as possible dopants to enhance the electrochemical performance of sno2 electrodes among these elements sb is the most commonly used doping element with the sb sno2 electrode exhibiting both a high oer overpotential of 1 9 2 2 v vs she martínez huitle et al 2015 and an excellent ability to oxidatively degrade various organic compounds such as pyridine li et al 2016 isothiazolin ones han et al 2011 phenol li et al 2005 and ciprofloxacin wang et al 2016 experimental results also indicate that the introduction of ni into the sno2 electrode can promote not only the generation of oh but also the formation of hydroperoxy radicals ooh on the sno2 anode surface with resultant facilitation of the degradation of organic compounds yang et al 2012 in addition yang s group fabricated a f doped sno2 electrode to oxidize perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate with this electrode exhbiting a high oer potential and a smooth surface to generate weakly adsorbed oh due to the similar ionic radii of f and o and the strong electronegativity of f yang et al 2015 yang et al 2017 in addition to the doping of different elements extensive research has been conducted on optimizing the structure fan et al 2013 and particle size of the sno2 electrode in order to generate more oh huang et al 2020b zhao et al 2009 for example zhao et al 2009 utilized tio2 nanotubes as the substrate to support an sb doped sno2 film with the resultant electrode exhibiting a high oxygen evolution potential and a high capacity of generating oh due to the larger specific surface area and the more active sites provided by the smaller grain sizes than the traditional sb doped sno2 electrode although some progress in developing sno2 based electrodes has been achieved few studies have been conducted to investigate the generation mechanisms of oh at the surface of sno2 electrodes 5 1 4 tino2n 1 electrode many studies have been conducted on the degradation of various organic compounds such as p methoxyphenol zaky and chaplin 2013 antibiotic amoxicillin ganiyu et al 2016 tetracycline liang et al 2018 and humic acid geng and chen 2016 using tino2n 1 as the anode with results showing that tino2n 1 is a promising and cost effective anode material with a high oer overpotential chaplin 2014 due to the low price and easy processing there have been many studies on the fabrication of tino2n 1 reactive electrochemical membrane rem to reduce the limitations associated with mass transfer process and enhance the degradation rate of organic compounds trellu et al 2018a in addition the apparent generation rate of oh by tino2n 1 rem has been shown to be significantly enhanced due to the much more active sites on the nominal geometric surface compared to plate tino2n 1 electrodes zaky and chaplin 2013 some effort has also been invested in development of other structures for instance geng et al 2015 prepared highly ordered tino2n 1 nanotube arrays to oxidize phenol with results suggesting that 20 more cod removal than obtained with tino2n 1 particles could be achieved due to the faster electron transfer rate furthermore pb huang et al 2020a ce lin et al 2021 and carbon materials almassi et al 2018 almassi et al 2019 xie et al 2020 have been introduced to promote the electrochemical performance of tino2n 1 electrodes for example doping 1 3 ce3 into tino2n 1 electrodes can increase the anodic production of oh by 37 129 and enhance the electrochemical stability lin et al 2021 in addition pei et al 2021 indicated that f doped tino2n 1 anode can increase the oer potential and thus enhance the oh generation with this effect possibly associated with the increased hydrophobicity as a result of f doping and the associated difficulty of oxygen evolution an inner sphere process requiring close association of the surface with water molecules in contrast huang et al 2020 showed that f doping of the tino2n 1 anode can inhibit oh formation with this effect attributed to the inhibition of water adsorption on the hydrophobic electrode surface however tino2n 1 will inevitably convert into tio2 under extended anodic polarization thus losing conductivity and electrochemical reactivity jing et al 2018 investigated the surface deactivation mechanism of tino2n 1 in three different electrolyte solutions with results indicating that the loss of charge carriers and formation of a passivation layer causes the decrease in the conductivity and electrochemical reactivity these investigators showed however that cathodic polarization via h intercalation can eliminate the passivation layer and reactivate the tino2n 1 anode the results of some studies however provide the contrary view that the passivation process is irreversible waraksa et al 2003 greater attention should be paid to the passivation and oh generation mechanisms of tino2n 1 with the aim of utilizing the tino2n 1 more appropriately 5 2 performance of different anodic oxidation systems while anode materials are critical to the generation of oh the configuration of anodic oxidation systems are of great significance to the utilization of oh various innovative electrochemical reactors have been developed with the goal of increasing the effective surface area of anodes and reducing the limitations associated with the mass transfer processes in order to improve oh generation and utilization efficiency in this section a variety of different anode oxidation systems are described and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed 5 2 1 mixed tank cell mixed tank cells are the simplest reactor type and are commonly used in laboratory studies martínez huitle and brillas 2009 martínez huitle et al 2015 the removal rates of organics in mixed tank cells are significantly affected by the speed of the magnetic or mechanical stirrers since the mass transfer process is limiting in mixed tank cells martínez huitle et al 2015 the mass transport rate km in a mixed tank cell is around 5 9 10 6 m s 1 chaplin 2014 with such low value indicating that a low current efficiency is to be expected especially in solutions with low concentrations of pollutants although mixed tank cells are not suitable for practical application the investigation of organic degradation mechanisms is feasible since the mathematical interpretation of results and the simulation tools used in mixed tank cells are relatively simple 5 2 2 flow by cell flow by reactors consist of two parallel plate electrodes placed at a distance of several millimetres apart with wastewater flowing through the narrow channel between these two parallel plate electrodes fig 10 a chaplin 2014 although the mass transport rate of flow by cells 2 0 10 5 m s 1 is higher than that of the mixed tank cells chaplin 2014 the steady state diffusion layer thickness of flow by electrochemical reactors can be as high as 100 µm chaplin 2014 with this distance still far in excess of that where the oh can react efficiently with the organic compounds present in solution suggesting that mass transport in flow by cells is still a critical issue 5 2 3 flow through cell in order to overcome the mass transfer limitation in conventional electrochemical cells porous electrodes used in a flow through mode have been implemented fig 10b the typical flow through electrode is a reactive electrochemical membrane rem which can promote the mass transfer process significantly due to a sharp decrease in the thickness of the diffusion layer trellu et al 2018a the thickness of the diffusion layer of porous electrodes in flow through mode can be less than the electrode pore radius at high flow rates thus the mass transport rate in flow through reactors 1 4 10 4 m s 1 is much higher than that in the conventional mixed tank and flow by cells chaplin 2014 various materials such as carbon nanotubes chowdhury et al 2018 ruo2 liu et al 2019b zhou et al 2017 β pbo2 liu et al 2017 sno2 bi gayen et al 2018 and tino2n 1 le et al 2019 trellu et al 2018b have been used to fabricate rems although the carbon materials possess high conductivity appropriate pore structure and low price the electrochemical stability of carbon materials under high potential is the most serious issue preventing their widespread industrial application trellu et al 2018a among these materials tino2n 1 is a promising anode material with high oer potential and high conductivity and for these reasons has attracted the most attention impressive results have been achieved on degradation of various organics via electrochemical oxidation or reduction processes using tino2n 1 rems guo et al 2016 jing et al 2016 shi et al 2019 trellu et al 2018b however fouling of the rem due to deposition pore blockage and adsorption remain challenges especially when treating phenolic compounds which will form soluble or insoluble polymers via det processes on the anode surface thereby preventing further oxidation trellu et al 2018b a smaller pore size always means a higher pressure drops across the rem and a higher possibility of fouling and pore blockage with more energy needed to operate the electrochemical system in addition the permeate flux should be adjusted in an appropriate range since a too high permeate flux will increase the rate of the oer by sweeping gas bubbles from the rem surface this increase in rate of the oer will occur at the expense of the rate of the hydroxyl radical generation reaction leading to lower removal rates and decreased current efficiencies guo et al 2016 trellu et al 2018b 5 2 4 particle electrode system the particle electrode system involves the addition of conducting particles into the area between the anode and cathode of a conventional mixed tank cell fig 11 zhang et al 2013 the degradation of organics not only occurs at the surface of the anodes but also at the surface of the conducting particles electrodes where a bipolar system will be formed when potential is applied zhang et al 2013 the bipolarized particles can operate as an independent microelectrochemical oxidation system with one side acting as an anode while the other side acts as a cathode shen et al 2017 sun et al 2019 these particle electrodes can improve the catalytic efficiency by 10 50 due to the much more reactive surface area and the shorter mass transfer distance compared to the conventional mixed tank and flow by electrochemical oxidation systems ghanbarlou et al 2020 due to the complexity of the removal mechanism for organics it is more difficult to calculate the mass transport rate in particle electrode systems than is the case for two electrodes systems carbon materials such as granular activated carbon granular carbon aerogels graphene and activated carbon fibres are mostly used to prepare particle electrodes ghanbarlou et al 2020 nekoueian et al 2019 zhan et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 with some effort also given to utilizing metal oxides as particle electrodes for instance sun et al 2019 fabricated bi sn sb γ al2o3 particle electrodes to remove tetracycline and liu et al 2019c modified activated carbon fibres with mnox as particle electrodes to degrade m cresol with results confirming that hydroxyl radicals were generated on the surface of these metal oxide particles most of particles electrode are highly conductive thus the amount of particle electrodes added should be carefully determined excessive particle loading between the anode and cathode is likely to cause short circuiting of the system with resultant decrease in current efficiency and increased energy consumption 5 2 5 three dimensional electrochemical system with ion exchange membranes an ion exchange membrane reactor involves emplacement of an ion exchange membrane iem between that anode and cathode with the iem functioning as a salt bridge and thereby significantly decreasing the solution resistance fig 12 a meng et al 2019 meng et al 2019 found that the ion exchange membrane reactor can reduce the applied voltage by 75 7 and increase the electrical efficiency per log order reduction ee o by 73 compared with the traditional two dimensional 2 d system in low ionic strength wastewater in addition to utilizing the anode tank to oxidize organics the cathode tank in the ion exchange membrane reactor can be further exploited for example zou et al 2019 utilized the ion exchange membrane reactor with a 3d hexagonal co3o4 array as the anode to oxidize 4 nitrophenol simultaneously achieving the complete oxidation of 4 nitrophenol on the anode and the reduction of co2 into ch3oh and c2h5oh on the cathode although the ion exchange membrane system resolves the problem that traditional electrochemical oxidation systems are ineffective to deal with low ionic strength wastewater to some extent the mass transfer rates still depend almost exclusively on the velocity of solutions or the speed of stirrer 5 2 6 flow anode cell a flow anode system is built on the concepts of the ion exchange membrane and particle reactors described above and involves emplacement of the anode current collector and cathode on either side of a cation exchange membrane and addition of conducting particles to the anode chamber fig 12b xie et al 2021b investigated the oh generation mechanism in a flow anode system using pt mesh as the anode current collector ti mesh as the cathode and tino2n 1 particles as the flow anode and provided evidence that adsorbed oh can be generated at the surface of the tino2n 1 particles and utilized to oxidize organics at applied potentials as low as 1 5 v vs she as a result of enhanced mass transfer carbon black particles have also been used to investigate the direct electron transfer process in flow anode systems with results showing the oxalate removal rate via det oxidation was enhanced by 20 times in the flow anode system at 1 0 v vs ag agcl compared to the control experiment with no carbon black particles present xie et al 2021a this increase in rate of oxidation is presumably a result of the larger surface area available for direct electron transfer and or the increased affinity of the carbon black modified particle suspension for oxalate although the flow anode system exhibits some advantages compared with other electrochemical oxidation systems the optimization of the flow anode reactor and the need for separation of flow anode particles for subsequent reuse should be considered for long term operation and practical application recently xie et al 2022 incorporated an ultrafiltration uf membrane module into the flow anodic oxidation system and achieved the continuous defluorination of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa for 12 days with high efficiency 94 1 although some progress has been achieved in the development and use of flow anode systems considerations should also be given to the h2 and h2o2 production and or no3 co2 reduction at the cathode with the introduction of a flow cathode expected to significantly improve the efficiency of these processes 6 challenges and perspectives the generation of oh in anodic oxidation systems has been recognized as one of the most important ways to treat wastewater here we provide a comprehensive review of anodic oxidation with particular attention given to the identification quantification methods and generation mechanisms of oh and the configurations of anodic oxidation reactors epr quenching tests and uv fluorescence probe methods are usually used to identify oh that are generated in anodic oxidation systems concerns that the inverted spin trapping phenomenon and the forrester hepburn mechanism on application of epr for identification of the presence of oh may lead to a false positive detection of these radicals have been described jing and chaplin 2017 as has the work of pei et al 2020 who showed that the validity of the epr method can be guaranteed by controlling dmpo concentration and trapping time various oh scavengers have been used in anodic oxidation systems but whether tert butanol which is the most widely used oh scavenger reacts with surface bound oh or free oh in bulk solutions is still under debate in addition potassium iodide ki is used extensively as a surface bound oh scavenger but the mechanism of action of ki is unclear clarification of the reaction mechanisms of these oh scavengers is needed if we are to guarantee the validity of experimental results using these reagents furthermore use of uv fluorescence probes for examination of the presence of oh in anodic oxidation systems should be done so with care as most uv fluorescence probes can be oxidized via det processes leading to false detection of oh in this regard terephthalic acid ta is the most appropriate probe of the presence or otherwise of oh due to its high stability with regard to oxidation by det in summary great care should be exercised in choosing appropriate methods to confirm that oh is generated in anodic oxidation systems if the reliability of results is to be assured the quantification of oh that is generated in anodic oxidation systems is a common method to evaluate and compare the electrochemical performance of different anodes the fluorescence intensity of hta which is the product of the reaction between ta and oh has long been recognized as a measure of the rate and amount of oh generated however some recent studies suggest that hta can be further oxidized by oh leading to an underestimation of the amount of oh generated at the surface of anodes with strong oxidizing ability as such this method should be recognized as a means of confirming the production of oh but should not be seen as a reliable quantification method chaplin and colleagues describe a method for calculating the lower bounds of the steady state surface concentration of oh generated in an anodic oxidation system based on the amount of ta removed and recommend this approach as a means of comparing the electrochemical performance of different anodes many studies have been conducted on the oxidation effectiveness and degradation mechanisms of a wide variety of organic compounds on the surface of different anodes while there have only been a few studies dedicated to understanding the oh generation mechanism it is important to understand the oh generation mechanism on particular anode surfaces as this understanding can instruct the design of electrode surface with respect to increasing the current efficiency and enhancing the electrochemical stability of anodes while there are a variety of promising anode materials including bdd ti4o7 sno2 and pbo2 the electrochemical stability of sno2 and pbo2 and the relatively high cost of bdd and ti4o7 still cannot meet the requirements of industrial application as such there is an urgent need to develop cost effective anode materials with high electrochemical performance and stability it should also be recognized that the efficacy of hydroxyl radical generation cannot be used as the only criterion with which to judge the quality of electrode materials for example the bdd electrode is generally recognized as the best anodic oxidation electrode material with the highest oer potential thereby enabling highly effective generation of hydroxyl radicals without the danger of current wastage as a result of o2 evolution however the pbo2 anode shows a higher degradation rate and higher current efficiency for contaminant degradation than the bdd electrode in some cases ansari and nematollahi 2018 guenfoud et al 2014 additionally the sno2 electrode exhibits a lower potential for direct oxidation of p nitrophenol carbamazepine and oxalic acid than is the case for the bdd electrode ferro et al 2010 gurung et al 2018 song et al 2018 zhu et al 2008 therefore the use of an electrode with the specific purpose to efficiently remove or selectively oxidize particular organic pollutants would appear to be an effective and feasible approach such an approach was adopted by tang et al 2018 who prepared a mesoporous sno2 electrode with a molecular imprinted surface and achieved preferential electrochemical degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d due to the selective adsorption of 2 4 d on the molecular imprinted surface of the sno2 electrode mass transfer is typically the rate limiting step of the anodic oxidation process in conventional mixed tank and flow by reactors a flow through configuration has been shown to provide a much higher mass transfer rate compared to a flow by configuration due to the convection enhanced mass transport of compounds to the anode surface other electrochemical systems such as particle electrodes ion exchange membrane and flow anode reactors possess their own advantages and disadvantages and more effort should be paid to understanding the reaction mechanism and mass transport kinetics in these electrochemical systems further optimization of electrochemical reactors is needed to increase the current efficiency and decrease the energy consumption which largely limits the practical application of anodic oxidation systems compared to other traditional wastewater treatment technologies in conclusion a comprehensive overview of the identification quantification methods and generation mechanisms of oh in anodic oxidation systems and the configurations of electrochemical reactors has been presented here the existing problems and the corresponding corrective solutions in the identification and quantification of oh in anodic oxidation systems have been described new insights into the oh generation mechanisms at the surface of anodes have also been summarized furthermore the advantage and disadvantages of anodic oxidation

16009,anodic oxidation has emerged as a promising treatment technology for the removal of a broad range of organic pollutants from wastewaters hydroxyl radicals are the primary species generated in anodic oxidation systems to oxidize organics in this review the methods of identifying hydroxyl radicals and the existing debates and misunderstandings regarding the validity of experimental results are discussed consideration is given to the methods of quantification of hydroxyl radicals in anodic oxidation systems with particular attention to approaches used to compare the electrochemical performance of different anodes in addition we describe recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of hydroxyl radical generation at the surface of most commonly used anodes and the utilization of hydroxyl radical in typical electrochemical reactors this review shows that the key challenges facing anodic oxidation technology are related to i the elimination of mistakes in identifying hydroxyl radicals ii the establishment of an effective hydroxyl radical quantification method iii the development of cost effective anode materials with high corrosion resistance and high electrochemical activity and iv the optimization of electrochemical reactor design to maximise the utilization efficiency of hydroxyl radicals graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anodic oxidation hydroxyl radicals generation mechanism quantification 1 introduction extremely diverse types of organic compounds are contained in domestic and industrial wastewaters as a result of the intensification of industrial activities and population growth in recent decades moreira et al 2017 although the traditional wastewater treatment technologies of biological transformation physico chemical separation and chemical oxidation are able to remove the majority of organics to a degree that meets the local discharge requirements nguyen et al 2021 shahedi et al 2020 some biorefractory organic pollutants continue to be difficult to remove and require new approaches electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaop based on anodic oxidation have emerged as an alternative to deal with these persistent organic contaminants brillas and martínez huitle 2015 martinez huitle and panizza 2018 radjenovic et al 2020 the number of papers published in the anodic oxidation field and related to environmental engineering and water resources has increased enormously since 2004 in part no doubt due to the increased urgency in developing methods for the removal of toxic organic compounds from waters and wastewaters fig 1 anodic oxidation can produce active species such as the sulfate radical so4 sulfite radical so3 carbonate radical co3 chlorine radical cl oxychloride radical clo superoxide anion radical o2 hydroxyl radical oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 each of which to varying degrees is capable of completely and or partially degrading the organic compounds into co2 and or biodegradable by products giannakis et al 2021 peng et al 2020 xiong et al 2021 among these radicals oh is the primary oxidant of interest as it is generated directly from water oxidation with no chemical addition necessary and is recognised to be one of the most powerful oxidants that are generated in electrochemical systems wang et al 2020b indirect oh identification methods including electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy following addition of a spin trap uv fluorescence probing and selective quenching have been developed and employed in anodic oxidation processes due to the short lifetime of oh 10 6 10 3 s in water wang et al 2020b some controvery remains however with regard to the validity specificity and precision of these methods for example the validity of the epr test has been questioned due to the possible occurrence of either the forrester hepburn mechanism or inverted spin trapping in both cases a radical adduct r oh is formed which is identical to that formed by oh attack on the original spin trap with dmpo and coumarin and p chlorobenzoic acid found to be unsuitable for use in anodic oxidation studies for these reasons jing and chaplin 2017 pei et al 2020 recently suggested that the complications associated with use of the epr method for quantification of oh generation rate in anodic oxidation reactors could be avoided by using high concentrations of dmpo 180 mm and by restricting the trapping time ideally to 60 s furthermore some studies used tert butanol as the scavenger of freely diffusing oh in the bulk phase kim et al 2012 yang et al 2011 while some authors believed that tert butanol can both react with oh on the catalyst surface and in bulk solution zhao et al 2017 these issues related to anode oxidation should be thoroughly discussed to eliminate uncertainty and guarantee the validity of these methods the electrode materials used in anodic oxidation play a critical role in the rate and extent of degradation of organic pollutants with suggestions that different oh generation mechanisms apply depending on the lattice structure the grain size the crystal plane and the interaction between the functional groups on the electrode surface and that of organic compounds martinez huitle and ferro 2006 martínez huitle et al 2015 the oh production process will be further complicated by consideration of other factors such as the ph the type and concentration of electrolyte the potential applied and the status of the electrode surface some progress has been made recently to increase the rate of oh generation on the anode surface leading to a better understanding of oh generation mechanisms for instance the oxygen evolution reaction oer potential has always been recognized as a critical index with which to evaluate the oh generation performance of the electrode with a higher oer potential suggesting a faster generation rate of oh and consequently higher electrochemical activity martinez huitle and ferro 2006 recently it has been suggested that the generation of oh on the surface of the boron doped diamond bdd electrode is an outer sphere electron transfer process and nearly independent of both the nature of functional groups present and the ph while the generation of o2 follows an inner sphere electron transfer pathway henke et al 2018 jaimes et al 2017 indicating that the oer potential might be an inappropriate indicator of capacity for oh generation it has also been shown that the surfaces of highly hydrophobic anode materials such as pbo2 can selectively restrain inner sphere oxidation of h2o to o2 thus promoting the outer sphere oxidation process to generate oh he et al 2018 zhuo et al 2017 the structure of the electrochemical reactor used is of crucial importance to the efficacy of organic pollutant oxidation since it influences the mass transfer process and more importantly the energy consumption many studies have indicated that the electrochemical reaction rate is controlled by the rate of mass transfer with the tardiness of this rate in traditional flow by reactors hindering the potential for large scale application of such reactors chaplin 2014 in comparison use of a flow through configuration leading to convection enhanced mass transport of pollutants to the electrode shows considerable potential for scale up chaplin 2014 some progress with different designs has also been achieved recently a three dimensional 3 d electrochemical system in which an ion exchange membrane is sandwiched between the anode and cathode has been proposed and shown to be capable of treating low ionic strength wastewater with high electrical efficiency since the presence of the ion exchange membrane results in a significant decrease in the system resistance meng et al 2019 zou et al 2019 furthermore a flow anode system in which hydroxyl radicals can be generated at 1 5 v vs she enabling the degradation of organics with ultra low energy consumption has been developed based on the above membrane system xie et al 2021b while many excellent review papers have been published in regard to electrochemical oxidation systems bergmann et al 2014 fernandes et al 2015 martinez huitle and ferro 2006 martínez huitle et al 2015 wang and stahl 2020 wang et al 2020b we focus in this review on the nature and extent of oh generated at the anode surface in anodic oxidation systems based on the above considerations we discuss methods of identifying and quantifying oh generation in anodic oxidation systems and review recent developments in understanding of the oh generation mechanisms in anodic oxidation reactors we also give attention to developments in design of anodic oxidation reactors with a view to facilitating the wider application of anodic oxidation in wastewater treatment 2 oh generation mechanism in anodic oxidation systems oh a strong oxidant generated at the surface of the anode can completely and or partially degrade organic compounds into co2 and or biodegradable by products according to the different types of oh formed on the anode surface active and non active electrodes are established depending on the nature of different electrode materials martinez huitle and ferro 2006 on the surface of both active and non active electrodes water molecules are oxidized to initially form adsorbed or synonomously surface bound oh siahrostami et al 2020 eq 1 1 m h 2 o m oh h e where represents an anode surface site for active electrodes such as those constructed from mixed metal oxides also known as dimensionally stable anodes dsa where oxides of elements such as ruthenium iridium and platinum are coated on supports such as titanium plate or grid chemisorbed active oxygen denoted here as mo can be generated on the electrode surface through the interaction between the adsorbed oh and the anode subsequently mo acts as a mediator to selectively oxidize the organic compounds r at the electrode surface eqs 2 3 2 m oh mo h e 3 mo r m ro evidence for the formation of the mo m redox pair was provided by the detection of 18o within iro2 fierro et al 2007 ruo2 and niooh electrodes comninellis 1994 from 18o enriched water showing that the lattice oxygen at the outer surface of the oxide electrode was involved in the oxygen exchange reaction fierro et al 2007 nevertheless due to the limited oxidation power of mo at these active electrode surface sites partial mineralization of organic pollutants is highly likely which will result in the formation of toxic by products during treatment for example i propanol can be oxidized at 1 6 v vs rhe at the surface of the iro2 ti electrode yielding acetone as a final product with a selectivity exceeding 90 while co2 was the final product under similar experiment conditions when using a bdd electrode fóti et al 1999 besides most active electrode materials involve the use of noble metals which are uneconomical and expensive accordingly most of the active electrode materials are unlikely to find practical application for large scale water treatment in terms of the non active electrodes such as boron doped diamond electrode bdd oxides of sn sno2 pb pbo2 and magnéli phase titanium suboxide tino2n 1 the formed oh is likely to desorb and transform to the solvated hydroxyl radical eq 4 oh aq due to the relatively weak interaction between oh and the non active electrode surface thus these hydroxyl radicals can indiscriminately and completely oxidize organic compounds to co2 eq 5 4 m oh m o h aq 5 o h aq r m c o 2 h 2 o h e where represents an anode surface site in practice however none of electrode materials exhibit exclusive active or non active behaviours just the predominance of one over the other some studies have shown that the bdd anode shows dual behaviour in some cases de araújo et al 2014 garcia segura et al 2015 the hydroxyl radical oh aq h2o2 and o2 are the products of the one two and four electron oxidation processes shown in eqs 6 8 with the free energy of the intermediates oh o and ooh critical determinants of the particular product s formed shi et al 2017 when δgoh is close to or exceeds 2 73 ev the energy required for water oxidation to result in formation of oh aq fig 2 the one electron oxidation process is likely to form oh aq malik et al 2020 when δgoh 2 73 ev and δgo 3 5 ev the energy required for water oxidation to result in formation of h2o2 the two electron oxidation process for h2o2 generation should be dominant malik et al 2020 when δgoh 2 73 ev and δgo 3 5 ev o2 formation is expected to dominate malik et al 2020 the δgoh of anodes determines whether the surface bound oh or oh aq generation is thermodynamically favorable at the anode surface anodes with low δgoh values have a strong tendency to form surface bound oh while anodes with high oer potentials usually possess a strong ability to generate oh aq since δgoh of these anode is close to 2 73 ev higher oer potentials which make the generation of o2 more difficult can increase the faradaic efficiency of oh aq production inhibition of o2 generation at the anode surface and or decrease in the value of δgoh by manipulation of the intrinsic surface electronic configuration can be considered effective means of designing anodes that are well suited to generation of oh aq 6 h 2 o o h aq h e e 0 2 73 v 7 2 h 2 o h 2 o 2 2 h e e 0 1 76 v 8 h 2 o o 2 4 h e e 0 1 23 v it has long been accepted that the generation and utilization of oh aq via the desorption of oh is necessary in anodic oxidation systems thus non active electrodes with high oer potentials are typically used however high energy consumption is inevitable when operating at anode potentials sufficiently large to generate oh aq garcia segura et al 2018 martínez huitle and panizza 2018 the generation of oh is recognized to require much lower energy compared to that of oh aq malik et al 2020 shi et al 2017 siahrostami et al 2017 for instance siahrostami et al 2017 investigated the selectivity of different electrodes toward the formation of oh aq and showed that the δg oh values of iro2 0 2 ev fig 2a and rho2 1 1 ev are much smaller than δg oh 2 73 ev for these materials in addition shi et al 2017 analyzed the catalytic properties towards h2o2 evolution on wo3 and sno2 electrodes suggesting that the δg oh values of wo3 and sno2 are 1 7 fig 2b and 2 0 ev respectively however utilization of the surface located oh has typically been small due to the mass transfer limitations inherent in traditional electrochemical reactors recently some effort has been paid to the utilization of the surface located oh bin saiman et al 2012 liu et al 2019a with these studies showing that the energy consumed in such a process is comparable to that used in conventional decontamination techniques miklos et al 2018 for instance tio2 particles were facet tailored by liu et al 2019 to oxidize phenols with results showing that phenols were degraded mainly by surface bound oh and direct electron transfer on the tio2 ti electrode with a 001 polar facet bin saiman et al 2012 utilized au pd nanoparticles as heterogeneous catalysts to oxidize toluene with results indicating that surface bound oxygen centred radicals played a critical role in activating toluene 3 identification methods of oh 3 1 epr method electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy is a widely applied method to confirm the presence and in some cases quantify the rate of formation of oh via use of a spin trap wang et al 2020b epr is a spectroscopic method in which a static magnetic field and microwaves with a frequency between 0 04 25 cm 1 are used to observe the behavior of the unpaired electrons the degeneracy of the electron spin states is lifted when an unpaired electron is placed in a magnetic field creating two spin states ms 1 2 thus providing detailed information on structure and bonding of paramagnetic species bonke et al 2021 the nitrone 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo is the most common spin trap for oh since it has high selectivity and can react with oh to form a dmpo oh adduct that is detectable by epr wang et al 2020b the intensity ratio of the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh are 1 2 2 1 as shown in fig 3 pei et al 2020 however the false positive detection of oh which has been reported in electrochemical oxidation and biochemical processes may occur due to both the inverted spin trapping phenomenon and the forrester hepburn mechanism wang et al 2020b the inverted spin trapping phenomenon involves the formation of dmpo via a direct electron transfer det oxidation process with the dmpo oh spin adduct subsequently formed via nucleophilic addition of hydroxyl ions eq 9 jing and chaplin 2017 conversely the forrester hepburn mechanism is initiated by nucleophilic attack by hydroxyl ions followed by loss of an electron to an oxidant such as oxygen eq 10 jing and chaplin 2017 in addition dmpo undergoes det oxidation at 1 72 v vs she pei et al 2020 fig 4 a and the dmpo oh adduct is electrochemically unstable and can be further oxidized by det and oh mediated oxidation processes under anodic polarization conditions fig 4b wang et al 2020b resulting in low confidence in epr data obtained in anodic oxidation systems the possible dmpo transformation pathways in anodic oxidation systems proposed by pei et al 2020 are shown in fig 4c 9 dmpo e dmp o o h dmpo oh 10 dmpo o h dmpo o h e dmpo oh recently pei et al 2020 investigated the validity of the epr method for identification of oh in anodic oxidation systems and indicated that the acidic boundary layer formed near the surface of the anode can inhibit the reactions that occur in the inverted spin trapping phenomenon and the forrester hepburn mechanism as such these investigators concluded that the validity of the epr method can be guaranteed by careful control of dmpo concentration and trapping time for instance an extremely high concentration of dmpo 125 mm and a fast spin trapping time 300 s are required to effectively spin trap oh at a current density of 10 ma cm 2 fig 3 pei et al 2020 these investigators advise that the minimum dmpo concentration should be estimated based on the current density before starting experiments and recommend that the trapping time should be less than 300 s before epr measurement in order to minimize the occurrence of side reactions pei et al 2020 although the epr method may be applicable to oh identification in anodic oxidation systems provided certain conditions are met it should be noted that some studies suggest that dmpo reacts with surface bound oh rather than free oh in bulk solution grela et al 1996 while others suggest that dmpo reacts with both oh at the surface of the electrode and in bulk solution dvoranová et al 2014 a negative aspect of using the epr method to identify oh in anodic oxidation systems is that the price of dmpo is relatively high compared to electrochemically active oh probes and as is clear from the above discussion the experimental conditions when using dmpo in anodic oxidation systems should be strictly controlled for example studies should be undertaken at a reduced temperature e g in an ice bath since dmpo is easily oxidized by oxygen or other oxidants at room temperature in summary epr spectroscopy has the unique capability of providing direct evidence for oh generation in anodic oxidation systems while other methods are indirect and ambiguous 3 2 quenching methods quenching tests are used to inhibit the reactions between oh and the target organic compound by adding scavengers into anodic oxidation system wang et al 2020b the concentration and reaction rate with oh of these scavengers should be much higher than that of the target organic compound in order to guarantee their effectiveness the purposes of a quenching test are to investigate the contribution of oh towards the degradation of the target organic compound and to distinguish the type of oh present by comparing the changes of removal rate before and after the addition of scavengers a summary of common oh scavengers that are used in anodic oxidation systems is provided in table 1 among these scavengers tert butanol and methanol are typically used to distinguish the contribution of oh aq and so4 song et al 2017 zou et al 2019 however zhao et al 2017 suggested that tert butanol can be easily adsorbed on the surface of znfe2o4 cu3 particles and therefore used as the surface bound scavenger in contrast barazesh et al 2016 indicated that the surface bound oh present at the bdd anode surface was unable to be scavenged by saturated tert butanol in addition ling et al 2016 indicated that methanol can be used as a quencher for oh both in the bulk solution and on the surface of tio2 while wu et al 2019 and liang et al 2013 suggested that methanol may not accumulate on the surface of catalyst and can only be used as an oh aq scavenger a similar divergence of results is also observed when using hydrophobic n butanol as the oh scavenger liu et al 2019a used n butanol as the oh aq scavenger due to the low molecular affinity of hydrophobic n butanol toward hydrophilic tio2 surfaces while xu and wang 2012 indicated that n butanol is an effective scavenger for both oh aq and surface bound oh although ki is a commonly used surface bound oh scavenger wang et al 2020b the mechanism by which i ions inhibit the reaction between particular target organic compounds and surface bound oh is unclear in addition most of these scavengers can be oxidized via direct electron transfer det processes the excessive addition of these scavengers can inhibit both oh and det oxidation processes thus leading to an overestimated contribution of oh to the degradation of organics and an underestimated contribution of det processes for instance methanol can be oxidized via det processes below 1 0 v vs she dong et al 2010 dubale et al 2020 while methanol is always used as the oh scavenger in anodic oxidation systems with much higher anode potentials applied inhibiting both oh and det oxidation processes baek et al 2021 song et al 2018 in addition xie et al 2022 indicated that the addition of ki as the surface bound hydroxyl radical scavenger can suppress both oh and det oxidation processes although scavenging methods have been widely adopted in homogenous systems such as the low ph fenton process they may be problematic when being used in heterogeneous systems typical of electrochemical and photocatalytic processes due to the complications and uncertainties arising from the possible consumption of the quenching agent by det processes for anodic oxidation where the anode is polarized at high overpotential anions present in the supporting electrolyte can also be oxidized leading to the formation of active intermediates with these species potentially exerting a complex influence on the production and identification of electro produced oh in particular anions such as cl co3 2 po4 3 and so4 2 can be oxidized at the active sites on the anode surface to generate other oxidants such as chlorine percarbonates perphosphates and persulfates bagastyo et al 2013 thus inhibiting the generation of oh due to the limited active sites on the anode surface besides co3 2 hco3 and po4 3 can act as oh scavengers to form other free radicals such as co3 hco3 and po4 2 ghatak 2014 son et al 2006 staehelin and hoigne 1985 in view of the considerable divergence in interpretation of the results of tests using these various oh scavengers an urgent need exists to better understand the mechanism of interaction of these scavengers with both oh aq and surface bound oh 3 3 uv and fluorescence probe method the uv fluorescence probe method is usually used to detect the production of the oh adduct or the disappearance of the probe in solution via conventional analytical techniques such as high performance liquid chromatography and uv spectrophotometry an hplc system can separate organic compounds as a result of their relative affinity for either the mobile or stationary phases with the concentration of the compounds present in the mobile phase subsequently determined via a method such as uv or fluorescence spectroscopy particular organic compounds may be retarded to varying degrees while passing through the porous stationary phase with the extent of their retardation and thus their residence time on the column dependent on their chemical structure size and or charge the detection unit can be calibrated to recognize the organics leaving the column with signals converted and recorded by a data management system uv spectrophotometry is based on the absorption of ultraviolet light or visible light by organics which undergoes either excitation or de excitation resulting in the production of distinct spectra various organic probes such as coumarin nakabayashi and nosaka 2013 salicylic acid jen et al 1998 luminol hirakawa and nosaka 2002 1 4 dioxane kishimoto and sugimura 2010 1 propanol overend and paraskevopoulos 1978 methylene blue wei and feng 2017 p chlorobenzoic acid yang et al 2016b terephthalic acid ta rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 and p benzoquinone shi et al 2015 have been used in the anodic oxidation system however most of these probes can be oxidized by direct electron transfer or forrester hepburn processes leading to the false positive detection of oh jing and chaplin 2017 wang et al 2020b jing and chaplin 2017 investigated the validity of using five commonly used oh probes coumarin ta benzoic acid p chlorobenzoic acid and 1 4 benzoquinone and indicated that ta is the most appropriate oh probe compound in anodic oxidation systems it should be noted that ta can also be oxidized via direct electron transfer when the anode potential exceeds 2 76 v vs she therefore the false positive detection of oh using ta as the probe might also occur when the anode potential is too high jing and chaplin 2017 developed the following criteria for choosing appropriate oh probes 1 the probe compound should react with oh at diffusion limited rates 2 the probe compound should be electrochemically stable towards direct electron transfer processes 3 the probe compound should be sufficiently soluble in solution and 4 the probe compound should yield a stable and soluble redox product that is detectable by conventional analytical techniques although ta is recognized as the most appropriate oh probe compound the solubility of ta is very limited in acidic solution and varies significantly at room temperature depending on the ph of the solution terephthalate has higher solubility than ta and generates the same oh adduct product and as such has been suggested as a reasonable alternative to ta lv et al 2017 wang et al 2020a yuan et al 2018 4 the quantification of oh the amount of oh generated is usually quantified by using the above mentioned reactive probe molecules jing et al investigated the validity of using these hydroxyl radical probes in anodic oxidation systems and indicated that ta which can react with oh to form detectable 2 hydroxyl terephthalic acid with high fluorescence response and is resistant to direct oxidation processes is the most appropriate oh probe compound jing and chaplin 2017 thus the fluorescence intensity of 2 hydroxyl terephthalic acid hta has been extensively used to calculate the rate of generation of oh fig 5 a he et al 2015 liao et al 2014 qiao et al 2018 however hta is relatively unstable and can be further oxidized into other products nayak and chaplin 2018 therefore use of the fluorescence intensity of hta to characterize the oh generation rate is inappropriate if the anodic oxidation ability is high enough to induce the further degradation of hta for example he et al 2018 found that an electrochemical cell utilizing an n pbo2 anode exhibited a higher hta fluorescence intensity with electrolysis time compared to that obtained with a bdd electrode fig 5b but yielded comparable degradation performance of paracetamol fig 5c and suggested oxidation of hta at the bdd anode surface may have accounted for this observation further evidence of this effect has been provided by gayen et al 2018 who prepared three reactive electrochemical membranes rems a pure magnéli phase tino2n 1 n 4 6 rem a bi doped sno2 tino2n 1 rem obtained by a pulsed laser deposition method bdto pld and a bi doped sno2 tino2n 1 rem obtained by pulsed electrodeposition followed by thermal oxidation bdto edt in comparison with the ta removal performances of the bi doped rems the pure tino2n 1 rem exhibited the lowest degradation performance of ta fig 6 a but the highest rate of generation of hta fig 6b gayen et al 2018 with these results indicating that a greater amount of hta was further degraded by bdto pld and bdto edt rems than was the case for the pure tino2n 1 rem the time dependent change in concentration of hta accounting for both formation and degradation processes can be expressed by eq 11 11 d hta dt k ta oh ta oh k hta oh hta oh k det hta where ta oh and hta represent the concentrations of ta oh and hta on the anode surface respectively at time t kta oh represents the second order reaction rate constant of ta with oh 4 0 106 m3 mol 1 s 1 khta oh represents the second order reaction rate constant of hta with oh and kdet represents the direct electron transfer reaction rate constant of hta with the anode under ideal conditions ta rapidly diffuses to the anode surface where it reacts with oh to form hta which then rapidly diffuses into solution such that the surface concentration of hta is close to zero and further oxidation of hta prevented in this case the formation rate of hta will be proportional to the surface concentration of oh present at time t eq 12 12 d hta dt k ta oh ta oh in actuality however the concentration of hta on the anode surface is unlikely to be equal to zero with the extent of accumulation of hta at the anode surface depending on the relative rates of generation and degradation of hta additionally it should be recognized that the reaction rate is always limited by mass transfer in traditional electrochemical systems the surface concentration of ta will become zero when the applied current is large enough to generate sufficient oh to oxidize ta with any superfluous oh further oxidizing hta or forming other products such as oxygen in this case the surface concentration of oh present at time t is not proportional to the rate of formation of hta therefore the detection of hta is generally considered to be an indication of oh formation only rather than a quantitative measure of the amount of oh generated the methodology that is most widely used to quantify the amount of oh generated in anodic oxidation systems involves determination of the steady state surface concentrations of oh oh ss using the expression shown in eq 13 gayen et al 2018 nayak and chaplin 2018 13 oh ss k ta k ta oh where kta is the nominal surface area normalized observed rate constant for ta oxidation in single pass mode the value of kta can be calculated by eq 14 14 k ta c 0 c e v c 0 s t where c0 is the feed concentration of ta ce is the permeate concentration of ta s is the geometric area of anode t is the time of oxidation process and v is the solution volume in batch mode the value of kta can be expressed by eq 15 15 k ta ln c t c 0 v t s although this methodology cannot accurately measure the amount of oh generated it does represent a means of obtaining a quantitative measure of the lower bounds oh generated since there is a lack of clarity on both the exact proportion of oh reacting with ta and whether the det process is involved in the oxidation of hta this method is also applicable to other oh probes that do not suffer from complications associated with possible occurrence of det processes however it should be noted that the steady state surface concentrations of oh represents the variety of hydroxyl radicals present in the electrochemical system including surface bound oh and oh physisorbed as well as free oh aq in solution since ta can react with all these kinds of hydroxyl radicals to form hta liu et al 2019a mahé et al 2013 proposed a systematic method to quantify the generation of oh resulting from the cathodic reduction of oxygen by coupling electrochemical measurements and the detection of the produced species by chemiluminescence with phthalhydrazide as the luminescent probe with this method exhibiting a detection limit for hydroxyl radicals ranging from 7 4 nm at ph 3 to 6 2 nm at ph 8 1 mahé et al 2013 this method has been used extensively for quantification of oh generation rate in natural and engineered systems miller et al 2011 he et al 2014 qiu et al 2015 xing et al 2018 would seem to hold particular promise for use in anodic oxidation systems though attention should be given to the possible direct oxidation of phthalhydrazide at the anode in order to distinguish the contributions to the removal of organics by different kinds of hydroxyl radicals oh scavengers mentioned in table 1 can be used the degradation rates of reactive probe molecules in the presence of high concentrations of surface bound and free hydroxyl radical scavengers can be used to quantify the contribution of det oxidation kdet song et al 2018 in this instance the degradation rate of organic compounds can be expressed by eq 16 16 d r dt r k r oh oh surface k r oh oh aqueous k det r k r r where r is the concentration of reactive probe molecules in mol l 1 kr oh is the second order reaction rate constant of r with oh aqueous kr oh is the second order reaction rate constant of r with oh surface kdet is the direct oxidation rate constant and kr is the apparent degradation rate of r thus the concentration of surface located and aqueous hydroxyl radicals can be calculated using eq 17 17 k r oh oh surface k r oh oh aqueous k r k det according to the different values of kr when surface bound or free oh scavengers are separately added into the electrochemical oxidation system the concentrations of surface bound and free oh can be calculated respectively this method is suited to use with a wider range of reactive probe molecules for which both det and oh oxidation occur simultaneously however this method only works when the concentration of oh scavengers is much higher than the reactive probe molecules though it should be recognised that the presence of excess concentrations of oh scavengers in anodic oxidation systems also inhibits the det oxidation of reactive probe molecules since most of the oh scavengers are not resistant to transformation via det with this effect leading to an underestimation in kdet value and an overestimation in oh ss value in addition both of the above two methods use the apparent degradation rate of r kr to calculate to the amount of oh generated but the value of kr is significantly influenced by the mass transfer process therefore the calculated concentrations of oh reflect not only the oh generation capacity of anodes but also the mass transfer rate of electrochemical cells in other words the value of oh ss calculated in a flow through cell is higher than that in a flow by cell under the same experimental conditions the oh concentrations calculated by the above methods are summarized in table 2 kinetic modelling using packages such as kintecus kintek explorer etc has emerged as a powerful tool that shows the significance of competing processes as determinants of steady state concentrations in anode oxidation and other systems chen et al 2021 garg et al 2020 lizhang et al 2016 yuan et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 for example kapałka et al 2009 developed a model to describe the oh concentration profile at the surface of the bdd electrode in the presence and absence of organic compounds this model only considered the charge transfer controlled region in which reaction rate is controlled by applied current the steady state surface concentration of oh during oxidation of organic compounds r was calculated by eq 18 18 oh ss j f z k r oh c r d oh where j is the applied current f is the c mol 1 is the faraday constant z is the number of exchanged electrons cr is the surface concentration of r and d oh m2 s 1 is the diffusion coefficient of oh it should be noted that this model was established under the hypothesis that only oh mediated oxidation processes contributed to the removal of organic compounds ignoring the det oxidation of organic compounds leads to overestimated oh ss values fig 7 a compared to the experimental data table 2 with results showing simulated concentration profiles of hydroxyl radicals in fig 7a that are several orders of magnitude higher than the experimentally determined concentration of hydroxyl radicals table 2 additionally lan et al 2018 developed a mathematical model for electroxidation of target pharmaceuticals which can be used to predict the temporal variation in concentration of organics with electroxidation time this model considered both the det and oh mediated oxidation processes with model results showing excellent agreement with experiment fig 7b unfortunately this model is unable to predict the oh ss values since it did not involve the second order reaction rate constant of r with oh although progress has been achieved it would be useful to develop a model that can be widely applied to various electrodes to predict the oh concentration a sound understanding of oh generation mechanisms on the surfaces of various electrodes is an essential precondition for effective and practical modelling the following subsection provides more details on the oh generation mechanisms 5 regulation of oh generation in anodic systems a typical electrochemical oxidation system consists of an anode and a cathode oh can be formed at the surface of the anode when an appropriate potential is applied with the generation and utilization of oh affected by various factors such as anode materials electrochemical reactors and solution matrix in this section we provide a comprehensive review of the oh generation mechanisms and regulation on the surface of four non active anodes various alternate configurations of anodic oxidation systems and the influence of operating parameters 5 1 oh generation by different anode materials oh mediated oxidation processes are responsible for the partial and in some instances complete degradation of organic pollutants into co2 and h2o as such the rate of generation and the electrochemical activity of oh formed on the anode surface are critical determinants of the electrochemical performance of anode materials researchers have investigated the oh generation performance of various materials including metals szpyrkowicz et al 2005 metal oxides huang et al 2018 schranck et al 2018 and carbon based materials periyasamy and muthuchamy 2018 yang 2018 since active electrodes are unable to generate sufficient oh compared to inactive electrodes four inactive anode materials pbo2 sno2 boron doped diamond bdd and tino2n 1 with high oh generation rates and electrochemical activity are comprehensively reviewed below 5 1 1 bdd electrode the bdd electrode which consists of non active sp3 diamond carbon and amorphous sp2 non diamond carbon ayres et al 2016 is a promising anode with excellent electrochemical properties and stability bdd film electrodes are usually prepared via a cvd method using si plate as the substrate da silva et al 2019 some other substrates such as nb brito et al 2018 and ta liu et al 2018 have also been used to prepare bdd electrodes with these electrodes demonstrating higher oer potential and increased effective active surface area in addition further enhancement in active surface area has been achieved by use of porous substrates leading to a faster apparent generation rate of oh braga et al 2012 he et al 2019 the generation mechanisms of oh on bdd electrode are related to the boron content the sp3 sp2 ratio and the functional groups on the bdd anode surface ivandini and einaga 2017 a higher boron content decreases the oer potential of the bdd electrode while a higher sp3 sp2 ratio in the bdd electrode has been shown to enhance the production of oh de araújo et al 2014 souza et al 2016 and increase the oer potential espinoza et al 2018 some experimental results have suggested that the oer potentials of bdd electrodes decreased from 2 74 v to 2 29 v vs she when the hydrogen terminated surface sites were oxidized to oxygen terminated surface sites chaplin et al 2013 however alternative results indicate that the generation of oh on the bdd electrode surface is nearly independent of the functional groups and the ph value while the electrochemical current arising from o2 generation differs strongly between bdd electrodes with different surface functionalizations henke et al 2018 suggesting that the formation of oh from the electrolysis of water is an outer sphere electron transfer process while the generation of o2 follows an inner sphere electron transfer pathway henke et al 2018 attributed this difference to the fact that a hydrophobic bdd surface can prevent water molecules from entering the inner sphere thereby inhibiting o2 generation and enhancing oh formation therefore it is to be expected that a highly hydrophobic anode surface will selectively restrain the inner sphere oxidation of h2o to o2 thus promoting the outer sphere oxidation process to generate oh henke et al 2018 fig 8 a c shows prevalent functional groups on the hydrogen terminated oxygen terminated and polyfluorinated molecular ligands terminated surface of bdd electrode the polyfluorinated molecular ligands terminated surface exhibits a selective outer sphere electron transfer production of oh due to its high hydrophobicity furthermore liu et al 2021a presented oxygen generation and oh production mechanisms on the surface of different element n p s and f doped diamond anodes electrodes based on density functional theory fig 8 with results indicating that oxygen evolution is an inner sphere reaction related to the intrinsic surface electronic configuration and a high oxygen overpotential is beneficial for increasing the faradaic efficiency of oh production in addition jaimes et al 2017 investigated the relationship between the formation of oh and the adsorption of h2o on the bdd anode surface suggesting that weak adsorption of h2o on the active sites can decrease the overpotential to generate oh on the other hand the presence of high concentrations of anions such as cl so4 2 and co3 2 will inhibit the generation of oh almassi et al 2018 and as such can accelerate or decrease the cod removal of some organic compounds depending on the reactivity between the active oxidants and specific organic compounds bu et al 2018 klidi et al 2019 klidi et al 2018 5 1 2 pbo2 electrode the pbo2 anode possesses a comparable capacity of generating oh to that of the bdd electrode but the mechanisms of generating oh on the pbo2 surface are not well understood pavlov and monahov 1996 investigated the generation mechanisms of oh on the pbo2 anode in h2so4 solution and suggested that the generation of oh and oxygen share the same active sites on the hydrated pbo oh 2 layer that formed on the pbo2 anode surface via the reaction shown in eq 19 when anodic polarization is applied 19 pb o 2 h 2 o pbo oh 2 at potentials between 1 0 φ 1 3v vs hg hg2so4 the generation of oh is the dominant reaction via the oxidation of the gel layer cong and wu 2007 liu et al 2021b pavlov and monahov 1996 as shown in eq 20 20 pbo oh 2 h 2 o pbo oh 2 o h h e when the potential is greater than 1 3v the oh that formed on the active sites will be further oxidized into oxygen pavlov and monahov 1996 the above oh and oxygen generation mechanisms are illustrated in fig 9 in addition the electrodeposition of bi3 on the pbo2 anode surface can enhance the surface hydration of the pbo2 electrode resulting in an increase in the amount of oh generated on the pbo2 anode surface shmychkova et al 2015 however some experimental results suggested that a highly hydrophobic surface can also promote the generation of oh he et al 2018 yang et al 2020 and increase the oer overpotential zhuo et al 2017 to enhance the capacity of generating oh with high activity various dopants such as co dai et al 2016c ce yao et al 2019b ni sun et al 2021 xia et al 2015 nb yang et al 2016a mo bi rong et al 2021 yao et al 2019a and la dai et al 2016a have been introduced into the pbo2 electrode interestingly the optimal doping mass fraction of these elements on the pbo2 electrode is always 1 wt for example dai et al 2016b prepared a 1 wt mo doped pbo2 electrode to oxidize cinnamic acid and obtained the highest oer overpotential and a high cinnamic acid 85 51 and cod 25 79 removal efficiencies however the mechanism of the increased oer overpotential on the pbo2 electrode doped by the elements mentioned above was not elaborated clearly 5 1 3 sno2 electrode pure sno2 is an n type semiconductor material with a band gap of 3 5 ev that exhibits a reasonable conductivity only at high temperatures kötz et al 1991 various metallic elements such as sb yang et al 2017 pd li et al 2017 co wang et al 2007 and ni yang et al 2012 have been investigated as possible dopants to enhance the electrochemical performance of sno2 electrodes among these elements sb is the most commonly used doping element with the sb sno2 electrode exhibiting both a high oer overpotential of 1 9 2 2 v vs she martínez huitle et al 2015 and an excellent ability to oxidatively degrade various organic compounds such as pyridine li et al 2016 isothiazolin ones han et al 2011 phenol li et al 2005 and ciprofloxacin wang et al 2016 experimental results also indicate that the introduction of ni into the sno2 electrode can promote not only the generation of oh but also the formation of hydroperoxy radicals ooh on the sno2 anode surface with resultant facilitation of the degradation of organic compounds yang et al 2012 in addition yang s group fabricated a f doped sno2 electrode to oxidize perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate with this electrode exhbiting a high oer potential and a smooth surface to generate weakly adsorbed oh due to the similar ionic radii of f and o and the strong electronegativity of f yang et al 2015 yang et al 2017 in addition to the doping of different elements extensive research has been conducted on optimizing the structure fan et al 2013 and particle size of the sno2 electrode in order to generate more oh huang et al 2020b zhao et al 2009 for example zhao et al 2009 utilized tio2 nanotubes as the substrate to support an sb doped sno2 film with the resultant electrode exhibiting a high oxygen evolution potential and a high capacity of generating oh due to the larger specific surface area and the more active sites provided by the smaller grain sizes than the traditional sb doped sno2 electrode although some progress in developing sno2 based electrodes has been achieved few studies have been conducted to investigate the generation mechanisms of oh at the surface of sno2 electrodes 5 1 4 tino2n 1 electrode many studies have been conducted on the degradation of various organic compounds such as p methoxyphenol zaky and chaplin 2013 antibiotic amoxicillin ganiyu et al 2016 tetracycline liang et al 2018 and humic acid geng and chen 2016 using tino2n 1 as the anode with results showing that tino2n 1 is a promising and cost effective anode material with a high oer overpotential chaplin 2014 due to the low price and easy processing there have been many studies on the fabrication of tino2n 1 reactive electrochemical membrane rem to reduce the limitations associated with mass transfer process and enhance the degradation rate of organic compounds trellu et al 2018a in addition the apparent generation rate of oh by tino2n 1 rem has been shown to be significantly enhanced due to the much more active sites on the nominal geometric surface compared to plate tino2n 1 electrodes zaky and chaplin 2013 some effort has also been invested in development of other structures for instance geng et al 2015 prepared highly ordered tino2n 1 nanotube arrays to oxidize phenol with results suggesting that 20 more cod removal than obtained with tino2n 1 particles could be achieved due to the faster electron transfer rate furthermore pb huang et al 2020a ce lin et al 2021 and carbon materials almassi et al 2018 almassi et al 2019 xie et al 2020 have been introduced to promote the electrochemical performance of tino2n 1 electrodes for example doping 1 3 ce3 into tino2n 1 electrodes can increase the anodic production of oh by 37 129 and enhance the electrochemical stability lin et al 2021 in addition pei et al 2021 indicated that f doped tino2n 1 anode can increase the oer potential and thus enhance the oh generation with this effect possibly associated with the increased hydrophobicity as a result of f doping and the associated difficulty of oxygen evolution an inner sphere process requiring close association of the surface with water molecules in contrast huang et al 2020 showed that f doping of the tino2n 1 anode can inhibit oh formation with this effect attributed to the inhibition of water adsorption on the hydrophobic electrode surface however tino2n 1 will inevitably convert into tio2 under extended anodic polarization thus losing conductivity and electrochemical reactivity jing et al 2018 investigated the surface deactivation mechanism of tino2n 1 in three different electrolyte solutions with results indicating that the loss of charge carriers and formation of a passivation layer causes the decrease in the conductivity and electrochemical reactivity these investigators showed however that cathodic polarization via h intercalation can eliminate the passivation layer and reactivate the tino2n 1 anode the results of some studies however provide the contrary view that the passivation process is irreversible waraksa et al 2003 greater attention should be paid to the passivation and oh generation mechanisms of tino2n 1 with the aim of utilizing the tino2n 1 more appropriately 5 2 performance of different anodic oxidation systems while anode materials are critical to the generation of oh the configuration of anodic oxidation systems are of great significance to the utilization of oh various innovative electrochemical reactors have been developed with the goal of increasing the effective surface area of anodes and reducing the limitations associated with the mass transfer processes in order to improve oh generation and utilization efficiency in this section a variety of different anode oxidation systems are described and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed 5 2 1 mixed tank cell mixed tank cells are the simplest reactor type and are commonly used in laboratory studies martínez huitle and brillas 2009 martínez huitle et al 2015 the removal rates of organics in mixed tank cells are significantly affected by the speed of the magnetic or mechanical stirrers since the mass transfer process is limiting in mixed tank cells martínez huitle et al 2015 the mass transport rate km in a mixed tank cell is around 5 9 10 6 m s 1 chaplin 2014 with such low value indicating that a low current efficiency is to be expected especially in solutions with low concentrations of pollutants although mixed tank cells are not suitable for practical application the investigation of organic degradation mechanisms is feasible since the mathematical interpretation of results and the simulation tools used in mixed tank cells are relatively simple 5 2 2 flow by cell flow by reactors consist of two parallel plate electrodes placed at a distance of several millimetres apart with wastewater flowing through the narrow channel between these two parallel plate electrodes fig 10 a chaplin 2014 although the mass transport rate of flow by cells 2 0 10 5 m s 1 is higher than that of the mixed tank cells chaplin 2014 the steady state diffusion layer thickness of flow by electrochemical reactors can be as high as 100 µm chaplin 2014 with this distance still far in excess of that where the oh can react efficiently with the organic compounds present in solution suggesting that mass transport in flow by cells is still a critical issue 5 2 3 flow through cell in order to overcome the mass transfer limitation in conventional electrochemical cells porous electrodes used in a flow through mode have been implemented fig 10b the typical flow through electrode is a reactive electrochemical membrane rem which can promote the mass transfer process significantly due to a sharp decrease in the thickness of the diffusion layer trellu et al 2018a the thickness of the diffusion layer of porous electrodes in flow through mode can be less than the electrode pore radius at high flow rates thus the mass transport rate in flow through reactors 1 4 10 4 m s 1 is much higher than that in the conventional mixed tank and flow by cells chaplin 2014 various materials such as carbon nanotubes chowdhury et al 2018 ruo2 liu et al 2019b zhou et al 2017 β pbo2 liu et al 2017 sno2 bi gayen et al 2018 and tino2n 1 le et al 2019 trellu et al 2018b have been used to fabricate rems although the carbon materials possess high conductivity appropriate pore structure and low price the electrochemical stability of carbon materials under high potential is the most serious issue preventing their widespread industrial application trellu et al 2018a among these materials tino2n 1 is a promising anode material with high oer potential and high conductivity and for these reasons has attracted the most attention impressive results have been achieved on degradation of various organics via electrochemical oxidation or reduction processes using tino2n 1 rems guo et al 2016 jing et al 2016 shi et al 2019 trellu et al 2018b however fouling of the rem due to deposition pore blockage and adsorption remain challenges especially when treating phenolic compounds which will form soluble or insoluble polymers via det processes on the anode surface thereby preventing further oxidation trellu et al 2018b a smaller pore size always means a higher pressure drops across the rem and a higher possibility of fouling and pore blockage with more energy needed to operate the electrochemical system in addition the permeate flux should be adjusted in an appropriate range since a too high permeate flux will increase the rate of the oer by sweeping gas bubbles from the rem surface this increase in rate of the oer will occur at the expense of the rate of the hydroxyl radical generation reaction leading to lower removal rates and decreased current efficiencies guo et al 2016 trellu et al 2018b 5 2 4 particle electrode system the particle electrode system involves the addition of conducting particles into the area between the anode and cathode of a conventional mixed tank cell fig 11 zhang et al 2013 the degradation of organics not only occurs at the surface of the anodes but also at the surface of the conducting particles electrodes where a bipolar system will be formed when potential is applied zhang et al 2013 the bipolarized particles can operate as an independent microelectrochemical oxidation system with one side acting as an anode while the other side acts as a cathode shen et al 2017 sun et al 2019 these particle electrodes can improve the catalytic efficiency by 10 50 due to the much more reactive surface area and the shorter mass transfer distance compared to the conventional mixed tank and flow by electrochemical oxidation systems ghanbarlou et al 2020 due to the complexity of the removal mechanism for organics it is more difficult to calculate the mass transport rate in particle electrode systems than is the case for two electrodes systems carbon materials such as granular activated carbon granular carbon aerogels graphene and activated carbon fibres are mostly used to prepare particle electrodes ghanbarlou et al 2020 nekoueian et al 2019 zhan et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 with some effort also given to utilizing metal oxides as particle electrodes for instance sun et al 2019 fabricated bi sn sb γ al2o3 particle electrodes to remove tetracycline and liu et al 2019c modified activated carbon fibres with mnox as particle electrodes to degrade m cresol with results confirming that hydroxyl radicals were generated on the surface of these metal oxide particles most of particles electrode are highly conductive thus the amount of particle electrodes added should be carefully determined excessive particle loading between the anode and cathode is likely to cause short circuiting of the system with resultant decrease in current efficiency and increased energy consumption 5 2 5 three dimensional electrochemical system with ion exchange membranes an ion exchange membrane reactor involves emplacement of an ion exchange membrane iem between that anode and cathode with the iem functioning as a salt bridge and thereby significantly decreasing the solution resistance fig 12 a meng et al 2019 meng et al 2019 found that the ion exchange membrane reactor can reduce the applied voltage by 75 7 and increase the electrical efficiency per log order reduction ee o by 73 compared with the traditional two dimensional 2 d system in low ionic strength wastewater in addition to utilizing the anode tank to oxidize organics the cathode tank in the ion exchange membrane reactor can be further exploited for example zou et al 2019 utilized the ion exchange membrane reactor with a 3d hexagonal co3o4 array as the anode to oxidize 4 nitrophenol simultaneously achieving the complete oxidation of 4 nitrophenol on the anode and the reduction of co2 into ch3oh and c2h5oh on the cathode although the ion exchange membrane system resolves the problem that traditional electrochemical oxidation systems are ineffective to deal with low ionic strength wastewater to some extent the mass transfer rates still depend almost exclusively on the velocity of solutions or the speed of stirrer 5 2 6 flow anode cell a flow anode system is built on the concepts of the ion exchange membrane and particle reactors described above and involves emplacement of the anode current collector and cathode on either side of a cation exchange membrane and addition of conducting particles to the anode chamber fig 12b xie et al 2021b investigated the oh generation mechanism in a flow anode system using pt mesh as the anode current collector ti mesh as the cathode and tino2n 1 particles as the flow anode and provided evidence that adsorbed oh can be generated at the surface of the tino2n 1 particles and utilized to oxidize organics at applied potentials as low as 1 5 v vs she as a result of enhanced mass transfer carbon black particles have also been used to investigate the direct electron transfer process in flow anode systems with results showing the oxalate removal rate via det oxidation was enhanced by 20 times in the flow anode system at 1 0 v vs ag agcl compared to the control experiment with no carbon black particles present xie et al 2021a this increase in rate of oxidation is presumably a result of the larger surface area available for direct electron transfer and or the increased affinity of the carbon black modified particle suspension for oxalate although the flow anode system exhibits some advantages compared with other electrochemical oxidation systems the optimization of the flow anode reactor and the need for separation of flow anode particles for subsequent reuse should be considered for long term operation and practical application recently xie et al 2022 incorporated an ultrafiltration uf membrane module into the flow anodic oxidation system and achieved the continuous defluorination of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa for 12 days with high efficiency 94 1 although some progress has been achieved in the development and use of flow anode systems considerations should also be given to the h2 and h2o2 production and or no3 co2 reduction at the cathode with the introduction of a flow cathode expected to significantly improve the efficiency of these processes 6 challenges and perspectives the generation of oh in anodic oxidation systems has been recognized as one of the most important ways to treat wastewater here we provide a comprehensive review of anodic oxidation with particular attention given to the identification quantification methods and generation mechanisms of oh and the configurations of anodic oxidation reactors epr quenching tests and uv fluorescence probe methods are usually used to identify oh that are generated in anodic oxidation systems concerns that the inverted spin trapping phenomenon and the forrester hepburn mechanism on application of epr for identification of the presence of oh may lead to a false positive detection of these radicals have been described jing and chaplin 2017 as has the work of pei et al 2020 who showed that the validity of the epr method can be guaranteed by controlling dmpo concentration and trapping time various oh scavengers have been used in anodic oxidation systems but whether tert butanol which is the most widely used oh scavenger reacts with surface bound oh or free oh in bulk solutions is still under debate in addition potassium iodide ki is used extensively as a surface bound oh scavenger but the mechanism of action of ki is unclear clarification of the reaction mechanisms of these oh scavengers is needed if we are to guarantee the validity of experimental results using these reagents furthermore use of uv fluorescence probes for examination of the presence of oh in anodic oxidation systems should be done so with care as most uv fluorescence probes can be oxidized via det processes leading to false detection of oh in this regard terephthalic acid ta is the most appropriate probe of the presence or otherwise of oh due to its high stability with regard to oxidation by det in summary great care should be exercised in choosing appropriate methods to confirm that oh is generated in anodic oxidation systems if the reliability of results is to be assured the quantification of oh that is generated in anodic oxidation systems is a common method to evaluate and compare the electrochemical performance of different anodes the fluorescence intensity of hta which is the product of the reaction between ta and oh has long been recognized as a measure of the rate and amount of oh generated however some recent studies suggest that hta can be further oxidized by oh leading to an underestimation of the amount of oh generated at the surface of anodes with strong oxidizing ability as such this method should be recognized as a means of confirming the production of oh but should not be seen as a reliable quantification method chaplin and colleagues describe a method for calculating the lower bounds of the steady state surface concentration of oh generated in an anodic oxidation system based on the amount of ta removed and recommend this approach as a means of comparing the electrochemical performance of different anodes many studies have been conducted on the oxidation effectiveness and degradation mechanisms of a wide variety of organic compounds on the surface of different anodes while there have only been a few studies dedicated to understanding the oh generation mechanism it is important to understand the oh generation mechanism on particular anode surfaces as this understanding can instruct the design of electrode surface with respect to increasing the current efficiency and enhancing the electrochemical stability of anodes while there are a variety of promising anode materials including bdd ti4o7 sno2 and pbo2 the electrochemical stability of sno2 and pbo2 and the relatively high cost of bdd and ti4o7 still cannot meet the requirements of industrial application as such there is an urgent need to develop cost effective anode materials with high electrochemical performance and stability it should also be recognized that the efficacy of hydroxyl radical generation cannot be used as the only criterion with which to judge the quality of electrode materials for example the bdd electrode is generally recognized as the best anodic oxidation electrode material with the highest oer potential thereby enabling highly effective generation of hydroxyl radicals without the danger of current wastage as a result of o2 evolution however the pbo2 anode shows a higher degradation rate and higher current efficiency for contaminant degradation than the bdd electrode in some cases ansari and nematollahi 2018 guenfoud et al 2014 additionally the sno2 electrode exhibits a lower potential for direct oxidation of p nitrophenol carbamazepine and oxalic acid than is the case for the bdd electrode ferro et al 2010 gurung et al 2018 song et al 2018 zhu et al 2008 therefore the use of an electrode with the specific purpose to efficiently remove or selectively oxidize particular organic pollutants would appear to be an effective and feasible approach such an approach was adopted by tang et al 2018 who prepared a mesoporous sno2 electrode with a molecular imprinted surface and achieved preferential electrochemical degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d due to the selective adsorption of 2 4 d on the molecular imprinted surface of the sno2 electrode mass transfer is typically the rate limiting step of the anodic oxidation process in conventional mixed tank and flow by reactors a flow through configuration has been shown to provide a much higher mass transfer rate compared to a flow by configuration due to the convection enhanced mass transport of compounds to the anode surface other electrochemical systems such as particle electrodes ion exchange membrane and flow anode reactors possess their own advantages and disadvantages and more effort should be paid to understanding the reaction mechanism and mass transport kinetics in these electrochemical systems further optimization of electrochemical reactors is needed to increase the current efficiency and decrease the energy consumption which largely limits the practical application of anodic oxidation systems compared to other traditional wastewater treatment technologies in conclusion a comprehensive overview of the identification quantification methods and generation mechanisms of oh in anodic oxidation systems and the configurations of electrochemical reactors has been presented here the existing problems and the corresponding corrective solutions in the identification and quantification of oh in anodic oxidation systems have been described new insights into the oh generation mechanisms at the surface of anodes have also been summarized furthermore the advantage and disadvantages of anodic oxidation reactors are presented with this information hopefully of use in transferring anodic oxidation from a laboratory based novelty to a realistic cost effective wastewater treatment technology declaration
