eutrophication problem in lake erhai is evaluated to check the performance of the proposed approach the evaluation results were consistent with the real situation when the coefficient p in the membership function is equal to 1 moreover the developed approach is able to i deal with evaluation items with inherent fuzziness and uncertainties ii improve the reliability of evaluation results via mcs and iii raise the tolerance to errors in measured data a global sensitivity analysis indicated that the potassium permanganate index codmn and secchi disc sd are the most sensitive factors in the developed approach finally a range for the coefficient p value in the membership function was recommended graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eutrophication level evaluation topsis method monte carlo simulation lake erhai 1 introduction with rapidly increasing industrial and agricultural production a large amount of wastewater containing nitrogen phosphorus and other nutrients is discharged into lakes reservoirs and rivers eutrophication in lakes is commonly caused by an excessive load of phosphorus and nitrogen ni et al 2013 ni and wang 2015a 2015b wu et al 2018 wu et al 2020 eutrophication significantly impacts the local environment destroying the ecological balance of water bodies threatening the safety of the regional water environment and restricting the sustainable development of the local economy xia et al 2019a 2019b thus the accurate evaluation of lake eutrophication levels is a significant prerequisite for the conservation control of water bodies and safety guaranty of the regional water environment garcía nieto et al 2019 yang et al 2018 moreover an accurate evaluation of lake eutrophication levels can help in determining the optimal water resource management hu et al 2018 khorasani et al 2018 lake eutrophication related to water quality evaluations is regarded as a multi criteria issue involving both qualitative and quantitative uncertainties kurek and ostfeld 2013 yao et al 2019 lin et al 2020a lake eutrophication is a complex process wherein there are numerous factors that combine to impact water quality field data exhibit variations and deviations related to influential factors and the determination of potential factors affecting water quality is uncertain alonso fernández et al 2014 wong and hu 2013 data are an important source for water quality evaluation therefore the reliability and quality of the data are determined using advanced monitored sensors and equipment however in the process of data collection human factors pose negative impacts to data quality castrillo and garcía 2020 du et al 2020 the ambiguities and performance of a model also increase the uncertainty of the evaluation results yang et al 2017 thus it is difficult to establish an efficient model and obtain precise results of the water quality level in a complex water environment in addition in practical water quality evaluation processes models with simple and easy operation characteristics provide a certain convenience to water quality managers under these conditions there are two issues in developing a sufficient water quality evaluation approach first overcoming the errors and human impacts that occur during data collection must be considered second the approach should be developed to be simple and easy to operate for water quality managers hwang and yoon 1981 proposed the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis method which is an effective method in dealing with multi criteria issues here the underlying principle is to choose an alternative wherein the farthest distance exists between the alternative and negative ideal solution nis while the shortest distance exists between the alternative and positive ideal solution pis jahanshahloo et al 2006 li et al 2018 in the process of approach establishment various influencing factors can be regarded as multi criteria in the topsis method meanwhile a monte carlo simulation mcs is an applicable method to deal with the uncertainty and fuzziness of decision making allen 1995 sadeghi et al 2010 mcs is widely applied in various engineering fields including groundwater quality assessment seifi et al 2020 evaluation of uncertain effects on irrigation water supply liu et al 2017 water quality martin and ayesa 2010 and identification of parameters of advanced soil models jin et al 2019 jin and yin 2020 the objective of this study is to establish a robust approach for evaluating lake eutrophication levels based on measured data the developed approach merges the topsis method and mcs to provide a certain convenience for water quality managers in practice a eutrophicated lake lake erhai is used to assess the performance of the proposed approach 2 brief review of existing approaches eutrophication level evaluations are a water quality assessment to reduce the uncertainty or fuzziness associated with the evaluation process and obtain accurate evaluation results numerous models have been developed and proposed these models can be approximately classified into four categories 1 comprehensive evaluation models based on fuzzy set theory and membership functions saaty 1977 lyu et al 2020a proposed a new expert consulting process to determine the fuzzy numbers in ahp zhou et al 2013 constructed a two stage comprehensive evaluation model based on the analytical hierarchy process ahp ai mamun et al 2019 established an assessment model based on the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process vázquez burgos et al 2019 developed a water quality evaluation model based on the ahp note that the fuzzy set theory has been effectively utilised to cope with issues such as great fuzziness and uncertainty in limited data including water quality and flood risk evaluations lyu et al 2019 2020b 2020c however the evaluation results are more subjective li et al 2018 proposed a water quality evaluation model based on topsis but the errors and human factors existing in the data collection were not considered 2 statistical models based on multivariables ying 2005 adopted principal component analysis pca and principal factor analysis methods to identify monitoring stations that exhibit high correlations with water quality the water quality index wqi and trophic level indices tli are also important indicators that are widely applied in evaluating the degree of eutrophication zhang et al 2018 the wqi was developed by the national sanitation foundation nsf in 1965 and has been applied widely ott 1978 bordalo et al 2001 the tli was proposed based on five variables chlorophyll a chl a total nitrogen tn secchi disc sd total phosphorus tp and the potassium permanganate index codmn aizaki et al 1981 fernandes cunha et al 2013 wang et al 2002 3 models based on an experimental method to present chemical and physical processes gooddy et al 2016 proposed a new multi stable isotope model to track biogeochemical reactions in natural ecosystems romanelli et al 2020 utilised a multi stable isotope and biological concept to track the biogeochemical transformations of nitrogen inputs and the fate of nitrate 4 models based on machine learning methods chen et al 2020 xu et al 2020 such as water quality indicator prediction huo et al 2013 ahmed et al 2019 xu et al 2020 wqi estimation ho et al 2019 and the concentration of key factors affecting eutrophication prediction xu et al 2015 castrillo and garcía 2020 these models however have some limitations comprehensive evaluation methods obtain results based primarily on limited data and expert judgement with high subjectivity statistical models attempt to summarise general rules from observed data however unavoidable biases as a result of human factors or measurement errors are inevitably present in the collected data further the selection of techniques in statistical modelling is meticulous liu et al 2014 ahmed et al 2019 moreover a model based on an experimental method is generally a time consuming process regarding models constructed via a machine learning method a large amount of data is needed to train the model and some intelligent models are sensitive to missing and unbalanced data moreover the fuzziness and uncertainty inherent in water quality evaluations are not considered in addition some established machine learning models have low generalisations and are not suitable for some lakes to overcome these limitations this study develops a hybrid approach that integrates the topsis method with mcs to evaluate lake eutrophication levels the advantages of this study lie in the development of a hybrid approach that is capable of i dealing with evaluation items with inherent fuzziness and uncertainties ii assessing the lake eutrophication level based on the observed data and evaluating the sensitivities of influential factors and iii improving the reliability of evaluation results via mcs 3 methodology 3 1 proposed approach framework herein the framework fig 1 mainly consists of three phases data processing executing the topsis method and water quality eutrophication level evaluation phase 1 data processing this phase consists of determining the influential factors of eutrophication and classifying the water quality level tn and tp are the primary factors triggering the occurrence of lake eutrophication because they provide nutrients for algae growth and reproduction ni and wang 2015a 2015b thus excessive loads of nitrogen and phosphorus lead to eutrophication and algal blooms carlson 1977 algae are the main phytoplankton groups in eutrophic lakes and have a strong capacity for photosynthesis the chl a concentration in the water column can display the growth and distribution characteristics of algae aizaki et al 1981 during eutrophication light is necessary for the growth and distribution of aquatic plants which subsequently affects water transparency the sd depth is a measure of water transparency that directly reflects the primary productivity of aquatic plants zou et al 2020 the codmn is adopted to approximately reflect the relative organic matter in the water wang et al 2002 in addition measured data are collected from the annual environmental reports published by the department of ecological environment of yunnan province deeyp 2019 deeyp used five influential factors tp tn codmn chl a and sd to reflect the water quality thus these five factors are represented and were selected as key factors in this research the data collected are in the form of the annual mean concentration of each water quality factor the next step is to conduct initial data pre processing such as sample dataset generation and data normalisation data processing applies the mcs to overcome measurement errors and human factors generating data sample sets the levels of the water quality indicators are determined based on the water quality standards in china mee 1999 2002 and a standard matrix is constructed based on the water quality indicators level the sample datasets generated via mcs and the standard matrix are used to construct the object matrix phase 2 topsis method in the topsis process the weights of influential factors are determined by considering the intercorrelation relationships among the data then a normalised comprehensive object matrix with aggregated weights is constructed the pis and nis are then identified based on the comprehensive object matrix finally the revised closeness of each alternative is calculated in this study topsis is applied to obtain the revised closeness of the alternatives phase 3 water quality evaluation the revised closeness of the alternatives in the object matrix and the coefficient p in the membership function are determined in this phase the membership function is constructed based on certain variables l sc and the coefficient p in this study the mcs is applied to generate sample datasets under this condition the water quality level is assigned based on the distribution of q i a sensitivity analysis is conducted to obtain the most sensitive influential factors then the impacts on the evaluation result are investigated under the different errors of measured data and variations of the coefficient p in the membership function 3 2 monte carlo simulation monte carlo simulation mcs is widely applied to probability analyses in engineering systems allen 1995 sadeghi et al 2010 in mcs random samples and statistical models are employed to estimate the value of mathematical equations and simulate the operation of complex systems the obvious advantage of an mcs is that it increases the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation results through numerous repeated iterations this operation can overcome the impact of data collection and human factor errors in this study we assume the distribution of each parameter water quality indicator to be a normal distribution the corresponding equations are located in the supporting information using 2013 as an example there are five influential factors x 2013 1 x 2013 2 x 2013 3 x 2013 4 and x 2013 5 and 1000 datasets are generated in a normal distribution using mcs 1 c t n c t p c c o d m n c c h l a c s d s 1 x 1 1 m c s x 1 2 m c s x 1 3 m c s x 1 4 m c s x 1 5 m c s s 2 x 2 1 m c s x 2 2 m c s x 2 3 m c s x 2 4 m c

sample data of the jth water quality indicator and the mean of xi j mcs is the measured data of the jth water quality indicator 3 3 topsis method the topsis method is a multi criteria decision making technique used to select the optimal alternatives according to the revised closeness jahanshahloo et al 2006 li et al 2018 these alternatives are evaluated under a set of criteria the topsis method has been widely applied in the field of operation research including optimal schemes and supplier selection wang et al 2009 zhu et al 2020 in this study the topsis method is modified and applied based on the data wherein it is used to obtain the revised closeness before implementing the topsis method the object and standard matrices should be constructed the standard matrix is constructed based on the division of influential factors in this study the water quality levels are classified into five categories with each level denoted as ⅰ ⅱ ⅲ ⅳ and ⅴ wherein a lower level implies better quality thus the standard matrix is given as follows 2 b b c j 5 5 c t n c t p c c o d m n c c h l a c s d i b 1 1 b 1 2 b 1 3 b 1 4 b 1 5 ii b 2 1 b 2 2 b 2 3 b 2 4 b 2 5 iii b 3 1 b 3 2 b 3 3 b 3 4 b 3 5 iv b 4 1 b 4 2 b 4 3 b 4 4 b 4 5 v b 5 1 b 5 2 b 5 3 b 5 4 b 5 5 where i 1 2 5 and j 1 2 5 bi j is the standard concentration of the jth water quality indicator then the object matrix can be constructed based on sample datasets and the standard matrix it is expressed as follows 3 r x i j 6 5 c t n c t p c c o d m n c c h l a c s d x i 1 m c s x i 2 m c s x i 3 m c s x i 4 m c s x i 5 m c s b 1 1 b 1

2 1000 j 1 2 5 the topsis method can be used to obtain the revised closeness q 1 i q b1 i q b2 i q b3 i q b4 i and q b5 i of the object matrix the detailed steps of implementation of the topsis method are provided in the supporting information for methodology 3 3 3 4 membership function and water quality evaluation a membership function is a method of knowledge inference and assesses the fuzziness of the alternatives the maximum value of the membership function is 1 the revised closeness η i membership degree is calculated using the membership function θ c in this study the membership function is constructed based on certain variables l s1 l s2 l s3 l s4 and l s5 and the coefficient p fig 2 presents the membership function in three scenarios p 0 8 1 0 and 1 2 the expression of the membership function is provided in the supporting information for methodology 3 4 eq 4 displays one type of defuzzification method that is applied to transform the fuzzy membership degree of an alternative into a crisp value leekwijck and kerre 1999 the index q i for the ith alternative in the object matrix is expressed in eq 5 the water quality level is determined based on the distribution of the value of index q i table 1 listed the water quality level and its corresponding evaluated index q i 4 t η i c 1 5 c θ c η i c 1 5 θ c η i 5 q i t η i min t η i max t η i min t η i 100 where η i is the revised closeness of each alternative in the object matrix obtained via the topsis method t η i is the defuzzification result of the fuzzy membership degree of alternatives and qi is the evaluation result of the water quality 3 5 global sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis of the influential factors is performed to examine the performance of the system in response to minor changes in the input factors in this study a global sensitivity analysis gsa is used to evaluate parameter uncertainty and check the importance of input variables on the output pianosi and wagener 2015 wagener and pianosi 2019 the pearson correlation coefficient pcc which is a type of gsa is adopted herein to evaluate the importance of the input variables the expression for pcc is given as follows 6 g s a c j i 1 n q i q i x i j x i j i 1 n q i q i 2 i 1 n x i j x i j 2 where gsa c j is the global sensitivity of the jth water quality indicator toward the output qi xi j is the value of the ith sample datasets of the jth water quality indicator x i j is the mean of the datasets and qi and q i are the output and mean of the output respectively the higher the absolute value of gsa c i the more sensitive and stronger the correlation of the jth indicator 3 6 eutrophication evaluation indicators and standards the eutrophication level evaluation problem can be regarded as a water quality evaluation problem as water quality level is a quantitative item that consists of measurable factors the sources of these factors can be classified into physical chemical and biological categories physical factors include light sd and water temperature whereas chemical factors include codmn tp and tn novak and chambers 2014 and biological factors primarily include chl a in 1999 and 2002 the ministry of ecology and environment of china published the environmental quality standard for surface water eqssw in the eqssw the water quality level is classified into five types i ii iii iv and v mee 1999 2002 in 2007 the chinese ministry of water resources published technological regulations for surface water resource quality evaluation trswrqe 2007 is cited here please give a rearragment according to the criteria for evaluating the degree of lake eutrophication five indicators tn tp codmn chl a and sd should be included in the evaluation process the standard concentration value of a water quality indicator is defined for each water quality level and the corresponding eutrophication status is as follows i poor nutrition ii moderate nutrition ⅲ mild eutrophication iv moderate eutrophication and v severe eutrophication each water quality indicator is divided into five levels the threshold ranges of the five indicators with the corresponding water quality levels are listed in table 2 note that the variables l sc are the basic elements of the construction membership function in this study the variables ls 1 ls 2 ls 3 ls 4 and ls 5 are set as 0 05 0 2 0 5 0 8 and 0 95 respectively 4 case study 4 1 study area a case study in lake erhai of the yunnan province was conducted to verify the performance of the developed approach fig 3 shows an overview of the research area the lake erhai watershed lake erhai is located in the dali autonomous prefecture of the bai nationality in the yunnan province wherein it is the second largest freshwater lake lake erhai is an important part of the terrestrial ecosystem playing a fundamental role in various sects of the local environment including ecological environment improvement climate regulation water supply and power generation the extent of the erhai area is approximately 249 4 km2 and the watershed area is nearly 2565 0 km2 the length of lake erhai is 42 5 km from north to south and nearly 8 4 km from west to east ni et al 2011 lin et al 2020 the mier luoshi and yong an river systems which account for nearly 50 of the annual runoff are the main river systems north of the erhai watershed moreover 18 streams flow west of the erhai basin and their water area is approximately 357 12 km2 the xier river south of the watershed is the only natural outflow river from lake erhai 4 2 assessing water quality level the water quality level assessment is considered to be a complex multi criteria decision making problem the observed data provide the materials for constructing the approach the water quality is categorised into five levels according to the value of the index q i as summarised in table 1 the human factors and measurement error impact the quality of the measured data therefore an mcs is employed to reduce the underlying uncertainty in the data collection in this study the measured data of each water quality factor are assumed to form a normal distribution wherein the standard deviation σ i is defined within 5 of the observed data x i because errors within 5 fall within a reasonable range of measurement thus a series of sample datasets x n j mcs x n j mcs x n j mcs x n j mcs and x n j mcs are obtained via mcs each sample dataset is combined with a standard matrix to construct an object matrix eq 3 then each object matrix is employed to obtain the revised closeness η 1 i η b1 i η b2 i η b3 i η b4 i and η b5 i using the topsis method the revised closeness is input to the membership function to obtain q 1 i q b1 i q b2 i q b3 i q b4 i and q b5 i then the q 1 1 q 1 2 q 1 3 q 1 1000 er of each corresponding sample dataset are obtained finally the water quality level is determined based on the distribution of er the coefficient p in the membership function is set to 1 note that the level of the eutrophication degree is sensitive to this coefficient fig 4 shows the scatter plots of the evaluated index q 1 i distribution for the water quality level in 2013 after 1000 iterations the water quality level is determined based on the distribution of the er wherein the highest number of er in one level accounts for the highest brief distribution in fig 4 the evaluated index q 1 i is located in the range of 50 54 this means that all of the evaluated indices q 1 i in 2013 are distributed in a range of 40 60 thus the water quality level in 2013 should be assigned a level iii in some circumstances it is not easy for water quality managers to determine the water quality level based on the distribution of er in fig 4 fig 5 shows the corresponding statistical histogram of the evaluation result over 1000 iterations this statistical histogram is another form of er wherein the water quality level can be determined based on the number of er in each water level fig 5 makes it easy for water quality managers to determine the water quality level using the evaluation result in 2013 as an example the scatter plot has the highest brief distribution in level iii thus it is reasonable to suggest that the water quality level in 2013 should be graded as level iii this is consistent with the real water quality level fig 6 shows the water quality level evaluation results from 2002 to 2013 here the water quality evaluation of each year can be regarded as a case as shown in fig 6 the evaluation results of each year are consistent with the real water quality level published by the deeyp 2019 in general the developed water quality evaluation approach has achieved reliable results a sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the performance of each influencing factor and investigate the relationship between the factor and the target result in this study the pcc is employed using eq 6 after implementing the developed approach there are 1000 pairs of datasets with corresponding evaluation results x i 1 norm mcs x i 2 norm mcs x i 3 norm mcs x i 4 norm mcs and x i 5 norm mcs q 1 1 i 1 1000 these 1000 pairs of datasets can be used to obtain five sets of influential factors x 1 j norm mcs x 2 j norm mcs x 1000 j norm mcs q 1 1 q 1 2 q 1 1000 j 1 5 then a gsa is applied to the aforementioned five sets to evaluate the relative importance of the input variables fig 7 shows the gsa results of five influential factors from 2002 2013 that were obtained under the measured error and human factors on the measured data within 5 in fig 7 the global sensitivities of the five influential factors impacting the water quality level vary in the selected years the factors sd and codmn have higher global sensitivity results the sd has the highest positive correlation with the evaluated index q 1 i while the codmn displays the highest negative correlation the influential factors tn tp and codmn exhibit a negative global sensitivity that is to say that these factors exhibit negative correlations with the water quality evaluation results 5 discussion the aforementioned water quality evaluation results are obtained when the measured errors and human factors on the measured data are within 5 and the coefficient p 1 in the membership function the assumption of different errors on the measured data poses an impact on the evaluated index q 1 i fig 8 presents the evaluated index q 1 i in four different scenarios wherein the measured errors of the measured data are within 5 10 15 and 20 with the increase in measured errors the evaluation result in 2013 becomes more scattered in addition the evaluated index q 1 i is mainly distributed in the range of 40 60 level iii under errors within 20 thus the developed approach has a higher tolerance to errors in the measured data moreover the evaluation results are more concentrated with lower errors providing more ease in water quality level determination thus it is suggested that the error should be controlled within 5 when using the developed approach in addition the value of p is significant to the evaluation results owing to its sensitivity to the membership function thus the impact of the coefficient p on water quality evaluation is discussed in this study p is a constant coefficient that impacts the shape of the membership function thus p can be given a different constant value to examine the output performance wherein each value of p is defined as a scenario using 2013 as an example to conduct the experiment the proposed approach is performed under different values of p in the membership function errors within 5 fig 9 shows the statistical histogram of the water quality level evaluation when the coefficient p is 0 6 0 7 1 7 and 1 8 in this figure p should be set in the range of 0 7 1 7 under this condition the water quality evaluation can achieve desirable results that are consistent with the real water quality level the number of frequencies q 1 i is lower 60 for all of the evaluated results q 1 i in real water quality level level ⅲ when the coefficient p is equal to 0 6 the evaluated water quality level is higher than real situation as the value of p increases especially over 1 7 there is a tendency for the water quality level to change from level ⅲ to level ⅱ in fig 9 the highest belief distribution is slightly transferred from level ⅲ to level ⅱ in addition the number of frequencies in level iii is over 60 for all of the evaluation results q 1 i when the coefficient p is equal to 1 7 meanwhile the number of frequencies in level iii is lower than 60 of all the evaluation results q 1 i when the coefficient p is equal to 1 8 therefore it is suggested that the range of the coefficient p should be determined based on the following condition the number of frequencies in the real water quality level accounts for over 60 of the evaluation result q 1 i note that there are some factors that affect the value of the coefficient p 1 the distribution of datasets generated through the mcs including poisson normal uniform discrete and beta distributions 2 apart from the five influential factors other influencing factors such as ammonia nitrogen nh3 h and biochemical oxygen demand over five days bod5 can affect the coefficient p the topsis method is an effective method to deal with numerous influential factors 3 the division range of influential factors wherein each water quality indicator is classified into five levels in this study 6 conclusions this study developed an approach to evaluate lake eutrophication levels a water quality issue in lake erhai was used as an example to validate the proposed approach the conclusions are summarised as follows 1 the developed approach for water quality evaluation merges the topsis method mcs and the membership function in the process of evaluation the topsis method is utilised to obtain the revised closeness of alternatives meanwhile mcs is employed to produce a variety of normally distributed datasets based on the measured data this process overcomes the limitations of data measurement collection errors and human factors the water quality level is obtained from the statistical distribution of the evaluation results furthermore gsa is used to analyse the correlation between the influential factors and the water quality level the results indicate that codmn and sd are the most sensitive factors to water quality level 2 the developed approach was utilised to study the eutrophication of lake erhai the evaluation results are consistent with the real water quality level when the value of coefficient p is set to 1 in the membership function moreover the developed approach has a higher tolerance to errors in the measured data in practise the coefficient p is provided and the errors should be set within 5 of the measured data in the proposed approach declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

performance of the proposed approach 2 brief review of existing approaches eutrophication level evaluations are a water quality assessment to reduce the uncertainty or fuzziness associated with the evaluation process and obtain accurate evaluation results numerous models have been developed and proposed these models can be approximately classified into four categories 1 comprehensive evaluation models based on fuzzy set theory and membership functions saaty 1977 lyu et al 2020a proposed a new expert consulting process to determine the fuzzy numbers in ahp zhou et al 2013 constructed a two stage comprehensive evaluation model based on the analytical hierarchy process ahp ai mamun et al 2019 established an assessment model based on the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process vázquez burgos et al 2019 developed a water quality evaluation model based on the ahp note that the fuzzy set theory has been effectively utilised to cope with issues such as great fuzziness and uncertainty in limited data including water quality and flood risk evaluations lyu et al 2019 2020b 2020c however the evaluation results are more subjective li et al 2018 proposed a water quality evaluation model based on topsis but the errors and human factors existing in the data collection were not considered 2 statistical models based on multivariables ying 2005 adopted principal component analysis pca and principal factor analysis methods to identify monitoring stations that exhibit high correlations with water quality the water quality index wqi and trophic level indices tli are also important indicators that are widely applied in evaluating the degree of eutrophication zhang et al 2018 the wqi was developed by the national sanitation foundation nsf in 1965 and has been applied widely ott 1978 bordalo et al 2001 the tli was proposed based on five variables chlorophyll a chl a total nitrogen tn secchi disc sd total phosphorus tp and the potassium permanganate index codmn aizaki et al 1981 fernandes cunha et al 2013 wang et al 2002 3 models based on an experimental method to present chemical and physical processes gooddy et al 2016 proposed a new multi stable isotope model to track biogeochemical reactions in natural ecosystems romanelli et al 2020 utilised a multi stable isotope and biological concept to track the biogeochemical transformations of nitrogen inputs and the fate of nitrate 4 models based on machine learning methods chen et al 2020 xu et al 2020 such as water quality indicator prediction huo et al 2013 ahmed et al 2019 xu et al 2020 wqi estimation ho et al 2019 and the concentration of key factors affecting eutrophication prediction xu et al 2015 castrillo and garcía 2020 these models however have some limitations comprehensive evaluation methods obtain results based primarily on limited data and expert judgement with high subjectivity statistical models attempt to summarise general rules from observed data however unavoidable biases as a result of human factors or measurement errors are inevitably present in the collected data further the selection of techniques in statistical modelling is meticulous liu et al 2014 ahmed et al 2019 moreover a model based on an experimental method is generally a time consuming process regarding models constructed via a machine learning method a large amount of data is needed to train the model and some intelligent models are sensitive to missing and unbalanced data moreover the fuzziness and uncertainty inherent in water quality evaluations are not considered in addition some established machine learning models have low generalisations and are not suitable for some lakes to overcome these limitations this study develops a hybrid approach that integrates the topsis method with mcs to evaluate lake eutrophication levels the advantages of this study lie in the development of a hybrid approach that is capable of i dealing with evaluation items with inherent fuzziness and uncertainties ii assessing the lake eutrophication level based on the observed data and evaluating the sensitivities of influential factors and iii improving the reliability of evaluation results via mcs 3 methodology 3 1 proposed approach framework herein the framework fig 1 mainly consists of three phases data processing executing the topsis method and water quality eutrophication level evaluation phase 1 data processing this phase consists of determining the influential factors of eutrophication and classifying the water quality level tn and tp are the primary factors triggering the occurrence of lake eutrophication because they provide nutrients for algae growth and reproduction ni and wang 2015a 2015b thus excessive loads of nitrogen and phosphorus lead to eutrophication and algal blooms carlson 1977 algae are the main phytoplankton groups in eutrophic lakes and have a strong capacity for photosynthesis the chl a concentration in the water column can display the growth and distribution characteristics of algae aizaki et al 1981 during eutrophication light is necessary for the growth and distribution of aquatic plants which subsequently affects water transparency the sd depth is a measure of water transparency that directly reflects the primary productivity of aquatic plants zou et al 2020 the codmn is adopted to approximately reflect the relative organic matter in the water wang et al 2002 in addition measured data are collected from the annual environmental reports published by the department of ecological environment of yunnan province deeyp 2019 deeyp used five influential factors tp tn codmn chl a and sd to reflect the water quality thus these five factors are represented and were selected as key factors in this research the data collected are in the form of the annual mean concentration of each water quality factor the next step is to conduct initial data pre processing such as sample dataset generation and data normalisation data processing applies the mcs to overcome measurement errors and human factors generating data sample sets the levels of the water quality indicators are determined based on the water quality standards in china mee 1999 2002 and a standard matrix is constructed based on the water quality indicators level the sample datasets generated via mcs and the standard matrix are used to construct the object matrix phase 2 topsis method in the topsis process the weights of influential factors are determined by considering the intercorrelation relationships among the data then a normalised comprehensive object matrix with aggregated weights is constructed the pis and nis are then identified based on the comprehensive object matrix finally the revised closeness of each alternative is calculated in this study topsis is applied to obtain the revised closeness of the alternatives phase 3 water quality evaluation the revised closeness of the alternatives in the object matrix and the coefficient p in the membership function are determined in this phase the membership function is constructed based on certain variables l sc and the coefficient p in this study the mcs is applied to generate sample datasets under this condition the water quality level is assigned based on the distribution of q i a sensitivity analysis is conducted to obtain the most sensitive influential factors then the impacts on the evaluation result are investigated under the different errors of measured data and variations of the coefficient p in the membership function 3 2 monte carlo simulation monte carlo simulation mcs is widely applied to probability analyses in engineering systems allen 1995 sadeghi et al 2010 in mcs random samples and statistical models are employed to estimate the value of mathematical equations and simulate the operation of complex systems the obvious advantage of an mcs is that it increases the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation results through numerous repeated iterations this operation can overcome the impact of data collection and human factor errors in this study we assume the distribution of each parameter water quality indicator to be a normal distribution the corresponding equations are located in the supporting information using 2013 as an example there are five influential factors x 2013 1 x 2013 2 x 2013 3 x 2013 4 and x 2013 5 and 1000 datasets are generated in a normal distribution using mcs 1 c t n c t p c c o d m n c c h l a c s d s 1 x 1 1 m c s x 1 2 m c s x 1 3 m c s x 1 4 m c s x 1 5 m c s s 2 x 2 1 m c s x 2 2 m c s x 2 3 m c s x 2 4 m c

sample data of the jth water quality indicator and the mean of xi j mcs is the measured data of the jth water quality indicator 3 3 topsis method the topsis method is a multi criteria decision making technique used to select the optimal alternatives according to the revised closeness jahanshahloo et al 2006 li et al 2018 these alternatives are evaluated under a set of criteria the topsis method has been widely applied in the field of operation research including optimal schemes and supplier selection wang et al 2009 zhu et al 2020 in this study the topsis method is modified and applied based on the data wherein it is used to obtain the revised closeness before implementing the topsis method the object and standard matrices should be constructed the standard matrix is constructed based on the division of influential factors in this study the water quality levels are classified into five categories with each level denoted as ⅰ ⅱ ⅲ ⅳ and ⅴ wherein a lower level implies better quality thus the standard matrix is given as follows 2 b b c j 5 5 c t n c t p c c o d m n c c h l a c s d i b 1 1 b 1 2 b 1 3 b 1 4 b 1 5 ii b 2 1 b 2 2 b 2 3 b 2 4 b 2 5 iii b 3 1 b 3 2 b 3 3 b 3 4 b 3 5 iv b 4 1 b 4 2 b 4 3 b 4 4 b 4 5 v b 5 1 b 5 2 b 5 3 b 5 4 b 5 5 where i 1 2 5 and j 1 2 5 bi j is the standard concentration of the jth water quality indicator then the object matrix can be constructed based on sample datasets and the standard matrix it is expressed as follows 3 r x i j 6 5 c t n c t p c c o d m n c c h l a c s d x i 1 m c s x i 2 m c s x i 3 m c s x i 4 m c s x i 5 m c s b 1 1 b 1

2 1000 j 1 2 5 the topsis method can be used to obtain the revised closeness q 1 i q b1 i q b2 i q b3 i q b4 i and q b5 i of the object matrix the detailed steps of implementation of the topsis method are provided in the supporting information for methodology 3 3 3 4 membership function and water quality evaluation a membership function is a method of knowledge inference and assesses the fuzziness of the alternatives the maximum value of the membership function is 1 the revised closeness η i membership degree is calculated using the membership function θ c in this study the membership function is constructed based on certain variables l s1 l s2 l s3 l s4 and l s5 and the coefficient p fig 2 presents the membership function in three scenarios p 0 8 1 0 and 1 2 the expression of the membership function is provided in the supporting information for methodology 3 4 eq 4 displays one type of defuzzification method that is applied to transform the fuzzy membership degree of an alternative into a crisp value leekwijck and kerre 1999 the index q i for the ith alternative in the object matrix is expressed in eq 5 the water quality level is determined based on the distribution of the value of index q i table 1 listed the water quality level and its corresponding evaluated index q i 4 t η i c 1 5 c θ c η i c 1 5 θ c η i 5 q i t η i min t η i max t η i min t η i 100 where η i is the revised closeness of each alternative in the object matrix obtained via the topsis method t η i is the defuzzification result of the fuzzy membership degree of alternatives and qi is the evaluation result of the water quality 3 5 global sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis of the influential factors is performed to examine the performance of the system in response to minor changes in the input factors in this study a global sensitivity analysis gsa is used to evaluate parameter uncertainty and check the importance of input variables on the output pianosi and wagener 2015 wagener and pianosi 2019 the pearson correlation coefficient pcc which is a type of gsa is adopted herein to evaluate the importance of the input variables the expression for pcc is given as follows 6 g s a c j i 1 n q i q i x i j x i j i 1 n q i q i 2 i 1 n x i j x i j 2 where gsa c j is the global sensitivity of the jth water quality indicator toward the output qi xi j is the value of the ith sample datasets of the jth water quality indicator x i j is the mean of the datasets and qi and q i are the output and mean of the output respectively the higher the absolute value of gsa c i the more sensitive and stronger the correlation of the jth indicator 3 6 eutrophication evaluation indicators and standards the eutrophication level evaluation problem can be regarded as a water quality evaluation problem as water quality level is a quantitative item that consists of measurable factors the sources of these factors can be classified into physical chemical and biological categories physical factors include light sd and water temperature whereas chemical factors include codmn tp and tn novak and chambers 2014 and biological factors primarily include chl a in 1999 and 2002 the ministry of ecology and environment of china published the environmental quality standard for surface water eqssw in the eqssw the water quality level is classified into five types i ii iii iv and v mee 1999 2002 in 2007 the chinese ministry of water resources published technological regulations for surface water resource quality evaluation trswrqe 2007 is cited here please give a rearragment according to the criteria for evaluating the degree of lake eutrophication five indicators tn tp codmn chl a and sd should be included in the evaluation process the standard concentration value of a water quality indicator is defined for each water quality level and the corresponding eutrophication status is as follows i poor nutrition ii moderate nutrition ⅲ mild eutrophication iv moderate eutrophication and v severe eutrophication each water quality indicator is divided into five levels the threshold ranges of the five indicators with the corresponding water quality levels are listed in table 2 note that the variables l sc are the basic elements of the construction membership function in this study the variables ls 1 ls 2 ls 3 ls 4 and ls 5 are set as 0 05 0 2 0 5 0 8 and 0 95 respectively 4 case study 4 1 study area a case study in lake erhai of the yunnan province was conducted to verify the performance of the developed approach fig 3 shows an overview of the research area the lake erhai watershed lake erhai is located in the dali autonomous prefecture of the bai nationality in the yunnan province wherein it is the second largest freshwater lake lake erhai is an important part of the terrestrial ecosystem playing a fundamental role in various sects of the local environment including ecological environment improvement climate regulation water supply and power generation the extent of the erhai area is approximately 249 4 km2 and the watershed area is nearly 2565 0 km2 the length of lake erhai is 42 5 km from north to south and nearly 8 4 km from west to east ni et al 2011 lin et al 2020 the mier luoshi and yong an river systems which account for nearly 50 of the annual runoff are the main river systems north of the erhai watershed moreover 18 streams flow west of the erhai basin and their water area is approximately 357 12 km2 the xier river south of the watershed is the only natural outflow river from lake erhai 4 2 assessing water quality level the water quality level assessment is considered to be a complex multi criteria decision making problem the observed data provide the materials for constructing the approach the water quality is categorised into five levels according to the value of the index q i as summarised in table 1 the human factors and measurement error impact the quality of the measured data therefore an mcs is employed to reduce the underlying uncertainty in the data collection in this study the measured data of each water quality factor are assumed to form a normal distribution wherein the standard deviation σ i is defined within 5 of the observed data x i because errors within 5 fall within a reasonable range of measurement thus a series of sample datasets x n j mcs x n j mcs x n j mcs x n j mcs and x n j mcs are obtained via mcs each sample dataset is combined with a standard matrix to construct an object matrix eq 3 then each object matrix is employed to obtain the revised closeness η 1 i η b1 i η b2 i η b3 i η b4 i and η b5 i using the topsis method the revised closeness is input to the membership function to obtain q 1 i q b1 i q b2 i q b3 i q b4 i and q b5 i then the q 1 1 q 1 2 q 1 3 q 1 1000 er of each corresponding sample dataset are obtained finally the water quality level is determined based on the distribution of er the coefficient p in the membership function is set to 1 note that the level of the eutrophication degree is sensitive to this coefficient fig 4 shows the scatter plots of the evaluated index q 1 i distribution for the water quality level in 2013 after 1000 iterations the water quality level is determined based on the distribution of the er wherein the highest number of er in one level accounts for the highest brief distribution in fig 4 the evaluated index q 1 i is located in the range of 50 54 this means that all of the evaluated indices q 1 i in 2013 are distributed in a range of 40 60 thus the water quality level in 2013 should be assigned a level iii in some circumstances it is not easy for water quality managers to determine the water quality level based on the distribution of er in fig 4 fig 5 shows the corresponding statistical histogram of the evaluation result over 1000 iterations this statistical histogram is another form of er wherein the water quality level can be determined based on the number of er in each water level fig 5 makes it easy for water quality managers to determine the water quality level using the evaluation result in 2013 as an example the scatter plot has the highest brief distribution in level iii thus it is reasonable to suggest that the water quality level in 2013 should be graded as level iii this is consistent with the real water quality level fig 6 shows the water quality level evaluation results from 2002 to 2013 here the water quality evaluation of each year can be regarded as a case as shown in fig 6 the evaluation results of each year are consistent with the real water quality level published by the deeyp 2019 in general the developed water quality evaluation approach has achieved reliable results a sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the performance of each influencing factor and investigate the relationship between the factor and the target result in this study the pcc is employed using eq 6 after implementing the developed approach there are 1000 pairs of datasets with corresponding evaluation results x i 1 norm mcs x i 2 norm mcs x i 3 norm mcs x i 4 norm mcs and x i 5 norm mcs q 1 1 i 1 1000 these 1000 pairs of datasets can be used to obtain five sets of influential factors x 1 j norm mcs x 2 j norm mcs x 1000 j norm mcs q 1 1 q 1 2 q 1 1000 j 1 5 then a gsa is applied to the aforementioned five sets to evaluate the relative importance of the input variables fig 7 shows the gsa results of five influential factors from 2002 2013 that were obtained under the measured error and human factors on the measured data within 5 in fig 7 the global sensitivities of the five influential factors impacting the water quality level vary in the selected years the factors sd and codmn have higher global sensitivity results the sd has the highest positive correlation with the evaluated index q 1 i while the codmn displays the highest negative correlation the influential factors tn tp and codmn exhibit a negative global sensitivity that is to say that these factors exhibit negative correlations with the water quality evaluation results 5 discussion the aforementioned water quality evaluation results are obtained when the measured errors and human factors on the measured data are within 5 and the coefficient p 1 in the membership function the assumption of different errors on the measured data poses an impact on the evaluated index q 1 i fig 8 presents the evaluated index q 1 i in four different scenarios wherein the measured errors of the measured data are within 5 10 15 and 20 with the increase in measured errors the evaluation result in 2013 becomes more scattered in addition the evaluated index q 1 i is mainly distributed in the range of 40 60 level iii under errors within 20 thus the developed approach has a higher tolerance to errors in the measured data moreover the evaluation results are more concentrated with lower errors providing more ease in water quality level determination thus it is suggested that the error should be controlled within 5 when using the developed approach in addition the value of p is significant to the evaluation results owing to its sensitivity to the membership function thus the impact of the coefficient p on water quality evaluation is discussed in this study p is a constant coefficient that impacts the shape of the membership function thus p can be given a different constant value to examine the output performance wherein each value of p is defined as a scenario using 2013 as an example to conduct the experiment the proposed approach is performed under different values of p in the membership function errors within 5 fig 9 shows the statistical histogram of the water quality level evaluation when the coefficient p is 0 6 0 7 1 7 and 1 8 in this figure p should be set in the range of 0 7 1 7 under this condition the water quality evaluation can achieve desirable results that are consistent with the real water quality level the number of frequencies q 1 i is lower 60 for all of the evaluated results q 1 i in real water quality level level ⅲ when the coefficient p is equal to 0 6 the evaluated water quality level is higher than real situation as the value of p increases especially over 1 7 there is a tendency for the water quality level to change from level ⅲ to level ⅱ in fig 9 the highest belief distribution is slightly transferred from level ⅲ to level ⅱ in addition the number of frequencies in level iii is over 60 for all of the evaluation results q 1 i when the coefficient p is equal to 1 7 meanwhile the number of frequencies in level iii is lower than 60 of all the evaluation results q 1 i when the coefficient p is equal to 1 8 therefore it is suggested that the range of the coefficient p should be determined based on the following condition the number of frequencies in the real water quality level accounts for over 60 of the evaluation result q 1 i note that there are some factors that affect the value of the coefficient p 1 the distribution of datasets generated through the mcs including poisson normal uniform discrete and beta distributions 2 apart from the five influential factors other influencing factors such as ammonia nitrogen nh3 h and biochemical oxygen demand over five days bod5 can affect the coefficient p the topsis method is an effective method to deal with numerous influential factors 3 the division range of influential factors wherein each water quality indicator is classified into five levels in this study 6 conclusions this study developed an approach to evaluate lake eutrophication levels a water quality issue in lake erhai was used as an example to validate the proposed approach the conclusions are summarised as follows 1 the developed approach for water quality evaluation merges the topsis method mcs and the membership function in the process of evaluation the topsis method is utilised to obtain the revised closeness of alternatives meanwhile mcs is employed to produce a variety of normally distributed datasets based on the measured data this process overcomes the limitations of data measurement collection errors and human factors the water quality level is obtained from the statistical distribution of the evaluation results furthermore gsa is used to analyse the correlation between the influential factors and the water quality level the results indicate that codmn and sd are the most sensitive factors to water quality level 2 the developed approach was utilised to study the eutrophication of lake erhai the evaluation results are consistent with the real water quality level when the value of coefficient p is set to 1 in the membership function moreover the developed approach has a higher tolerance to errors in the measured data in practise the coefficient p is provided and the errors should be set within 5 of the measured data in the proposed approach declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

17491,fluorescence spectroscopy has been suggested as a promising online monitoring technique in water and wastewater treatment processes due to its high sensitivity and selectivity however a pre filtration is still indispensable in fluorescence measurement for removing ubiquitous particles and flocs in real samples to eliminate the strong light scattering that could attenuate fluorescence detection significantly this study proposed a front face fluorescence spectroscopy which could characterize the liquid sample with suspended solids directly without pre filtration front face excitation emission matrix ff eem coupled with parallel factor parafac analysis was used for analyzing fluorescence components and to probe coagulation of secondary effluent and fouling in the subsequent ultrafiltration uf and conventional right angle fluorescence eem ra eem was also compared the results showed that ff eem was less susceptible to turbidity induced by standard particles in the secondary effluent compared to ra eem ff eem could successfully measure dissolved fluorophores in coagulated suspension without pre filtration while conventional ra eem was undermined significantly due to the existing flocs ff eem coupled with parafac could accurately probe dissolved organic matter and fouling in coagulation uf wastewater reclamation processes therefore it was demonstrated that this front face fluorescence without any sample preparation step might be highly promising in real time online fluorescence monitoring in multi water and wastewater treatment processes graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords front face fluorescence excitation emission matrix parafac online monitoring wastewater reclamation 1 introduction real time online monitoring is always of importance for surveillance of source and treated water as well as the operational status of water and wastewater treatment processes carstea et al 2016 henderson et al 2009 li et al 2016 wu et al 2019 spectroscopy based methods especially absorbance and fluorescence are quite suitable for online monitoring because they are fast inexpensive reagentless and require little sample preparation aftab et al 2020 li et al 2016 maqbool et al 2020 roccaro et al 2015 xiao et al 2019 fluorescence excitation emission matrix is extremely sensitive and highly informative compared to absorbance spectra therefore online monitoring based on fluorescence spectra has experienced enormous development in recent years carstea et al 2016 henderson et al 2009 shutova et al 2014 particles and flocs are ubiquitous in drinking water or wastewater treatment processes they will induce strong light scattering or light absorption which could attenuate fluorescence intensively durkin et al 1994 müller et al 2001 while fluorescence detection is quite fast and easy a pre filtration to remove this turbidity is still indispensable this single step pre filtration could make real time online fluorescence monitoring unsustainable and even impractical thus the fluorescence technique that could characterize turbid samples is still necessitated for more effective real time online fluorescence monitoring conventional right angle fluorescence spectroscopy is used for characterizing diluted and transparent samples and is ineffective in analyzing original samples with turbidity or even opaque from water treatment processes fig 1 a the front face fluorescence is more suitable for this scenario in front face fluorescence detection the incident angle angle formed between the excitation beam and the perpendicular to the illuminated surface of the cell is normally 30 to 60 while this angle in conventional right angle fluorescence is always 0 the emitted radiation is detected from the same cell face as excitation beam incidence and thus it is called front face fluorescence fig 1b the front face fluorescence measurement would pertain around only the surface of a sample and thus could significantly mitigate the impacts of light absorption scattering reflection or shielding on fluorescence detection airado rodríguez et al 2011 lakowicz 2013 more detailed theory and the emission function for right angle fluorescence and front face fluorescence can be found in si this means front face fluorescence measurement may not need any sample preparation which is perfectly suitable for real time online and non destructive detection and monitoring with this merit front face fluorescence has been widely used for characterizing turbid or opaque samples like yogurt miquel becker et al 2003 wine sádecká et al 2009 milk schamberger and labuza 2006 honey karoui et al 2007 and even solid surface like different meat allais et al 2004 karoui et al 2006 this front face fluorescence was also applied to translucent edible oil and protein in water oil emulsion and transparent tryptophan riboflavin or nadh solution samples bevilacqua et al 2020 castelain and genot 1996 valderrama et al 2011 zandomeneghi et al 2005 thus it is considered that it is broadly applicable besides its major application in food chemistry front face fluorescence has also been applied to water treatment for probing membrane surface to illustrate membrane fouling ding et al 2020 yamamura et al 2019 yu et al 2019 however to the utmost knowledge of authors its potential for analyzing turbid liquid samples in water and wastewater treatment processes has never been reported reuse and recycling of secondary effluent has been widely employed in the world wide to lift water source restriction fluorescence monitoring has been investigated as a monitoring tool for performance assessment and early warning of contamination events carstea et al 2016 henderson et al 2009 particles and flocs commonly existing in the wastewater recycling processes like coagulation and membrane filtration could induce strong light scattering in fluorescence measurement it is realized that direct characterizing fluorescence in wastewater recycling processes by using front face fluorescence spectroscopy without sample preparation may be able to diminish the impact of light scattering on fluorescence detection and thus enable a valid real time online monitoring therefore this study attempted to investigate the feasibility of using front face fluorescence to characterize dissolved organic matters in flocculated suspension in aluminum and ferric coagulations of wastewater secondary effluent and to predict fouling in the subsequent ultrafiltration uf front face fluorescence and conventional right angle fluorescence were compared in terms of characterizing turbid samples with floc and clear samples without floc after pre filtration excitation emission matrix eem for both front face and right angle fluorescence were obtained and parallel factor parafac analysis was employed to decompose fluorescence components the correlations between front face fluorescence components and other water quality indices as well as membrane fouling index mfi were established in order to examine the feasibility of using front face fluorescence to probe coagulation efficacy and to predict fouling in subsequent ultrafiltration uf 2 material and methods 2 1 secondary effluent a grab sample of secondary effluent was collected from the wenchang wastewater treatment plant harbin china this wastewater treatment plant uses activated sludge processes anaerobic anoxic oxic the effluent from secondary sedimentation tank was collected and transport to our lab within 2 hours and stored at 4 c before use the dissolved organic carbon doc in the secondary effluent was 5 676 0 008 mg l and uv254 of the sample was 0 116 0 007 cm 1 with ph value of 7 21 0 12 the alkalinity of the sample was 138 mg l as caco3 and the electric conductivity was 762 μs cm 2 2 preparation of suspended solution with standard particle in order to investigate the effects of suspended solids on ff eem and ra eem detections a standard particle silicon dioxide sio2 0 5 10 μm was added into the secondary effluent samples to different turbidities i e 10 ntu 20 ntu 30 ntu 50 ntu 100 ntu fluorescence of secondary effluent samples with different turbidities was measured using conventional right angle fluorescence and front face fluorescence 2 3 coagulation tests two sets of coagulation tests were conducted using 1l secondary effluent sample with aluminum sulfate and ferric chloride aladin shanghai china at different concentrations respectively this experiment was carried out in a six jar tester my3000 6m meiyu wuhan china stock solutions of aluminum sulfate 2 g l and ferric chloride 5 g l were first made respectively then aluminum sulfate or ferric chloride was added into 1l of secondary effluent at concentrations of 10 20 30 40 50 60 mg l respectively the coagulant concentrations used here are commonly adopted in the relevant studies and a comparison could be found in table s1 in si the coagulation reaction was conducted by stirring secondary effluent with coagulant dosed at 200 r min for 1 min then at a middle speed of 120 r min for 5 min and then to 60 r min for 10 min the corresponding g values at these three mixing speeds were 138 8 s 1 64 5 s 1 and 22 8 s 1 the mixing speed and the g value are comparable to other studies as summarized in table s1 two slow mixing speeds 120 r min for 5 min and 60 r min for 10 min were used in this work since this mixing program may speed up flocculation while preventing from floc breakage right after the coagulation steps suspension samples were collected and directly subjected to eem turbidity absorbance and floc size measurements another set of samples were also collected and filtered using 0 45 μm syringe filter with cellulose acetate membrane and then subjected to eem doc uv254 and zeta potential measurements all measurements are triplicated and average and deviation are shown in final results 2 4 eem measurement both conventional right angle eem ra eem and front face eem ff eem were adopted to characterize unfiltered with floc and filtered without floc samples ra eem was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f7000 hitachi japan at room temperature 23 1 c conventional sample holder and 1 cm quartz cuvette were used and the sample geometry is shown in fig 1a excitation ex light was set to 250 450 nm at an interval of 5 nm and emission em light was detected in the range of 250 550 nm at an interval of 1 nm the ex and em slit widths were both 5 nm the photomultiplier tube pmt voltage was 700 v a scanning speed of 30 000 nm min was adopted to avoid too much precipitation of coagulation flocs during the eem measurement it took 105 seconds for an eem measurement settling times of suspended solution in different coagulation tests could be found in table s2 and the turbidity and uv254 change after 105 seconds of each sample were also measured the effect of floc settlement on the ra eem may be less than 6 except for 60 mg l fecl3 coagulation 11 59 and the influence on the ff eem would be even less detailed data and analysis could be found in si in ff eem measurement a front face sample holder p n 650 0616 hitachi was used and the sample geometry is shown in fig 1 b fig s2 and s3 the same 1 cm cuvette was used but the ex and em light paths in ff eem are quite different from those in ra eem the em light was detected from the front side of the cuvette the same side as the ex beam incidence this geometry could decrease the impact of sample turbidity or color the light absorption in order to decrease the reflected light that enters into the emission monochromator the incident angle was 30 degrees and the upper surface was inclined to 10 degrees fig 1 and fig s3 which could remove the specular reflection light from the sample three dimensionally the optimization of the incident angle and inclined angle can be found on the website of hitachi https www hitachi hightech com file global products science appli ana fl solid fl 120005 pdf it was also included in the si as an appendix except for the sample geometry all the other parameters in ff eem measurement were the same as those in the ra eem measurement above typical eem contour plots of a secondary effluent sample measured by conventional ra eem and ff eem are also shown in fig 1 c and d ff eem and ra eem showed a very similar fluorescence peak pattern but fluorescence intensity in ra eem was a little bit higher than that in ff eem this could be attributed to the less reflection of ex in the ra eem geometry lakowicz 2013 the raman scattering was eliminated by subtracting eem of pure water ryleigh scattering was cut from the eems and zeros were inserted at ryleigh scattering position inner filter effect of ra eem without floc was corrected by using dreem toolbox http openfluor weebly com dreem html in matlab 2014a mathworks inc natick ma and spectral absorbance in the range of 250 nm to 550 nm recorded for each sample t6 puxi beijing parafac was used to decompose fluorescence components in the eems the eems obtained by ff eem and ra eem were assigned into two datasets respectively for parafac analyses each dataset included 78 eems parafac modeling was conducted according to the tutorial published by murphy et al 2013 using matlab with dreem toolbox 2 5 uf experiments uf tests were conducted using secondary effluent sample and samples after coagulation as feedwater respectively uf was performed using a dead end filtration cell as previously described yu et al 2019 a schematic diagram can be found in fig s4 in supporting information briefly a 20 ml filtration cell was continuously fed by a 1 l glass reservoir the uf tests were conducted in constant flux mode and flux was controlled at 240 l m2h using a peristaltic pump bt 100 2j longer precision pump co ltd baoding china a polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf uf membrane 100 kda tianchuang china with an

according to tmp profiles to quantitatively assess membrane fouling boerlage et al 2004 sim et al 2011 the mfi was calculated by using equation as follows mfi μ i 2 δ p 0 a 2 where μ is the viscosity of feed solution i is resistivity obtained from the slope of tmp against time filtration curve p0 refers to the standard pressure of 0 2 mpa and a is an effective filtration membrane area 2 6 other analytical methods doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer multi n c 2100s analytic jena germany uv254 was measured using a spectrophotometer t6 puxi beijing turbidity 2100n hach usa

statistical analysis the principal component analysis pca and linear regression were conducted to investigate the correlation between eem parafac components in ff eem with floc and in ra eem without floc as well as other indices i e doc uv254 turbidity floc size and mfi a pca biplot was developed which shows a score plot of samples and a loading plot of indices the pca was performed on an average of replicates for all indices linear regressions between ff eem components ra eem components and other indices were conducted and the r square values are presented in the form of heat map all the statistical analyses were performed using origin software 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of turbidity on ff eem and ra eem fluorescence of turbid samples made with standard suspended solids was measured using ff eem and ra eem as shown in fig 2 as suspended solids increased fluorescence detected by using ra eem was remarkably attenuated while fluorescence intensity detected by ff eem decreased by no more than 7 60 until turbidity reached 50 ntu detailed data could be found in table s3 in si ra eem was more susceptible to turbidity compared to ff eem it is considered that the fluorescence attenuation in both ra eem and ff eem would be attributed to the light absorption or light shelter by the suspended particle added which could be evaluated by spectral absorbance measurement the absorbance of each sample could be found in fig s5 in si and a function describing the relationship between absorbance and fluorescence could be found in eq 1 in si ra eem was more affected because the optical path length in the ra eem 0 5 cm would be much longer than in ff eem bevilacqua et al 2020 the optical path length in the ff eem detection of these standard turbid samples was estimated to be 0 0418 with r2 0 9125 by using modeling detailed in si with this optical path length obtained an absorbance limitation of 0 59 cm 1 for valid ff eem measurement could be achieved the calculation could be found in si thus the mild effect of suspended solids on the ff eems with turbidity not higher than 50 ntu could be explained by their relatively low absorbance 0 59 cm 1 as shown in fig s5 in another case the opaque sample like milk and yogurt would have much higher absorbance but they were still successfully subjected to the ff eem analysis miquel becker et al 2003 schamberger and labuza 2006 this could be attributed to the extremely high fluorophores majorly proteins content in these samples and even shorter optical path length in this case as shown in fig s1 3 2 characterization of coagulated suspension using ff eem and ra eem it has been indicated that the ff eem could be used to characterize dissolved organic matter with the presence of standard particles absorbance 0 59 cm 1 the ff eem was further applied in the analysis of secondary effluent coagulation turbidity and floc size of the coagulated suspension samples were first measured as shown in fig 3 turbidity increased with increasing coagulant dosage while floc size changed inconsistently with increasing coagulant dosage the floc size increased with increasing coagulant dosage when the dosage was lower than 20 mg l majorly due to the compressed electrical double layer while coagulant dosage exceeded 20 mg l charge reversal and complete surface coverage might occur which would result in the restabilization and inefficacy coagulation and thus the floc size kept steady or decreased a little bit at these coagulant dosages the floc size increased sharply again with 60 mg l fecl3 this could be explained by the sweep mechanism or precipitant enmeshment metal coagulants in aqueous solution form metal hydroxide precipitates which could serve to enmesh particulate material thus affecting destabilization essentially by a sweep action bratby 2016 ph in the coagulation tests did not change significantly this may be attributed to the relatively high alkalinity due to the sodium bicarbonate dosed in anaerobic tank for denitrification in the wastewater treatment plant the alkalinity consumption of 60 mg l al2 so4 3 and 60 mg l fecl3 can be calculated to be 52 62 mg l as caco3 and 55 38 mg l as caco3 respectively bratby 2016 which are lower than the alkalinity in the secondary effluent 138 mg l as caco3 it could be found that the turbidity of coagulated samples was around 5 to 20 ntu with floc size around 200 to 1000 μm which might induce significant light scattering and thus attenuate fluorescence detection the size of suspended solids in the coagulated sample was much bigger than standard particle used in the turbidity test in fig 2 silica dioxide in bigger size was not adopted in the turbidity test due to its fast sinking which could not form a relatively stable suspended solution for eem measurement fluorescence eems of secondary effluent coagulated with different al2 so4 3 dosages were characterized by using ra eem and ff eem directly i e with floc or after pre filtration i e without floc as shown in fig 4 a and b the fluorescence detected by ra eem without floc decreased with increasing coagulant dosage since more the fluorophores in the secondary effluent were adsorbed by the coagulant with increasing coagulant dosage the fluorescence change due to the adsorption could be calculated by subtracting eem w o floc from the eem of raw water as shown in fig 4 d the fluorescence drop resulted from the fluorophore removal or adsorption by coagulant increased with increasing coagulant dosage it was also found that the flocs that may aggregate a lot of fluorophores showed almost no fluorescence this might be attributed to the complexes formed by coagulant metal and fluorescence organics in the flocs could quench the fluorophores cheng and chi 2002 the decreasing rates of fluorescence intensities in ra eem without floc and in ra eem with floc were not consistent fig 4 c shows the differential eem between ra eem with floc and ra eem without floc the differential eem intensity increased with increasing coagulant dosage which indicated the flocs attenuated fluorescence detected by ra eem the floc could impact fluorescence measurement through light absorption scattering or even sheltering spectral absorbance could measure all these effects the absorbance of each sample in fig 4 could be found in fig s8 in si absorbance data of both samples with and without floc exceeded the critical value of 0 05 cm 1 for ra eem but did not reach the critical absorbance of 0 59 cm 1 for ff eem the effect of absorbance on the fluorescence detection in ra geometry and ff geometry is shown in fig s9 in si ra eem was attenuated significantly by the suspensions while the ff eem was mildly influenced the eems measured with and without floc by using ff eem in fig 4 e and f were quite similar with p values all higher than 0 05 in anova of peak intensities in ff eem with and without floc detailed data could be found in table s4 as shown in fig 4g the differential eem between these two sets of eems were approximate to zero these results are consistent with the fluorescence attenuation factor calculated in fig s9 the fluorescence decrease in ff eem due to the removal of fluorophores in the coagulation was calculated and shown in fig 4h this result indicated the ff eem with floc would be affected by only the effluent dom removed by coagulation while ra eem with floc would influence by both the flocs existing and the dom removal this implies the priority of ff eem over ra eem in characterizing sample with suspended solids eems for ferric coagulation fig s7 in si also indicated the flocs attenuated ra eem substantially while almost no difference was found when analyzing with and without floc using ff eem it should be noted that the dissolved ferric ion and aluminum ion remained in the coagulated samples was quite low table s5 in si which would not induce a fluorescence quenching poulin et al 2014 yan et al 2013 the fluorescence components in the eems were decomposed using parafac analysis and the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of each component in each sample in aluminum coagulation is shown in fig 5 contour plots of fluorescence sub components can be found in fig s10 and s11 flocs in samples diminished fluorescence intensities of both humic like and protein like components detected by using ra eem fig 5 a and b while this issue did not occur in ff eem measurement fig 5 c and d fmax of components in the ferric coagulation shows the same trend fig s12 in si besides it can be noted that the decreasing slopes of fmax of a fluorescence component in ra eem w o floc and ff eem were not the same this may be attributed to the different sample geometries which would result in different excitation light flux reaching the liquid sample this different slope indicates that the percentage change in fmax in ff eem may not be used for quantitatively describing the fluorescence concentration change a conversion equation fig s13 in the si could be used to obtain the standard fluorescence intensity this also indicated that in the real application it is still necessary to work out the mathematical relationship between fluorescence intensity in ff eem and ra eem so that the change of fluorescence concentration could be accurately assessed in summary it could be demonstrated that the suspended floc in the coagulated samples significantly undermined ra eem fluorescence detection but not ff eem this result implied that the ff eem could be very suitable for secondary effluent coagulation real time monitoring without sample pre filtration 3 3 prediction for effluent quality and subsequent fouling using ff eem the water quality of secondary effluent after coagulation was measured uv254 and doc were all decreased with increasing coagulant dosage as shown in fig 6 a and b this is consistent with the zeta potential and floc size results fig 3 as well as fluorescence changes fig 4 and 5 fig s7 and s12 ferric coagulation removed more doc than aluminum coagulation this could be attributed to the higher zeta potential fig 3c and thus more effective coagulation uf tests were also conducted using the supernatant of coagulation as feed the tmp profiles are shown in fig 6 c and d and tmp build up was slowed down as coagulant dosage increased fig 6 e shows the mfi calculated according to the tmp profiles it is indicated that coagulation pretreatment decreased the fouling potential of wastewater effluent in order to examine the potential of using ff eem for online monitoring of coagulation and fouling prediction in the subsequent uf statistical analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between fluorescence detected and other indices i e floc size turbidity uv254 doc and mfi only ff eem with floc and ra eem without floc were included in the statistical analyses since ff eem with floc is the ideal scenario for real time online monitoring and ra eem without floc has been regarded as the standard fluorescence measurement approach the pca analyses for all indices i e characteristics in loading plot in aluminum coagulation and ferric coagulation are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively in the aluminum coagulation test the principal component 1 pc1 and pc2 explained for 83 1 and 14 4 of the total variances while in the ferric test the pc1 and pc2 explained 90 9 and 6 3 of variances this indicated the goodness of pca analyses the angles between the vectors in loading plot indicate the characteristics correlate with one another in fig 7a and b loading vectors for components of ff eem with floc and ra eem without floc doc uv254 and mfi clustered very closely this indicated that ff eem ra eem doc uv254 and mfi were positively correlated well with each other the good correlation between ff eem and the other clustered indices i e ra eem doc uv254 and mfi were also shown in the r2 heat map in fig 7 c and d this suggested that the approach of using ff eem to probe the fluorescence in the coagulated sample without pre filtration is valid besides it is also indicated that the uv254 and the doc in secondary effluent coagulation could be predicted based on ff eem detection without sample preparation in the pca results fig 7 a and b floc size vector was about to perpendicular to the cluster and turbidity vector diverged from the cluster and form a nearly 180 angle this means turbidity was negatively correlated to the indices in the cluster and floc size is not likely to be correlated with other indices the heat map of r2 values also confirmed the correlations between floc size and other indices were poor the poor relationship between floc size and ff eem indicated that the floc size increase in the coagulation did not interfere with ff eem measurement for probing the dissolved fluorophores interestingly the correlation between conventional ra eem and mfi was poor in aluminum coagulation fig 7c and even uv254 and doc did not correlate very well with mfi in this experiment in the pca results fig 7a the angles between mfi and ff eem in aluminum coagulation were much smaller than those between mfi and ra eem doc and uv254 which confirmed the poor correlation between mfi and ra eem doc and uv254 this may be because sedimentation instead of pre filtration was used prior to uf test in order to mimic the real situation while pre filtration was adopted before ra eem doc and uv254 measurements thus the pre filtration used prior to the ra eem uv254 and doc measurements which intended to remove only flocs may remove some other dissolved organic foulants as well the ff eem measurement without any sample preparation could not only alleviate the impact of particle scattering on fluorescence detection but also preserve the intact of sample for better prediction for fouling in the following uf unit besides it should be noted that both protein like and humic like components in ff eem correlated well with fouling in this work while this did not always happen in all situations other study reported protein like substances were most likely associated with fouling haberkamp et al 2011 henderson et al 2011 while humic like fraction co contributed to fouling occasionally peiris et al 2010 sun et al 2016 the fluorescence fouling relation was summarized in table s6 in si therefore the relationship between fluorescence components and fouling may not be always consistent in all cases in order to establish a valid fluorescence monitoring system for fouling prediction it is suggested to investigate the relationship between fluorescence fraction and fouling in that case in advance with these results it is considered that ff eem might be quite promising for online and real time monitoring in the coagulation uf wastewater reclamation processes 3 4 implications this work demonstrated that front face fluorescence could be applicable for online monitoring of organic matters in the wastewater recycling process without any sample preparation it could give a real time diagnosing for performance assessment and an early warning for membrane fouling events besides this front face fluorescence can be easily coupled with an optical fiber to enable a more convenient online monitoring apparatus this ff eem coupled with optic fiber probe has been reported for membrane fouling monitoring ding et al 2020 pawlowski et al 2016 yamamura et al 2019 and algae solution monitoring sá et al 2017 thus online monitoring of wastewater recycling processes based on the front face fluorescence technique may be very applicable fluorescence monitoring has been investigated in many other systems such as drinking water treatment processes li et al 2016 shutova et al 2014 wastewater treatment processes carstea et al 2016 sgroi et al 2017a and wastewater impacted river baker 2001 lee et al 2019 sgroi et al 2017b particles and flocs are also ubiquitous in the processes above thus the front face fluorescence technique may also be extrapolated to these systems for online monitoring performance assessment and early warning of events to the utmost knowledge of authors this work is the first attempt to use ff eem for analyzing turbid liquid sample in water and wastewater treatment although the results are quite promising this work is still just a proof of concept study further studies are yet warranted to fulfill some possible issues although ff eem was found to be better than conventional ra eem under strong light scattering and light absorption ff eem could also be attenuated if absorbance was quite high 0 59 cm 1 in this study the absorbance in the secondary effluent coagulation did not exceed the limitation and thus the ff eem was valid in this case if the wastewater secondary treatment dysfunction the turbidity in the advanced treatment unit could rise up to high the heterogeneous suspended solids in the mixed liquor may lead to locally high suspension as well besides a rainstorm is known to be able to increase the turbidity of surface water dramatically and thus increased the turbidity in whole drinking water treatment processes in these cases front face fluorescence monitoring could be failed thus online absorbance monitoring is still necessary for validating fluorescence measurement and predicting a possible fail of ff eem detection in addition to inner filter effect temperature ph and metal ion could affect fluorescence signal and thus proper correction is still required moreover advanced data analytical technique is still necessitated this work employed parafac which could effectively decompose sub components from bulk fluorescence eems but the parafac analysis is still needed to be upgraded to a more intelligent level to compile with the real time online application additionally the front face sample holder and cuvette used in this work is still not suitable for on line monitoring and optical fiber probe should be further examined to mimic the real online monitoring scenario therefore further studies are still necessary to address these issues to allow a reliable and stable real time online monitoring of fluorescence 4 conclusions this study investigated the feasibility of using front face fluorescence spectrometer to characterize fluorescence in coagulated secondary effluent sample without pre filtration and to predict fouling in subsequent uf and conventional right angle fluorescence were also compared the following conclusions can be drawn 1 standard particles in samples significantly attenuated fluorescence detected by conventional ra eem while ff eem was less susceptible the absorbance limitations for valid ra eem and ff eem measurements were calculated to be 0 05 cm 1 and 0 59 cm 1 for less than 5 6 deviation 2 ff eem was not compromised by the flocs in the coagulated secondary effluent samples while conventional ra eem was undermined significantly when measuring coagulated sample without pre filtration i e with flocs 3 fluorescence intensities of fluorescence components obtained by ff eem coupled with parafac correlated well with uv254 and doc in the coagulated secondary effluent as well as mfi in the subsequent uf thus ff eem with parafac analysis is valid for online assessing performance of secondary effluent coagulation and providing early warning of fouling events in the following uf unit 4 front face fluorescence spectroscopy was demonstrated to be promising in real time online fluorescence monitoring in multi water and wastewater treatment

17491,fluorescence spectroscopy has been suggested as a promising online monitoring technique in water and wastewater treatment processes due to its high sensitivity and selectivity however a pre filtration is still indispensable in fluorescence measurement for removing ubiquitous particles and flocs in real samples to eliminate the strong light scattering that could attenuate fluorescence detection significantly this study proposed a front face fluorescence spectroscopy which could characterize the liquid sample with suspended solids directly without pre filtration front face excitation emission matrix ff eem coupled with parallel factor parafac analysis was used for analyzing fluorescence components and to probe coagulation of secondary effluent and fouling in the subsequent ultrafiltration uf and conventional right angle fluorescence eem ra eem was also compared the results showed that ff eem was less susceptible to turbidity induced by standard particles in the secondary effluent compared to ra eem ff eem could successfully measure dissolved fluorophores in coagulated suspension without pre filtration while conventional ra eem was undermined significantly due to the existing flocs ff eem coupled with parafac could accurately probe dissolved organic matter and fouling in coagulation uf wastewater reclamation processes therefore it was demonstrated that this front face fluorescence without any sample preparation step might be highly promising in real time online fluorescence monitoring in multi water and wastewater treatment processes graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords front face fluorescence excitation emission matrix parafac online monitoring wastewater reclamation 1 introduction real time online monitoring is always of importance for surveillance of source and treated water as well as the operational status of water and wastewater treatment processes carstea et al 2016 henderson et al 2009 li et al 2016 wu et al 2019 spectroscopy based methods especially absorbance and fluorescence are quite suitable for online monitoring because they are fast inexpensive reagentless and require little sample preparation aftab et al 2020 li et al 2016 maqbool et al 2020 roccaro et al 2015 xiao et al 2019 fluorescence excitation emission matrix is extremely sensitive and highly informative compared to absorbance spectra therefore online monitoring based on fluorescence spectra has experienced enormous development in recent years carstea et al 2016 henderson et al 2009 shutova et al 2014 particles and flocs are ubiquitous in drinking water or wastewater treatment processes they will induce strong light scattering or light absorption which could attenuate fluorescence intensively durkin et al 1994 müller et al 2001 while fluorescence detection is quite fast and easy a pre filtration to remove this turbidity is still indispensable this single step pre filtration could make real time online fluorescence monitoring unsustainable and even impractical thus the fluorescence technique that could characterize turbid samples is still necessitated for more effective real time online fluorescence monitoring conventional right angle fluorescence spectroscopy is used for characterizing diluted and transparent samples and is ineffective in analyzing original samples with turbidity or even opaque from water treatment processes fig 1 a the front face fluorescence is more suitable for this scenario in front face fluorescence detection the incident angle angle formed between the excitation beam and the perpendicular to the illuminated surface of the cell is normally 30 to 60 while this angle in conventional right angle fluorescence is always 0 the emitted radiation is detected from the same cell face as excitation beam incidence and thus it is called front face fluorescence fig 1b the front face fluorescence measurement would pertain around only the surface of a sample and thus could significantly mitigate the impacts of light absorption scattering reflection or shielding on fluorescence detection airado rodríguez et al 2011 lakowicz 2013 more detailed theory and the emission function for right angle fluorescence and front face fluorescence can be found in si this means front face fluorescence measurement may not need any sample preparation which is perfectly suitable for real time online and non destructive detection and monitoring with this merit front face fluorescence has been widely used for characterizing turbid or opaque samples like yogurt miquel becker et al 2003 wine sádecká et al 2009 milk schamberger and labuza 2006 honey karoui et al 2007 and even solid surface like different meat allais et al 2004 karoui et al 2006 this front face fluorescence was also applied to translucent edible oil and protein in water oil emulsion and transparent tryptophan riboflavin or nadh solution samples bevilacqua et al 2020 castelain and genot 1996 valderrama et al 2011 zandomeneghi et al 2005 thus it is considered that it is broadly applicable besides its major application in food chemistry front face fluorescence has also been applied to water treatment for probing membrane surface to illustrate membrane fouling ding et al 2020 yamamura et al 2019 yu et al 2019 however to the utmost knowledge of authors its potential for analyzing turbid liquid samples in water and wastewater treatment processes has never been reported reuse and recycling of secondary effluent has been widely employed in the world wide to lift water source restriction fluorescence monitoring has been investigated as a monitoring tool for performance assessment and early warning of contamination events carstea et al 2016 henderson et al 2009 particles and flocs commonly existing in the wastewater recycling processes like coagulation and membrane filtration could induce strong light scattering in fluorescence measurement it is realized that direct characterizing fluorescence in wastewater recycling processes by using front face fluorescence spectroscopy without sample preparation may be able to diminish the impact of light scattering on fluorescence detection and thus enable a valid real time online monitoring therefore this study attempted to investigate the feasibility of using front face fluorescence to characterize dissolved organic matters in flocculated suspension in aluminum and ferric coagulations of wastewater secondary effluent and to predict fouling in the subsequent ultrafiltration uf front face fluorescence and conventional right angle fluorescence were compared in terms of characterizing turbid samples with floc and clear samples without floc after pre filtration excitation emission matrix eem for both front face and right angle fluorescence were obtained and parallel factor parafac analysis was employed to decompose fluorescence components the correlations between front face fluorescence components and other water quality indices as well as membrane fouling index mfi were established in order to examine the feasibility of using front face fluorescence to probe coagulation efficacy and to predict fouling in subsequent ultrafiltration uf 2 material and methods 2 1 secondary effluent a grab sample of secondary effluent was collected from the wenchang wastewater treatment plant harbin china this wastewater treatment plant uses activated sludge processes anaerobic anoxic oxic the effluent from secondary sedimentation tank was collected and transport to our lab within 2 hours and stored at 4 c before use the dissolved organic carbon doc in the secondary effluent was 5 676 0 008 mg l and uv254 of the sample was 0 116 0 007 cm 1 with ph value of 7 21 0 12 the alkalinity of the sample was 138 mg l as caco3 and the electric conductivity was 762 μs cm 2 2 preparation of suspended solution with standard particle in order to investigate the effects of suspended solids on ff eem and ra eem detections a standard particle silicon dioxide sio2 0 5 10 μm was added into the secondary effluent samples to different turbidities i e 10 ntu 20 ntu 30 ntu 50 ntu 100 ntu fluorescence of secondary effluent samples with different turbidities was measured using conventional right angle fluorescence and front face fluorescence 2 3 coagulation tests two sets of coagulation tests were conducted using 1l secondary effluent sample with aluminum sulfate and ferric chloride aladin shanghai china at different concentrations respectively this experiment was carried out in a six jar tester my3000 6m meiyu wuhan china stock solutions of aluminum sulfate 2 g l and ferric chloride 5 g l were first made respectively then aluminum sulfate or ferric chloride was added into 1l of secondary effluent at concentrations of 10 20 30 40 50 60 mg l respectively the coagulant concentrations used here are commonly adopted in the relevant studies and a comparison could be found in table s1 in si the coagulation reaction was conducted by stirring secondary effluent with coagulant dosed at 200 r min for 1 min then at a middle speed of 120 r min for 5 min and then to 60 r min for 10 min the corresponding g values at these three mixing speeds were 138 8 s 1 64 5 s 1 and 22 8 s 1 the mixing speed and the g value are comparable to other studies as summarized in table s1 two slow mixing speeds 120 r min for 5 min and 60 r min for 10 min were used in this work since this mixing program may speed up flocculation while preventing from floc breakage right after the coagulation steps suspension samples were collected and directly subjected to eem turbidity absorbance and floc size measurements another set of samples were also collected and filtered using 0 45 μm syringe filter with cellulose acetate membrane and then subjected to eem doc uv254 and zeta potential measurements all measurements are triplicated and average and deviation are shown in final results 2 4 eem measurement both conventional right angle eem ra eem and front face eem ff eem were adopted to characterize unfiltered with floc and filtered without floc samples ra eem was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f7000 hitachi japan at room temperature 23 1 c conventional sample holder and 1 cm quartz cuvette were used and the sample geometry is shown in fig 1a excitation ex light was set to 250 450 nm at an interval of 5 nm and emission em light was detected in the range of 250 550 nm at an interval of 1 nm the ex and em slit widths were both 5 nm the photomultiplier tube pmt voltage was 700 v a scanning speed of 30 000 nm min was adopted to avoid too much precipitation of coagulation flocs during the eem measurement it took 105 seconds for an eem measurement settling times of suspended solution in different coagulation tests could be found in table s2 and the turbidity and uv254 change after 105 seconds of each sample were also measured the effect of floc settlement on the ra eem may be less than 6 except for 60 mg l fecl3 coagulation 11 59 and the influence on the ff eem would be even less detailed data and analysis could be found in si in ff eem measurement a front face sample holder p n 650 0616 hitachi was used and the sample geometry is shown in fig 1 b fig s2 and s3 the same 1 cm cuvette was used but the ex and em light paths in ff eem are quite different from those in ra eem the em light was detected from the front side of the cuvette the same side as the ex beam incidence this geometry could decrease the impact of sample turbidity or color the light absorption in order to decrease the reflected light that enters into the emission monochromator the incident angle was 30 degrees and the upper surface was inclined to 10 degrees fig 1 and fig s3 which could remove the specular reflection light from the sample three dimensionally the optimization of the incident angle and inclined angle can be found on the website of hitachi https www hitachi hightech com file global products science appli ana fl solid fl 120005 pdf it was also included in the si as an appendix except for the sample geometry all the other parameters in ff eem measurement were the same as those in the ra eem measurement above typical eem contour plots of a secondary effluent sample measured by conventional ra eem and ff eem are also shown in fig 1 c and d ff eem and ra eem showed a very similar fluorescence peak pattern but fluorescence intensity in ra eem was a little bit higher than that in ff eem this could be attributed to the less reflection of ex in the ra eem geometry lakowicz 2013 the raman scattering was eliminated by subtracting eem of pure water ryleigh scattering was cut from the eems and zeros were inserted at ryleigh scattering position inner filter effect of ra eem without floc was corrected by using dreem toolbox http openfluor weebly com dreem html in matlab 2014a mathworks inc natick ma and spectral absorbance in the range of 250 nm to 550 nm recorded for each sample t6 puxi beijing parafac was used to decompose fluorescence components in the eems the eems obtained by ff eem and ra eem were assigned into two datasets respectively for parafac analyses each dataset included 78 eems parafac modeling was conducted according to the tutorial published by murphy et al 2013 using matlab with dreem toolbox 2 5 uf experiments uf tests were conducted using secondary effluent sample and samples after coagulation as feedwater respectively uf was performed using a dead end filtration cell as previously described yu et al 2019 a schematic diagram can be found in fig s4 in supporting information briefly a 20 ml filtration cell was continuously fed by a 1 l glass reservoir the uf tests were conducted in constant

statistical analysis the principal component analysis pca and linear regression were conducted to investigate the correlation between eem parafac components in ff eem with floc and in ra eem without floc as well as other indices i e doc uv254 turbidity floc size and mfi a pca biplot was developed which shows a score plot of samples and a loading plot of indices the pca was performed on an average of replicates for all indices linear regressions between ff eem components ra eem components and other indices were conducted and the r square values are presented in the form of heat map all the statistical analyses were performed using origin software 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of turbidity on ff eem and ra eem fluorescence of turbid samples made with standard suspended solids was measured using ff eem and ra eem as shown in fig 2 as suspended solids increased fluorescence detected by using ra eem was remarkably attenuated while fluorescence intensity detected by ff eem decreased by no more than 7 60 until turbidity reached 50 ntu detailed data could be found in table s3 in si ra eem was more susceptible to turbidity compared to ff eem it is considered that the fluorescence attenuation in both ra eem and ff eem would be attributed to the light absorption or light shelter by the suspended particle added which could be evaluated by spectral absorbance measurement the absorbance of each sample could be found in fig s5 in si and a function describing the relationship between absorbance and fluorescence could be found in eq 1 in si ra eem was more affected because the optical path length in the ra eem 0 5 cm would be much longer than in ff eem bevilacqua et al 2020 the optical path length in the ff eem detection of these standard turbid samples was estimated to be 0 0418 with r2 0 9125 by using modeling detailed in si with this optical path length obtained an absorbance limitation of 0 59 cm 1 for valid ff eem measurement could be achieved the calculation could be found in si thus the mild effect of suspended solids on the ff eems with turbidity not higher than 50 ntu could be explained by their relatively low absorbance 0 59 cm 1 as shown in fig s5 in another case the opaque sample like milk and yogurt would have much higher absorbance but they were still successfully subjected to the ff eem analysis miquel becker et al 2003 schamberger and labuza 2006 this could be attributed to the extremely high fluorophores majorly proteins content in these samples and even shorter optical path length in this case as shown in fig s1 3 2 characterization of coagulated suspension using ff eem and ra eem it has been indicated that the ff eem could be used to characterize dissolved organic matter with the presence of standard particles absorbance 0 59 cm 1 the ff eem was further applied in the analysis of secondary effluent coagulation turbidity and floc size of the coagulated suspension samples were first measured as shown in fig 3 turbidity increased with increasing coagulant dosage while floc size changed inconsistently with increasing coagulant dosage the floc size increased with increasing coagulant dosage when the dosage was lower than 20 mg l majorly due to the compressed electrical double layer while coagulant dosage exceeded 20 mg l charge reversal and complete surface coverage might occur which would result in the restabilization and inefficacy coagulation and thus the floc size kept steady or decreased a little bit at these coagulant dosages the floc size increased sharply again with 60 mg l fecl3 this could be explained by the sweep mechanism or precipitant enmeshment metal coagulants in aqueous solution form metal hydroxide precipitates which could serve to enmesh particulate material thus affecting destabilization essentially by a sweep action bratby 2016 ph in the coagulation tests did not change significantly this may be attributed to the relatively high alkalinity due to the sodium bicarbonate dosed in anaerobic tank for denitrification in the wastewater treatment plant the alkalinity consumption of 60 mg l al2 so4 3 and 60 mg l fecl3 can be calculated to be 52 62 mg l as caco3 and 55 38 mg l as caco3 respectively bratby 2016 which are lower than the alkalinity in the secondary effluent 138 mg l as caco3 it could be found that the turbidity of coagulated samples was around 5 to 20 ntu with floc size around 200 to 1000 μm which might induce significant light scattering and thus attenuate fluorescence detection the size of suspended solids in the coagulated sample was much bigger than standard particle used in the turbidity test in fig 2 silica dioxide in bigger size was not adopted in the turbidity test due to its fast sinking which could not form a relatively stable suspended solution for eem measurement fluorescence eems of secondary effluent coagulated with different al2 so4 3 dosages were characterized by using ra eem and ff eem directly i e with floc or after pre filtration i e without floc as shown in fig 4 a and b the fluorescence detected by ra eem without floc decreased with increasing coagulant dosage since more the fluorophores in the secondary effluent were adsorbed by the coagulant with increasing coagulant dosage the fluorescence change due to the adsorption could be calculated by subtracting eem w o floc from the eem of raw water as shown in fig 4 d the fluorescence drop resulted from the fluorophore removal or adsorption by coagulant increased with increasing coagulant dosage it was also found that the flocs that may aggregate a lot of fluorophores showed almost no fluorescence this might be attributed to the complexes formed by coagulant metal and fluorescence organics in the flocs could quench the fluorophores cheng and chi 2002 the decreasing rates of fluorescence intensities in ra eem without floc and in ra eem with floc were not consistent fig 4 c shows the differential eem between ra eem with floc and ra eem without floc the differential eem intensity increased with increasing coagulant dosage which indicated the flocs attenuated fluorescence detected by ra eem the floc could impact fluorescence measurement through light absorption scattering or even sheltering spectral absorbance could measure all these effects the absorbance of each sample in fig 4 could be found in fig s8 in si absorbance data of both samples with and without floc exceeded the critical value of 0 05 cm 1 for ra eem but did not reach the critical absorbance of 0 59 cm 1 for ff eem the effect of absorbance on the fluorescence detection in ra geometry and ff geometry is shown in fig s9 in si ra eem was attenuated significantly by the suspensions while the ff eem was mildly influenced the eems measured with and without floc by using ff eem in fig 4 e and f were quite similar with p values all higher than 0 05 in anova of peak intensities in ff eem with and without floc detailed data could be found in table s4 as shown in fig 4g the differential eem between these two sets of eems were approximate to zero these results are consistent with the fluorescence attenuation factor calculated in fig s9 the fluorescence decrease in ff eem due to the removal of fluorophores in the coagulation was calculated and shown in fig 4h this result indicated the ff eem with floc would be affected by only the effluent dom removed by coagulation while ra eem with floc would influence by both the flocs existing and the dom removal this implies the priority of ff eem over ra eem in characterizing sample with suspended solids eems for ferric coagulation fig s7 in si also indicated the flocs attenuated ra eem substantially while almost no difference was found when analyzing with and without floc using ff eem it should be noted that the dissolved ferric ion and aluminum ion remained in the coagulated samples was quite low table s5 in si which would not induce a fluorescence quenching poulin et al 2014 yan et al 2013 the fluorescence components in the eems were decomposed using parafac analysis and the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of each component in each sample in aluminum coagulation is shown in fig 5 contour plots of fluorescence sub components can be found in fig s10 and s11 flocs in samples diminished fluorescence intensities of both humic like and protein like components detected by using ra eem fig 5 a and b while this issue did not occur in ff eem measurement fig 5 c and d fmax of components in the ferric coagulation shows the same trend fig s12 in si besides it can be noted that the decreasing slopes of fmax of a fluorescence component in ra eem w o floc and ff eem were not the same this may be attributed to the different sample geometries which would result in different excitation light flux reaching the liquid sample this different slope indicates that the percentage change in fmax in ff eem may not be used for quantitatively describing the fluorescence concentration change a conversion equation fig s13 in the si could be used to obtain the standard fluorescence intensity this also indicated that in the real application it is still necessary to work out the mathematical relationship between fluorescence intensity in ff eem and ra eem so that the change of fluorescence concentration could be accurately assessed in summary it could be demonstrated that the suspended floc in the coagulated samples significantly undermined ra eem fluorescence detection but not ff eem this result implied that the ff eem could be very suitable for secondary effluent coagulation real time monitoring without sample pre filtration 3 3 prediction for effluent quality and subsequent fouling using ff eem the water quality of secondary effluent after coagulation was measured uv254 and doc were all decreased with increasing coagulant dosage as shown in fig 6 a and b this is consistent with the zeta potential and floc size results fig 3 as well as fluorescence changes fig 4 and 5 fig s7 and s12 ferric coagulation removed more doc than aluminum coagulation this could be attributed to the higher zeta potential fig 3c and thus more effective coagulation uf tests were also conducted using the supernatant of coagulation as feed the tmp profiles are shown in fig 6 c and d and tmp build up was slowed down as coagulant dosage increased fig 6 e shows the mfi calculated according to the tmp profiles it is indicated that coagulation pretreatment decreased the fouling potential of wastewater effluent in order to examine the potential of using ff eem for online monitoring of coagulation and fouling prediction in the subsequent uf statistical analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between fluorescence detected and other indices i e floc size turbidity uv254 doc and mfi only ff eem with floc and ra eem without floc were included in the statistical analyses since ff eem with floc is the ideal scenario for real time online monitoring and ra eem without floc has been regarded as the standard fluorescence measurement approach the pca analyses for all indices i e characteristics in loading plot in aluminum coagulation and ferric coagulation are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively in the aluminum coagulation test the principal component 1 pc1 and pc2 explained for 83 1 and 14 4 of the total variances while in the ferric test the pc1 and pc2 explained 90 9 and 6 3 of variances this indicated the goodness of pca analyses the angles between the vectors in loading plot indicate the characteristics correlate with one another in fig 7a and b loading vectors for components of ff eem with floc and ra eem without floc doc uv254 and mfi clustered very closely this indicated that ff eem ra eem doc uv254 and mfi were positively correlated well with each other the good correlation between ff eem and the other clustered indices i e ra eem doc uv254 and mfi were also shown in the r2 heat map in fig 7 c and d this suggested that the approach of using ff eem to probe the fluorescence in the coagulated sample without pre filtration is valid besides it is also indicated that the uv254 and the doc in secondary effluent coagulation could be predicted based on ff eem detection without sample preparation in the pca results fig 7 a and b floc size vector was about to perpendicular to the cluster and turbidity vector diverged from the cluster and form a nearly 180 angle this means turbidity was negatively correlated to the indices in the cluster and floc size is not likely to be correlated with other indices the heat map of r2 values also confirmed the correlations between floc size and other indices were poor the poor relationship between floc size and ff eem indicated that the floc size increase in the coagulation did not interfere with ff eem measurement for probing the dissolved fluorophores interestingly the correlation between conventional ra eem and mfi was poor in aluminum coagulation fig 7c and even uv254 and doc did not correlate very well with mfi in this experiment in the pca results fig 7a the angles between mfi and ff eem in aluminum coagulation were much smaller than those between mfi and ra eem doc and uv254 which confirmed the poor correlation between mfi and ra eem doc and uv254 this may be because sedimentation instead of pre filtration was used prior to uf test in order to mimic the real situation while pre filtration was adopted before ra eem doc and uv254 measurements thus the pre filtration used prior to the ra eem uv254 and doc measurements which intended to remove only flocs may remove some other dissolved organic foulants as well the ff eem measurement without any sample preparation could not only alleviate the impact of particle scattering on fluorescence detection but also preserve the intact of sample for better prediction for fouling in the following uf unit besides it should be noted that both protein like and humic like components in ff eem correlated well with fouling in this work while this did not always happen in all situations other study reported protein like substances were most likely associated with fouling haberkamp et al 2011 henderson et al 2011 while humic like fraction co contributed to fouling occasionally peiris et al 2010 sun et al 2016 the fluorescence fouling relation was summarized in table s6 in si therefore the relationship between fluorescence components and fouling may not be always consistent in all cases in order to establish a valid fluorescence monitoring system for fouling prediction it is suggested to investigate the relationship between fluorescence fraction and fouling in that case in advance with these results it is considered that ff eem might be quite promising for online and real time monitoring in the coagulation uf wastewater reclamation processes 3 4 implications this work demonstrated that front face fluorescence could be applicable for online monitoring of organic matters in the wastewater recycling process without any sample preparation it could give a real time diagnosing for performance assessment and an early warning for membrane fouling events besides this front face fluorescence can be easily coupled with an optical fiber to enable a more convenient online monitoring apparatus this ff eem coupled with optic fiber probe has been reported for membrane fouling monitoring ding et al 2020 pawlowski et al 2016 yamamura et al 2019 and algae solution monitoring sá et al 2017 thus online monitoring of wastewater recycling processes based on the front face fluorescence technique may be very applicable fluorescence monitoring has been investigated in many other systems such as drinking water treatment processes li et al 2016 shutova et al 2014 wastewater treatment processes carstea et al 2016 sgroi et al 2017a and wastewater impacted river baker 2001 lee et al 2019 sgroi et al 2017b particles and flocs are also ubiquitous in the processes above thus the front face fluorescence technique may also be extrapolated to these systems for online monitoring performance assessment and early warning of events to the utmost knowledge of authors this work is the first attempt to use ff eem for analyzing turbid liquid sample in water and wastewater treatment although the results are quite promising this work is still just a proof of concept study further studies are yet warranted to fulfill some possible issues although ff eem was found to be better than conventional ra eem under strong light scattering and light absorption ff eem could also be attenuated if absorbance was quite high 0 59 cm 1 in this study the absorbance in the secondary effluent coagulation did not exceed the limitation and thus the ff eem was valid in this case if the wastewater secondary treatment dysfunction the turbidity in the advanced treatment unit could rise up to high the heterogeneous suspended solids in the mixed liquor may lead to locally high suspension as well besides a rainstorm is known to be able to increase the turbidity of surface water dramatically and thus increased the turbidity in whole drinking water treatment processes in these cases front face fluorescence monitoring could be failed thus online absorbance monitoring is still necessary for validating fluorescence measurement and predicting a possible fail of ff eem detection in addition to inner filter effect temperature ph and metal ion could affect fluorescence signal and thus proper correction is still required moreover advanced data analytical technique is still necessitated this work employed parafac which could effectively decompose sub components from bulk fluorescence eems but the parafac analysis is still needed to be upgraded to a more intelligent level to compile with the real time online application additionally the front face sample holder and cuvette used in this work is still not suitable for on line monitoring and optical fiber probe should be further examined to mimic the real online monitoring scenario therefore further studies are still necessary to address these issues to allow a reliable and stable real time online monitoring of fluorescence 4 conclusions this study investigated the feasibility of using front face fluorescence spectrometer to characterize fluorescence in coagulated secondary effluent sample without pre filtration and to predict fouling in subsequent uf and conventional right angle fluorescence were also compared the following conclusions can be drawn 1 standard particles in samples significantly attenuated fluorescence detected by conventional ra eem while ff eem was less susceptible the absorbance limitations for valid ra eem and ff eem measurements were calculated to be 0 05 cm 1 and 0 59 cm 1 for less than 5 6 deviation 2 ff eem was not compromised by the flocs in the coagulated secondary effluent samples while conventional ra eem was undermined significantly when measuring coagulated sample without pre filtration i e with flocs 3 fluorescence intensities of fluorescence components obtained by ff eem coupled with parafac correlated well with uv254 and doc in the coagulated secondary effluent as well as mfi in the subsequent uf thus ff eem with parafac analysis is valid for online assessing performance of secondary effluent coagulation and providing early warning of fouling events in the following uf unit 4 front face fluorescence spectroscopy was demonstrated to be promising in real time online fluorescence monitoring in multi water and wastewater treatment

17492,to achieve a better understanding of global biogeochemical cycle and budget of trace metals tm in the world s ocean a comprehensive study of the level fate and burial flux of tm in surface sediment from the eastern china marginal seas ecms was conducted the results indicated that pb zn cu and cr were highly concentrated in mud deposits and primarily controlled by the natural processes of sediment composition and regional hydrodynamics whereas as had a close association with mn and was mainly derived from anthropogenic activity the sediment mass inventories of pb zn cu cr and as in the ecms 220 780 km2 were estimated to be 28 324 92 192 23 434 94 560 and 11 968 t yr respectively a mass budget model revealed that riverine runoff coastal erosion input and atmospheric deposition dry and wet constituted 62 76 15 37 and 2 9 of the total pb zn and cr influxes respectively while more than 4 690 t of cu annually outflowed to the open seas to balance the budget more importantly we found that the sum of the estimates of these contributions tended to fall short of the calculated depositional fluxes of as implying that anthropogenic activities probably have altered the natural geochemical cycle of as our results suggest that the ecms constitutes a major final repository of tm at the asia scale however the burial fluxes of trace metals are expected to decrease due to enhanced environmental investments by the chinese government and decreased suspended particulate tm loads from the chinese major rivers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords trace metals cycle depositional fate eastern china marginal seas 1 introduction contamination of toxic metals in aquatic ecosystems sediments water organisms etc is a global concern due to its abundance persistence and environmental toxicity schwarzenbach et al 2006 apart from sediment contamination which may lead to water quality deterioration and a series of adverse impacts on the natural system the propagation of tm throughout the food chain can induce a carcinogenic effect on the human body and other risks to the aquatic ecosystem generally these hazardous pollutants originate from both geochemical sources and anthropogenic activities and ultimately enter fluvial systems via surface runoff or associated with aerosols by atmospheric transport globally atmospheric deposition is recognized as a major contribution of tm to open oceans whereas terrestrial derived metals by river discharge and surface runoff are predominantly deposited and largely stored in continental shelf sediments owing to geochemical controls viers et al 2009 coastal margins not only are critical transition zones linking terrestrial with the oceanic system but also have sensitive responses to human induced pressures and are acknowledged to be a major dynamic component of the global tm cycle and budget audry et al 2004 bauer et al 2013 according to the statistical data approximately 44 of the world s population lives within 150 km of a coastline syvitski et al 2005 thus large amounts of toxic metals released from anthropogenic activities will enter the aquatic environment previous studies suggested that 90 of global riverine sediments and associated pollutants are ultimately buried on the continental margins where the thicknesses of metals deposits are often the largest although they occupy only 10 of global ocean area martin and windom 1991 moreover it has been widely shown that the vast majority up to 90 of tm carried downstream in a river are bound to fine suspended particulates and colloids whereas riverine dissolved flux is less than 3 of the total riverine flux due to their relative insolubility in water surface sediments with oxic conditions of circa neutral ph poulton and raiswell 2000 consequently these shallow narrow river influenced marginal sediments are geochemical reservoirs for tm and have significant influences on the oceanic tm dynamic and even the earth s biogeochemical metal cycles to a considerable degree the ecms in the western pacific ocean bounded by china comprising the bohai sea bs yellow sea ys and east china sea ecs are highly exposed to industrial and anthropogenic activity and characterized with a high loading of terrigenous materials from major chinese rivers which account for 10 of the world s river sediment supply to the ocean milliman and meade 1983 moreover as the world s leading producer and consumer china produced an estimated 4 6 mt yr of pb 5 5 mt yr of zn 1 7 mt yr of cu 3 3 mt yr of cr and 0 03 mt yr of as during the period 2011 2015 particularly for the consumption of pb zn and as which accounted for 47 of global metals consumption usgs 2016 additionally because of amounts of large dam construction in the catchments of the yellow river and yangtze river over the past decades the environment and water ecosystem in those rivers have degraded drastically müller et al 2008 yang et al 2014 wang et al 2017 and the yangtze river ranked globally as the 6th of the most polluted rivers in the world including sedimentation and industrial and agricultural domestic waste by the world wildlife fund for nature wong et al 2007 additionally asian dust and pollutants are transported eastward by winter monsoon to the eastern marginal areas and even to the western pacific ocean hu et al 2012 and thus the ecms receives an abundant atmospheric deposition of aerosol tm therefore the ecms are scientifically unique and ideal target areas to study coastal trace metal cycling and budgets to our knowledge most studies have focused on the spatial distribution potential risk and source identification of sedimentary tm in single environmental compartments he 2011 gao et al 2018 liang et al 2018 unfortunately research on the interaction of trace metals with environmental factors and mass budgets in the ecms as an integrated system is lacked which to some degree would limit our better understanding of the significance of the ecms on the regional and global biogeochemical cycles of trace elements therefore the primary objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the distribution patterns and sources of tm pb zn cu cr and as over the spatially extensive region of the ecms 2 quantify the amounts of tm that have entered passed through and ultimately deposited in the ecms and elucidate their relationships with dry wet atmospheric deposition in these areas and terrestrial discharge from the chinese rivers and 3 reveal the ultimate fate of sedimentary tm with the alteration of physicochemical properties on a global scale this study can provide a new database and a case study for coastal oceanic trace metal cycling and budget assessments 2 material and methods 2 1 study areas and sample collection the ecms is characterized by high loadings of suspended particles that are mainly delivered by the yellow river and the yangtze river during 1954 2015 with annual sediment discharges of 6 6 108 t yr and 3 7 108 t yr respectively wu et al 2020 annual suspended sediment load supplied from other local coastal rivers liaohe qiantang min etc total sediment load 0 8 108 t yr and erosion from the old yellow river mouth 2 56 108 t yr amounted to 3 36 108 t yr qiao et al 2017 and they account for nearly 25 of total sediment fluxes into ecms due to widely ranging water depths from approximately 4 m to more than 200 m off the ecms and the east asian monsoon the ecms have a complex set of circulation systems including the coastal cold and warm currents fig 1 a the complex dynamic conditions lead to the formation of delta deposits in the yellow river estuary and yangtze river estuary fine grained mud deposits defined by mean grain size 6φ in the central bs the northern yellow sea nys the southern yellow sea sys and along the zhejiang fujian coasts sand deposits in the outer shelf and mixtures of sand silt and clay on the coast and inner shelf in total 179 surface sediment samples depths of 0 3 cm in the ecms were collected from the 27 sites in the bs and 64 sites in the ys in december 2012 and december 2017 by personnel deployed on the r v dong fang hong 2 in may 2015 and the 88 sites in the ecs in december 2016 conducted by r v run jiang 1 and ke xue 3 fig 1b all surface samples were obtained using a stainless steel grab or box samplers and stored at 4 6

eliminating carbonate with 30 h2o2 and 10 hcl respectively the relative measurement error was 3 water content w in surface sediments was determined by comparison of the weights of wet and dried

1 w determination of major elements al fe and mn and tm pb zn cu cr and as contents in sediment was undertaken using an x ray fluorescence spectrometer xrf spectr ltd germany following the detailed procedures previously described in liu and fan 2011 the accuracy of each batch of samples was checked by the analysis of the certified national reference material gbw07314 and parallel samples the recoveries of most certified samples performed by multiple analyses varied between 85 and 110 the analytical errors of the measured certified reference were less than 9 table s1 notably to eliminate the analytical errors deviating from known values of the certified reference material sedimentary tm concentrations were normalized based on the measured values of the reference material in each batch

sedimentary tm in the ecms the mass inventories of sedimentary tm in the present sampling region were estimated according to ingall and jahnke 1994 and lin et al 2013 the study area of the ecms

and the 1012 is the unit conversion factor that changes μg m2 yr to t m2 yr 2 3 4 calculation of the f coastal erosion the coastal erosion dominated export fluxes of tm t yr from the abandoned yellow

export flux ess t yr eisma 1998 saito et al 2001 hu and yang 2001 9 f c o a s t a l e r o s i o n tm ess 10 6 additionally the contributions of coastal erosion tm from the old yellow river estuary to the ys and from the zhejiang fujiang coastal region to the ecs are calculated by deducting the total influxes of atmospheric deposition riverine discharge and the import through the bs strait and the yscc from the estimated inventories of tm 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial distribution of trace metals the spatial distributions of sedimentary grain size al fe mn and tm in the surface sediments from the ecms are shown in fig 3 the spatial distribution of sedimentary mean grain size mz was consistent with the al and fe varying from 1 8 7 8φ 37 320 3 84 865 4 mg kg and 16 585 8 51 304 4 mg kg with average values of 5 4φ 64 503 1 mg kg and 33 009 2 mg kg respectively the ecms had mn concentration ranges of 233 3 1852 5 mg kg with a mean value of 702 8 mg kg tm concentrations mg kg 1 of pb zn cu cr and as in surface sediments of the ecms ranged from 11 3 44 7 25 5 122 5 1 9 41 4 45 1 107 1 and 1 1 34 3 with mean levels of 22 5 71 5 19 4 73 7 and 9 7 mg kg 1 respectively additionally the spatial distribution of tm exhibits significant variability under different sediment textures remarkable enrichment of sedimentary pb zn cu and cr was mainly found in the fine grained deposits around the river mouth areas and the depocenters of the bs ys and ecs light gray area in fig 1a with values up to 2 20 fold higher in mud areas whereas the low natural level of tm was constrained in the coarse grained areas including the northeastern outer shelf of the ecs the western nearshore area of the sys and the eastern offshore region of the nys fig 3 high concentrations of mn were observed in the central ys and estuarine areas however sedimentary as displayed a distinct variation with relatively higher values that mainly occurred in the estuarine regions of the ecms and decreasing values offshore towards the outer shelf suggesting that the distribution of as mainly depends directly on riverine discharge from the chinese major rivers 3 2 deposition flux and budget of tm 3 2 1 estimation of tm flux and sedimentary inventory the sedimentary tm burial flux in the ecms was estimated by the measured dry sediment density and previously reported radionuclide 210pb 137cs derived sr figure s1 and fig 2 as shown in table 1 and fig 4 the spatial distribution of tm depositional flux in the study areas showed an apparent regional variability ranging from 0 2 133 2 17 4 21 1 0 6 456 6 57 4 74 5 0 2 148 7 16 4 23 7 0 7 446 3 58 8 71 0 0 1 66 5 9 0 12 6 μg cm2 yr for pb zn cu cr and as respectively the estimated tm fluxes in this study were comparable with those of the coastal sepetiba bay in brazil gomes et al 2009 but they were lower than those of coastal areas with a strong impact of anthropogenic perturbations around the world such as the hailing bay of a typical mariculture zone in south china zhang et al 2012 the thi vai estuary in southern vietnam costa böddeker et al 2018 and the coastal belt of pakistan ali et al 2015 in contrast these results were still several orders magnitude higher than the fluxes observed in estuarine sediments with low sr such as in the galician rias estuary of the iberian peninsula álvarez vazquez et al 2017 and the auckland estuary williamsonb and morrisey 2000 among the subregions in the ecms relatively high tm deposition fluxes were observed in the yangtze river estuary and the yellow river delta they were significantly higher than those of the bs ys and ecs areas off the estuary fig 4 compared to the tm levels the spatial distribution patterns of tm flux exhibited significant differences in some subregions such as the central mud areas of the nys and sys and the western coastal areas of the ys fig 3 tm flux near the western coasts of the ys was noticeably higher than that for the central mud deposits of the ys but the tm concentrations on the western coasts of the ys were very low due to a relatively high dynamic condition therefore this discrepancy occurred in the spatial patterns of tm level and flux and might be explained by varying modern mass accumulation rates mar in the ecms according to the 210pb and 137cs derived sr fig 2 the yangtze river subaqueous delta and the yellow river estuary exhibit high sediment accumulation rates with sr of 2 5 4 cm yr demaster et al 1985 and generally 0 5 cm yr a maximum value of 9 59 cm yr qiao et al 2017 respectively in comparison relatively lower sr 0 1 0 5 cm yr occur in the offshore regions of the bs ys and ecs yang et al 2003 more importantly the gradual decrease trend in tm burial flux from the estuary to open seas coincided well with the spatial distribution of sr indicating that high tm burial flux in the continental margins was controlled by river borne tm inputs from both the yangtze and yellow rivers in china and high sedimentation based on the estimated tm deposition flux and accumulation areas of each of the divided homogenous sectors the sedimentary inventories of tm were estimated to be 28 324 92 192 23 434 94 560 and 11 968 t yr for pb zn cu cr and as within the ecms areas 220 780 km2 respectively fig 5 at a global scale it can be estimated that 658 104 t yr with annual particle and dissolved flux 104 t yr of 77 0 3 for pb 262 2 3 for zn 96 5 7 for cu 164 2 7 for cr and 46 2 4 for as respectively were transported to the continental margins based on the average composition of suspended sediments in the world rivers poulton and raiswell 2000 carey et al 2002 viers et al 2009 and the global modern sediment fluxes of 12 610 mt yr and runoff of 38 540 km3 yr syvitski et al 2005 notably these results also showed that sedimentary tm inventories in the ecms account for approximately 4 of the global fluvial export and play a significant role in the global tm cycle 3 2 2 sedimentary tm budget in the ecms a mass budget of tm in the continental regions is developed as a primary step towards understanding the local sources and transport processes controlling tm fates in a highly complex coastal area oram et al 2008 to further evaluate to what extent terrestrial runoff atmospheric deposition and other origins control tm export a mass balance budget describing the statuses of sedimentary tm was constructed by assembling all of the fluxes estimated in the previous section tables s2 s3 and fig 6 for the bs the tm fluxes input via river inflows were several orders of magnitude higher than the atmospheric deposition fluxes suggesting that the direct atmospheric contribution into the bs area is relatively small among the rivers around the bs the yellow river is the major source of tm into the bs accounting for 79 89 93 93 and 93 for pb zn cu cr and as of the total fluvial inputs respectively based on the inputs of tm via the river discharge atmospheric fallout and sedimentary tm flux in the bs it was calculated that 47 for pb 47 for zn 35 for cu 43 for cr and 83 for as of their total influxes were deposited in the bs of which approximately 17 65 were finally transported out of the bohai strait and eastward to the ys for the ys approximately 227 t yr for pb 3995 t yr for zn 220 t yr for cu and 244 t yr for cr and 97 t yr for as from atmospheric dry and wet deposits table s3 however it should be noted that the tm input from direct atmospheric deposition and indirectly transported from river discharge only constituted 70 of the total burial fluxes of tm in the ys suggesting that additional diffuse sources from the old yellow river estuary have to be taken into account as they may disrupt the balance of the fluvial system dominated margins and modify the sedimentary tm budget audry et al 2004 reported that the mobilization of riverbed sediments and associated tm triggered by local human activities and intense floods may strongly alter the heavy metal budget of rivers dominating estuary shelf areas to our knowledge the old yellow river delta has suffered intense erosion since the river mouth shifted from the ys to bs since 1855 and eroded materials from that abandoned estuary largely influence the modern sediment burial in the ys wang and jiang 2007 reported that the 500 mt yr of spm resuspended from the seabed of the old yellow river mouth in winter is an important source for the ys zhou et al 2014 showed that 790 mt yr of sediment were eroded in the areas with water depths of 20 m and 75 80 of those eroded materials were transported to the offshore slope in the western ys and the mud belt of the central ys recently qiao et al 2017 proposed that more than 23 7 mt yr of fine grained sediment total sediment 262 mt yr eroded from the coastal sand areas in the old yellow river estuary are transported to the ys therefore it can be inferred that the potential sources of sedimentary tm derived from the erosion processes in the old yellow river to the ys could not be ignored if we assume that all the tm fluxes were completely deposited in the ys it can be roughly estimated that at least 40 3600 t yr for pb 27 7673 t yr for zn and 35 10 991 t yr for cr were deposited in the ys from the reworked sediments in the old yellow river delta notably excess cu escaped from the ys to the okinawa trough with net export fluxes of at least 1740 t yr obtained by mass balance in fact the eroded materials in the old yellow river estuary were not completely transported to the ys eisma 1998 and hu and yang 2001 estimated that 100 110 mt yr of that was delivered to the ecs along with the yscc thus it can be roughly calculated that approximately 1430 t yr for pb 5530 t yr for zn 1760 t yr for cu 6980 t yr for cr and 1260 t yr for as were outflow to the ecs based on the sedimentary tm contents 14 3 55 2 17 6 69 8 and 12 6 mg kg 1 for pb zn cu cr and as respectively in the near old yellow estuary for the ecs including the yre more than 96 of the total sediment load from the yangtze river and other middle sized rivers of the qiantangjiang minjiang jiulongjiang and jiaojiang was deposited in the ecs shelf due to the alongshore dispersal riverine sediments carried by the coastal currents and the barrier effect of the northward twc whereas only 4 of suspended sediment is cross shelf seaward transported and enters the nw pacific ocean deng et al 2006 accordingly a box model was applied to construct a sedimentary tm budget for the ecs shelf without considering the small outflow of tm fig 6 the calculated results showed that the total annual sediment flux of tm in the ecs covering an area of 96 180 km2 was as follows pb 14 633 t yr zn 49 440 t yr cu 11 047 t yr cr 48 078 t yr and as 5738 t yr among the burial contributions of tm the fluvial flux of metals constituted 74 10 790 t yr for pb 80 39 738 t yr for zn 99 10 940 t yr for cu 48 23 102 t yr for cr and 47 2924 t yr for as compared to this contribution the aerosol dry and wet deposition only accounted for 2 6 12 and 2 for pb zn cu and cr respectively of the total metal inputs of the ecs our data set also revealed the existence of additional transport pathways of tm to the ecs hung and ho 2014 reported that typhoon and earthquake events appeared to enhance the concentration and inventory of suspended tm 2 5 fold above normal conditions along submarine canyons off southwestern taiwan notably a similar condition can also be found in the ecs and the additional tm sources in this area can be regarded simply as the outcome of typhoon events the seafloor sediments in the ecms coastal areas of the very shallow seabed 20 m water depth often were reworked by intense waves and currents due to frequent modern floods and storm events that occurred in these areas tian et al 2019 and most of the resuspended materials transported eastward to the inner shelf of the ecs li et al 2015 according to our estimates the coastal eroded material input accounts for 14 2087 t yr for pb 2 1080 t yr for zn and 35 16 853 t yr for cr of the total tm delivered into the ecms moreover similar to the budget of cu in the ys the remainder of more than 2953 t yr of cu was net exported to the open seas outside the ecs shelf to balance the budget unlike other metals including pb zn cu and cr the fluvial inputs and atmospheric flux of as only accounted for 52 of the total burial fluxes in the ecms suggesting that a potential additional as sources might be directly from in coastal cities in china according to the statistical data china produced an estimated 16 000 26 000 t yr of arsenic trioxide and remained the world s leading producer during 1990 2016 usgs 2016 in china growing domestic use of as since the early 1970s was mainly driven by agricultural pesticide application and mine and smelter waste discharge mandal and suzuki 2002 sun et al 2019 after 2000 the significant increase in domestic consumption of as was primarily related to the intensive manufacturing industries developing batteries and semiconductors and engaging in glassmaking and alloys shi et al 2017 notably a large proportion 60 of as related enterprises are located in the developed coastal areas of china such as the shandong hebei liaoning zhejiang and jiangsu provinces nbsc 2016 among those provinces shandong province was suggested to be the largest contributor to anthropogenic emission of as 400 t in 2010 cheng et al 2015 it indicated that the domestic consumption of as in the coastal areas is likely to be responsible for the large burial flux of as 11 968 t yr in the ecms to provide the amount of the total tm pb zn cu cr and as fluxes within and out of the ecms and of their relative importance for global tm cycle a summary information regarding the inputs burial and outputs of tm for the ecms is given as a schematic diagram in fig 6 the box model indicated that more than 95 of the tm inputs from riverine discharge coastal erosion and atmospheric deposition are ultimately deposited in the sediments of the ecms whereas only 5 of the tm inputs could escape from the ecms and enter the nw pacific ocean our results suggested that the ecms constitutes a major final repository of tm at the asia scale and thus contributes to remove a majority of tm from the riverine input and atmospheric deposition our findings are therefore likely representative of most marginal seas greatly influenced by large river systems on a global scale additionally it should be noted that the ecms may play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycling of tm in the global oceans by delivering 0 5 104 t yr of tm to the pacific ocean 3 3 sources and fates of tm 3 3 1 source analyses because of the larger reactive surface capable of adsorption and flocculation tm are usually concentrated in weathering derived terrestrial fine particles and their relationships can be used to reveal the burial fate of pollutants in an aquatic environment gier and johns 2000 sedimentary al and mz are positively correlated in the ecms fig 7 suggesting that the natural weathering process of grain size impose a significant control on the levels of conservation al however the slope and intercept coefficients of the linear relationship between al and mz in the ecms sediments varied from 0 936 1 296 and 3 006 0 400 probably reflecting that the migration of element al e g aluminosilicate minerals from land to ocean has a close relation with source characteristics and physicochemical weathering intensity in addition mn and al were moderately positively corrected r 0 304 p 0 01 figure s3 indicating that mn in the ecms was mainly from lithogenic origin and exported from catchments through river discharge to further reveal the intensity of anthropogenic perturbation 95 linear predicted intervals 95 lpi was calculated by the al tm relationships as shown in fig 7 tm concentrations of pb zn cu and cr exhibited strongly positive correlations with the element al r 0 697 0 880 0 861 and 0 871 with p 0 001 respectively suggesting that variation in sedimentary grain size was a significant factor dominating most contaminants distributions in ecsm surface sediments moreover some points lying outside the upper 95 lpi for the ecms are easily discernible on the plots pb 4 points zn 2 cu 3 and cr 2 suggesting that these sediment samples were probably influenced by anthropogenic point and nonpoint sources weisberg et al 2000 principal components analysis pca approach is statistically robust in that it utilizes a large number of individual samples 179 samples in this case to examine the interrelations among a set of variables pca involving the sedimentary tm pb zn cu cr and as major constituents al fe and mn and grain size mz φ was conducted to assist in the evaluation of the origins dispersion pathways and sinks of tm the result of pca identified the two principal components pcs based on the factor loadings which could be explained by 86 of the cumulative variance eigenvalues 1 table s4 pc1 and pc2 contribute 71 and 15 of the total variance respectively the interrelationships of these elements with the pcs could be attributed to two major sources anthropogenic influence and geological origin the conservative elements of al fe and mz are generally associated with crustal sources and less affected by anthropogenic activities which are positively correlated with pb zn cu and cr in pc1 fig 8 indicating that these metals may have a common lithogenic input from the chinese rivers catchments and were controlled by continental weathering processes when transported from bedrocks to sampling sites however the lack of correlations between as and mz nor as and al or fe in pc2 the poor correlations between as and these three elements indicate that much of as in the ecms was not likely derived from natural rock soil weathering processes mn in pc2 indicates that mn in the form of hydr oxides probably act as an efficient scavenger for as in aquatic environments note that this observation of moderate and positive correlation between mn and as might reflects that the mobilization and preservation of sedimentary as was probably related to riverine mn hydr oxides figure s4 unlike other elements and trace metals as exhibits quite different sensitivity to mobilization at ph values sarkar and paul 2016 changes in chemical properties of redox potential eh and ph can alter the chemical speciation i e iii 0 iii and v toxicity and bioavailability of as during the early diagenesis processes thereby affecting the geochemical cycle of as in the marine environment widerlund and ingri 1995 chaillou et al 2003 eggleton and thomas 2004 in the ecms an oxidative eh ranging from 372 6 637 4 mv 544 9 mv on average and weakly alkali to neutral ph varying from 7 51 8 32 7 94 on average environment was observed in the surface sediments of the bs and ys and overlying water of the ecs figure s5 according to the eh ph diagram for the as species in the aquatic environment figure s6 the haso 4 2 of as v seems to be the dominant compound at ph 7 langmuir et al 1999 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 it may be efficiently adsorbed and or co precipitation with minerals i e hydr oxides mn and fe widerlund and ingri 1995 gorny et al 2015 given that eh and ph in the ecms do not change dramatically i e eh 300 mv and ph 7 an oxidized alkaline condition may not be sufficient to affect the affinity of as to surface sediment and cause the microbial reduction of as v to as iii in the marginal seas that are characterized by shallow water depths eggleton and thomas 2004 even so there was not sufficient evidence to exclude the potential effect of early diagenetic processes on the cycling of as in these surface sediments for example the high values of mn and low as concentrations that occurred in the central ys sediments can be not fully explained additional works including dissolved mn fe and as concentrations in porewaters extracted from sediments are needed to elucidate the behavior of as during the early diagenesis processes 3 3 2 impact of sedimentary hydrodynamic conditions on the fate of tm the east asia monsoon dominated hydrodynamic conditions and sediment discharge in the ecms largely influence dispersal pattern of river derived suspended sediment wang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 fang et al 2018 thereby affecting the behavior and fate of suspended particle associated pollutants although more than 80 of the total sediments from the yellow and yangtze rivers occur in summer from may to october 90 of suspended sediment was preferentially accumulated in the subaqueous delta areas because of low energetic conditions and high setting velocity cwrc 1950 2016 wang et al 2017 in winter from late september to early april in the next year with the gradual strengthening of the northwest monsoon and erosion processes enhanced coastal currents waves tides and other disturbance events could trigger resuspension and release of contaminants from the sediments by affecting the affinity of fine particles and contaminants after resuspension processes non cohesive sediments sand dominated 7 5 clay with bimodal frequency curves were observed in the sediments off mud areas figure s7 and s8 implying that a large quantity of fine sediments 4 12 φ fractions deposited in proximal deltas to be preferentially winnowed and resuspended at low shear stress due to frequent physical sorting processes law et al 2008 in contrast cohesive sediments i e clay dominated in the estuarine turbidity maximum zone and mud areas of the ecms under poor sorting thus maintain their similar characteristics of grain size distribution and the form of suspended aggregates for the hydrodynamic dominated sediment budget of the bs and ys alexander et al 1991 stated that approximately 9 15 of the total sediment load from the yellow river is transported and deposited in the ys based on the 210pb and 14c dated sediments in the ys bi et al 2011 qiao et al 2016 and wang et al 2016 estimated that the annual net spm flux from the bs to the ys was 4 84 14 0 mt yr during 2000 2016 accounting for approximately 3 10 of the total sediment discharge of yellow river at the gage station lijin during the same period and the transportation in the winter season contributed approximately 80 of the annual net spm flux from the bs to the ys bi et al 2011 however in this study the calculated exchange contributions of tm from the bs to the ys accounting for 35 43 of the total tm influx are 3 to 12 fold higher than the proportions of export fluxes of riverine suspended particle fig 6 regarding the discrepancy we posit that resuspension can cause the release of the fine grained particles associated with pollutants and induce the long distance transport of sediments in winter ultimately resulting in low levels of tm in coarse sediments that accumulate in the original areas additionally enhanced flocculation in the coastal environment was an important factor influencing the behavior of fine particles and associated tm through the formation of mineral flocs organic mineral flocs etc milligan and law 2013 through flocculation dissolved tm and aggregation of particles tended to be scavenged and deposited with a high setting velocity at the interface between river runoff and saltwater intrusion via the chemical processes of adsorption and coagulation ip et al 2007 milligan et al 2007 the strong correlation between clay fraction and tm further confirmed that fined grained sediments e g clay mineral fe mn oxide and organic matter with high potential cohesion or adhesion are the main carriers of suspended tm fig 7 this finding is also in accordance with the finding that on average 78 82 of the total suspended tm loading from the yellow river accumulated in the 16 μm fractions yao et al 2015 this finding can explain why spm delivers only 3 10 of the present yellow river s annual total sediment load across the bohai strait but may account for up to 35 43 of the total tm budget in the yre and ecs based on numerous boring and seismic profiles saito et al 2001 and liu et al 2006 proposed that approximately 68 of the yangtze derived sediments accumulated in the delta estuary systems and that the remaining approximately 32 were resuspended and transported southward and deposited in the inner shelf of ecs during winter this is in accordance with our finding that the calculated burial fluxes of tm in the yre and ecs are 58 892 t yr and 70 045 t yr respectively which further highlights the importance of hydrodynamic dominated tm transportation from the delta to the shelf region of the ecms additionally when these terrestrial materials and pollutants were transported from the estuary to shelf areas affected by the barrier effect of the warm currents including the twc kc and yswc flowing to northward throughout the year fig 1a the spreading rates and ranges of these materials into the deep ocean were limited consequently large deposits of tm exist in the interface of the coastal cold currents and the warm currents 3 4 future trends in tm burial future tm burial in sediment are associated with many factors including the direction and strength of global and regional policies for controlling anthropogenic pollutants emissions development of local economies and populations and factors related to suspended sediments and associated tm fluxes from rivers álvarez vazquez et al 2018 thorne et al 2018 in china anthropogenic emissions of tm significantly increased from the enhanced industrial activities in the 1980s and peaked in the mid 1990s due to china s reform and open door policy initiated in 1978 and a poor awareness of governmental environmental protections sun et al 2019 after gradually realizing the frequent occurrence of tm pollution the chinese government strengthened environmental regulations and also invested large amounts of money in environmental restoration during 2004 2016 nbsc 2016 in particular investments in environmental protection facilities control of atmospheric waste gas emissions and treatment of industrial sewage discharges in 2000 increased 3 10 fold compared to the investments in 1999 fig 9 a as a result the atmospheric emissions of cr and as in china gradually decreased between 2000 and 2012 tian et al 2015 and national pb cr and as discharge in wastewater decreased approximately 3 4 times from 337 8 to 106 1 t in 2012 2016 nbsc 2016 fig 9b and 9c additionally because of the phasing out of the use of leaded gasoline in 2000 a sharp decrease in atmospheric emission of pb was presented in 2001 more importantly as the main pathway of tm from a drainage basin to the ecms the load of suspended particle tm transported from the yangtze river to the sea decreased approximately 4 5 times 78 from 15 7 to 3 5 104 t during the period 2000 2014 qiao et al 2007 müller et al 2008 2012 he 2011 yin et al 2016 the significant decrease in the tm load matches the reduction in the suspended particle load 65 measured at the datong station with sediment discharge of 340 mt yr in 2000 and 120 mt yr in 2014 cwrc 1950 2016 fig 9d most of fluvial sediments trapped in the three gorges dam constructed in 2003 was probably responsible for the recent reduction in the sediment load from the yangtze river yang et al 2018 these findings indicate that in addition to efforts controlling anthropogenic emissions to the river the decreased tm load might be partly caused by the trapping of tm in terrestrial reservoirs at present in the context of increased awareness of environmental protection and dam construction and soil conservation induced decreases in suspended particles and the associated supply of tm to the ecms it is reasonable to assume that the burial fluxes of tm in the ecms in the future will be significantly altered and will continuously decrease overall our results indicate that riverine discharge is a key factor regulating high tm flux to sediment over the shelf notably china is the world s leading producer and consumer of tm however tremendous runoff and terrestrial particle derived from the natural weathering processes dilute the levels of sedimentary tm in the ecms which can cover up the effect of anthropogenic inputs on global ocean tm cycling and even the earth s surface additionally hydrodynamically driven resuspension and transportation of sedimentary particles constrain the fate of tm burial on large river dominated continental margins and should be considered in budget and flux of global oceanic tm burial and export 3 5 uncertainties in budget calculations there were some uncertainties related to the tm budget calculation for the ecms in terms of time scales the calculated tm fluxes of riverine discharge and atmospheric deposition were restricted to the sampling period but the surface sediments 3 cm in the ecms actually reflected deposits of different times due to the different sediment accumulation rates sr in the bs ys and ecs varied from 0 3 2 5 0 01 0 7 and 0 01 3 6 cm yr respectively thus the estimated tm inventories for the ecms represent approximately 10 30 years of deposition however the input fluxes of riverine runoff and atmosphere deposition should be calculated for thirty years to obtain significant values but such an extensive database did not exist for the study areas long term regular observations of river derived tm in the yellow river 1980 1986 1997 1998 2000 2001 2004 2005 and 2013 2014 and yangtze river 2000 2001 2006 2007 2008 2009 2009 2010 and 2013 2014 can reflect the reliable characteristics of riverine export of modern tm from the chinese major rivers to the ecms table s3 additionally the decline in loads of suspended particle from the chinese major rivers e g the yangtze and yellow rivers and the occurrence of episodic events might change the modern sediment accumulation rates in the ecms which also causes the uncertainties of the budget calculation as regards the time of sampling although the time scale of sedimentary tm level in this study can cover multiple dry and flood seasons over recent decades the samples in the ecms collected from different time of year can influence the concentration of tm at the water sediment interface milligan and law 2013 and therefore budget construction overall the uncertainties involved in the tm budget construction e g estimates for the burial flux riverine discharge and atmospheric deposition were carefully considered through the combined evaluation of available uncertainties literature provided errors in measurements and when not available estimation of uncertainties based on

conducted including a long term monitoring of riverine discharge tm from the chinese major rivers and the direct atmospheric deposition in the ecms b survey based data for all tm biota sediments suspended particle material and water c extensive investigation of the vertical distributions of tm bulk density and 210pb 137cs derived sr in sediment cores d and more reliable statistics and methods for quantitative analysis of the relative contribution of tm from coastal erosion 4 conclusions in this study we provide an extensive and comprehensive investigation of sedimentary tm spatial distribution patterns controlling factors flux and budget in the ecms the principal conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 the pc and pca analysis revealed that pb zn cu and cr were mainly derived from natural sources and were controlled by sediment composition and regional hydrodynamics however as mainly originated from anthropogenic activities and was probably carried by mn in form of hydr oxides through river discharge 2 the tm burial flux μg cm2 yr in the ecms ranged from 0 2 133 2 for pb 0 6 456 6 for zn 0 2 148 7 for cu 0 7 446 3 for cr and 0 1 66 5 for as with average values of 17 4 21 1 57 4 74 5 16 4 23 7 58 8 3 6 and 9 0 12 6 μg cm2 yr respectively tm burial flux showed a gradual seaward decrease with increasing distance from coastline and estuaries reflecting the noticeable influence of the outflow of land based sources 3 the estimated sediment mass inventories were approximately 28 324 92 192 23 434 94 560 and 11 968 t yr for pb zn cu cr and as within the

17492,to achieve a better understanding of global biogeochemical cycle and budget of trace metals tm in the world s ocean a comprehensive study of the level fate and burial flux of tm in surface sediment from the eastern china marginal seas ecms was conducted the results indicated that pb zn cu and cr were highly concentrated in mud deposits and primarily controlled by the natural processes of sediment composition and regional hydrodynamics whereas as had a close association with mn and was mainly derived from anthropogenic activity the sediment mass inventories of pb zn cu cr and as in the ecms 220 780 km2 were estimated to be 28 324 92 192 23 434 94 560 and 11 968 t yr respectively a mass budget model revealed that riverine runoff coastal erosion input and atmospheric deposition dry and wet constituted 62 76 15 37 and 2 9 of the total pb zn and cr influxes respectively while more than 4 690 t of cu annually outflowed to the open seas to balance the budget more importantly we found that the sum of the estimates of these contributions tended to fall short of the calculated depositional fluxes of as implying that anthropogenic activities probably have altered the natural geochemical cycle of as our results suggest that the ecms constitutes a major final repository of tm at the asia scale however the burial fluxes of trace metals are expected to decrease due to enhanced environmental investments by the chinese government and decreased suspended particulate tm loads from the chinese major rivers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords trace metals cycle depositional fate eastern china marginal seas 1 introduction contamination of toxic metals in aquatic ecosystems sediments water organisms etc is a global concern due to its abundance persistence and environmental toxicity schwarzenbach et al 2006 apart from sediment contamination which may lead to water quality deterioration and a series of adverse impacts on the natural system the propagation of tm throughout the food chain can induce a carcinogenic effect on the human body and other risks to the aquatic ecosystem generally these hazardous pollutants originate from both geochemical sources and anthropogenic activities and ultimately enter fluvial systems via surface runoff or associated with aerosols by atmospheric transport globally atmospheric deposition is recognized as a major contribution of tm to open oceans whereas terrestrial derived metals by river discharge and surface runoff are predominantly deposited and largely stored in continental shelf sediments owing to geochemical controls viers et al 2009 coastal margins not only are critical transition zones linking terrestrial with the oceanic system but also have sensitive responses to human induced pressures and are acknowledged to be a major dynamic component of the global tm cycle and budget audry et al 2004 bauer et al 2013 according to the statistical data approximately 44 of the world s population lives within 150 km of a coastline syvitski et al 2005 thus large amounts of toxic metals released from anthropogenic activities will enter the aquatic environment previous studies suggested that 90 of global riverine sediments and associated pollutants are ultimately buried on the continental margins where the thicknesses of metals deposits are often the largest although they occupy only 10 of global ocean area martin and windom 1991 moreover it has been widely shown that the vast majority up to 90 of tm carried downstream in a river are bound to fine suspended particulates and colloids whereas riverine dissolved flux is less than 3 of the total riverine flux due to their relative insolubility in water surface sediments with oxic conditions of circa neutral ph poulton and raiswell 2000 consequently these shallow narrow river influenced marginal sediments are geochemical reservoirs for tm and have significant influences on the oceanic tm dynamic and even the earth s biogeochemical metal cycles to a considerable degree the ecms in the western pacific ocean bounded by china comprising the bohai sea bs yellow sea ys and east china sea ecs are highly exposed to industrial and anthropogenic activity and characterized with a high loading of terrigenous materials from major chinese rivers which account for 10 of the world s river sediment supply to the ocean milliman and meade 1983 moreover as the world s leading producer and consumer china produced an estimated 4 6 mt yr of pb 5 5 mt yr of zn 1 7 mt yr of cu 3 3 mt yr of cr and 0 03 mt yr of as during the period 2011 2015 particularly for the consumption of pb zn and as which accounted for 47 of global metals consumption usgs 2016 additionally because of amounts of large dam construction in the catchments of the yellow river and yangtze river over the past decades the environment and water ecosystem in those rivers have degraded drastically müller et al 2008 yang et al 2014 wang et al 2017 and the yangtze river ranked globally as the 6th of the most polluted rivers in the world including sedimentation and industrial and agricultural domestic waste by the world wildlife fund for nature wong et al 2007 additionally asian dust and pollutants are transported eastward by winter monsoon to the eastern marginal areas and even to the western pacific ocean hu et al 2012 and thus the ecms receives an abundant atmospheric deposition of aerosol tm therefore the ecms are scientifically unique and ideal target areas to study coastal trace metal cycling and budgets to our knowledge most studies have focused on the spatial distribution potential risk and source identification of sedimentary tm in single environmental compartments he 2011 gao et al 2018 liang et al 2018 unfortunately research on the interaction of trace metals with environmental factors and mass budgets in the ecms as an integrated system is lacked which to some degree would limit our better understanding of the significance of the ecms on the regional and global biogeochemical cycles of trace elements therefore the primary objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the distribution patterns and sources of tm pb zn cu cr and as over the spatially extensive region of the ecms 2 quantify the amounts of tm that have entered passed through and ultimately deposited in the ecms and elucidate their relationships with dry wet atmospheric deposition in these areas and terrestrial discharge from the chinese rivers and 3 reveal the ultimate fate of sedimentary tm with the alteration of physicochemical properties on a global scale this study can provide a new database and a case study for coastal oceanic trace metal cycling and budget assessments 2 material and methods 2 1 study areas and sample collection the ecms is characterized by high loadings of suspended particles that are mainly delivered by the yellow river and the yangtze river during 1954 2015 with annual sediment discharges of 6 6 108 t yr and 3 7 108 t yr respectively wu et al 2020 annual suspended sediment load supplied from other local coastal rivers liaohe qiantang min etc total sediment load 0 8 108 t yr and erosion from the old yellow river mouth 2 56 108 t yr amounted to 3 36 108 t yr qiao et al 2017 and they account for nearly 25 of total sediment fluxes into ecms due to widely ranging water depths from approximately 4 m to more than 200 m off the ecms and the east asian monsoon the ecms have a complex set of circulation systems including the coastal cold and warm currents fig 1 a the complex dynamic conditions lead to the formation of delta deposits in the yellow river estuary and yangtze river estuary fine grained mud deposits defined by mean grain size 6φ in the central bs the northern yellow sea nys the southern yellow sea sys and along the zhejiang fujian coasts sand deposits in the outer shelf and mixtures of sand silt and clay on the coast and inner shelf in total 179 surface sediment samples depths of 0 3 cm in the ecms were collected from the 27 sites in the bs and 64 sites in the ys in december 2012 and december 2017 by personnel deployed on the r v dong fang hong 2 in may 2015 and the 88 sites in the ecs in december 2016 conducted by r v run jiang 1 and ke xue 3 fig 1b all surface samples were obtained using a stainless steel grab or box samplers and stored at 4 6 c for further laboratory analysis 2 2 analysis procedure the measurement of sediment grain size was performed with a laser granulometer malvern uk mastersizer2000 after decomposing organic matter and eliminating carbonate with 30 h2o2 and 10 hcl respectively the relative measurement error was 3 water content w in surface sediments was determined by comparison of the weights of wet and dried samples dry bulk density ρd g cm 3 was measured as the ratio between dry sample weight and fixed volume 17 18 g cm 3 briefly the ρd in sediments was calculated by the bulk density ρ g cm 3 and w ρd ρ 1 w determination of major elements al fe and mn and tm pb zn cu cr and as contents in sediment was undertaken using an x ray fluorescence spectrometer xrf spectr ltd germany following the detailed procedures previously described in liu and fan 2011 the accuracy of each batch of samples was checked by the analysis of the certified national reference material gbw07314 and parallel samples the recoveries of most certified samples performed by multiple analyses varied between 85 and 110 the analytical errors of the measured certified reference were less than 9 table s1 notably to eliminate the analytical errors deviating from known values of the certified reference material sedimentary tm concentrations were normalized based on the measured values of the reference material in each batch

sedimentary tm in the ecms the mass inventories of sedimentary tm in the present sampling region were estimated according to ingall and jahnke 1994 and lin et al 2013 the study area of the ecms including the bs ys yre and ecs was divided into 179 homogeneous compartments table s2 each compartment represented one sampling site that was made to be near the center of their corresponding sectors the surface deposition flux of tm fburial t yr was calculated based on the following equation 2 f buri al i 1 179 c i a i s i ρ i where ci is the tm concentration in the sediment sample mg kg 1 ρi is the measured dry bulk density at site i g cm 3 figure s1 ai is the compartment water surface area represented by site i km2 and si is the sediment accumulation rate for each sample site spatial variation in sedimentation rates sr throughout the ecms was derived from the 210pb 137cs analyses of 158 cores see table s2 measured by the previous studies demaster et al 1985 alexander et al 1991 huh and su 1999 hu et al 2002 su and huh 2002 liu et al 2006 lim et al 2007 yang and youn 2007 hu et al 2011 wang et al 2013 li et al 2016 sun et al 2017 qiao et al 2017 jia et al 2018 the sr of sedimentary tm used in our study sites was interpolated using the contour map presented in fig 2 and the ordinary kriging interpolation method table s2 the ordinary kriging analysis was conducted using arcgis 10 3 the root mean square error rmse value between the predicted and observed sr 158 cores using ordinary kriging analysis was calculated to be 0 4 small rmse value and a strong correlation between the predicted and observed sr r2 0 803 p 0 001 suggest the model with few errors and more accurate predictions figure s2 2 3 2 calculation of the f riverine discharge f riverine discharge was estimated by summing up the total 18 riverine particulate fpd t yr and dissolved fdd t yr tm loads around the ecms with each calculated by multiplying the measured average annual concentration of particulate c tm p mg kg and dissolved tm c tm d μg l and their corresponding annual mean suspended sediment discharge s s d t yr and water discharge w d m3 yr respectively text s2

of wet atmospheric deposition 200 g m3 duce et al 1991 liu and zhou 1999 wang et al 2011 the f atmospheric deposition t yr in the ecms was calculated by the following equation 8 f a t m o s p h e r i

and the 1012 is the unit conversion factor that changes μg m2 yr to t m2 yr 2 3 4 calculation of the f coastal erosion the coastal erosion dominated export fluxes of tm t yr from the abandoned yellow river estuary to the ecs are estimated by multiplying the mean concentrations of sedimentary tm t m mg kg measured at sampling sites i e h21 and h30 near this abandoned estuary and the mean annual export flux ess t yr eisma 1998 saito et al 2001 hu and yang 2001 9 f c o a s t a l e r o s i o n tm ess 10 6 additionally the contributions of coastal erosion tm from the old yellow river estuary to the ys and from the zhejiang fujiang coastal region to the ecs are calculated by deducting the total influxes of atmospheric deposition riverine discharge and the import through the bs strait and the yscc from the estimated inventories of tm 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial distribution of trace metals the spatial distributions of sedimentary grain size al fe mn and tm in the surface sediments from the ecms are shown in fig 3 the spatial distribution of sedimentary mean grain size mz was consistent with the al and fe varying from 1 8 7 8φ 37 320 3 84 865 4 mg kg and 16 585 8 51 304 4 mg kg with average values of 5 4φ 64 503 1 mg kg and 33 009 2 mg kg respectively the ecms had mn concentration ranges of 233 3 1852 5 mg kg with a mean value of 702 8 mg kg tm concentrations mg kg 1 of pb zn cu cr and as in surface sediments of the ecms ranged from 11 3 44 7 25 5 122 5 1 9 41 4 45 1 107 1 and 1 1 34 3 with mean levels of 22 5 71 5 19 4 73 7 and 9 7 mg kg 1 respectively additionally the spatial distribution of tm exhibits significant variability under different sediment textures remarkable enrichment of sedimentary pb zn cu and cr was mainly found in the fine grained deposits around the river mouth areas and the depocenters of the bs ys and ecs light gray area in fig 1a with values up to 2 20 fold higher in mud areas whereas the low natural level of tm was constrained in the coarse grained areas including the northeastern outer shelf of the ecs the western nearshore area of the sys and the eastern offshore region of the nys fig 3 high concentrations of mn were observed in the central ys and estuarine areas however sedimentary as displayed a distinct variation with relatively higher values that mainly occurred in the estuarine regions of the ecms and decreasing values offshore towards the outer shelf suggesting that the distribution of as mainly depends directly on riverine discharge from the chinese major rivers 3 2 deposition flux and budget of tm 3 2 1 estimation of tm flux and sedimentary inventory the sedimentary tm burial flux in the ecms was estimated by the measured dry sediment density and previously reported radionuclide 210pb 137cs derived sr figure s1 and fig 2 as shown in table 1 and fig 4 the spatial distribution of tm depositional flux in the study areas showed an apparent regional variability ranging from 0 2 133 2 17 4 21 1 0 6 456 6 57 4 74 5 0 2 148 7 16 4 23 7 0 7 446 3 58 8 71 0 0 1 66 5 9 0 12 6 μg cm2 yr for pb zn cu cr and as respectively the estimated tm fluxes in this study were comparable with those of the coastal sepetiba bay in brazil gomes et al 2009 but they were lower than those of coastal areas with a strong impact of anthropogenic perturbations around the world such as the hailing bay of a typical mariculture zone in south china zhang et al 2012 the thi vai estuary in southern vietnam costa böddeker et al 2018 and the coastal belt of pakistan ali et al 2015 in contrast these results were still several orders magnitude higher than the fluxes observed in estuarine sediments with low sr such as in the galician rias estuary of the iberian peninsula álvarez vazquez et al 2017 and the auckland estuary williamsonb and morrisey 2000 among the subregions in the ecms relatively high tm deposition fluxes were observed in the yangtze river estuary and the yellow river delta they were significantly higher than those of the bs ys and ecs areas off the estuary fig 4 compared to the tm levels the spatial distribution patterns of tm flux exhibited significant differences in some subregions such as the central mud areas of the nys and sys and the western coastal areas of the ys fig 3 tm flux near the western coasts of the ys was noticeably higher than that for the central mud deposits of the ys but the tm concentrations on the western coasts of the ys were very low due to a relatively high dynamic condition therefore this discrepancy occurred in the spatial patterns of tm level and flux and might be explained by varying modern mass accumulation rates mar in the ecms according to the 210pb and 137cs derived sr fig 2 the yangtze river subaqueous delta and the yellow river estuary exhibit high sediment accumulation rates with sr of 2 5 4 cm yr demaster et al 1985 and generally 0 5 cm yr a maximum value of 9 59 cm yr qiao et al 2017 respectively in comparison relatively lower sr 0 1 0 5 cm yr occur in the offshore regions of the bs ys and ecs yang et al 2003 more importantly the gradual decrease trend in tm burial flux from the estuary to open seas coincided well with the spatial distribution of sr indicating that high tm burial flux in the continental margins was controlled by river borne tm inputs from both the yangtze and yellow rivers in china and high sedimentation based on the estimated tm deposition flux and accumulation areas of each of the divided homogenous sectors the sedimentary inventories of tm were estimated to be 28 324 92 192 23 434 94 560 and 11 968 t yr for pb zn cu cr and as within the ecms areas 220 780 km2 respectively fig 5 at a global scale it can be estimated that 658 104 t yr with annual particle and dissolved flux 104 t yr of 77 0 3 for pb 262 2 3 for zn 96 5 7 for cu 164 2 7 for cr and 46 2 4 for as respectively were transported to the continental margins based on the average composition of suspended sediments in the world rivers poulton and raiswell 2000 carey et al 2002 viers et al 2009 and the global modern sediment fluxes of 12 610 mt yr and runoff of 38 540 km3 yr syvitski et al 2005 notably these results also showed that sedimentary tm inventories in the ecms account for approximately 4 of the global fluvial export and play a significant role in the global tm cycle 3 2 2 sedimentary tm budget in the ecms a mass budget of tm in the continental regions is developed as a primary step towards understanding the local sources and transport processes controlling tm fates in a highly complex coastal area oram et al 2008 to further evaluate to what extent terrestrial runoff atmospheric deposition and other origins control tm export a mass balance budget describing the statuses of sedimentary tm was constructed by assembling all of the fluxes estimated in the previous section tables s2 s3 and fig 6 for the bs the tm fluxes input via river inflows were several orders of magnitude higher than the atmospheric deposition fluxes suggesting that the direct atmospheric contribution into the bs area is relatively small among the rivers around the bs the yellow river is the major source of tm into the bs accounting for 79 89 93 93 and 93 for pb zn cu cr and as of the total fluvial inputs respectively based on the inputs of tm via the river discharge atmospheric fallout and sedimentary tm flux in the bs it was calculated that 47 for pb 47 for zn 35 for cu 43 for cr and 83 for as of their total influxes were deposited in the bs of which approximately 17 65 were finally transported out of the bohai strait and eastward to the ys for the ys approximately 227 t yr for pb 3995 t yr for zn 220 t yr for cu and 244 t yr for cr and 97 t yr for as from atmospheric dry and wet deposits table s3 however it should be noted that the tm input from direct atmospheric deposition and indirectly transported from river discharge only constituted 70 of the total burial fluxes of tm in the ys suggesting that additional diffuse sources from the old yellow river estuary have to be taken into account as they may disrupt the balance of the fluvial system dominated margins and modify the sedimentary tm budget audry et al 2004 reported that the mobilization of riverbed sediments and associated tm triggered by local human activities and intense floods may strongly alter the heavy metal budget of rivers dominating estuary shelf areas to our knowledge the old yellow river delta has suffered intense erosion since the river mouth shifted from the ys to bs since 1855 and eroded materials from that abandoned estuary largely influence the modern sediment burial in the ys wang and jiang 2007 reported that the 500 mt yr of spm resuspended from the seabed of the old yellow river mouth in winter is an important source for the ys zhou et al 2014 showed that 790 mt yr of sediment were eroded in the areas with water depths of 20 m and 75 80 of those eroded materials were transported to the offshore slope in the western ys and the mud belt of the central ys recently qiao et al 2017 proposed that more than 23 7 mt yr of fine grained sediment total sediment 262 mt yr eroded from the coastal sand areas in the old yellow river estuary are transported to the ys therefore it can be inferred that the potential sources of sedimentary tm derived from the erosion processes in the old yellow river to the ys could not be ignored if we assume that all the tm fluxes were completely deposited in the ys it can be roughly estimated that at least 40 3600 t yr for pb 27 7673 t yr for zn and 35 10 991 t yr for cr were deposited in the ys from the reworked sediments in the old yellow river delta notably excess cu escaped from the ys to the okinawa trough with net export fluxes of at least 1740 t yr obtained by mass balance in fact the eroded materials in the old yellow river estuary were not completely transported to the ys eisma 1998 and hu and yang 2001 estimated that 100 110 mt yr of that was delivered to the ecs along with the yscc thus it can be roughly calculated that approximately 1430 t yr for pb 5530 t yr for zn 1760 t yr for cu 6980 t yr for cr and 1260 t yr for as were outflow to the ecs based on the sedimentary tm contents 14 3 55 2 17 6 69 8 and 12 6 mg kg 1 for pb zn cu cr and as respectively in the near old yellow estuary for the ecs including the yre more than 96 of the total sediment load from the yangtze river and other middle sized rivers of the qiantangjiang minjiang jiulongjiang and jiaojiang was deposited in the ecs shelf due to the alongshore dispersal riverine sediments carried by the coastal currents and the barrier effect of the northward twc whereas only 4 of suspended sediment is cross shelf seaward transported and enters the nw pacific ocean deng et al 2006 accordingly a box model was applied to construct a sedimentary tm budget for the ecs shelf without considering the small outflow of tm fig 6 the calculated results showed that the total annual sediment flux of tm in the ecs covering an area of 96 180 km2 was as follows pb 14 633 t yr zn 49 440 t yr cu 11 047 t yr cr 48 078 t yr and as 5738 t yr among the burial contributions of tm the fluvial flux of metals constituted 74 10 790 t yr for pb 80 39 738 t yr for zn 99 10 940 t yr for cu 48 23 102 t yr for cr and 47 2924 t yr for as compared to this contribution the aerosol dry and wet deposition only accounted for 2 6 12 and 2 for pb zn cu and cr respectively of the total metal inputs of the ecs our data set also revealed the existence of additional transport pathways of tm to the ecs hung and ho 2014 reported that typhoon and earthquake events appeared to enhance the concentration and inventory of suspended tm 2 5 fold above normal conditions along submarine canyons off southwestern taiwan notably a similar condition can also be found in the ecs and the additional tm sources in this area can be regarded simply as the outcome of typhoon events the seafloor sediments in the ecms coastal areas of the very shallow seabed 20 m water depth often were reworked by intense waves and currents due to frequent modern floods and storm events that occurred in these areas tian et al 2019 and most of the resuspended materials transported eastward to the inner shelf of the ecs li et al 2015 according to our estimates the coastal eroded material input accounts for 14 2087 t yr for pb 2 1080 t yr for zn and 35 16 853 t yr for cr of the total tm delivered into the ecms moreover similar to the budget of cu in the ys the remainder of more than 2953 t yr of cu was net exported to the open seas outside the ecs shelf to balance the budget unlike other metals including pb zn cu and cr the fluvial inputs and atmospheric flux of as only accounted for 52 of the total burial fluxes in the ecms suggesting that a potential additional as sources might be directly from in coastal cities in china according to the statistical data china produced an estimated 16 000 26 000 t yr of arsenic trioxide and remained the world s leading producer during 1990 2016 usgs 2016 in china growing domestic use of as since the early 1970s was mainly driven by agricultural pesticide application and mine and smelter waste discharge mandal and suzuki 2002 sun et al 2019 after 2000 the significant increase in domestic consumption of as was primarily related to the intensive manufacturing industries developing batteries and semiconductors and engaging in glassmaking and alloys shi et al 2017 notably a large proportion 60 of as related enterprises are located in the developed coastal areas of china such as the shandong hebei liaoning zhejiang and jiangsu provinces nbsc 2016 among those provinces shandong province was suggested to be the largest contributor to anthropogenic emission of as 400 t in 2010 cheng et al 2015 it indicated that the domestic consumption of as in the coastal areas is likely to be responsible for the large burial flux of as 11 968 t yr in the ecms to provide the amount of the total tm pb zn cu cr and as fluxes within and out of the ecms and of their relative importance for global tm cycle a summary information regarding the inputs burial and outputs of tm for the ecms is given as a schematic diagram in fig 6 the box model indicated that more than 95 of the tm inputs from riverine discharge coastal erosion and atmospheric deposition are ultimately deposited in the sediments of the ecms whereas only 5 of the tm inputs could escape from the ecms and enter the nw pacific ocean our results suggested that the ecms constitutes a major final repository of tm at the asia scale and thus contributes to remove a majority of tm from the riverine input and atmospheric deposition our findings are therefore likely representative of most marginal seas greatly influenced by large river systems on a global scale additionally it should be noted that the ecms may play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycling of tm in the global oceans by delivering 0 5 104 t yr of tm to the pacific ocean 3 3 sources and fates of tm 3 3 1 source analyses because of the larger reactive surface capable of adsorption and flocculation tm are usually concentrated in weathering derived terrestrial fine particles and their relationships can be used to reveal the burial fate of pollutants in an aquatic environment gier and johns 2000 sedimentary al and mz are positively correlated in the ecms fig 7 suggesting that the natural weathering process of grain size impose a significant control on the levels of conservation al however the slope and intercept coefficients of the linear relationship between al and mz in the ecms sediments varied from 0 936 1 296 and 3 006 0 400 probably reflecting that the migration of element al e g aluminosilicate minerals from land to ocean has a close relation with source characteristics and physicochemical weathering intensity in addition mn and al were moderately positively corrected r 0 304 p 0 01 figure s3 indicating that mn in the ecms was mainly from lithogenic origin and exported from catchments through river discharge to further reveal the intensity of anthropogenic perturbation 95 linear predicted intervals 95 lpi was calculated by the al tm relationships as shown in fig 7 tm concentrations of pb zn cu and cr exhibited strongly positive correlations with the element al r 0 697 0 880 0 861 and 0 871 with p 0 001 respectively suggesting that variation in sedimentary grain size was a significant factor dominating most contaminants distributions in ecsm surface sediments moreover some points lying outside the upper 95 lpi for the ecms are easily discernible on the plots pb 4 points zn 2 cu 3 and cr 2 suggesting that these sediment samples were probably influenced by anthropogenic point and nonpoint sources weisberg et al 2000 principal components analysis pca approach is statistically robust in that it utilizes a large number of individual samples 179 samples in this case to examine the interrelations among a set of variables pca involving the sedimentary tm pb zn cu cr and as major constituents al fe and mn and grain size mz φ was conducted to assist in the evaluation of the origins dispersion pathways and sinks of tm the result of pca identified the two principal components pcs based on the factor loadings which could be explained by 86 of the cumulative variance eigenvalues 1 table s4 pc1 and pc2 contribute 71 and 15 of the total variance respectively the interrelationships of these elements with the pcs could be attributed to two major sources anthropogenic influence and geological origin the conservative elements of al fe and mz are generally associated with crustal sources and less affected by anthropogenic activities which are positively correlated with pb zn cu and cr in pc1 fig 8 indicating that these metals may have a common lithogenic input from the chinese rivers catchments and were controlled by continental weathering processes when transported from bedrocks to sampling sites however the lack of correlations between as and mz nor as and al or fe in pc2 the poor correlations between as and these three elements indicate that much of as in the ecms was not likely derived from natural rock soil weathering processes mn in pc2 indicates that mn in the form of hydr oxides probably act as an efficient scavenger for as in aquatic environments note that this observation of moderate and positive correlation between mn and as might reflects that the mobilization and preservation of sedimentary as was probably related to riverine mn hydr oxides figure s4 unlike other elements and trace metals as exhibits quite different sensitivity to mobilization at ph values sarkar and paul 2016 changes in chemical properties of redox potential eh and ph can alter the chemical speciation i e iii 0 iii and v toxicity and bioavailability of as during the early diagenesis processes thereby affecting the geochemical cycle of as in the marine environment widerlund and ingri 1995 chaillou et al 2003 eggleton and thomas 2004 in the ecms an oxidative eh ranging from 372 6 637 4 mv 544 9 mv on average and weakly alkali to neutral ph varying from 7 51 8 32 7 94 on average environment was observed in the surface sediments of the bs and ys and overlying water of the ecs

kinniburgh 2002 it may be efficiently adsorbed and or co precipitation with minerals i e hydr oxides mn and fe widerlund and ingri 1995 gorny et al 2015 given that eh and ph in the ecms do not change dramatically i e eh 300 mv and ph 7 an oxidized alkaline condition may not be sufficient to affect the affinity of as to surface sediment and cause the microbial reduction of as v to as iii in the marginal seas that are characterized by shallow water depths eggleton and thomas 2004 even so there was not sufficient evidence to exclude the potential effect of early diagenetic processes on the cycling of as in these surface sediments for example the high values of mn and low as concentrations that occurred in the central ys sediments can be not fully explained additional works including dissolved mn fe and as concentrations in porewaters extracted from sediments are needed to elucidate the behavior of as during the early diagenesis processes 3 3 2 impact of sedimentary hydrodynamic conditions on the fate of tm the east asia monsoon dominated hydrodynamic conditions and sediment discharge in the ecms largely influence dispersal pattern of river derived suspended sediment wang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 fang et al 2018 thereby affecting the behavior and fate of suspended particle associated pollutants although more than 80 of the total sediments from the yellow and yangtze rivers occur in summer from may to october 90 of suspended sediment was preferentially accumulated in the subaqueous delta areas because of low energetic conditions and high setting velocity cwrc 1950 2016 wang et al 2017 in winter from late september to early april in the next year with the gradual strengthening of the northwest monsoon and erosion processes enhanced coastal currents waves tides and other disturbance events could trigger resuspension and release of contaminants from the sediments by affecting the affinity of fine particles and contaminants after resuspension processes non cohesive sediments sand dominated 7 5 clay with bimodal frequency curves were observed in the sediments off mud areas figure s7 and s8 implying that a large quantity of fine sediments 4 12 φ fractions deposited in proximal deltas to be preferentially winnowed and resuspended at low shear stress due to frequent physical sorting processes law et al 2008 in contrast cohesive sediments i e clay dominated in the estuarine turbidity maximum zone and mud areas of the ecms under poor sorting thus maintain their similar characteristics of grain size distribution and the form of suspended aggregates for the hydrodynamic dominated sediment budget of the bs and ys alexander et al 1991 stated that approximately 9 15 of the total sediment load from the yellow river is transported and deposited in the ys based on the 210pb and 14c dated sediments in the ys bi et al 2011 qiao et al 2016 and wang et al 2016 estimated that the annual net spm flux from the bs to the ys was 4 84 14 0 mt yr during 2000 2016 accounting for approximately 3 10 of the total sediment discharge of yellow river at the gage station lijin during the same period and the transportation in the winter season contributed approximately 80 of the annual net spm flux from the bs to the ys bi et al 2011 however in this study the calculated exchange contributions of tm from the bs to the ys accounting for 35 43 of the total tm influx are 3 to 12 fold higher than the proportions of export fluxes of riverine suspended particle fig 6 regarding the discrepancy we posit that resuspension can cause the release of the fine grained particles associated with pollutants and induce the long distance transport of sediments in winter ultimately resulting in low levels of tm in coarse sediments that accumulate in the original areas additionally enhanced flocculation in the coastal environment was an important factor influencing the behavior of fine particles and associated tm through the formation of mineral flocs organic mineral flocs etc milligan and law 2013 through flocculation dissolved tm and aggregation of particles tended to be scavenged and deposited with a high setting velocity at the interface between river runoff and saltwater intrusion via the chemical processes of adsorption and coagulation ip et al 2007 milligan et al 2007 the strong correlation between clay fraction and tm further confirmed that fined grained sediments e g clay mineral fe mn oxide and organic matter with high potential cohesion or adhesion are the main carriers of suspended tm fig 7 this finding is also in accordance with the finding that on average 78 82 of the total suspended tm loading from the yellow river accumulated in the 16 μm fractions yao et al 2015 this finding can explain why spm delivers only 3 10 of the present yellow river s annual total sediment load across the bohai strait but may account for up to 35 43 of the total tm budget in the yre and ecs based on numerous boring and seismic profiles saito et al 2001 and liu et al 2006 proposed that approximately 68 of the yangtze derived sediments accumulated in the delta estuary systems and that the remaining approximately 32 were resuspended and transported southward and deposited in the inner shelf of ecs during winter this is in accordance with our finding that the calculated burial fluxes of tm in the yre and ecs are 58 892 t yr and 70 045 t yr respectively which further highlights the importance of hydrodynamic dominated tm transportation from the delta to the shelf region of the ecms additionally when these terrestrial materials and pollutants were transported from the estuary to shelf areas affected by the barrier effect of the warm currents including the twc kc and yswc flowing to northward throughout the year fig 1a the spreading rates and ranges of these materials into the deep ocean were limited consequently large deposits of tm exist in the interface of the coastal cold currents and the warm currents 3 4 future trends in tm burial future tm burial in sediment are associated with many factors including the direction and strength of global and regional policies for controlling anthropogenic pollutants emissions development of local economies and populations and factors related to suspended sediments and associated tm fluxes from rivers álvarez vazquez et al 2018 thorne et al 2018 in china anthropogenic emissions of tm significantly increased from the enhanced industrial activities in the 1980s and peaked in the mid 1990s due to china s reform and open door policy initiated in 1978 and a poor awareness of governmental environmental protections sun et al 2019 after gradually realizing the frequent occurrence of tm pollution the chinese government strengthened environmental regulations and also invested large amounts of money in environmental restoration during 2004 2016 nbsc 2016 in particular investments in environmental protection facilities control of atmospheric waste gas emissions and treatment of industrial sewage discharges in 2000 increased 3 10 fold compared to the investments in 1999 fig 9 a as a result the atmospheric emissions of cr and as in china gradually decreased between 2000 and 2012 tian et al 2015 and national pb cr and as discharge in wastewater decreased approximately 3 4 times from 337 8 to 106 1 t in 2012 2016 nbsc 2016 fig 9b and 9c additionally because of the phasing out of the use of leaded gasoline in 2000 a sharp decrease in atmospheric emission of pb was presented in 2001 more importantly as the main pathway of tm from a drainage basin to the ecms the load of suspended particle tm transported from the yangtze river to the sea decreased approximately 4 5 times 78 from 15 7 to 3 5 104 t during the period 2000 2014 qiao et al 2007 müller et al 2008 2012 he 2011 yin et al 2016 the significant decrease in the tm load matches the reduction in the suspended particle load 65 measured at the datong station with sediment discharge of 340 mt yr in 2000 and 120 mt yr in 2014 cwrc 1950 2016 fig 9d most of fluvial sediments trapped in the three gorges dam constructed in 2003 was probably responsible for the recent reduction in the sediment load from the yangtze river yang et al 2018 these findings indicate that in addition to efforts controlling anthropogenic emissions to the river the decreased tm load might be partly caused by the trapping of tm in terrestrial reservoirs at present in the context of increased awareness of environmental protection and dam construction and soil conservation induced decreases in suspended particles and the associated supply of tm to the ecms it is reasonable to assume that the burial fluxes of tm in the ecms in the future will be significantly altered and will continuously decrease overall our results indicate that riverine discharge is a key factor regulating high tm flux to sediment over the shelf notably china is the world s leading producer and consumer of tm however tremendous runoff and terrestrial particle derived from the natural weathering processes dilute the levels of sedimentary tm in the ecms which can cover up the effect of anthropogenic inputs on global ocean tm cycling and even the earth s surface additionally hydrodynamically driven resuspension and transportation of sedimentary particles constrain the fate of tm burial on large river dominated continental margins and should be considered in budget and flux of global oceanic tm burial and export 3 5 uncertainties in budget calculations there were some uncertainties related to the tm budget calculation for the ecms in terms of time scales the calculated tm fluxes of riverine discharge and atmospheric deposition were restricted to the sampling period but the surface sediments 3 cm in the ecms actually reflected deposits of different times due to the different sediment accumulation rates sr in the bs ys and ecs varied from 0 3 2 5 0 01 0 7 and 0 01 3 6 cm yr respectively thus the estimated tm inventories for the ecms represent approximately 10 30 years of deposition however the input fluxes of riverine runoff and atmosphere deposition should be calculated for thirty years to obtain significant values but such an extensive database did not exist for the study areas long term regular observations of river derived tm in the yellow river 1980 1986 1997 1998 2000 2001 2004 2005 and 2013 2014 and yangtze river 2000 2001 2006 2007 2008 2009 2009 2010 and 2013 2014 can reflect the reliable characteristics of riverine export of modern tm from the chinese major rivers to the ecms table s3 additionally the decline in loads of suspended particle from the chinese major rivers e g the yangtze and yellow rivers and the occurrence of episodic events might change the modern sediment accumulation rates in the ecms which also causes the uncertainties of the budget calculation as regards the time of sampling although the time scale of sedimentary tm level in this study can cover multiple dry and flood seasons over recent decades the samples in the ecms collected from different time of year can influence the concentration of tm at the water sediment interface milligan and law 2013 and therefore budget construction overall the uncertainties involved in the tm budget construction e g estimates for the burial flux riverine discharge and atmospheric deposition were carefully considered through the combined evaluation of available uncertainties literature provided errors in measurements and when not available estimation of uncertainties based on statistical analysis e g relative standard deviation rsd and root mean square error rmse are constrained furthermore to improve the accuracy of estimation for tm budgets future research needs to be conducted including a long term monitoring of riverine discharge tm from the chinese major rivers and the direct atmospheric deposition in the ecms b survey based data for all tm biota sediments suspended particle material and water c extensive investigation of the vertical distributions of tm bulk density and 210pb 137cs derived sr in sediment cores d and more reliable statistics and methods for quantitative analysis of the relative contribution of tm from coastal erosion 4 conclusions in this study we provide an extensive and comprehensive investigation of sedimentary tm spatial distribution patterns controlling factors flux and budget in the ecms the principal conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 the pc and pca analysis revealed that pb zn cu and cr were mainly derived from natural sources and were controlled by sediment composition and regional hydrodynamics however as mainly originated from anthropogenic activities and was probably carried by mn in form of hydr oxides through river discharge 2 the tm burial flux μg cm2 yr in the ecms ranged from 0 2 133 2 for pb 0 6 456 6 for zn 0 2 148 7 for cu 0 7 446 3 for cr and 0 1 66 5 for as with average values of 17 4 21 1 57 4 74 5 16 4 23 7 58 8 3 6 and 9 0 12 6 μg cm2 yr respectively tm burial flux showed a gradual seaward decrease with increasing distance from coastline and estuaries reflecting the noticeable influence of the outflow of land based sources 3 the estimated sediment mass inventories were approximately 28 324 92 192 23 434 94 560 and 11 968 t yr for pb zn cu cr and as within the ecms 220 780 km2 respectively riverine discharge coastal erosion and atmospheric deposition input play important roles in delivering tm to the ecms accounting for 62 76 15 37 and 2 9 of the sedimentary inventories of pb zn and cr respectively in terms of the outputs approximately 4690 t yr cu were net transported out of the continental shelf to balance the budget according to our estimates the fluvial inputs and atmospheric fluxes of as only constituted less than 40 of the total as input delivered into the ecms suggesting that large amounts of as might be directly from the discharge of domestic consumption of as in the coastal areas in china declaration of competing interest authors declare that is no conflict of interest that could have appeared to influence the work

17493,serious concerns have been raised regarding antibiotic resistance genes args with respect to their potential threat to human health wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been considered to be hotspots for args in this study high throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction ht qpcr was used to profile size dependent args and mobile genetic elements mges divided by particle associated pa assemblages 3 0 μm free living fl bacteria 0 2 3 0 μm and cell free cf dna 0 2 μm in two full scale wwtps plants a and b and a receiving stream the results revealed that fl args were predominant in wwtps and the receiving stream especially in the final effluent of both plants more than 40 types of cf args and cf mges were detected with absolute abundances ranging from 6 0 0 7 105 to 1 0 0 2 108 copies ml in wastewater and relatively high abundances were also detected in the final effluent of the two plants suggesting that cf args were important sources spreading from the wwtps to the receiving environment plant a exhibited higher log removal of size fractionated args and mges than was observed for plant b which was attributed to the enhanced settleability of pa assemblages and fl bacteria by additional macrophytes and chemical coagulants ultraviolet disinfection had limited effects on args and mges of the pa and fl fractions which was probably ascribed to the protective matrices of the particles and cell walls the bacterial communities of the two plants were significantly different among the size fractions p 0 01 the variation partitioning analysis vpa indicated that the microbial community structures and mges contributed a variation of 68 2 in total to the relative abundance changes of size fractionated args procrustes analyses and mantel tests showed that the relative abundances of args were significantly correlated with bacterial community structures these results suggested that the bacterial community structures and mges might have been the main drivers of the size fractionated arg disseminations this study provides novel insights into size fractionated args and mges in full scale wwtps and may lead to the identification of key targets to control the spread of args graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance genes particle associated assemblages free living bacteria cell free dna wastewater 1 introduction antibiotic resistance genes args are emerging contaminants that have caused public concern due to their potential threat to human health and the situation has worsened in recent years concomitant with an increased risk of no efficacious medicine being available who 2014 wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been considered to be hotspots of args not only because they receive domestic or hospital wastewater sources caucci et al 2016 quintela baluja et al 2019 but also because they discharge effluent containing diverse args with relatively high loads lee et al 2017 furthermore bacteria frequently detected in wwtps can be the hosts of diverse args haaber et al 2016 which may threaten human health through direct or indirect pathways cai zhang 2013 particles are important carriers of nutrients and microorganisms chahal et al 2016 some types of bacteria tend to form biofilm or become attached to particles an et al 2016 which can be classified as particle associated pa assemblages ganesh et al 2014 gonsalves et al 2017 while others are prone to a free living fl lifestyle with no association with inorganic substances huang et al 2018 full size fractionated analyses are frequently conducted in investigations of communities of marine and riverine microorganisms d ambrosio et al 2014 jackson et al 2014 savio et al 2015 the results have indicated that microbial community structures are significantly different between pa assemblages and fl bacteria particle integrity and residence time likely contributed to the differences between the pa and fl bacterial communities in coastal north carolina d ambrosio et al 2014 in the mississippi river basin the differences between the two fractions may be ascribed to the proportional abundances of major bacterial lineages such as alphaproteobacteria cyanobacteria and planctomycetes jackson et al 2014 however little is known regarding the dynamics of antibiotic resistome abundances influenced by different bacterial forms in activated sludge systems or effluent receiving streams the effects of small sized microbes on the fate of args in water was recently studied but this investigation was limited to a narrow size range 0 2 0 45 μm ma et al 2019 investigations of microorganisms based on their sizes may be conducive to promoting a fundamental understanding of arg dissemination among different fractions however few studies have investigated bacteria harboring args and mobile genetic elements mges with respect to different size fractions although previous studies have investigated intracellular and extracellular args liu et al 2018 sui et al 2019 intracellular dna is still needed to be further separated to unveil possible fundamental understanding a recent study demonstrated that fl bacteria cannot be effectively removed in wwtps huang et al 2018 different pore sizes such as 3 0 μm guo et al 2018 5 0 μm rieck et al 2015 and 10 0 μm riemann winding 2001 have been used to distinguish pa from fl bacteria while a pore size of 3 0 μm has been widely used to separate pa assemblages from fl bacteria d ambrosio et al 2014 garneau et al 2009 guo et al 2018 jackson et al 2014 milici et al 2016 savio et al 2015 therefore this convention was used in our study except for args in the pa and fl fractions extracellular dna here defined as cell free cf dna passes through 0 22 μm pore sized filters and potentially harbors args which may pose potential risks to the receiving environment zhang et al 2018 this has rarely been studied cell free dna can be released by cell associated bacteria after their decay and lysis which is a common occurrence during wastewater treatment thereby resulting in its ubiquitous presence in the final effluent together with resistance genes encoded enzymes in living cells although a recent study investigated cf dna only four args and no mges were targeted to assess their occurrence and dissemination in wwtps zhang et al 2018 which is far fewer than the known arg subtypes stedtfeld et al 2018 to the best of our knowledge no previous studies have systematically investigated the full size fractionated antibiotic resistome with respect to pa fl and cf args in wwtps in this study high throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction ht qpcr was used to target 283 major args and 12 mges to assess the proliferation of args and mges among pa assemblages fl bacteria and cf dna in two full scale wwtps and a receiving stream this research aimed to 1 investigate the diversity and distribution of args and mges among size fractionated bacteria in the wwtps and an effluent receiving stream 2 reveal the co occurrence patterns of args and mges among pa assemblages fl bacteria and cf dna and 3 reveal the dynamics of structures of size fractionated bacterial communities and their possible relationships with args and mges 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and pretreatment in our previous study yu et al 2020 although the relative abundances of args were reduced in a tridimensional eco biological wwtp teb wwtp e 114 39 28 77 n 23 37 39 64 marked as plant a args and mges were still abundant in the final effluent to further decipher the occurrences and dynamics of arg abundance in wastewater treatment system we selected this teb wwtp to conduct size fractionated investigations plant a was rebuilt from the anaerobic anoxic oxic aao process by adding internal bio modules and macrophytes on top of the biological reactors in 2013 as a control another wwtp plant b running the conventional aao process

than that of plant b table s1 we attempted to determine whether different treatment levels can affect the fate of size fractionated resistance genes the design parameters of the two wwtps are presented in tables s2 and in a previous study yu et al 2020 water samples were collected from six sites along the treatment processes of plants a and b including the influent s1 biological reactor effluent s4 second sedimentation tank sst effluent s5 and final effluent s6 respectively in the biological reactors of both plants activated sludge as samples were obtained from the anoxic tank s2 and aerobic tank s3 respectively to evaluate the impact of treated effluent on the receiving stream water samples were also collected before g2 and after g3 and g4 the discharge site from plant a table s3 fig s1 both the obtained water and activated sludge samples were transported on ice within 1 h to the laboratory in plant a ph value dissolved oxygen do and temperature were measured in situ using portable device hq30d hach usa as numerous studies have adopted 3 0 μm and 0 2 μm pore sizes to divide the two fractions d ambrosio et al 2014 guo et al 2018 milici et al 2016 savio et al 2015 we used these sizes in our study wastewater samples were first filtered through 3 0 μm pore sized polycarbonate membranes millipore ireland to intercept pa assemblages the filtrates were then filtered through 0 22 μm polycarbonate membranes millipore to collect the fl bacteria the membranes were cut into pieces and transferred to 50 ml centrifuge tubes for further processing separation of the pa and fl fractions was completed within 24 h the tubes were stored at 20 c before dna extraction the final filtrates through 0 22 μm membranes were used to extract cf dna according to previous studies eichmiller et al 2016 ficetola et al 2008 zhang et al 2018 briefly 726 ml of absolute ethanol aladdin industrial corp shanghai china and 33 ml of a 3m sodium acetate anhydrous solution aladdin industrial corp were added to 330 ml filtrate sample the mixtures were stored at 20 c overnight and then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min at 4 c subsequently the supernatant was discarded and the centrifuge tubes were stored at 20 c until dna extraction 2 2 dna extraction dna was extracted from all the pa fl and pretreated cf using a fastdnatm spin kit for soil mp biomedical france protocols

et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 among which clinical class 1 integron integrase gene inti 1 clinic is considered to be closely related to human health gillings et al 2015 additionally inti 1 clinic can be used as a proxy or indicator for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 therefore inti 1 clinic was selected the designed primers are listed in table s5 the ht qpcr conditions were as follows 1 denaturation at 95 c for 10 min 2 40 amplification cycles at 95 c for 30 s and extension at 60 c for 30 s the efficiency of amplification beyond the range of 1 8 to 2 2 was considered to be a negative result the relative and absolute abundances of args and mges were calculated as described in previous studies chen et al 2019b su et al 2015 and shown as follows 1 gcn 1 0 31 ct 10 3 2 r gcn gc n 16 s 3 a a 16 s r where gcn is the gene copy number ct is the threshold cycle and 31 is set as the detection limit r is the relative abundance of each arg or mge and 16s is the 16s rrna gene measured by ht qpcr a is the absolute abundance of arg or mge and a 16s is the absolute abundance of the 16s rrna gene of each sample measured by real time qpcr rt qpcr it should be noted that the volume of size fractionated sample was taken into account when calculating the absolute abundance 2 4 real time quantitative pcr a lightcycler 480 system roche was applied to rt qpcr to quantify the 16s rrna according to the plasmid standard curve each sample was analyzed in triplicate with a reaction volume of 20 μl including 10 μl 2 lightcycle 480 sybr green i master roche applied sciences 1 μl each primer 10 μm 1 μl dna template and 8 μl nuclease free water the 16s rrna primers were the same as those used in the ht qpcr the thermal reaction conditions were as follows 5 min pre incubation at 95 c then amplification of 40 cycles at 95 c for 15 s annealing at 60 c for 60 s and final extension at 72 c for 20 s the melting curve analysis was performed by increasing the temperature stepwise from 65 c to 97 c using 0 30 c 5s ramp rate with continuous fluorescence recording the results obtained by rt qpcr exhibited a significant correlation with those obtained by ht qpcr r 2 0 92 p 0 01 therefore the absolute abundance of 16s rrna can be used to calculate the absolute abundances of args and mges according to the equation 3 ouyang et al 2015 2 5 bacterial 16s rrna gene sequencing the bacterial communities of all the size fractionated samples were identified via sequencing the v4 v5 region of the 16s rrna gene with the forward primer 338f actcctacgggaggcagcag and the reverse primer 806r

uploaded to the ncbi sequence read archive sra with the bio project accession number prjna592276 the relative abundances of all the samples were normalized to the same lowest sequence depth 23478 2 6

mges were detected in the samples of the three different size fractions while vancomycin resistance genes were dominant in the unique types of cf args fig 1d the relative abundances of args and mges in fl bacteria were the highest among the three different types of samples in the two wwtps fig 2 a and b fig s6 while pa args and pa mges exhibited the lowest relative abundances the changes of the relative abundances of args and mges among the three different fractions were not significant k w test p 0 05 fig 2a c the relative abundance of each gene was shown using a heatmap fig s7 size fractionated args and mges from two plants together were significantly separated from each other revealed by pcoa fig 3 a table s6 two way permanova f 2 76 p 0 0003 the results indicated that the fates of args and mges were potentially different for different fractions and different plants specifically fl args were significantly separated from pa args in plant b fig s8b one way permanova f 3 64 p 0 0062 but not significantly separated in plant a fig s8a one way permanova f 2 40 p 0 06 which is probably ascribed to the different processes and biological structures between the two plants cell free args were significantly separated from other fractions in both plants permanova p 0 05 the absolute abundances of pa and fl args ranged from 4 3 0 6 106 to 1 6 0 2 109 copies ml and from 6 3 0 8 106 to 1 0 0 1 109 copies ml respectively which were significantly higher than that observed for cf args with ranges from 2 8 0 6 105 to 7 1 1 0 108 copies ml k w test p 0 01 fig 2e fig s9 these results number relative and absolute abundances suggested that fl fractions may have the potential to carry the most args compared to other two fractions the absolute abundances of pa mges fl mges and cf mges were within the ranges of 2 1 0 1 106 to 7 2 0 8 108 copies ml 2 7 0 3 106 to 5 5 0 2 108 copies ml and 2 1 0 5 105 to 2 9 0 4 107 copies ml respectively although the absolute abundances of cf mges were significantly lower than that observed for the other two fractions k w test p 0 01 fig 2f mges were prevalent in the cf fraction which cannot be neglected 3 2 changes of size fractionated args along the treatment processes and the receiving stream with respect to the influent pa and fl args and mges were the most dominant types figs s4 and s9 cell free args and mges were also ubiquitous in both plants suggesting that cf args are important sources of these genes from domestic sewage the highest relative abundances of fl args and fl mges were observed in the bioreactors of plant a fig s6a while cf args and cf mges exhibited higher relative abundances in plant b fig s6b the absolute abundances of pa args and pa mges were the highest up to 1 9 0 2 109 copies ml in the sampling site of as3 while fl args and fl mges were the most abundant in the bioreactors of plant b fig s9b both the relative and absolute abundances of pa args and pa mges increased in the aerobic zone compared to the anoxic zone in the two plants indicating that changes in the dissolved oxygen do level probably affected the shift in arg abundance a similar phenomenon was also observed in the cf fractions as shown in fig s10 dissolved total nitrogen d tn and cod d cod nitrate no 3 n and do were significantly correlated with size fractionated args in the biological reactors of plant a while dissolved total phosphorous d tp ammonia nh3 n and temperature were more correlated with size fractionated args in plant b these results suggested that physicochemical parameters may have the potential to influence the abundances of size fractionated args in different plants the removal of pa args and pa mges by clarification in plant a decrease of 2 05 orders of magnitude was much higher than that in plant b decrease of 0 97 orders of magnitude table 1 among the assayed fractions fl args and fl mges were the most abundant in the effluent of the ssts in both plants the levels of fl args and fl mges were reduced after precipitation in plant a by 0 63 orders of magnitude whereas they were enriched in plant b table 1 figs s9a and b in contrast the levels of cf args were slightly altered in both plants indicating that cf args were probably less influenced by sedimentation the relative abundances of pa args and pa mges increased after uv disinfection in both plants figs s6a and b while those of the cf fractions were slightly reduced in both wwtps ultraviolet lights had limited effects on both pa and fl args in the two treatment systems table 1 however contrasting results were observed for cf args and cf mges which were reduced by 1 34 orders of magnitude in plant a but increased by 0 15 orders of magnitude in plant b in the final effluent of both plants the absolute abundance of fl args was the highest indicating that they were the most important sources of args spreading from the hotspots of wwtps the cf args and cf mges had the same absolute abundances as pa args and pa mges in the effluent of plant b although the absolute abundances of cf args and cf mges in plant a were the lowest among the tested samples they still reached at 5 0 1 1 105 copies ml suggesting that cf args were also important sources into the receiving stream fl args were the dominant type among the assayed fractions with the highest detected numbers and absolute abundance in the receiving stream of plant a fig s4c fig s9c both the relative and absolute abundances of pa and fl args in the downstream gs3 and gs4 were lower than that of the upstream gs2 fig s6 fig s9c which was attributed to the high quality treated effluent from plant a 3 3 co occurrence patterns of size fractionated args and mges all the targeted mges were detected in the different size fractions at different treatment stages fig s7 the relative abundances of mges such as tnpa 04 were maintained at high levels throughout the treatment systems and in the receiving stream fig s6 and s7 pa and fl mges also exhibited strong correlations with pa fl and total args p 0 05 but not cf args p 0 05 fig s11 a network analysis was performed to reveal co occurrence patterns of size fractionated args and mges fig 4 figs s12 14 the patterns were different in three size fractions mges such as inti 1 clinic inti2 tp614 and tnpa 07 exhibited strong connections with diverse args in addition vpa revealed that mges contributed 32 2 to the relative abundance changes in size fractionated args fig 6d these results suggested that mges may play an important role in the disseminations of size fractionated args 3 4 characterizations of size fractionated microbial communities a total of 2208853 high quality sequences were obtained from the 44 size fractionated samples table s7 the shared and unique otus were presented in venn plots fig 5 a and b free living fractions exhibited the highest otu number with over 23 94 unique otus in both plants proteobacteria were the most common phylum in all the size fractionated samples fig s15 firmicutes patescibacteria and actinobacteria were predominant in the pa assemblages free living bacteria were dominated by epsilonbacteraeota bacteroidetes and patescibacteria while the dna of bacteroidetes patescibacteria and verrucomicrobia were abundant in the cf fraction in plant a gammaproteobacteria was the most abundant class in the pa assemblages fig 5c the relative abundances of campylobacteria saccharimonadia and clostridia in the fl fraction were significantly higher than that of the pa assemblages for the cf fraction the dna of bacteroidia and verrucomicrobiae were predominant in plant b clostridia alphaproteobacteria patescibacteria blastocatellia subgroup 4 actinobacteria and bacilli were abundant in the pa fraction fig 5d while campylobacteria parcubacteria and gracilibacteria were abundant in the fl fraction the dna of bacteroidia parcubacteria and wwe3 were dominant in the cf fraction the size fractionated bacterial communities exhibited different structures in the two plants pcoa was implemented to assess the distribution patterns of size fractionated bacterial communities from the two plants together fig 3b the structures of size fractionated bacteria communities were statistically significantly affected by the interaction effects of two factors of size fraction and plant two way permanova f 3 5 p 0 0001 independently pcoa of size fractionated bacterial communities were also conducted in plant a fig 5e and plant b fig 5f three size fractionated samples were significantly separated from each other in both plants adonis test plant a r 2 0 5026 p 0 0001 plant b r 2 0 4950 p 0 0001 the microbial communities varied among the size fractions at the genus level fig s16 the different fractions from the two plants were clustered fig s17 pseudomonas spp were much more abundant in the pa fractions than in the other two types of fractions whereas arcobacter spp were more plentiful in the fl fractions in the two plants the relative abundance of acinetobacter spp was high in the pa and fl fractions in both plants mycobacterium spp were more likely to exist in planktonic form in plant a and be enriched after passing through the biological reactors while other genera tended to be reduced aeromonas spp were ubiquitous in the fl and cf fractions but only in plant b these differences may affect arg proliferation 3 5 relationship between size fractionated args and microbial communities the procrustes analyses indicated that size fractionated microbial communities were significantly correlated with args in plant a m 2 0 61 p 0 01 fig 6 a and plant b m 2 0 57 p 0 01 fig 6b these were further confirmed by mantel tests plant a r 0 25 p 0 008 plant b r 0 48 p 0 001 as revealed by the rda fig 6c seven genera exhibited close relationship with all the size fractionated args pseudo f 4 2 p 0 002 acinetobacter spp b3 mycobacterium spp b4 arcobacter spp b5 and pseudomonas spp b6 exhibited close connection with fl args from the two plants separately mycobacterium spp b4 arcobacter spp b5 and legionella spp b7 were correlated with fl args in plant a fig s18a mycobacterium spp b4 and pseudomonas spp b6 exhibited strong correlations with pa args while arcobacter spp b5 was related with fl args in plant b fig s18b the cf dna of legionella spp b7 had positively connection with cf args in plant b these results suggested that size fractionated bacteria may exhibit different correlations with args in addition the vpa results suggested that microbial community structures contributed 24 7 to the changes in size fractionated args fig 6d these results indicated that microbial communities may be an important driver of arg proliferation 4 discussion although numerous previous studies have evaluated the potential fate of args in wwtps especially considering intercellular and extracellular args limitations for the understanding of intercellular arg dynamics still exist this was the major motivation to convey the study of size dependent args to separate intercellular parts into pa and fl fractions especially for the full size range the obtained results indicated that fl and cf args and mges in the effluents of the wwtps may be the bottleneck of controlling the spread of args from the hotspots into the receiving environmental compartments 4 1 different fates of pa fl and cf args in natural environmental matrices microbial communities are abundant in pa assemblages d ambrosio et al 2014 gonsalves et al 2017 suspended sludge with abundant microorganisms after acclimatization and enrichment is the foundation of activated sludge treatment systems attributed to their abilities to adsorb materials including nutrients particle matrices not only provide suitable habitats for microbial communities but also protect microorganisms from damage caused by adverse environmental conditions such as a lack of nutrients or uv disinfection chahal et al 2016 thus it was predictable that diverse and ubiquitous args and mges were detected in pa assemblages considering the significantly higher abundance of 16s rrna sequences compared with the fl fraction k w test p 0 01 fig 2d because fl bacteria have been shown to be ubiquitous in various environmental matrices ganesh et al 2014 guo et al 2018 huang et al 2018 they tend to carry diverse args and mges guo et al 2018 because the dynamics and occurrence of fl args may be different from those of pa args in wwtps we attempted to separate fl bacteria from pa assemblages bacterioplankton is also an important type of microorganism lifestyle guo et al 2018 that can be plentiful in wastewater and exhibit the potential of carrying more diverse args compared to pa assemblages artificial aeration in the aerobic tank and water flow turbulence can potentially lead to the desorption of bacteria from particle assemblages in addition planktonic bacteria are not easily settled resulting in their higher abundance at the end of wwtps cell free args originate from the lysis of cells and the cytolysis of dead bacteria that harbor diverse args vlassov et al 2007 zhang et al 2018 thus cf dna may not persist as long as the dna in the pa and fl fractions which is protected by cell walls and particulate matters in wastewater enzyme hydrolysis and photolysis can breakdown or damage cf dna zhang et al 2018 however cf dna harboring diverse args may exist long durations 25 d in the wastewater and receiving environments vlassov et al 2007 zhang et al 2018 highlighting the concern that args in receiving compartments could propagate through cf args thus cf dna is an important but overlooked source of args in wwtps and their receiving environments although we targeted much greater number of args and mges than a previous study only four args and no mges zhang et al 2018 some important genes are still missing metagenome and other illumina high throughput sequencing technologies should be conducted to provide more information regarding the cf args there might be interactions among the three size fractions in the wastewater treatment processes fig s19 it should be noted that pa assemblages could potentially consist of fl bacteria hunt et al 2008 riemann winding 2001 and the release of fl cells from large particles may also occur during in situ aeration or sampling ganesh et al 2014 hunt et al 2008 the proportional abundances of args among the three fractions can be affected by the operational parameters of biological reactors and the treatment processes such as hydraulic retention time mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and flocculation the mechanisms of interactions between the fractions are complicated and more field and laboratory scale trails should be conducted to provide fundamental sights into the size fractionated args in addition the mechanical division of pa and fl bacteria by the firm pore size filter may be biased guo et al 2018 thus continuous pore sized profiling of the living styles of bacterial assemblages as well as carried args in wastewater treatment should be investigated in the future cell free args are not only released from activated sludge but also can be absorbed by particulate matters poly et al 2000 suggesting that there may be dynamic conditions of sorption and desorption between cf dna and activated sludge the bias problem of quantification caused by different pcr systems should be of concern nolvak et al 2018 nolvak et al 2012 although the primers of 16s rrna and the fluorescent dye were the same in conducting qpcr and ht qpcr and the datasets of 16s rrna obtained were significantly correlated r 2 0 92 p 0 01 the amplification efficiencies and other issues may potentially challenge the results nolvak et al 2018 therefore further verification and in depth investigation warrant to avoid the bias 4 2 treatment processes influenced the dynamics of abundances of size fractionated args different biological structures may affect the dynamic portions and distribution of different size fractions a conceptual model regarding size fractionated args and mges from wwtp influent to the final receiving stream is presented in fig s20 due to the unique bioreactor structure of plant a which has additional bio packings and numerous macrophytes table s2 fig s1 bacteria tended to be attached to suspended sludge and biofilms macrophytes probably promoted adhesion between particles and bacteria via root exudates which contain low relative molecular weight organic materials and polymeric adhesive substances coskun et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 in contrast fl args were dominant in the traditional activated sludge system of plant b which did not have as much internal materials or aquatic plants abiotic factors may also affect the abundance dynamics of size fractionated args organic matter nitrogen phosphorus and temperature have been considered as important abiotic factors to affect the bacterial communities which further influences the abundance of args novo et al 2013 in addition numerous studies have demonstrated that args can be affected by oxygen availability during wastewater treatment and sludge or manure digestions diehl lapara 2010 lee et al 2017 ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 it has been found that tet o was specific for aerobic while tet w was specific for anaerobic bacteria chopra roberts 2001 the do concentrations can also influence community structure dynamics of size fractionated bacteria the strict anaerobic bacteroides commonly existed in wastewater treatment systems and much more abundant in fl lifestyle in both the two plants and the receiving stream fig s16 has been identified as a host for tet x speer et al 1991 the relative abundance of the tet c gene was observed to be significantly lower under anaerobic conditions compared to that observed under aerobic conditions in a previous study which is probably attributed to the reduction of the energetic burden of plasmid reproduction rysz et al 2013 controlling the do level is potentially conducive to restricting the proliferations of args rysz et al 2013 long term low do condition can reduce the relative abundances of args in swine wastewater treatment ma et al 2018 significant reductions in the abundances of args were also obtained in anaerobic reactors while the opposite phenomenon was observed in aerobic digesters diehl lapara 2010 however aerobic conditions are required during traditional wastewater treatment when considering the removal of other pollutants such as ammonia therefore optimal design of operational conditions and precise control of do concentration for wastewater treatment should be taken into account recent studies have demonstrated that biosolids sedimentation directly results in the removal of args ju et al 2019 lee et al 2017 most of which as revealed by our results were actually pa args particle associated args were observed to be carried by large particle matrices 3 0 μm and their depositions occurred much more readily in the ssts proia et al 2018 fl bacteria was more difficult to be settled down by gravity resulting in their relatively high prevalence in the effluent of the ssts the results highlighted that more attention should be paid to fl args to more efficiently control the spread of args the different structures of the biological reactors in plants a and b might have led to the discrepant behaviors of pa args and pa mges observed in the ssts the coagulant dosage in plant a pac table s2 also resulted in a good sedimentation performance of particles which is consistent with previous studies grehs et al 2019 lee et al 2017 that the use of coagulants and higher dosages can achieve higher arg removal table s8 in previous jar tests 5 args were efficiently removed by coagulation processes using fecl3 and polyferric chloride pfc as coagulants li et al 2017 therefore attempt to promote the settleability of fl fractions could probably increase arg removal uv disinfection has different effects on the three fractions studies have demonstrated that particles or organic matters can protect microorganisms from uv induced damage chahal et al 2016 lee et al 2017 furthermore microorganisms themselves possess the ability to repair uv damaged dna hassen et al 2000 in previous studies lee et al 2017 narciso da rocha et al 2018 slight increases of relative abundances of args were also observed at comparable uv doses table s8 suggesting that uv disinfection has limited effects on the reduction of args in addition cf args have typically been neglected in those studies because extracted dna is typically filtered by 0 22 or 0 45 pore sized membranes chen et al 2019a lee et al 2017 quintela baluja et al 2019 although cf dna is susceptible to environmental changes and can be completely damaged by uv light chahal et al 2016 it should be noted that some types of disinfectors which can make holes in bacterioplankton zhang et al 2019 will promote the release of cf dna uv disinfection also resulted in bacterial apoptosis leading to the release of cf args into the environment zheng et al 2017 in addition dissolved organic matter in the wastewater may protect the cf dna from the uv damage our results showing that numbers of detected cf args and cf mges increased after uv disinfection in plant b fig s4b were consistent with these findings the dose of uv irradiation makes a difference if used at levels higher than 200 mj cm2 mckinney pruden 2012 however the higher the dose the greater the energy consumption and other issues also arise therefore if they were not completely degraded then cf args were enriched thus comprehensive consideration is warranted for the removal of args by disinfection some fine particles could reach the discharge endpoints it is much easier to increase the removal efficiency of pa args through the use of filters or enhanced sedimentation although these methods would probably not be particularly useful for removing fl args membrane technologies can be used to potentially improve pa and fl arg removal by the effective interception of large and fine particles when passing through small pore sized membranes breazeal et al 2013 the receiving environment would benefit from the removal of args and mges carried by pa and fl fractions in the wwtps in contrast cf args can pass through 0 22 μm pore sized filters zhang et al 2018 and easily escape traditional wwtps resulting in substantial increases of potential risk to receiving environments which warrants particular attention although there were significant results obtained from the profiling of size fractionated antibiotic resistome from two full scale wwtps sampling from much more wwtps with different kinds of processes and wastewater should be broadly conducted to obtain general rules considering the fact that size fractionated args can be affected by the treatment processes 4 3 relationship between args and mges mobile genetic elements can promote in the dissemination of args through horizontal gene transfer hgt in different environmental matrices guo et al 2018 however to the best of our knowledge assessments of mges in size fractionated samples from wwtps have not previously been performed the specific pathways of arg dissemination through hgt in fractions may be different due to the higher relative abundance of fl mges than that of pa mges especially in plant b fig s6 in contrast cf args could probably be directly captured by bacteria to facilitate the transfer of args dong et al 2019 jain et al 1999 which deserves particular attention and further investigation integron integrases are typically associated with anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 and waste sources potentially resulting in their proliferation and transfer among bacteria in wwtps one of the most important integron integrase encoding genes inti 1 clinic has been confirmed as cassettes of over 80 genes conferring resistance to major antibiotics mazel 2006 as revealed by our results that inti 1 clinic was abundant in all the three fractions in both plants fig s7 more attention should be paid to the inti 1 clinic carried by cf dna and its potential in facilitating arg transfer although inti2 was observed to be encoded in fewer gene cassettes its ability to facilitate arg transfer cannot be neglected biskri mazel 2003 fluit schmitz 2004 mazel 2006 rowe magnus mazel 2002 for size fractionated inti2 it exhibited significantly correlations with diverse args fig 4 suggesting that it had great potential to act a role in the hgt of size fractionated args transposases such as tnpa 04 tnpa 07 and tp614 frequently reported in various environmental matrices and all the size fractions fig s7 may play an important role in the transfer and acquisition of args among bacteria karkman et al 2016 yan et al 2018 4 4 microbial communities drive the dynamics of antibiotic resistome structure the structural dynamics of microbial communities have been revealed to be the main driver of arg propagation han et al 2018 jia et al 2017 however few studies have explored the size fractionated bacteria in wwtps and the encoded args and mges bacteria with different lifestyles have been investigated in oceans rivers and lakes which has revealed that different community structures may influence their dynamics or functions ganesh et al 2014 jackson et al 2014 mou et al 2013 our results first revealed that size fractionated bacteria probably shift the dynamics of arg abundances in full scale wwtps and the receiving stream size fractionated bacterial lineages were significantly correlated with arg profiles mantel test r 0 31 p 0 001 the vpa results also revealed that the microbial community contributed 24 2 to the changes of size fractionated args fig 6c specifically among the assayed fractions pa bacteria were highly abundant in wwtps fig 2d and potentially carried diverse args in activated sludge systems electrostatic interaction and hydrophobic forces can facilitate the combination of particles and microorganisms templeton et al 2005 resulting in relatively stable niches where microorganisms can obtain nutrients and survive environmental changes guo et al 2018 free living bacteria were also common in the two plants and can easily escape from the ssts resulting in high levels of their harbored args and mges in the effluents the separated fractions also exhibited close connections free living bacteria could be adsorbed and desorbed by pa assemblages while cell free dna was released after the lysis of dead cells from pa and fl bacteria the genera arrying specific args and mges can increase their potential risks to human beings cai zhang 2013 vaz moreira et al 2014 pseudomonas spp can harbor diverse args sib et al 2019 pseudomonas aeruginosa has been reported to be a superbug for having resistance to multiple antibiotics breidenstein et al 2011 fortunately pseudomonas spp were dominant in the pa fractions which was likely to be settled down in the sst with lower relative abundance in the effluent fig s14 arcobacter spp were observed to be resistant to commonly used antibiotics collado figueras 2011 acinetobacter spp have the ability to capture args yang et al 2014 and mycobacterium spp were identified as being possible carriers of multidrug and tetracycline resistance genes vaz moreira et al 2014 half of aeromonas spp may play roles in the proliferation of args blasco et al 2008 vaz moreira et al 2014 considering the ubiquity of fl bacteria with ability to escape wwtps measures targeting the removal of fl bacteria such as mycobacterium strains may aid in controlling the spreading of genera carrying args from treated wastewater different structures of size fractionated microbial communities are probably influenced by various factors the sludge concentration table s3 may influence the distribution of pa and fl bacteria as fl bacteria can probably be adhered onto particulate matters furthermore root exudates from macrophytes and coagulants pac added in plant a may facilitate the adhesions between particles and bacteria bulgarelli et al 2015 li et al 2017 previous studies have also demonstrated that microbial communities can be shaped by root exudates hu et al 2018 zhalnina et al 2018 but how the exudates affect the structures of size fractionated microbial communities needs further profiling most bacteria especially those in the pa fraction can be removed by traditional as systems by sedimentation however fine particles coated with bacteria and bacterioplankton may escape from sedimentation tanks furthermore these genera exhibited protection matrixes from uv disinfection which is the last line of defense in wwtps lu et al 2015 therefore priority genera list size dependent corresponding to effective controlling technologies should be built to better reduce the spreading of args 5 conclusion our study conveys a novel insight into the size fractionated args of two full scale wwtps and the receiving stream which may help to better understand the dynamics of antibiotic resistome structures in wastewater treatment systems size fractionated antibiotic resistome separated by particle associated assemblages free living bacteria and cell free dna exhibited different abundances which can be affected by the treatment processes cell free args were not efficiently removed by clarifying and ultraviolet disinfection and were abundant in the final effluents of the wwtps which should be of concern when considering the control of arg spreading vpa analyses indicated that the bacterial communities and mges may be the main two drivers in the propagations of size fractionated args additionally the microbial communities of the three size fractions exhibited different structures which might drive the interphase exchanges of args as size portioning was conducted

17493,serious concerns have been raised regarding antibiotic resistance genes args with respect to their potential threat to human health wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been considered to be hotspots for args in this study high throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction ht qpcr was used to profile size dependent args and mobile genetic elements mges divided by particle associated pa assemblages 3 0 μm free living fl bacteria 0 2 3 0 μm and cell free cf dna 0 2 μm in two full scale wwtps plants a and b and a receiving stream the results revealed that fl args were predominant in wwtps and the receiving stream especially in the final effluent of both plants more than 40 types of cf args and cf mges were detected with absolute abundances ranging from 6 0 0 7 105 to 1 0 0 2 108 copies ml in wastewater and relatively high abundances were also detected in the final effluent of the two plants suggesting that cf args were important sources spreading from the wwtps to the receiving environment plant a exhibited higher log removal of size fractionated args and mges than was observed for plant b which was attributed to the enhanced settleability of pa assemblages and fl bacteria by additional macrophytes and chemical coagulants ultraviolet disinfection had limited effects on args and mges of the pa and fl fractions which was probably ascribed to the protective matrices of the particles and cell walls the bacterial communities of the two plants were significantly different among the size fractions p 0 01 the variation partitioning analysis vpa indicated that the microbial community structures and mges contributed a variation of 68 2 in total to the relative abundance changes of size fractionated args procrustes analyses and mantel tests showed that the relative abundances of args were significantly correlated with bacterial community structures these results suggested that the bacterial community structures and mges might have been the main drivers of the size fractionated arg disseminations this study provides novel insights into size fractionated args and mges in full scale wwtps and may lead to the identification of key targets to control the spread of args graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance genes particle associated assemblages free living bacteria cell free dna wastewater 1 introduction antibiotic resistance genes args are emerging contaminants that have caused public concern due to their potential threat to human health and the situation has worsened in recent years concomitant with an increased risk of no efficacious medicine being available who 2014 wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been considered to be hotspots of args not only because they receive domestic or hospital wastewater sources caucci et al 2016 quintela baluja et al 2019 but also because they discharge effluent containing diverse args with relatively high loads lee et al 2017 furthermore bacteria frequently detected in wwtps can be the hosts of diverse args haaber et al 2016 which may threaten human health through direct or indirect pathways cai zhang 2013 particles are important carriers of nutrients and microorganisms chahal et al 2016 some types of bacteria tend to form biofilm or become attached to particles an et al 2016 which can be classified as particle associated pa assemblages ganesh et al 2014 gonsalves et al 2017 while others are prone to a free living fl lifestyle with no association with inorganic substances huang et al 2018 full size fractionated analyses are frequently conducted in investigations of communities of marine and riverine microorganisms d ambrosio et al 2014 jackson et al 2014 savio et al 2015 the results have indicated that microbial community structures are significantly different between pa assemblages and fl bacteria particle integrity and residence time likely contributed to the differences between the pa and fl bacterial communities in coastal north carolina d ambrosio et al 2014 in the mississippi river basin the differences between the two fractions may be ascribed to the proportional abundances of major bacterial lineages such as alphaproteobacteria cyanobacteria and planctomycetes jackson et al 2014 however little is known regarding the dynamics of antibiotic resistome abundances influenced by different bacterial forms in activated sludge systems or effluent receiving streams the effects of small sized microbes on the fate of args in water was recently studied but this investigation was limited to a narrow size range 0 2 0 45 μm ma et al 2019 investigations of microorganisms based on their sizes may be conducive to promoting a fundamental understanding of arg dissemination among different fractions however few studies have investigated bacteria harboring args and mobile genetic elements mges with respect to different size fractions although previous studies have investigated intracellular and extracellular args liu et al 2018 sui et al 2019 intracellular dna is still needed to be further separated to unveil possible fundamental understanding a recent study demonstrated that fl bacteria cannot be effectively removed in wwtps huang et al 2018 different pore sizes such as 3 0 μm guo et al 2018 5 0 μm rieck et al 2015 and 10 0 μm riemann winding 2001 have been used to distinguish pa from fl bacteria while a pore size of 3 0 μm has been widely used to separate pa assemblages from fl bacteria d ambrosio et al 2014 garneau et al 2009 guo et al 2018 jackson et al 2014 milici et al 2016 savio et al 2015 therefore this convention was used in our study except for args in the pa and fl fractions extracellular dna here defined as cell free cf dna passes through 0 22 μm pore sized filters and potentially harbors args which may pose potential risks to the receiving environment zhang et al 2018 this has rarely been studied cell free dna can be released by cell associated bacteria after their decay and lysis which is a common occurrence during wastewater treatment thereby resulting in its ubiquitous presence in the final effluent together with resistance genes encoded enzymes in living cells although a recent study investigated cf dna only four args and no mges were targeted to assess their occurrence and dissemination in wwtps zhang et al 2018 which is far fewer than the known arg subtypes stedtfeld et al 2018 to the best of our knowledge no previous studies have systematically investigated the full size fractionated antibiotic resistome with respect to pa fl and cf args in wwtps in this study high throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction ht qpcr was used to target 283 major args and 12 mges to assess the proliferation of args and mges among pa assemblages fl bacteria and cf dna in two full scale wwtps and a receiving stream this research aimed to 1 investigate the diversity and distribution of args and mges among size fractionated bacteria in the wwtps and an effluent receiving stream 2 reveal the co occurrence patterns of args and mges among pa assemblages fl bacteria and cf dna and 3 reveal the dynamics of structures of size fractionated bacterial communities and their possible relationships with args and mges 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and pretreatment in our previous study yu et al 2020 although the relative abundances of args were reduced in a tridimensional eco biological wwtp teb wwtp e 114 39 28 77 n 23 37 39 64 marked as plant a args and mges were still abundant in the final effluent to further decipher the occurrences and dynamics of arg abundance in wastewater treatment system we selected this teb wwtp to conduct size fractionated investigations plant a was rebuilt from the anaerobic anoxic oxic aao process by adding internal bio modules and macrophytes on top of the biological reactors in 2013 as a control another wwtp plant b running the conventional aao process with no macrophytes located in the same city of heyuan guangdong province southern china e 114 41 54 52 n 23 43 4 20 was selected in this study in addition plant a executes a higher discharge standard than that of plant b table s1 we attempted to determine whether different treatment levels can affect the fate of size fractionated resistance genes the design parameters of the two wwtps are presented in tables s2 and in a previous study yu et al 2020 water samples were collected from six sites along the treatment processes of plants a and b including the influent s1 biological reactor effluent s4 second sedimentation tank sst effluent s5 and final effluent s6 respectively in the biological reactors of both plants activated sludge as samples were obtained from the anoxic tank s2 and aerobic tank s3 respectively to evaluate the impact of treated effluent on the receiving stream water samples were also collected before g2 and after g3 and g4 the discharge site from plant a table s3 fig s1 both the obtained water and activated sludge samples were transported on ice within 1 h to the laboratory in plant a ph value dissolved oxygen do and temperature were measured in situ using portable device hq30d hach usa as numerous studies have adopted 3 0 μm and 0 2 μm pore sizes to divide the two fractions d ambrosio et al 2014 guo et al 2018 milici et al 2016 savio et al 2015 we used these sizes in our study wastewater samples were first filtered through 3 0 μm pore sized polycarbonate membranes millipore ireland to intercept pa assemblages the filtrates were then filtered through 0 22 μm polycarbonate membranes millipore to collect the fl bacteria the membranes were cut into pieces and transferred to 50 ml centrifuge tubes for further processing separation of the pa and fl fractions was completed within 24 h the tubes were stored at 20 c before dna extraction the final filtrates through 0 22 μm membranes were used to extract cf dna according to previous studies eichmiller et al 2016 ficetola et al 2008 zhang et al 2018 briefly 726 ml of absolute ethanol aladdin industrial corp shanghai china and 33 ml of a 3m sodium acetate anhydrous solution aladdin industrial corp were added to 330 ml filtrate sample the mixtures were stored at 20 c overnight and then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min at 4 c subsequently the supernatant was discarded and the centrifuge tubes were stored at 20 c until dna extraction 2 2 dna extraction dna was extracted from all the pa fl and pretreated cf using a fastdnatm spin kit for soil mp biomedical france protocols were conducted according to the manufacturer s instruction the concentration and quality of the extracted dna samples were measured using an ultraviolet uv visible spectrophotometer nd 1000 nanodrop technologies inc usa table s4 2 3 ht qpcr ht qpcr was performed using a smartchip real time pcr system takarabio japan to target 283 args 4 integron genes 8 transposase genes and the 16s rrna gene su et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 among which clinical class 1 integron integrase gene inti 1 clinic is considered to be closely related to human health gillings et al 2015 additionally inti 1 clinic can be used as a proxy or indicator for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 therefore inti 1 clinic was selected the designed primers are listed in table s5 the ht qpcr conditions were as follows 1 denaturation at 95 c for 10 min 2 40 amplification cycles at 95 c for 30 s and extension at 60 c for 30 s the efficiency of amplification beyond the range of 1 8 to 2 2 was considered to be a negative result the relative and absolute abundances of args and mges were calculated as described in previous studies chen et al 2019b su et al 2015 and shown as follows 1 gcn 1 0 31 ct 10 3 2 r gcn gc n 16 s 3 a a 16 s r where gcn is the gene copy number ct is the threshold cycle and 31 is set as the detection limit r is the relative abundance of each arg or mge and 16s is the 16s rrna gene measured by ht qpcr a is the absolute abundance of arg or mge and a 16s is the absolute abundance of the 16s rrna gene of each sample measured by real time qpcr rt qpcr it should be noted that the volume of size fractionated sample was taken into account when calculating the absolute abundance 2 4 real time quantitative pcr a lightcycler 480 system roche was applied to rt qpcr to quantify the 16s rrna according to the plasmid standard curve each sample was analyzed in triplicate with a reaction volume of 20 μl including 10 μl 2 lightcycle 480 sybr green i master roche applied sciences 1 μl each primer 10 μm 1 μl dna template and 8 μl nuclease free water the 16s rrna primers were the same as those used in the ht qpcr the thermal reaction conditions were as follows 5 min pre incubation at 95 c then amplification of 40 cycles at 95 c for 15 s annealing at 60 c for 60 s and final extension at 72 c for 20 s the melting curve analysis was performed by increasing the temperature stepwise from 65 c to 97 c using 0 30 c 5s ramp rate with continuous fluorescence recording the results obtained by rt qpcr exhibited a significant correlation with those obtained by ht qpcr r 2 0 92 p 0 01 therefore the absolute abundance of 16s rrna can be used to calculate the absolute abundances of args and mges according to the equation 3 ouyang et al 2015 2 5 bacterial 16s rrna gene sequencing the bacterial communities of all the size fractionated samples were identified via sequencing the v4 v5 region of the 16s rrna gene with the forward primer 338f actcctacgggaggcagcag and the reverse primer 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat using a thermocycler pcr system geneamp 9700 abi usa the pcr reaction was conducted in triplicate and each volume was 20 μl in total including 5 fastpfu buffer dntps 2 5 mm each primer 5 μm fastpfu polymerase bsa and dna template 10 ng the thermal reaction conditions were initial denaturation at 95 c for 3 min then 27 cycles of amplification at 95 c for 30 s annealing at 55 c for 30 s elongation at 72 c for 45 s and final extension at 72 c for 10 min purified amplicons were sequenced 2 300 bp paired end on the illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa at major biotech inc shanghai china the obtained paired end reads were quality controlled and merged using trimmomatic and flash bolger et al 2014 magoc salzberg 2011 uparse version 7 1 http drive5 com uparse was used to perform operational taxonomic unit otu clustering at the similarity threshold of 97 edgar 2013 to obtain the species classification information corresponding to each otu the ribosomal database project rdp classifier bayesian algorithm was used to classify each sequence with at an 80 confidence threshold according to the silva ssu123 database all the obtained raw sequence datasets have been uploaded to the ncbi sequence read archive sra with the bio project accession number prjna592276 the relative abundances of all the samples were normalized to the same lowest sequence depth 23478 2 6 statistical analysis and graphing pearson s correlation and tests for differences between groups by one way analysis of variance anova turkey s post hoc and the kruskal wallis k w tests were conducted using spss 21 0 ibm usa canoco v5 0 chen et al 2017 was used to perform principal coordinate analysis pcoa of size fractionated args and microbial communities based on the bray curtis distance and

usa 3 results 3 1 diversity and occurrence of size fractionated args and mges in total 261 args and all 12 targeted mges were detected in all of the wastewater samples among which multidrug 17 9 19 7 beta lactamase 17 6 19 6 aminoglycoside 12 5 13 8 tetracycline 14 3 14 9 and marcrolide lincosamide streptogramin b mlsb 12 2 14 9 were the most abundant resistance types in the pa assemblages fl bacteria and cf dna samples fig s2 these args can be interpreted by three major mechanisms antibiotic deactivate 39 4 42 1 efflux pump 30 3 31 9 and cellular protection 21 3 24 5 fig s3 notably the numbers of args and mges in the pa assemblages and fl bacteria were significantly higher than those observed for cf dna in both plants one way anova p 0 01 fig 1 a and b the number of fl args was significantly higher than that of pa args in plant b one way anova p 0 01 fig 1b while no significant difference was observed in plant a one way anova p 0 05 fig 1a although the detected number of cf args was the lowest over 40 args and mges of cf dna were still detected in all the size fractionated samples among which the influent of plant a had the most subtypes of args and mges 82 in total fig s4a the results indicated that cf args commonly existed throughout the treatment processes most arg and mge subtypes were shared 162 in different size fractions while a few of them were unique to cf dna in the wwtps fig 1c and the receiving stream fig s5 detailed information regarding shared and unique args and mges from the three size fractions of two plants are shown in fig 1d all the targeted mges were detected in the samples of the three different size fractions while vancomycin resistance genes were dominant in the unique types of cf args fig 1d the relative abundances of args and mges in fl bacteria were the highest among the three different types of samples in the two wwtps fig 2 a and b fig s6 while pa args and pa mges exhibited the lowest relative abundances the changes of the relative abundances of args and mges among the three different fractions were not significant k w test p 0 05 fig 2a c the relative abundance of each gene was shown using a heatmap fig s7 size fractionated args and mges from two plants together were significantly separated from each other revealed by pcoa fig 3 a table s6 two way permanova f 2 76 p 0 0003 the results indicated that the fates of args and mges were potentially different for different fractions and different plants specifically fl args were significantly separated from pa args in plant b fig s8b one way permanova f 3 64 p 0 0062 but not significantly separated in plant a fig s8a one way permanova f 2 40 p 0 06 which is probably ascribed to the different processes and biological structures between the two plants cell free args were significantly separated from other fractions in both plants permanova p 0 05 the absolute abundances of pa and fl args ranged from 4 3 0 6 106 to 1 6 0 2 109 copies ml and from 6 3 0 8 106 to 1 0 0 1 109 copies ml respectively which were significantly higher than that observed for cf args with ranges from 2 8 0 6 105 to 7 1 1 0 108 copies ml k w test p 0 01 fig 2e fig s9 these results number relative and absolute abundances suggested that fl fractions may have the potential to carry the most args compared to other two fractions the absolute abundances of pa mges fl mges and cf mges were within the ranges of 2 1 0 1 106 to 7 2 0 8 108 copies ml 2 7 0 3 106 to 5 5 0 2 108 copies ml and 2 1 0 5 105 to 2 9 0 4 107 copies ml respectively although the absolute abundances of cf mges were significantly lower than that observed for the other two fractions k w test p 0 01 fig 2f mges were prevalent in the cf fraction which cannot be neglected 3 2 changes of size fractionated args along the treatment processes and the receiving stream with respect to the influent pa and fl args and mges were the most dominant types figs s4 and s9 cell free args and mges were also ubiquitous in both plants suggesting that cf args are important sources of these genes from domestic sewage the highest relative abundances of fl args and fl mges were observed in the bioreactors of plant a fig s6a while cf args and cf mges exhibited higher relative abundances in plant b fig s6b the absolute abundances of pa args and pa mges were the highest up to 1 9 0 2 109 copies ml in the sampling site of as3 while fl args and fl mges were the most abundant in the bioreactors of plant b fig s9b both the relative and absolute abundances of pa args and pa mges increased in the aerobic zone compared to the anoxic zone in the two plants indicating that changes in the dissolved oxygen do level probably affected the shift in arg abundance a similar phenomenon was also observed in the cf fractions as shown in fig s10 dissolved total nitrogen d tn and cod d cod nitrate no 3 n and do were significantly correlated with size fractionated args in the biological reactors of plant a while dissolved total phosphorous d tp ammonia nh3 n and temperature were more correlated with size fractionated args in plant b these results suggested that physicochemical parameters may have the potential to influence the abundances of size fractionated args in different plants the removal of pa args and pa mges by clarification in plant a decrease of 2 05 orders of magnitude was much higher than that in plant b decrease of 0 97 orders of magnitude table 1 among the assayed fractions fl args and fl mges were the most abundant in the effluent of the ssts in both plants the levels of fl args and fl mges were reduced after precipitation in plant a by 0 63 orders of magnitude whereas they were enriched in plant b table 1 figs s9a and b in contrast the levels of cf args were slightly altered in both plants indicating that cf args were probably less influenced by sedimentation the relative abundances of pa args and pa mges increased after uv disinfection in both plants figs s6a and b while those of the cf fractions were slightly reduced in both wwtps ultraviolet lights had limited effects on both pa and fl args in the two treatment systems table 1 however contrasting results were observed for cf args and cf mges which were reduced by 1 34 orders of magnitude in plant a but increased by 0 15 orders of magnitude in plant b in the final effluent of both plants the absolute abundance of fl args was the highest indicating that they were the most important sources of args spreading from the hotspots of wwtps the cf args and cf mges had the same absolute abundances as pa args and pa mges in the effluent of plant b although the absolute abundances of cf args and cf mges in plant a were the lowest among the tested samples they still reached at 5 0 1 1 105 copies ml suggesting that cf args were also important sources into the receiving stream fl args were the dominant type among the assayed fractions with the highest detected numbers and absolute abundance in the receiving stream of plant a fig s4c fig s9c both the relative and absolute abundances of pa and fl args in the downstream gs3 and gs4 were lower than that of the upstream gs2 fig s6 fig s9c which was attributed to the high quality treated effluent from plant a 3 3 co occurrence patterns of size fractionated args and mges all the targeted mges were detected in the different size fractions at different treatment stages fig s7 the relative abundances of mges such as tnpa 04 were maintained at high levels throughout the treatment systems and in the receiving stream fig s6 and s7 pa and fl mges also exhibited strong correlations with pa fl and total args p 0 05 but not cf args p 0 05 fig s11 a network analysis was performed to reveal co occurrence patterns of size fractionated args and mges fig 4 figs s12 14 the patterns were different in three size fractions mges such as inti 1 clinic inti2 tp614 and tnpa 07 exhibited strong connections with diverse args in addition vpa revealed that mges contributed 32 2 to the relative abundance changes in size fractionated args fig 6d these results suggested that mges may play an important role in the disseminations of size fractionated args 3 4 characterizations of size fractionated microbial communities a total of 2208853 high quality sequences were obtained from the 44 size fractionated samples table s7 the shared and unique otus were presented in venn plots fig 5 a and b free living fractions exhibited the highest otu number with over 23 94 unique otus in both plants proteobacteria were the most common phylum in all the size fractionated samples fig s15 firmicutes patescibacteria and actinobacteria were predominant in the pa assemblages free living bacteria were dominated by epsilonbacteraeota bacteroidetes and patescibacteria while the dna of bacteroidetes patescibacteria and verrucomicrobia were abundant in the cf fraction in plant a gammaproteobacteria was the most abundant class in the pa assemblages fig 5c the relative abundances of campylobacteria saccharimonadia and clostridia in the fl fraction were significantly higher than that of the pa assemblages for the cf fraction the dna of bacteroidia and verrucomicrobiae were predominant in plant b clostridia alphaproteobacteria patescibacteria blastocatellia subgroup 4 actinobacteria and bacilli were abundant in the pa fraction fig 5d while campylobacteria parcubacteria and gracilibacteria were abundant in the fl fraction the dna of bacteroidia parcubacteria and wwe3 were dominant in the cf fraction the size fractionated bacterial communities exhibited different structures in the two plants pcoa was implemented to assess the distribution patterns of size fractionated bacterial communities from the two plants together fig 3b the structures of size fractionated bacteria communities were statistically significantly affected by the interaction effects of two factors of size fraction and plant two way permanova f 3 5 p 0 0001 independently pcoa of size fractionated bacterial communities were also conducted in plant a fig 5e and plant b fig 5f three size fractionated samples were significantly separated from each other in both plants adonis test plant a r 2 0 5026 p 0 0001 plant b r 2 0 4950 p 0 0001 the microbial communities varied among the size fractions at the genus level fig s16 the different fractions from the two plants were clustered fig s17 pseudomonas spp were much more abundant in the pa fractions than in the other two types of fractions whereas arcobacter spp were more plentiful in the fl fractions in the two plants the relative abundance of acinetobacter spp was high in the pa and fl fractions in both plants mycobacterium spp were more likely to exist in planktonic form in plant a and be enriched after passing through the biological reactors while other genera tended to be reduced aeromonas spp were ubiquitous in the fl and cf fractions but only in plant b these differences may affect arg proliferation 3 5 relationship between size fractionated args and microbial communities the procrustes analyses indicated that size fractionated microbial communities were significantly correlated with args in plant a m 2 0 61 p 0 01 fig 6 a and plant b m 2 0 57 p 0 01 fig 6b these were further confirmed by mantel tests plant a r 0 25 p 0 008 plant b r 0 48 p 0 001 as revealed by the rda fig 6c seven genera exhibited close relationship with all the size fractionated args pseudo f 4 2 p 0 002 acinetobacter spp b3 mycobacterium spp b4 arcobacter spp b5 and pseudomonas spp b6 exhibited close connection with fl args from the two plants separately mycobacterium spp b4 arcobacter spp b5 and legionella spp b7 were correlated with fl args in plant a fig s18a mycobacterium spp b4 and pseudomonas spp b6 exhibited strong correlations with pa args while arcobacter spp b5 was related with fl args in plant b fig s18b the cf dna of legionella spp b7 had positively connection with cf args in plant b these results suggested that size fractionated bacteria may exhibit different correlations with args in addition the vpa results suggested that microbial community structures contributed 24 7 to the changes in size fractionated args fig 6d these results indicated that microbial communities may be an important driver of arg proliferation 4 discussion although numerous previous studies have evaluated the potential fate of args in wwtps especially considering intercellular and extracellular args limitations for the understanding of intercellular arg dynamics still exist this was the major motivation to convey the study of size dependent args to separate intercellular parts into pa and fl fractions especially for the full size range the obtained results indicated that fl and cf args and mges in the effluents of the wwtps may be the bottleneck of controlling the spread of args from the hotspots into the receiving environmental compartments 4 1 different fates of pa fl and cf args in natural environmental matrices microbial communities are abundant in pa assemblages d ambrosio et al 2014 gonsalves et al 2017 suspended sludge with abundant microorganisms after acclimatization and enrichment is the foundation of activated sludge treatment systems attributed to their abilities to adsorb materials including nutrients particle matrices not only provide suitable habitats for microbial communities but also protect microorganisms from damage caused by adverse environmental conditions such as a lack of nutrients or uv disinfection chahal et al 2016 thus it was predictable that diverse and ubiquitous args and mges were detected in pa assemblages considering the significantly higher abundance of 16s rrna sequences compared with the fl fraction k w test p 0 01 fig 2d because fl bacteria have been shown to be ubiquitous in various environmental matrices ganesh et al 2014 guo et al 2018 huang et al 2018 they tend to carry diverse args and mges guo et al 2018 because the dynamics and occurrence of fl args may be different from those of pa args in wwtps we attempted to separate fl bacteria from pa assemblages bacterioplankton is also an important type of microorganism lifestyle guo et al 2018 that can be plentiful in wastewater and exhibit the potential of carrying more diverse args compared to pa assemblages artificial aeration in the aerobic tank and water flow turbulence can potentially lead to the desorption of bacteria from particle assemblages in addition planktonic bacteria are not easily settled resulting in their higher abundance at the end of wwtps cell free args originate from the lysis of cells and the cytolysis of dead bacteria that harbor diverse args vlassov et al 2007 zhang et al 2018 thus cf dna may not persist as long as the dna in the pa and fl fractions which is protected by cell walls and particulate matters in wastewater enzyme hydrolysis and photolysis can breakdown or damage cf dna zhang et al 2018 however cf dna harboring diverse args may exist long durations 25 d in the wastewater and receiving environments vlassov et al 2007 zhang et al 2018 highlighting the concern that args in receiving compartments could propagate through cf args thus cf dna is an important but overlooked source of args in wwtps and their receiving environments although we targeted much greater number of args and mges than a previous study only four args and no mges zhang et al 2018 some important genes are still missing metagenome and other illumina high throughput sequencing technologies should be conducted to provide more information regarding the cf args there might be interactions among the three size fractions in the wastewater treatment processes fig s19 it should be noted that pa assemblages could potentially consist of fl bacteria hunt et al 2008 riemann winding 2001 and the release of fl cells from large particles may also occur during in situ aeration or sampling ganesh et al 2014 hunt et al 2008 the proportional abundances of args among the three fractions can be affected by the operational parameters of biological reactors and the treatment processes such as hydraulic retention time mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and flocculation the mechanisms of interactions between the fractions are complicated and more field and laboratory scale trails should be conducted to provide fundamental sights into the size fractionated args in addition the mechanical division of pa and fl bacteria by the firm pore size filter may be biased guo et al 2018 thus continuous pore sized profiling of the living styles of bacterial assemblages as well as carried args in wastewater treatment should be investigated in the future cell free args are not only released from activated sludge but also can be absorbed by particulate matters poly et al 2000 suggesting that there may be dynamic conditions of sorption and desorption between cf dna and activated sludge the bias problem of quantification caused by different pcr systems should be of concern nolvak et al 2018 nolvak et al 2012 although the primers of 16s rrna and the fluorescent dye were the same in conducting qpcr and ht qpcr and the datasets of 16s rrna obtained were significantly correlated r 2 0 92 p 0 01 the amplification efficiencies and other issues may potentially challenge the results nolvak et al 2018 therefore further verification and in depth investigation warrant to avoid the bias 4 2 treatment processes influenced the dynamics of abundances of size fractionated args different biological structures may affect the dynamic portions and distribution of different size fractions a conceptual model regarding size fractionated args and mges from wwtp influent to the final receiving stream is presented in fig s20 due to the unique bioreactor structure of plant a which has additional bio packings and numerous macrophytes table s2 fig s1 bacteria tended to be attached to suspended sludge and biofilms macrophytes probably promoted adhesion between particles and bacteria via root exudates which contain low relative molecular weight organic materials and polymeric adhesive substances coskun et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 in contrast fl args were dominant in the traditional activated sludge system of plant b which did not have as much internal materials or aquatic plants abiotic factors may also affect the abundance dynamics of size fractionated args organic matter nitrogen phosphorus and temperature have been considered as important abiotic factors to affect the bacterial communities which further influences the abundance of args novo et al 2013 in addition numerous studies have demonstrated that args can be affected by oxygen availability during wastewater treatment and sludge or manure digestions diehl lapara 2010 lee et al 2017 ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 it has been found that tet o was specific for aerobic while tet w was specific for anaerobic bacteria chopra roberts 2001 the do concentrations can also influence community structure dynamics of size fractionated bacteria the strict anaerobic bacteroides commonly existed in wastewater treatment systems and much more abundant in fl lifestyle in both the two plants and the receiving stream fig s16 has been identified as a host for tet x speer et al 1991 the relative abundance of the tet c gene was observed to be significantly lower under anaerobic conditions compared to that observed under aerobic conditions in a previous study which is probably attributed to the reduction of the energetic burden of plasmid reproduction rysz et al 2013 controlling the do level is potentially conducive to restricting the proliferations of args rysz et al 2013 long term low do condition can reduce the relative abundances of args in swine wastewater treatment ma et al 2018 significant reductions in the abundances of args were also obtained in anaerobic reactors while the opposite phenomenon was observed in aerobic digesters diehl lapara 2010 however aerobic conditions are required during traditional wastewater treatment when considering the removal of other pollutants such as ammonia therefore optimal design of operational conditions and precise control of do concentration for wastewater treatment should be taken into account recent studies have demonstrated that biosolids sedimentation directly results in the removal of args ju et al 2019 lee et al 2017 most of which as revealed by our results were actually pa args particle associated args were observed to be carried by large particle matrices 3 0 μm and their depositions occurred much more readily in the ssts proia et al 2018 fl bacteria was more difficult to be settled down by gravity resulting in their relatively high prevalence in the effluent of the ssts the results highlighted that more attention should be paid to fl args to more efficiently control the spread of args the different structures of the biological reactors in plants a and b might have led to the discrepant behaviors of pa args and pa mges observed in the ssts the coagulant dosage in plant a pac table s2 also resulted in a good sedimentation performance of particles which is consistent with previous studies grehs et al 2019 lee et al 2017 that the use of coagulants and higher dosages can achieve higher arg removal table s8 in previous jar tests 5 args were efficiently removed by coagulation processes using fecl3 and polyferric chloride pfc as coagulants li et al 2017 therefore attempt to promote the settleability of fl fractions could probably increase arg removal uv disinfection has different effects on the three fractions studies have demonstrated that particles or organic matters can protect microorganisms from uv induced damage chahal et al 2016 lee et al 2017 furthermore microorganisms themselves possess the ability to repair uv damaged dna hassen et al 2000 in previous studies lee et al 2017 narciso da rocha et al 2018 slight increases of relative abundances of args were also observed at comparable uv doses table s8 suggesting that uv disinfection has limited effects on the reduction of args in addition cf args have typically been neglected in those studies because extracted dna is typically filtered by 0 22 or 0 45 pore sized membranes chen et al 2019a lee et al 2017 quintela baluja et al 2019 although cf dna is susceptible to environmental changes and can be completely damaged by uv light chahal et al 2016 it should be noted that some types of disinfectors which can make holes in bacterioplankton zhang et al 2019 will promote the release of cf dna uv disinfection also resulted in bacterial apoptosis leading to the release of cf args into the environment zheng et al 2017 in addition dissolved organic matter in the wastewater may protect the cf dna from the uv damage our results showing that numbers of detected cf args and cf mges increased after uv disinfection in plant b fig s4b were consistent with these findings the dose of uv irradiation makes a difference if used at levels higher than 200 mj cm2 mckinney pruden 2012 however the higher the dose the greater the energy consumption and other issues also arise therefore if they were not completely degraded then cf args were enriched thus comprehensive consideration is warranted for the removal of args by disinfection some fine particles could reach the discharge endpoints it is much easier to increase the removal efficiency of pa args through the use of filters or enhanced sedimentation although these methods would probably not be particularly useful for removing fl args membrane technologies can be used to potentially improve pa and fl arg removal by the effective interception of large and fine particles when passing through small pore sized membranes breazeal et al 2013 the receiving environment would benefit from the removal of args and mges carried by pa and fl fractions in the wwtps in contrast cf args can pass through 0 22 μm pore sized filters zhang et al 2018 and easily escape traditional wwtps resulting in substantial increases of potential risk to receiving environments which warrants particular attention although there were significant results obtained from the profiling of size fractionated antibiotic resistome from two full scale wwtps sampling from much more wwtps with different kinds of processes and wastewater should be broadly conducted to obtain general rules considering the fact that size fractionated args can be affected by the treatment processes 4 3 relationship between args and mges mobile genetic elements can promote in the dissemination of args through horizontal gene transfer hgt in different environmental matrices guo et al 2018 however to the best of our knowledge assessments of mges in size fractionated samples from wwtps have not previously been performed the specific pathways of arg dissemination through hgt in fractions may be different due to the higher relative abundance of fl mges than that of pa mges especially in plant b fig s6 in contrast cf args could probably be directly captured by bacteria to facilitate the transfer of args dong et al 2019 jain et al 1999 which deserves particular attention and further investigation integron integrases are typically associated with anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 and waste sources potentially resulting in their proliferation and transfer among bacteria in wwtps one of the most important integron integrase encoding genes inti 1 clinic has been confirmed as cassettes of over 80 genes conferring resistance to major antibiotics mazel 2006 as revealed by our results that inti 1 clinic was abundant in all the three fractions in both plants fig s7 more attention should be paid to the inti 1 clinic carried by cf dna and its potential in facilitating arg transfer although inti2 was observed to be encoded in fewer gene cassettes its ability to facilitate arg transfer cannot be neglected biskri mazel 2003 fluit schmitz 2004 mazel 2006 rowe magnus mazel 2002 for size fractionated inti2 it exhibited significantly correlations with diverse args fig 4 suggesting that it had great potential to act a role in the hgt of size fractionated args transposases such as tnpa 04 tnpa 07 and tp614 frequently reported in various environmental matrices and all the size fractions fig s7 may play an important role in the transfer and acquisition of args among bacteria karkman et al 2016 yan et al 2018 4 4 microbial communities drive the dynamics of antibiotic resistome structure the structural dynamics of microbial communities have been revealed to be the main driver of arg propagation han et al 2018 jia et al 2017 however few studies have explored the size fractionated bacteria in wwtps and the encoded args and mges bacteria with different lifestyles have been investigated in oceans rivers and lakes which has revealed that different community structures may influence their dynamics or functions ganesh et al 2014 jackson et al 2014 mou et al 2013 our results first revealed that size fractionated bacteria probably shift the dynamics of arg abundances in full scale wwtps and the receiving stream size fractionated bacterial lineages were significantly correlated with arg profiles mantel test r 0 31 p 0 001 the vpa results also revealed that the microbial community contributed 24 2 to the changes of size fractionated args fig 6c specifically among the assayed fractions pa bacteria were highly abundant in wwtps fig 2d and potentially carried diverse args in activated sludge systems electrostatic interaction and hydrophobic forces can facilitate the combination of particles and microorganisms templeton et al 2005 resulting in relatively stable niches where microorganisms can obtain nutrients and survive environmental changes guo et al 2018 free living bacteria were also common in the two plants and can easily escape from the ssts resulting in high levels of their harbored args and mges in the effluents the separated fractions also exhibited close connections free living bacteria could be adsorbed and desorbed by pa assemblages while cell free dna was released after the lysis of dead cells from pa and fl bacteria the genera arrying specific args and mges can increase their potential risks to human beings cai zhang 2013 vaz moreira et al 2014 pseudomonas spp can harbor diverse args sib et al 2019 pseudomonas aeruginosa has been reported to be a superbug for having resistance to multiple antibiotics breidenstein et al 2011 fortunately pseudomonas spp were dominant in the pa fractions which was likely to be settled down in the sst with lower relative abundance in the effluent fig s14 arcobacter spp were observed to be resistant to commonly used antibiotics collado figueras 2011 acinetobacter spp have the ability to capture args yang et al 2014 and mycobacterium spp were identified as being possible carriers of multidrug and tetracycline resistance genes vaz moreira et al 2014 half of aeromonas spp may play roles in the proliferation of args blasco et al 2008 vaz moreira et al 2014 considering the ubiquity of fl bacteria with ability to escape wwtps measures targeting the removal of fl bacteria such as mycobacterium strains may aid in controlling the spreading of genera carrying args from treated wastewater different structures of size fractionated microbial communities are probably influenced by various factors the sludge concentration table s3 may influence the distribution of pa and fl bacteria as fl bacteria can probably be adhered onto particulate matters furthermore root exudates from macrophytes and coagulants pac added in plant a may facilitate the adhesions between particles and bacteria bulgarelli et al 2015 li et al 2017 previous studies have also demonstrated that microbial communities can be shaped by root exudates hu et al 2018 zhalnina et al 2018 but how the exudates affect the structures of size fractionated microbial communities needs further profiling most bacteria especially those in the pa fraction can be removed by traditional as systems by sedimentation however fine particles coated with bacteria and bacterioplankton may escape from sedimentation tanks furthermore these genera exhibited protection matrixes from uv disinfection which is the last line of defense in wwtps lu et al 2015 therefore priority genera list size dependent corresponding to effective controlling technologies should be built to better reduce the spreading of args 5 conclusion our study conveys a novel insight into the size fractionated args of two full scale wwtps and the receiving stream which may help to better understand the dynamics of antibiotic resistome structures in wastewater treatment systems size fractionated antibiotic resistome separated by particle associated assemblages free living bacteria and cell free dna exhibited different abundances which can be affected by the treatment processes cell free args were not efficiently removed by clarifying and ultraviolet disinfection and were abundant in the final effluents of the wwtps which should be of concern when considering the control of arg spreading vpa analyses indicated that the bacterial communities and mges may be the main two drivers in the propagations of size fractionated args additionally the microbial communities of the three size fractions exhibited different structures which might drive the interphase exchanges of args as size portioning was conducted in only two wwtps extensive research and broad sampling in different wwtps are needed to obtain general rules regarding the size fractionated antibiotic resistome declaration of competing interest the

17494,for digestion effluent treatment while the anammox based process has been successfully applied for nitrogen removal in most cases phosphorus p represents another major concern in this study a novel process integrating the partial nitritation anammox and hydroxyapatite crystallization pna hap in a single airlift reactor was developed for the simultaneous nitrogen removal and p recovery from synthetic digestion effluent with a stable influent p concentration of 20 0 mg l an hrt of 6 h and alternating increases of influent calcium and ammonium the final achieved nitrogen removal rate was 1 2 kg m3 d and the p removal efficiency was 83 0 the settleability of sludge was desirably enhanced with the calcium addition and a high biomass concentration was achieved in reactor quantitative and qualitative analyses confirmed that hap was the main inorganic content in sludge which could be harvested for p recovery according to the scanning electron microscope observation and the energy dispersive x ray spectrometry analysis the microbes were mainly distributed on the outer layer of the sludge aggregate while the hap mainly in the interior the relevant theoretical calculation also revealed that the sludge discharge manipulation has direct effect on the sludge composition and aggregate structure in sum the results are evidence of the feasibility of simultaneous nitrogen removal and p recovery through one stage pna hap process for digestion effluent graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords one stage partial nitritation anammox hydroxyapatite crystallization nitrogen removal phosphorus recovery 1 introduction as one of the crucial technologies to recover energy from organic waste the anaerobic digestion process is being increasingly used in industry with the unintended consequence of a huge environment problem if no proper countermeasure is adopted to deal with the generated digestion effluent ma et al 2018a ma and liu 2019 ren et al 2018 ye et al 2020 this digestion effluent contains ammonium and phosphorus p both crucial nutrients tomaszewski et al 2018 different approaches are adopted for the removal of ammonium and p in the case of nitrogen removal as ammonium can be easily obtained from atmosphere through the haber bosch process ajiwibowo et al 2019 the commonly adopted strategy is to remove nitrogen by generating the end product of dinitrogen guo et al 2020a however in the case of p removal currently the objective is to recover it as until now the available p is mainly obtained from natural phosphate reserves peng et al 2018 which will become depleted in the near future with a gradual decrease in the quality of remaining phosphate ore and increase in extraction costs desmidt et al 2015 it has been reported that about 10 of exploited p finally enters the wastewater cordell et al 2009 globally about 1 3 mt p year is treated in municipal wastewater treatment plants van vuuren et al 2010 enriched with ammonium and p digestion effluent from the sludge digestion installations presents two realities it is a potential environmental problem and also a potential p resource reserve chen et al 2018 ma et al 2018a in most cases of wastewater treatment facilities the removal of nitrogen and p is conducted in successive two reactors huang et al 2016 karakashev et al 2008 this configuration is costly in construction and complex in management the use of anammox based processes for nitrogen removal have been extensively studied over the past 40 years guo et al 2020a in recent years an increasing number of anammox based installations have been applied in wastewater treatment with the benefits of reductions in installation volume sludge production and operation costs lackner et al 2014 if the p removal also is realized simultaneously in the anammox based installation it will further enlarge the benefits chemical precipitation is a more effective method for p removal than the biological p removal processes rossi et al 2018 it has been reported that calcium phosphate crystallization may occur in aerobic granular sludge anaerobic granular sludge and even in anammox granular sludge angela et al 2011 de kreuk et al 2005 ma et al 2018b this was explained by that crystallization preferentially occurs when the ph and ion concentrations lead to mineral super saturation in the interior of sludge valsami jones 2001 in practical application high calcium concentrations is often supplied to anammox reactors to obtain sufficient bacterial aggregation and to enhance biomass retention through the combination of biomass and the formed phosphate gonzalez gil et al 2015 from this perspective it is also feasible that the intentional enhancement of chemical phosphate formation in anammox sludge provides an access to recover p the slow biomass production rate of the anammox bacteria manonmani and joseph 2018 would allow high p content in sludge in the anammox based process compared to that in the aerobic activated sludge process finally this kind of sludge can be utilized as fertilizer in agriculture or as a raw material in industry daneshgar et al 2018 to date anammox based research related to the simultaneous nitrogen removal and p recovery has been conducted with the form of combining anammox process and hydroxyapatite hap crystallization lin et al 2019 ma et al 2018b zhang et al 2018 as the one stage partial nitritation anammox pna process has more advantages than two stage pna process with the merits like installation volume saving no ph regulation less n2o emission guo et al 2020a simultaneous nitrogen removal and p recovery through the combination of one stage pna process and hap crystallization pna hap seems to be more promising however to date only one report was presented about p recovery in the one stage pna reactor johansson et al 2017 with limited data about p removal performance thus to our knowledge the present work is the first report featuring the systematic investigation of nitrogen removal and p recovery through one stage pna hap process with synthetic wastewater the optimum nitrogen removal rate nrr p removal rate prr and the structure relationship between hap and microbe in formed sludge aggregate were explored in addition the produced sludge was specifically analyzed to evaluate the p recovery potential 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and experimental conditions an airlift alr reactor made of polyethylene was adopted to offer both the oxygenation and agitation of mixed liquid it was comprised of a reaction

experiment is shown in fig 2 the average nlr nrr nre plr prr and pre at each stage are shown in table 2 from phase ⅰ to phase ⅳ with the fixed nlr the influent calcium was increased with the ca p ratio from 0 5 to 3 0 as shown in table 2 the nrr and nre were almost stable with the increased calcium in influent from phase ⅴ to phase ⅸ with the alternating increase of influent calcium and ammonium the influent nlr was further increased to 1 25 kg m3 d phase ⅴ and ⅵ 1 5 kg m3 d phase ⅶ and ⅷ and finally 2 0 kg m3 d phase ⅸ while the influent ca p ratio to 3 0 phase ⅴ 4 0 phase ⅵ and ⅶ to 6 0 phase ⅷ and ⅸ from table 2 the nrr and nre were stable until phase ⅷ however in phase ⅸ an obvious decrease in nre was observed while the nrr achieved was the highest at approximately 1 2 kg m3 d since the influent calcium was same in phase ⅷ and ⅸ the decrease in the nre was attributed to the limitation of nitrogen removal capacity of the experimental configuration rather the effect of influent calcium which will be discussed later the p removal performance shown in fig 2d indicates that the nre increased with the improvement of ca p ratio during the whole experiment at the final phase ⅸ with the influent ca p ratio of 6 0 a pre of 83 0 was achieved the saturation indexes si of minerals that might be generated were calculated using the hydrochemistry software aqion 6 2 6 based on synthetic wastewater composition and other operational conditions applied in this system ma et al 2018b as shown in fig 3 on the one hand from the figure the improved saturation indexes of the calcium phosphate especially the hap were beneficial to p removal on the other hand even at the same ca p ratio in phase ⅵ and ⅴ phases ⅵ and ⅶ and phases ⅷ and ⅸ an increase in pre was observed as shown in table 2 this indicates that the microbial activity also accelerated p removal johansson et al 2017 which also will be discussed later 3 2 the sludge characteristics and specific sludge activity from fig 4 a the mlvss and mlss concentration increased as the experiment proceeding from phase ⅰ to phase ⅴ at phase ⅴ the mlvss of 9 0 g l was achieved which was relatively high for the one stage pna process to date the highest reported nrr for the one stage pna research was 3 9 kg m3 d while the mlvss was just 11 0 g l wang et al 2017 in another study the nrr was 2 0 kg m3 d and the mlvss was below 7 2 g l shaopo wang et al 2017 in the expanded granular sludge bed egsb pna reactor with the nrr of 2 3 kg m3 d a high mlvss of 25 g l was reported wang and gao 2018 in a continuous stirred tank cstr pna reactor an extremely high nrr of 2 83 kg m3 d was achieved with the mlvss of 11 g l qian et al 2017 in addition both the mlvss mlss ratio and the svi30 had the decreased trend while no obvious variation was found for sv30 as shown in fig 4b and fig 4c from these results it can be concluded that the biomass in this study was adequate anammox bacteria is sensitive to the external environment and in suspended sludge type operations sludge washout is a terrible problem with the anammox based process manonmani and joseph 2018 zhang et al 2017 thus these results clearly indicate that the calcium addition is beneficial to the biomass retention this can be attributed to enhanced gravity of the sludge due to the combination of microbes and the generated calcium phosphate crystals gonzalez gil et al 2015 sobeck and higgins 2002 besides because proper calcium cations can form bridges between bacteria and negatively charged bioflocs they are also important for bioflocculation and granulation ma et al 2019 sobeck and higgins 2002 fig 5 a and fig 5b showed the size change of sludge aggregates during the whole experiment it was obvious that both the peak size and the average size of the aggregate had a decreasing trend from phase ⅰ to phase ⅴ this may be partly due to the breakdown of sludge aggregates due to increased collision chance with high sludge concentration liu et al 2017 from phase ⅵ to phase ⅸ with regular sludge discharge the peak size and average size of the aggregate both tended to increase this was attributed to the increase in the biomass growth according to the anammox reaction equation 2 in the pure anammox reactor novel anammox granules with a hap core were cultivated with a granule diameter larger than 1 0 mm ma et al 2018b zhang et al 2018 2016 it has been reported that sludge washout is more likely with smaller sludge particles however in this study excellent settleability was still achieved although the diameter of the granules was smaller with average particle size less than 0 22 mm as shown in fig 5b there may be two factors contributing to this difference in the one stage process the fierce shear force caused by the aeration would crush the formed granules liu et al 2017 the mechanical strength and structure of the granule was weakened due to that there were two main kinds of bacteria with different physiological metabolism in one stage pna reactor liu et al 2017 it was reported that small granules ranging between 0 5 mm and 0 9 mm had a higher nitrogen removal capacity than large ones wang et al 2014 however in this study excellent nitrogen removal performance was still achieved with smaller sludge aggregates solid liquid interface height falling versus the time with 1000 ml suspended mixed liquid in 1000 ml graduate and the solids flux density by settling versus the mlss were depicted according to the previous researches david hendricks 2006 dick 1970 as shown in fig 5c and fig 5d from the results it was obvious the settling laws of sludge with low mlss mlss 8 8g l was accordance with the hindered settling type for activated sludge the flux density reaches a peak and then declines with the mlss dick 1970 for high mlss 19 4g l the settling laws of sludge was accordance with the stokes law david hendricks 2006 the velocity increases with the raise of particle density which also indicated that the biomass and the crystals were well combined in this study crystallization has been shown to increase the settling velocity of granules winkler et al 2013 the alteration of granule properties helped to prevent the escape of gas due to the resultant decrease in sludge density the granules inevitably float in high rate anammox reactors song et al 2017 this problem did not occur in this study due to the increased sludge density table 3 also showed the specific sludge activity and the cytochrome c change during the whole experiment it is clear that the sdia and sdaa were relatively low compared to the saa this is evidence that the main pathway for nitrogen removal was the pna route meanwhile a decrease in the saa was observed from phase ⅰ to phase ⅴ this can partly be attributed to the mismatching of high biomass concentration and the nlr qian et al 2017 with excess biomass in the reactor and the limited nlr individual microbes would experience malnutrition resulting in a decrease in activity another reason was that because part of the microbe was covered by crystal mass transfer was blocked xing et al 2015 which will be stated later from phase ⅵ to phase ⅸ the saa was almost stable with the stable sludge concentration the variation of cytochrome c also served as an important indicator for saa and relative to the variation of saa 3 3 mineral species identification and element analysis of composite granular sludge from the xrd analysis the dried sludge samples obtained from reactor in last phase without the removal of organic matter showed a sharp legible pattern indicating the presence of different crystalline forms compared with reference spectra in database hap carbonate hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 3 co3 3 oh 2 and calcium phosphate hydrate ca3 po4 2 xh2o were the major phases as shown in fig 6 a in order to distinguish the main substance a raman spectra analysis was conducted from fig 6b the sludge band of 956 cm 1 was very similar to the band of hap at po4 3 ν1 961 cm 1 rey et al 2011 the other three bands of the hap reference were located at 429 585 and 1042 cm 1 and were not obvious in this sludge sample thus the main crystal in sludge was identified as hap further the dry sludge was digested for inorganic element analysis as shown in table 4 the inorganic elements were mainly calcium and p the ratio of ca p was 2 21 which was close to the theoretical ratio of hap 2 15 from the above it was conclusively shown that the phosphate formed in sludge was mainly in the form of hap an average 13 41 p 30 71 in p2o5 was accumulated in the dry sludge the recovered precipitates contained 10 15 of p and could potentially be reused in phosphate fertilizer production yao et al 2017 therefore the sludge obtained from this study was suitable for p recovery 3 4 sludge aggregate structure identification the sem analysis was adapted for aggregate structure identification in fig 7 a a cluster of aggregates were presented and it was obvious that the individual aggregates were irregular from fig 7b 7c 7d the surface of aggregate has many caves and protuberances these were very close in size to bacteria cells characterized by irregular or coccoid shapes van niftrik et al 2008 van niftrik et al 2008 in addition from the fig 7d there were distinct porous structure which may have been caused by gas release from the anammox reaction qian et al 2017 in a previous study high magnification imaging using backscattered electrons also revealed that anammox bacteria may be embedded in calcium phosphate precipitates gonzalez gil et al 2015 therefore from this point there is doubt that the combination of bacteria with the hap resulted in the improved settleability of sludge in addition this microbe crystal aggregate could be deem as a carrier and a biofilm like in other one stage carrier packing pna processes dapena mora et al 2010 lin et al 2013 however the crystal in this study was spontaneously formed and served both as carrier for microbe growth and recyclable resources a decrease in bacterial activity cell decay in the activated sludge could be attributed to cell death reduction in the amount of active bacteria and activity decay reduction in the specific activity of active bacteria from the sem observation the inactivated biomass increased due to the harboring of deposits which partly explained the decrease in the saa decrease as stated in section 3 2 according to the elemental mapping of aggregate section using edx as shown in fig 8 carbon and oxygen were mainly distributed on the surface and edge of sludge aggregate section this indicated the active microbe was distributed on the out layer of the sludge aggregate while the crystal was mainly in the core of the sludge aggregate johansson et al 2017 finally the formation mechanism of the crystal biomass combined sludge aggregate was illustrated in fig 9 as the bacteria growth and hap crystallization occurred simultaneously bacteria cell and hap well bond with each other in the formed sludge aggregate with the size of aggregate increasing the interior bacteria were blocked from mass transfer and then lysis finally the later formed hap occupied the space of decomposed bacteria in addition during this process the anammox bacteria activity changed the local environment of the aggregate which partly was beneficial to the hap crystallization johansson et al 2017 3 5 sludge morphology it can be seen in fig 10 that with no sludge discharge before phase ⅵ the sludge aggregate changed from loose particles surrounded with the transparent organic substances identified by edx in phase ⅰ as shown in fig 10a to individual dense particles surrounded with crystal substances identified by edx in phase ⅴ as shown in fig 10b the crystal were the hap after the biomass lysis from the sludge aggregate with the no sludge discharge means the long sludge retention time srt as shown in fig 9 with regular sludge discharge short srt at the last phase ⅸ while the sludge aggregate with the dense particle was similar to that of phase ⅴ there was a marked decrease in crystal substances as shown in fig 10c without sludge discharge from phase ⅰ to phase ⅴ the mlss and mlvss were obviously lower than theoretical biomass concentration and the sum of biomass and crystal concentration as shown in fig 4a it is well known that crystals formed in the reactor can be retained in the reactor however the biomass will experience lysis when there is no sludge discharge yang et al 2013 from fig 4b the mlvss mlss ratio was lower than the theoretical ratio of biomass the sum of biomass and crystal this is evidence that the biomass lysis happened as this study was also focused on p recovery this phenomenon indicated that long srt control has potential as an effective strategy to improve the mlvss mlss ratio of sludge in effect this increases the calcium phosphate contents in sludge for p recovery which will be further discussed later the theoretical ratio of bir bir cir was higher than the actual ratio of mlvss increase rate mlss increase rate in the initial several phases as shown in fig 4d this may be attributed to the low rate crystallization due to the seed crystal shortage and the low saturation index of calcium phosphate as shown in fig 3 the situation was reversed in phase ⅴ it was verified that biomass lysis heavily occurred when there was no sludge discharge as shown in fig 10b from phase ⅵ to phase ⅸ with regular sludge discharge from reactor the theoretical ratio of bir bir cir was closely parallel to the actual ratio of mlvss increase rate mlss increase rate which indicated that sludge concentration control is important for maintaining the stable mlvss mlss ratio in the reactor it was inferred that with the regular discharge of sludge cell lysis was avoided and the complete formed sludge aggregate with both biomass and hap was maintained as shown in fig 10c in this kind of pna hap process there are three likely situations in biomass growth and hap crystallization the first is the low crystal crystallization rate with high biomass growth rate equal to the high nrr in which the crystal occupies only a little part of the sludge aggregate with a high mlvss mlss ratio this kind of sludge floats easily that lead to the unstable nitrogen removal performance song et al 2017 the second situation is the ideal case the crystal crystallization rate and biomass growth rate is maintained with a proper ratio which strongly enhances sludge settleability this situation is ideal for both nitrogen removal and desirable p recovery the third situation is the high crystal crystallization rate and low biomass growth rate this is a dangerous situation due to the possibility that the surface of biomass will be covered by the thick crystal layer lin et al 2013 in the worst situation biological activity will become blocked as the mass transfer breaks up in this study it was obvious that the first and third situation did not emerge in addition as the microbe experienced lysis the formed crystal could remain stable in the reactor therefore with no discharge of sludge the mlss increased continuously with the drop of mlvss mlss ratio actually in actual operations with this high mlss such as 22 4 g l in phase ⅴ aeration became difficult since the higher density of mixed liquor increased the air pump energy consumption for air transportation therefore from phase ⅵ the sludge discharge was conducted regularly with the targeted sludge mlvss concentration below 7 0 g l from table 5 it can be seen that during the last four phases the stable mlvss mlss ratio was almost achieved and was close to the ratio of mlvss increase rate mlss increase rate this is evidence of the feasibility of a long term stable operation of this novel process 3 6 microbial community as shown in fig 11 a 24 phyla were detected in this experiment members of the phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi are usually observed in n removal reactors chu et al 2015 gonzalez martinez et al 2017 wang et al 2016 bacteroidetes organisms can also remove p and organic matter xu et al 2018 the growth of chloroflexi chlorobi and proteobacteria relied on scavenging polysaccharides and proteins of smp and eps produced by anammox bacteria chu et al 2015 miura et al 2007 proteobacteria is a common flora in the denitrification reaction system it can utilize substrate nh4 n or no2 n for metabolism and proliferation activities and simultaneously consume dissolved oxygen creating an anaerobic environment for the anammox bacteria cao et al 2016 2017 members of the acidobacteria phylum have been considered oligotrophic bacteria due to high abundances in low organic carbon environments kielak et al 2016 armatimonadetes and proteobacteria could contribute the secondary metabolites molybdopterin cofactor and folate for anammox bacteria to benefit their activity and growth zhao et al 2018 the obvious decreased phylum was chlorobi chlorobi affiliated bacteria had the ability to degrade extracellular proteins produced by anammox bacteria to amino acids to affect consortium aggregation zhao et al 2018 the obvious increased phylum was the chloroflexi it was reported as the chloroflexi affiliated bacteria encoded the function of biosynthesizing exopolysaccharides for anammox consortium aggregation based on the partial nucleotide sugars produced by anammox bacteria additionally the chloroflexi affiliated bacteria harbored genes for a nitrite loop and could have a dual role in anammox performance during reactor start up zhao et al 2018 the genera with a percent above 0 55 were shown in fig 11b no nob were detected in the reactor nitrospirae was not detected in three phases which indicated that nob was well controlled in the experiment wang et al 2018 table 6 illustrates the percentage change of main functional bacteria species the aob genera was mainly from genus nitrosomonas there were little genus nitrosococcus aob in the initial phases and this disappeared in later phases the single anammox bacteria belonged to genus kuenenia was detected without obvious variation and a maximum percent of 29 5 in phase ⅰ genus kuenenia is a k strategist with a low substrate half saturation constant liu et al 2017 park et al park et al 2010 concluded that feed composition and therefore substrate concentrations in the reactor may be the main factor determining microbial community selection over inoculum composition and reactor configuration in this study the nitrite concentration in reactor was maintained at an almost undetectable level which was though the crucial factor leading to the existence of only one anammox species of genus kuenenia in the reactor 3 7 enlightenment from this study as reported in a previous study phosphate was found in some granules regardless of whether the pure anammox reactor or one stage pna reactor was used and this phenomenon is defined as bio induced phosphate crystallization johansson et al 2017 ma et al 2018b from another perspective the results of this study indicate that intentional phosphate crystallization in granules with a proper mass has no negative effect on microbe activity from the chemical perspective a high calcium or high ph in influent is effective measure together with stable influent p concentration for high pre by hap crystallization as shown in the equation 3 however in this study the nitrogen removal related microbe was involved besides hap crystallization in the reactor and was sensitive to the high ph value yue et al 2018 as a result it was infeasible to increase ph to improve p removal thus with the stable influent p concentration calcium addition was the only feasible measure as shown in fig 3 it was obvious that during the whole experiment the si of hap was high which was beneficial to the hap crystallization from the perspective of the solubility equilibrium however no hap deposit was found on the surface of reactor wall also it was observed that the nitrogen removal activity aggrandized p removal as stated in section 3 1 these indicated that hap crystallization was a bio induced process rather than a simple chemical process johansson et al 2017 as the anammox bacteria has a long double time the retention of biomass in the reactor was crucial for the stable operation of one stage pna reactor although the use of a biofilm type reactor using carrier or fixed bed would improve this situation biofilm culturing is time consuming liu et al 2017 also while the membrane reactor can achieve the high biomass retention the nrr is limited and membrane fouling is a serious problem niu et al 2016 it seems the sludge type is the most convenient way to setup the one stage pna process but with the operation conditions inevitably fluctuating the sludge is easily washout guo et al 2020a this study proves the efficient sludge retention through hap crystallization in addition the excellent settleability of biomass enhanced the buffer ability of the reactor when facing the fluctuation of operation parameters this is one benefit of simultaneous pna hap crystallization for a long period the chemical crystallization method for p removal in aerobic reactor presented a puzzle due to the large volume of sludge produced with a p content so low that the recovery of p was uneconomical guo et al 2020a however it was well known that the anammox process has low sludge production thus for the same p removal rate combined with the anammox based process the content of p in the sludge could be increased making the recovery of p feasible in this study it is conclusively shown that a high quality p containing product can be obtained 4 conclusion in this study the simultaneous nitrogen removal and p recovery was successfully realized through the pna hap process in an alr reactor the hap crystallization in pna reactor solved the long standing sludge washout problem the well combination of the microbes and hap resulted in high biomass concentration in reactor allowing for stable nitrogen removal performance and the harvested sludge was ideal for p recovery this study presents a feasible method for the treatment of digestion effluent with both efficient nitrogen removal and

17494,for digestion effluent treatment while the anammox based process has been successfully applied for nitrogen removal in most cases phosphorus p represents another major concern in this study a novel process integrating the partial nitritation anammox and hydroxyapatite crystallization pna hap in a single airlift reactor was developed for the simultaneous nitrogen removal and p recovery from synthetic digestion effluent with a stable influent p concentration of 20 0 mg l an hrt of 6 h and alternating increases of influent calcium and ammonium the final achieved nitrogen removal rate was 1 2 kg m3 d and the p removal efficiency was 83 0 the settleability of sludge was desirably enhanced with the calcium addition and a high biomass concentration was achieved in reactor quantitative and qualitative analyses confirmed that hap was the main inorganic content in sludge which could be harvested for p recovery according to the scanning electron microscope observation and the energy dispersive x ray spectrometry analysis the microbes were mainly distributed on the outer layer of the sludge aggregate while the hap mainly in the interior the relevant theoretical calculation also revealed that the sludge discharge manipulation has direct effect on the sludge composition and aggregate structure in sum the results are evidence of the feasibility of simultaneous nitrogen removal and p recovery through one stage pna hap process for digestion effluent graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords one stage partial nitritation anammox hydroxyapatite crystallization nitrogen removal phosphorus recovery 1 introduction as one of the crucial technologies to recover energy from organic waste the anaerobic digestion process is being increasingly used in industry with the unintended consequence of a huge environment problem if no proper countermeasure is adopted to deal with the generated digestion effluent ma et al 2018a ma and liu 2019 ren et al 2018 ye et al 2020 this digestion effluent contains ammonium and phosphorus p both crucial nutrients tomaszewski et al 2018 different approaches are adopted for the removal of ammonium and p in the case of nitrogen removal as ammonium can be easily obtained from atmosphere through the haber bosch process ajiwibowo et al 2019 the commonly adopted strategy is to remove nitrogen by generating the end product of dinitrogen guo et al 2020a however in the case of p removal currently the objective is to recover it as until now the available p is mainly obtained from natural phosphate reserves peng et al 2018 which will become depleted in the near future with a gradual decrease in the quality of remaining phosphate ore and increase in extraction costs desmidt et al 2015 it has been reported that about 10 of exploited p finally enters the wastewater cordell et al 2009 globally about 1 3 mt p year is treated in municipal wastewater treatment plants van vuuren et al 2010 enriched with ammonium and p digestion effluent from the sludge digestion installations presents two realities it is a potential environmental problem and also a potential p resource reserve chen et al 2018 ma et al 2018a in most cases of wastewater treatment facilities the removal of nitrogen and p is conducted in successive two reactors huang et al 2016 karakashev et al 2008 this configuration is costly in construction and complex in management the use of anammox based processes for nitrogen removal have been extensively studied over the past 40 years guo et al 2020a in recent years an increasing number of anammox based installations have been applied in wastewater treatment with the benefits of reductions in installation volume sludge production and operation costs lackner et al 2014 if the p removal also is realized simultaneously in the anammox based installation it will further enlarge the benefits chemical precipitation is a more effective method for p removal than the biological p removal processes rossi et al 2018 it has been reported that calcium phosphate crystallization may occur in aerobic granular sludge anaerobic granular sludge and even in anammox granular sludge angela et al 2011 de kreuk et al 2005 ma et al 2018b this was explained by that crystallization preferentially occurs when the ph and ion concentrations lead to mineral super saturation in the interior of sludge valsami jones 2001 in practical application high calcium concentrations is often supplied to anammox reactors to obtain sufficient bacterial aggregation and to enhance biomass retention through the combination of biomass and the formed phosphate gonzalez gil et al 2015 from this perspective it is also feasible that the intentional enhancement of chemical phosphate formation in anammox sludge provides an access to recover p the slow biomass production rate of the anammox bacteria manonmani and joseph 2018 would allow high p content in sludge in the anammox based process compared to that in the aerobic activated sludge process finally this kind of sludge can be utilized as fertilizer in agriculture or as a raw material in industry daneshgar et al 2018 to date anammox based research related to the simultaneous nitrogen removal and p recovery has been conducted with the form of combining anammox process and hydroxyapatite hap crystallization lin et al 2019 ma et al 2018b zhang et al 2018 as the one stage partial nitritation anammox pna process has more advantages than two stage pna process with the merits like installation volume saving no ph regulation less n2o emission guo et al 2020a simultaneous nitrogen removal and p recovery through the combination of one stage pna process and hap crystallization pna hap seems to be more promising however to date only one report was presented about p recovery in the one stage pna reactor johansson et al 2017 with limited data about p removal performance thus to our knowledge the present work is the first report featuring the systematic investigation of nitrogen removal and p recovery through one stage pna hap process with synthetic wastewater the optimum nitrogen removal rate nrr p removal rate prr and the structure relationship between hap and microbe in formed sludge aggregate were explored in addition the produced sludge was specifically analyzed to evaluate the p recovery potential 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and experimental conditions an airlift alr reactor made of polyethylene was adopted to offer both the oxygenation and agitation of mixed liquid it was comprised of a reaction sink with effective volume of 5 0 l and a clarifier sink with effective volume of 1 0 l as shown in fig 1 an air pump was used to transfer air into the reactor with the gas flow gauge for air flow rate afr control and the outlet of air tube was set at the bottom of reaction sink a flow controllable peristaltic pump was used to feed the substrate into the reactor the hydraulic retention time hrt was set at 6 h during the whole experiment another peristaltic pump was used to feed the concentrated cacl2 solution from phase ⅰ to phase ⅴ no manual sludge discharge was conducted from phase ⅵ to phase ⅸ sludge discharge was conducted regularly to stabilize the sludge concentration in reactor the temperature of the reaction sink was controlled at 25 1 c by a heater the room temperature was under 20 c during the whole experiment so no cooling measure was needed during the experiment as shown in table 1 the whole experiment was divided into 9 phases according to the increase of calcium

experiment is shown in fig 2 the average nlr nrr nre plr prr and pre at each stage are shown in table 2 from phase ⅰ to phase ⅳ with the fixed nlr the influent calcium was increased with the ca p ratio from 0 5 to 3 0 as shown in table 2 the nrr and nre were almost stable with the increased calcium in influent from phase ⅴ to phase ⅸ with the alternating increase of influent calcium and ammonium the influent nlr was further increased to 1 25 kg m3 d phase ⅴ and ⅵ 1 5 kg m3 d phase ⅶ and ⅷ and finally 2 0 kg m3 d phase ⅸ while the influent ca p ratio to 3 0 phase ⅴ 4 0 phase ⅵ and ⅶ to 6 0 phase ⅷ and ⅸ from table 2 the nrr and nre were stable until phase ⅷ however in phase ⅸ an obvious decrease in nre was observed while the nrr achieved was the highest at approximately 1 2 kg m3 d since the influent calcium was same in phase ⅷ and ⅸ the decrease in the nre was attributed to the limitation of nitrogen removal capacity of the experimental configuration rather the effect of influent calcium which will be discussed later the p removal performance shown in fig 2d indicates that the nre increased with the improvement of ca p ratio during the whole experiment at the final phase ⅸ with the influent ca p ratio of 6 0 a pre of 83 0 was achieved the saturation indexes si of minerals that might be generated were calculated using the hydrochemistry software aqion 6 2 6 based on synthetic wastewater composition and other operational conditions applied in this system ma et al 2018b as shown in fig 3 on the one hand from the figure the improved saturation indexes of the calcium phosphate especially the hap were beneficial to p removal on the other hand even at the same ca p ratio in phase ⅵ and ⅴ phases ⅵ and ⅶ and phases ⅷ and ⅸ an increase in pre was observed as shown in table 2 this indicates that the microbial activity also accelerated p removal johansson et al 2017 which also will be discussed later 3 2 the sludge characteristics and specific sludge activity from fig 4 a the mlvss and mlss concentration increased as the experiment proceeding from phase ⅰ to phase ⅴ at phase ⅴ the mlvss of 9 0 g l was achieved which was relatively high for the one stage pna process to date the highest reported nrr for the one stage pna research was 3 9 kg m3 d while the mlvss was just 11 0 g l wang et al 2017 in another study the nrr was 2 0 kg m3 d and the mlvss was below 7 2 g l shaopo wang et al 2017 in the expanded granular sludge bed egsb pna reactor with the nrr of 2 3 kg m3 d a high mlvss of 25 g l was reported wang and gao 2018 in a continuous stirred tank cstr pna reactor an extremely high nrr of 2 83 kg m3 d was achieved with the mlvss of 11 g l qian et al 2017 in addition both the mlvss mlss ratio and the svi30 had the decreased trend while no obvious variation was found for sv30 as shown in fig 4b and fig 4c from these results it can be concluded that the biomass in this study was adequate anammox bacteria is sensitive to the external environment and in suspended sludge type operations sludge washout is a terrible problem with the anammox based process manonmani and joseph 2018 zhang et al 2017 thus these results clearly indicate that the calcium addition is beneficial to the biomass retention this can be attributed to enhanced gravity of the sludge due to the combination of microbes and the generated calcium phosphate crystals gonzalez gil et al 2015 sobeck and higgins 2002 besides because proper calcium cations can form bridges between bacteria and negatively charged bioflocs they are also important for bioflocculation and granulation ma et al 2019 sobeck and higgins 2002 fig 5 a and fig 5b showed the size change of sludge aggregates during the whole experiment it was obvious that both the peak size and the average size of the aggregate had a decreasing trend from phase ⅰ to phase ⅴ this may be partly due to the breakdown of sludge aggregates due to increased collision chance with high sludge concentration liu et al 2017 from phase ⅵ to phase ⅸ with regular sludge discharge the peak size and average size of the aggregate both tended to increase this was attributed to the increase in the biomass growth according to the anammox reaction equation 2 in the pure anammox reactor novel anammox granules with a hap core were cultivated with a granule diameter larger than 1 0 mm ma et al 2018b zhang et al 2018 2016 it has been reported that sludge washout is more likely with smaller sludge particles however in this study excellent settleability was still achieved although the diameter of the granules was smaller with average particle size less than 0 22 mm as shown in fig 5b there may be two factors contributing to this difference in the one stage process the fierce shear force caused by the aeration would crush the formed granules liu et al 2017 the mechanical strength and structure of the granule was weakened due to that there were two main kinds of bacteria with different physiological metabolism in one stage pna reactor liu et al 2017 it was reported that small granules ranging between 0 5 mm and 0 9 mm had a higher nitrogen removal capacity than large ones wang et al 2014 however in this study excellent nitrogen removal performance was still achieved with smaller sludge aggregates solid liquid interface height falling versus the time with 1000 ml suspended mixed liquid in 1000 ml graduate and the solids flux density by settling versus the mlss were depicted according to the previous researches david hendricks 2006 dick 1970 as shown in fig 5c and fig 5d from the results it was obvious the settling laws of sludge with low mlss mlss 8 8g l was accordance with the hindered settling type for activated sludge the flux density reaches a peak and then declines with the mlss dick 1970 for high mlss 19 4g l the settling laws of sludge was accordance with the stokes law david hendricks 2006 the velocity increases with the raise of particle density which also indicated that the biomass and the crystals were well combined in this study crystallization has been shown to increase the settling velocity of granules winkler et al 2013 the alteration of granule properties helped to prevent the escape of gas due to the resultant decrease in sludge density the granules inevitably float in high rate anammox reactors song et al 2017 this problem did not occur in this study due to the increased sludge density table 3 also showed the specific sludge activity and the cytochrome c change during the whole experiment it is clear that the sdia and sdaa were relatively low compared to the saa this is evidence that the main pathway for nitrogen removal was the pna route meanwhile a decrease in the saa was observed from phase ⅰ to phase ⅴ this can partly be attributed to the mismatching of high biomass concentration and the nlr qian et al 2017 with excess biomass in the reactor and the limited nlr individual microbes would experience malnutrition resulting in a decrease in activity another reason was that because part of the microbe was covered by crystal mass transfer was blocked xing et al 2015 which will be stated later from phase ⅵ to phase ⅸ the saa was almost stable with the stable sludge concentration the variation of cytochrome c also served as an important indicator for saa and relative to the variation of saa 3 3 mineral species identification and element analysis of composite granular sludge from the xrd analysis the dried sludge samples obtained from reactor in last phase without the removal of organic matter showed a sharp legible pattern indicating the presence of different crystalline forms compared with reference spectra in database hap carbonate hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 3 co3 3 oh 2 and calcium phosphate hydrate ca3 po4 2 xh2o were the major phases as shown in fig 6 a in order to distinguish the main substance a raman spectra analysis was conducted from fig 6b the sludge band of 956 cm 1 was very similar to the band of hap at po4 3 ν1 961 cm 1 rey et al 2011 the other three bands of the hap reference were located at 429 585 and 1042 cm 1 and were not obvious in this sludge sample thus the main crystal in sludge was identified as hap further the dry sludge was digested for inorganic element analysis as shown in table 4 the inorganic elements were mainly calcium and p the ratio of ca p was 2 21 which was close to the theoretical ratio of hap 2 15 from the above it was conclusively shown that the phosphate formed in sludge was mainly in the form of hap an average 13 41 p 30 71 in p2o5 was accumulated in the dry sludge the recovered precipitates contained 10 15 of p and could potentially be reused in phosphate fertilizer production yao et al 2017 therefore the sludge obtained from this study was suitable for p recovery 3 4 sludge aggregate structure identification the sem analysis was adapted for aggregate structure identification in fig 7 a a cluster of aggregates were presented and it was obvious that the individual aggregates were irregular from fig 7b 7c 7d the surface of aggregate has many caves and protuberances these were very close in size to bacteria cells characterized by irregular or coccoid shapes van niftrik et al 2008 van niftrik et al 2008 in addition from the fig 7d there were distinct porous structure which may have been caused by gas release from the anammox reaction qian et al 2017 in a previous study high magnification imaging using backscattered electrons also revealed that anammox bacteria may be embedded in calcium phosphate precipitates gonzalez gil et al 2015 therefore from this point there is doubt that the combination of bacteria with the hap resulted in the improved settleability of sludge in addition this microbe crystal aggregate could be deem as a carrier and a biofilm like in other one stage carrier packing pna processes dapena mora et al 2010 lin et al 2013 however the crystal in this study was spontaneously formed and served both as carrier for microbe growth and recyclable resources a decrease in bacterial activity cell decay in the activated sludge could be attributed to cell death reduction in the amount of active bacteria and activity decay reduction in the specific activity of active bacteria from the sem observation the inactivated biomass increased due to the harboring of deposits which partly explained the decrease in the saa decrease as stated in section 3 2 according to the elemental mapping of aggregate section using edx as shown in fig 8 carbon and oxygen were mainly distributed on the surface and edge of sludge aggregate section this indicated the active microbe was distributed on the out layer of the sludge aggregate while the crystal was mainly in the core of the sludge aggregate johansson et al 2017 finally the formation mechanism of the crystal biomass combined sludge aggregate was illustrated in fig 9 as the bacteria growth and hap crystallization occurred simultaneously bacteria cell and hap well bond with each other in the formed sludge aggregate with the size of aggregate increasing the interior bacteria were blocked from mass transfer and then lysis finally the later formed hap occupied the space of decomposed bacteria in addition during this process the anammox bacteria activity changed the local environment of the aggregate which partly was beneficial to the hap crystallization johansson et al 2017 3 5 sludge morphology it can be seen in fig 10 that with no sludge discharge before phase ⅵ the sludge aggregate changed from loose particles surrounded with the transparent organic substances identified by edx in phase ⅰ as shown in fig 10a to individual dense particles surrounded with crystal substances identified by edx in phase ⅴ as shown in fig 10b the crystal were the hap after the biomass lysis from the sludge aggregate with the no sludge discharge means the long sludge retention time srt as shown in fig 9 with regular sludge discharge short srt at the last phase ⅸ while the sludge aggregate with the dense particle was similar to that of phase ⅴ there was a marked decrease in crystal substances as shown in fig 10c without sludge discharge from phase ⅰ to phase ⅴ the mlss and mlvss were obviously lower than theoretical biomass concentration and the sum of biomass and crystal concentration as shown in fig 4a it is well known that crystals formed in the reactor can be retained in the reactor however the biomass will experience lysis when there is no sludge discharge yang et al 2013 from fig 4b the mlvss mlss ratio was lower than the theoretical ratio of biomass the sum of biomass and crystal this is evidence that the biomass lysis happened as this study was also focused on p recovery this phenomenon indicated that long srt control has potential as an effective strategy to improve the mlvss mlss ratio of sludge in effect this increases the calcium phosphate contents in sludge for p recovery which will be further discussed later the theoretical ratio of bir bir cir was higher than the actual ratio of mlvss increase rate mlss increase rate in the initial several phases as shown in fig 4d this may be attributed to the low rate crystallization due to the seed crystal shortage and the low saturation index of calcium phosphate as shown in fig 3 the situation was reversed in phase ⅴ it was verified that biomass lysis heavily occurred when there was no sludge discharge as shown in fig 10b from phase ⅵ to phase ⅸ with regular sludge discharge from reactor the theoretical ratio of bir bir cir was closely parallel to the actual ratio of mlvss increase rate mlss increase rate which indicated that sludge concentration control is important for maintaining the stable mlvss mlss ratio in the reactor it was inferred that with the regular discharge of sludge cell lysis was avoided and the complete formed sludge aggregate with both biomass and hap was maintained as shown in fig 10c in this kind of pna hap process there are three likely situations in biomass growth and hap crystallization the first is the low crystal crystallization rate with high biomass growth rate equal to the high nrr in which the crystal occupies only a little part of the sludge aggregate with a high mlvss mlss ratio this kind of sludge floats easily that lead to the unstable nitrogen removal performance song et al 2017 the second situation is the ideal case the crystal crystallization rate and biomass growth rate is maintained with a proper ratio which strongly enhances sludge settleability this situation is ideal for both nitrogen removal and desirable p recovery the third situation is the high crystal crystallization rate and low biomass growth rate this is a dangerous situation due to the possibility that the surface of biomass will be covered by the thick crystal layer lin et al 2013 in the worst situation biological activity will become blocked as the mass transfer breaks up in this study it was obvious that the first and third situation did not emerge in addition as the microbe experienced lysis the formed crystal could remain stable in the reactor therefore with no discharge of sludge the mlss increased continuously with the drop of mlvss mlss ratio actually in actual operations with this high mlss such as 22 4 g l in phase ⅴ aeration became difficult since the higher density of mixed liquor increased the air pump energy consumption for air transportation therefore from phase ⅵ the sludge discharge was conducted regularly with the targeted sludge mlvss concentration below 7 0 g l from table 5 it can be seen that during the last four phases the stable mlvss mlss ratio was almost achieved and was close to the ratio of mlvss increase rate mlss increase rate this is evidence of the feasibility of a long term stable operation of this novel process 3 6 microbial community as shown in fig 11 a 24 phyla were detected in this experiment members of the phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi are usually observed in n removal reactors chu et al 2015 gonzalez martinez et al 2017 wang et al 2016 bacteroidetes organisms can also remove p and organic matter xu et al 2018 the growth of chloroflexi chlorobi and proteobacteria relied on scavenging polysaccharides and proteins of smp and eps produced by anammox bacteria chu et al 2015 miura et al 2007 proteobacteria is a common flora in the denitrification reaction system it can utilize substrate nh4 n or no2 n for metabolism and proliferation activities and simultaneously consume dissolved oxygen creating an anaerobic environment for the anammox bacteria cao et al 2016 2017 members of the acidobacteria phylum have been considered oligotrophic bacteria due to high abundances in low organic carbon environments kielak et al 2016 armatimonadetes and proteobacteria could contribute the secondary metabolites molybdopterin cofactor and folate for anammox bacteria to benefit their activity and growth zhao et al 2018 the obvious decreased phylum was chlorobi chlorobi affiliated bacteria had the ability to degrade extracellular proteins produced by anammox bacteria to amino acids to affect consortium aggregation zhao et al 2018 the obvious increased phylum was the chloroflexi it was reported as the chloroflexi affiliated bacteria encoded the function of biosynthesizing exopolysaccharides for anammox consortium aggregation based on the partial nucleotide sugars produced by anammox bacteria additionally the chloroflexi affiliated bacteria harbored genes for a nitrite loop and could have a dual role in anammox performance during reactor start up zhao et al 2018 the genera with a percent above 0 55 were shown in fig 11b no nob were detected in the reactor nitrospirae was not detected in three phases which indicated that nob was well controlled in the experiment wang et al 2018 table 6 illustrates the percentage change of main functional bacteria species the aob genera was mainly from genus nitrosomonas there were little genus nitrosococcus aob in the initial phases and this disappeared in later phases the single anammox bacteria belonged to genus kuenenia was detected without obvious variation and a maximum percent of 29 5 in phase ⅰ genus kuenenia is a k strategist with a low substrate half saturation constant liu et al 2017 park et al park et al 2010 concluded that feed composition and therefore substrate concentrations in the reactor may be the main factor determining microbial community selection over inoculum composition and reactor configuration in this study the nitrite concentration in reactor was maintained at an almost undetectable level which was though the crucial factor leading to the existence of only one anammox species of genus kuenenia in the reactor 3 7 enlightenment from this study as reported in a previous study phosphate was found in some granules regardless of whether the pure anammox reactor or one stage pna reactor was used and this phenomenon is defined as bio induced phosphate crystallization johansson et al 2017 ma et al 2018b from another perspective the results of this study indicate that intentional phosphate crystallization in granules with a proper mass has no negative effect on microbe activity from the chemical perspective a high calcium or high ph in influent is effective measure together with stable influent p concentration for high pre by hap crystallization as shown in the equation 3 however in this study the nitrogen removal related microbe was involved besides hap crystallization in the reactor and was sensitive to the high ph value yue et al 2018 as a result it was infeasible to increase ph to improve p removal thus with the stable influent p concentration calcium addition was the only feasible measure as shown in fig 3 it was obvious that during the whole experiment the si of hap was high which was beneficial to the hap crystallization from the perspective of the solubility equilibrium however no hap deposit was found on the surface of reactor wall also it was observed that the nitrogen removal activity aggrandized p removal as stated in section 3 1 these indicated that hap crystallization was a bio induced process rather than a simple chemical process johansson et al 2017 as the anammox bacteria has a long double time the retention of biomass in the reactor was crucial for the stable operation of one stage pna reactor although the use of a biofilm type reactor using carrier or fixed bed would improve this situation biofilm culturing is time consuming liu et al 2017 also while the membrane reactor can achieve the high biomass retention the nrr is limited and membrane fouling is a serious problem niu et al 2016 it seems the sludge type is the most convenient way to setup the one stage pna process but with the operation conditions inevitably fluctuating the sludge is easily washout guo et al 2020a this study proves the efficient sludge retention through hap crystallization in addition the excellent settleability of biomass enhanced the buffer ability of the reactor when facing the fluctuation of operation parameters this is one benefit of simultaneous pna hap crystallization for a long period the chemical crystallization method for p removal in aerobic reactor presented a puzzle due to the large volume of sludge produced with a p content so low that the recovery of p was uneconomical guo et al 2020a however it was well known that the anammox process has low sludge production thus for the same p removal rate combined with the anammox based process the content of p in the sludge could be increased making the recovery of p feasible in this study it is conclusively shown that a high quality p containing product can be obtained 4 conclusion in this study the simultaneous nitrogen removal and p recovery was successfully realized through the pna hap process in an alr reactor the hap crystallization in pna reactor solved the long standing sludge washout problem the well combination of the microbes and hap resulted in high biomass concentration in reactor allowing for stable nitrogen removal performance and the harvested sludge was ideal for p recovery this study presents a feasible method for the treatment of digestion effluent with both efficient nitrogen removal and
