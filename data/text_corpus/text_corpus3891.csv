carbonaceous tio2 and its application to ppcp removal including its influence on water chemistry and the relevant operational parameters finally we present an analysis of current priorities in the

purposes jiang et al 2013 omar et al 2016 yang et al 2017a ppcp can be further classified as antibiotics anticonvulsants contrast agents hormones nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids β blockers lipid regulators painkillers preservatives disinfectants insect repellants fungicides soaps and detergents fragrances and sunscreen uv filters yang et al 2017a ppcp are transported to the aqueous environment through domestic wastewater industrial wastewater runoff and landfill leachate cardoso et al 2014 chen et al 2016 kapelewska et al 2016 lu et al 2015 fig 1 of these treatment plants for sewage and industrial wastewater were found to be the largest sources of ppcp jiang et al 2013 lester et al 2013 previous studies found that concentrations of diclofenac as low as 5 μg l 1 can accumulate inside the bodies of rainbow trout schwaiger et al 2004 and a mixture of acetaminophen carbamazepine gemfibrozil and venlafaxine at concentration 0 5 and 10 μg l 1 can cause significant effects to zebrafish including tissue degeneration a decline in embryo production and increased in embryo mortalities galus et al 2013 it is therefore extremely troublesome that ppcp can be found in surface and ground waters at concentrations ranging up to 10 000 μg l 1 and 100 μg l 1 for pharmaceuticals and personal care products respectively yang et al 2017a numerous techniques for removing ppcp from water have been reported including activated sludge jewell et al 2016 fungi li et al 2016 microalgae bai and acharya 2016 matamoros et al 2016 wetlands rühmland et al 2015 zhang et al 2013a 2013b 2016 adsorption ali et al 2016 baghdadi et al 2016 lerman et al 2013 mailler et al 2016 nielsen and bandosz 2016 wei et al 2013 and membranes jin et al 2012 sheng et al 2016 wang et al 2016 conventional wastewater treatment plants use biological processes e g activated sludge and wetlands with removal efficiencies for ppcp in the range of 50 90 ibáñez et al 2013 zhang et al 2013b while ppcp removal becomes relatively high in some cases many of the ppcp are antimicrobial agents and designed to be persistent mcclellan and halden 2010 thus ppcp can be and are detected in the effluent of conventional wastewater treatment plants in many countries around the world yang et al 2017b there is therefore a need for improved physical treatment methods e g adsorption based systems and membranes for ppcp removal adsorption and membrane filtration have shown high removal efficiencies over 90 ali et al 2016 baghdadi et al 2016 jin et al 2012 sheng et al 2016 however adsorption based systems and membranes only trap ppcp they do not destroy them moreover the spent adsorbents and rejected water from the membrane processes are classified as secondary contaminants ateia et al 2018 xu et al 2017 several reviews have examined photocatalyst performance and the limitations and advanced modification of tio2 chong et al 2010 dong et al 2015 leary and westwood 2011 melchionna et al 2016 woan et al 2009 daghrir et al 2013 reviewed some modified forms of tio2 including anion and cation doping and coupling with narrow band gap semiconductors mxoy tio2 or mssy tio2 in addition khalid et al 2017 reviewed the modification of tio2 with carbonaceous nanomaterials as an alternative and innovative approach for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity all of these reviews suggest that intentionally modified tio2 have better photocatalytic activity than pristine tio2 one modified form in particular carbonaceous tio2 has attracted a lot of attention for environmental applications however in the case of ppcp photodegradation most reviews have focused on the use of tio2 tong et al 2012 reviewed the parameters governing tio2 photocatalysis for the removal of pharmaceuticals and the ecotoxicity of photoproducts in the recent years mahmoud et al 2017 also reviewed tio2 photocatalysis for removing pharmaceuticals and the possible formation of photodegradation by products kanakaraju et al 2014 presented an overview of tio2 photocatalysis for treatment of pharmaceuticals in wastewater lee et al 2017 reviewed the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment and the application of tio2 photocatalysis sarkar et al 2014 presented an in depth review of the application and process parameters that affect tio2 photocatalysis for the removal of pharmaceuticals in fig 2 we illustrate the compilation of all studies in the literature and the current trends for ppcp photocatalysis by carbonaceous tio2 ppcp even with the same molecular weight and under the same light conditions showed variations of half life which can be caused by the differences in the chemical backbone romão et al 2017 as well as in operating conditions to the best of our knowledge there is currently no review considering the use of carbonacoues tio2 composites for removing ppcp from contaminated water thus a comprehensive understanding of the use of carbonaceous tio2 for the remediation of ppcp would help optimize the development and implementation of this composite in this paper we present a critical review of recent developments and applications of carbonaceous tio2 composite photocatalysts for removing ppcp from water and the key water chemistry and operational parameters 2 pharmaceuticals and personal care products pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcp are a class of compounds that mainly consists of polar molecules with molecular weights ranging from 150 to 1000 daltons da and a wide variety of physicochemical properties barceló and petrovic 2007 kim and tanaka 2009 rahman et al 2009 suárez et al 2008 in the last decade the global annual consumption of ppcp has increased and top countries consumers include brazil russia india china and south africa tijani et al 2016 to date more than 3000 ppcp have been produced and the constant development of new chemical compounds has led to an increasing abundance and variety of ppcp in the environment chen et al 2016 of et al 2009 previous investigations showed that sewage treatment plants are the main source of ppcp into aquatic environments brunsch et al 2018 accordingly ppcp can be found in lakes bonvin et al 2011 ferguson et al 2013 subedi et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 zhu et al 2013 rivers carmona et al 2014 dai et al 2015 hanamoto et al 2018 hughes et al 2013 ground water del rosario et al 2014 gottschall et al 2012 peng et al 2014 sui et al 2015 yang et al 2017b marine and coastal areas ali et al 2018 arpin pont et al 2016 benotti and brownawell 2009 dsikowitzky et al 2015 pereira et al 2016 and in drinking water aristizabal ciro et al 2017 batt et al 2017 benotti et al 2009 t lin et al 2016a currently the main methods for removing ppcp in conventional wastewater treatment plants are biotransformation biodegradation and or adsorption on conventional adsorbents e g activated carbon alvarino et al 2018 however conventional wastewater treatment plants are inefficient at removing ppcp due to their low biodegradability coelho et al 2009 lagesson et al 2016 mirzaei et al 2016 the continuous input of ppcp into the environment is a serious concern for instance wastewater containing a mix of pharmaceuticals caused significant reproductive and other health impacts for fish al salhi et al 2012 moreover ppcp e g acetaminophen caffeine 1 7 dimethylxanthine dehydronifedine tetracycline oxytetracycline sulfonamides macrolides and ormetoprim have been detected in fruits vegetables fish meat and milk due to uptake from an environment contaminated by ppcp baron et al 2014 done and halden 2015 pan et al 2014 alternative solutions such as advanced treatment processes should be implemented to diminish the release of ppcp into environment heterogeneous photocatalysis is considered as a sustainable technique 3 heterogeneous photocatalysis heterogeneous photocatalysis is an oxidation process occurring on semiconductor solid catalysts illuminated at suitable wavelengths ahmad et al 2016 sudha and sivakumar 2015 venkata laxma reddy et al 2011 among frequently used semiconductor materials tio2 shows the greatest potential among developing green chemistry technologies there are three different polymorphs of tio2 crystals namely anatase rutile and brookite friedmann et al 2010 when zhang et al 2014a compared the photocatalytic activity of the three polymorphs anatase tio2 was found to exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity the longest lifetime of the photoexcited electron and the fastest migration of photogenerated electrons therefore anatase is the preferred polymorph of tio2 in photocatalysis basically light with a certain energy λ 380 nm an energy that is greater than the band gap i e the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band in semiconductors of tio2 3 2 ev excites the electron from the valence band to the conduction band and creates an electron hole pair e and h electrons and holes on the surface of a semiconductor participate in redox reactions that produce reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide anion radicals o2 the key reactions in the photocatalytic oxidation and reduction mechanism are summarized in fig 3 1 photoexcitation tio2 hv e h 2 charge carrier trapping of e e cb e tr 3 charge carrier trapping of h h vb h tr 4 electron hole recombination e tr h vb h tr e cb heat 5 photoexcited e scavenging o2 ads e o2 6 oxidation of hydroxyls h2o h oh h 7 photodegradation by oh contaminants oh intermediate s h2o 8 direct photoholes contaminants h intermediate s final degradation products 9 protonation of superoxide o2 h ho2 10 co scavenging of e ho2 e ho2 11 formation of h2o2 ho2 h h2o2 the surface trapped valence band electron e tr and conduction band hole h tr are formed by the processes shown in eqs 2 and eq 3 respectively these trapped carriers on the tio2 surface do not recombine immediately after photoexcitation chong et al 2010 in parallel in the absence of an electron scavenger the photoexcited electron recombines with the valence band hole in nanoseconds eq 4 schneider et al 2014 therefore the presence of electron scavengers is very important in photocatalysis to retard recombination the presence of oxygen prevents the recombination of the electron hole pair electron scavenger and allows the formation of superoxide o2 eq 5 superoxide radicals can be protonated to form hydroperoxyl radicals ho2 that can react further to form h2o2 eqs 9 11 it should be noted that all of these reactions to produce reactive oh occurred due to the presence of both dissolved oxygen and water the overall process of heterogeneous photocatalysis can be decomposed into five steps herrmann 1999 first ppcp move from the fluid phase to the interface region of the catalyst by diffusion second ppcp are adsorbed onto the surface of the photocatalyst third a chemical reaction occurs with oxidizing and or reducing species in the vicinity of the surface fourth by products desorb finally products are removed from the interface region into the bulk fluid previous studies showed that the photocatalytic degradation of ppcp using tio2 could reach up to 99 within one to three hours czech and buda 2016 lin et al 2016a murgolo et al 2015 however the use of bare tio2 has critical limitations such as lower activity under solar irradiation than uv light λ 400 nm low adsorption capability and the difficulty of recovering it from the treated water dong et al 2015 various techniques e g cation doped anion doped coupled semiconductor have been tested in the development of tio2 based systems daghrir et al 2013 despite significant efforts carbonaceous materials offer unique advantages e g chemical inertness stability electrical properties and tunable structure that have not been adequately tested combining tio2 with carbonaceous materials has attracted a lot of attention as a strategy for enhancing the performance of tio2 photocatalysts as described in the following section 4 carbonaceous tio2 photocatalysis activated carbon ac carbon nanotubes cnts and graphene are the main carbonaceous materials that have been tested for use in water and wastewater treatment santhosh et al 2016 these materials have large specific surface areas and high charge carrier mobility leary and westwood 2011 table 1 shows a summary of 29 studies on ppcp removal using three different carbonaceous tio2 composites published over the past seven years overall the composites of carbonaceous materials with tio2 have higher photocatalytic activity adsorption capacity electron scavenging and sensitization ability and extended visible light absorption relative to bare tio2 khalid et al 2017 table 1 summarizes studies of the ability of photocatalytic carbonaceous tio2 to degrade personal care products such studies are very limited compared for example to pharmaceuticals further studies of using photocatalytic carbonaceous tio2 for ppcp photodegradation in complex water matrices are limited overall cnt tio2 and graphene tio2 showed better response to visible light irradiation than ac tio2 due to better heterojunction interaction however synthesis methods affected the characteristics of carbonaceous tio2 as well as their photocatalytic activity table 2 presents a comparison among the common synthesis methods of carbonaceous tio2 composites the degradation of ppcp is enhanced when using composites of carbonaceous materials with tio2 because of four main mechanisms first the affinity and the mobility of ppcp on carbonaceous materials and the high specific surface areas of carbonaceous materials help to harvest the ppcp and concentrate them close to the tio2 active site for enhanced photodegradation kuvarega and mamba 2016 li puma et al 2008 carbonaceous material is well known as an effective adsorbent due to hydrophobic interaction π π interactions hydrogen bonding interactions and electrostatic and dispersion interactions ateia et al 2017a second carbonaceous materials acts as electron scavengers due to their large electron storage capacity this property which hinders electron recombination is known as the hoffmann mechanism woan et al 2009 simply when a photon with sufficient energy excites an electron from the valence band to the conduction band of tio2 a hole is created in the valence band h instead of returning to the valence band in carbonaceous materials the excited electrons are transferred into the graphitic π electron band retarding recombination because of entropy the electron becomes lost the holes that remain h on the tio2 are available to take part in redox reactions third carbonaceous materials act as sensitizers that provide electrons to tio2 these electrons can be excited by photons of the light energy thereby resulting in the generation of superoxide radicals from adsorbed molecular oxygen in addition the positively charged carbonaceous materials attract electrons from tio2 and create a hole h in the tio2 valence band which reacts with adsorbed water to create hydroxyl radicals fourth the presence of carbon oxygen titanium linkages in the composite system reduces the band gap and extends the absorption band into the lower energy visible range wang et al 2005 the carbonaceous tio2 photocatalysis mechanisms are summarized in fig 4 4 1 activated carbon tio2 composites activated carbon ac is a porous and amorphous solid carbon material which can be derived from coal or plants and is the most common carbonaceous material used for water or wastewater treatment ac is typically prepared in two stages carbonization i e heating at temperature between 400 and 600 c to drive off volatile components and activation i e increase surface area using an activating agent such as steam or co2 li puma et al 2008 ac has a rigid porosity on the macro 50 nm meso 2 50 nm and micro 2 nm scale pore range with a specific surface area ranging up to 1250 m2 g 1 leary and westwood 2011 mailler et al 2016 park et al 2015 patiño et al 2015 further ac has wide range of functional groups on its surface including carboxyl carbonyl phenol lactone and quinone groups that enhance the affinity of ac for ppcp bhatnagar et al 2013 for these reasons researchers have used ac as a supporting material in photocatalysis applications using methods such as sol gel rey et al 2012 chemical vapor deposition li puma et al 2008 impregnation gar alalm et al 2016 pyrolysis lara lópez et al 2017 precipitation otieno et al 2017 hydrothermal preparation liu et al 2007 microwave assisted synthesis orha et al 2017 sonochemical treatment tan et al 2013 dip coating omri and benzina 2015 and molecular self assembly sun et al 2016 ac tio2 composites have been extensively studied for ppcp degradation basha et al 2011 2010 el sheikh et al 2017 gar alalm et al 2016 keane et al 2011 khraisheh et al 2013 ma et al 2017 quiñones et al 2014 rey et al 2012 rosa et al 2017 they are effective due to their uniform pore structure that enhances photocatalytic activity and their high ability to adsorb and concentrate contaminants ma et al 2017 for instance khraisheh et al 2013 prepared activated charcoal from coconut shell material an inexpensive source of carbon known to also have superior quality and prepared a tio2 composite material ac tio2 had a highest removal efficiency and the composite removed carbamazepine up to 98 uvc intensity of 10 5 mw cm 2 for 40 min in addition response surface methodology rsm and a central composite design model ccd were used to evaluate the optimum parameters e g calcination temperature and ac loading amount for preparing ac tio2 composite this group of researchers demonstrated that surface area pore size distribution tio2 crystal structure and composite size have significant influences on the adsorption and photocatalytic activities of ac tio2 composites the complete removal of pharmaceuticals e g amoxicillin ampicillin paracetamol and diclofenac can be achieved using ac tio2 composites after 180 min of sunlight irradiation while using only tio2 could not match this performance gar alalm et al 2016 the enhanced performance is due to the transfer of sorbates on ac to photoactive tio2 through the common interface between them leary and westwood 2011 moreover in this study the total costs of ac tio2 was estimated to be around 2 3 3 19 per m3 of treated water which is similar to the total cost for tio2 therefore using ac tio2 rather than tio2 is recommended another study of ac tio2 composites showed higher adsorption and photodegradation of amoxicillin a β lactam antibiotic than for pure ac or tio2 basha et al 2011 this may occur due to chemisorption between amoxicillin and functional groups on the ac tio2 surface involving valence bond sharing or electron exchange basha et al 2010 moreover this ac tio2 maintained its photocatalytic activity over four consecutive cycles of treatment and cleaning this work shows that tio2 loadings and substrate adsorption are important factors affecting photocatalysis by ac tio2 composites meanwhile quiñones et al 2014 reported enhanced photocatalytic activity and reusability of magnetic ac tio2 fe by adding ozone i e photocatalytic ozonation photocatalytic ozonation of magnetic ac tio2 fe showed a high degree of mineralization of metoprolol 80 at 5 h reaction times moreover this material can be easily separated and the photocatalytic ozonation of this material exhibited no significant loss retaining the overall toc removal at 75 85 over 10 consecutive cycles the higher removal in this system could be attributed to the synergies of direct ozonation ozone photolytic decomposition heterogeneous photocatalysis fenton reaction and the photo fenton reaction the surface chemistry of ac plays an important role in the production of oxidants such as super oxide and hydroxyl radicals velo gala et al 2017 ac itself can act as a photocatalyst by promoting electrons from the valence band into the conduction band and increasing the generation of oh in the solution under uv or solar irradiation velo gala et al 2013 studies of the correlation between the surface chemistry of ac and the concentration of oxidants shows that 1 while an increase in lactone and anhydride surface groups leads to more oh under uv irradiation generation of oh decreased with increasing surface oxygen content e g carboxyl groups 2 an increase in physisorbed water enhanced production of superoxide o2 during uv irradiation 3 under solar irradiation oh concentrations increase with an increase in carboxyl surface groups but the concentration of o2 decreases as carboxyl and quinone surface groups increases 4 in both uv and solar irradiation aromatic ring and surface oxygen groups on ac contributed to the stabilization of photogenerated electrons and 5 ac with the lowest energy band gap favors enhanced oh production while the larger energy band gap of ac preferentially enhances production of o2 the extension of absorption bands to longer visible wavelengths is one of the proposed synergistic processes in ac tio2 composites however at present the photocatalytic activity of ac tio2 composites is limited due to insufficient interactions between ac and tio2 leary and westwood 2011 diffuse reflectance spectra of ac tio2 show absorption at wavelength shorter than uv vis 400 nm approximately 380 nm which is not so different with the bare tio2 385 nm omri et al 2014 wang et al 2013 thus there is minimal shifting towards the visible light region in the ac tio2 composite system tio2 loaded onto an ac fiber belt felt acf has a lower band gap 2 95 ev compared to pure tio2 3 22 ev due to perterbation of the tio2 absorption by its interaction with acf li et al 2017a this may be because of surface morphology the interactions that shift and scale absorption bands are intense but only over molecular distances kumar et al 2017 another study showed that f n codoped tio2 on magnetic ac exhibits an enhanced absorption at visible wavelengths with a significant red shift in the transition measured using uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra ma et al 2017 codoping with f and n gave a better match for excitation with sunlight the band gap of the magnetic ac f n tio2 composite was estimated to be 2 6 3 0 ev in addition the small particle size of this composite yields a greater surface defect density further increasing absorption at low band gap energies martins et al 2017 there are several studies however that show decreased photocatalytic activity for ac tio2 composites compared to pure tio2 rey et al 2012 rosa et al 2017 the photocatalytic activity of titania coated magnetically activated carbon tifec was not as high as pure tio2 degussa 25 for photodegradation of metoprolol very likely due to non uniform size and tio2 concentration in the composite particles rey et al 2012 however this tifec composite showed continued good reactivity through five series of photocatalytic experiments and it is easy to separate using an external magnetic field the superiority of pristine tio2 compared to the ac tio2 composite may be due to the higher availability of active sites and the physicochemical properties of ac cordero et al 2007 rosa et al 2017 in addition the incorrect use of the simplified langmuir hinshelwood equation for analyzing the photocatalytic kinetics of ac tio2 can lead to erroneous conclusions asenjo et al 2013 therefore the development of new synthesis methods for ac tio2 composites that are active under uv and solar irradiation is still needed in parallel an appropriate photocatalysis kinetics model for ac tio2 composites needs to be developed to provide a fundamental physical mechanism describing photodegradation rates as an evaluation of synergetic interaction 4 2 carbon nanotube tio2 composites recent decades have seen greatly increased interest in photocatalysis using carbon nanotubes tio2 cnts are composed of cylindrical graphene sheets and can be categorized as single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts and multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts iijima 1991 cnts have an usually high specific surface area to mass ratio e g 75 1020 m2 g 1 with exceptional sorption capability czech and buda 2016 jung et al 2015 lerman et al 2013 patiño et al 2015 peigney et al 2001 wang et al 2015 wei et al 2013 in contrast to ac cnts are prone to aggregation because of hydrophobic interactions van der waals forces and π π stacking these processes lead to the formation of four different types of adsorption sites inner cavities interstitial channels external grooves and outermost surfaces agnihotri et al 2006 apul and karanfil 2015 in addition cnts show superior hydrophobicity making them as a promising material chen et al 2007 jung et al 2015 yang and xing 2010 the sorption behavior of cnts mainly depends on their surface chemistries and the nature of contaminants due to the rehybridized sp2 c c bonds and one dimensional microstructure cnts exhibit unique mechanical thermal and semiconductor properties cao et al 2013 further cnts have many advantages such as large electron storage capacity superior metallic conductivity and light absorption at a broad range of wavelengths woan et al 2009 in general cnts are an attractive option for a supporting material to enhance photocatalytic activity due to their outstanding characteristics many efforts have been made to exploit cnts as a supporting material with preparation methods including hydrothermal yuan et al 2016 hydrolysis an et al 2007 restrained hydrolysis chen et al 2011 simple evaporation and drying yao et al 2008 sol gel abbas et al 2016 surfactant wrapping sol gel gao et al 2009 chemical vapor deposition cvd ma et al 2012 physical vapor deposition pvd fan et al 2006 electrophoretic deposition epd bordbar et al 2015 electrostatic attraction daneshvar tarigh et al 2015 solvothermal zhou et al 2010 and impregnation xu et al 2010 common to these methods is that tio2 is attached to the cnts by physical and chemical bonding tio2 binds more strongly to functionalized cnts i e chemisorption compared to physisorption on pristine cnts ayissi et al 2015 in addition chemical bonding provides better electron transfer than physical bonding due to proximity and chemical coupling the use of cnt tio2 nanocomposites for the photodegradation of ppcp has been of considerable scientific interest in one study functionalized cnts and larger tio2 crystal sizes were necessary to provide good contact between the cnts and tio2 this interaction lead to a better enhancement of photocatalytic activity for caffeine photodegradation marques et al 2013 in another study acid treated cnt tio2 sio2 showed better photodegradation of diclofenac relative to untreated cnt tio2 sio2 due to optimal structure and well shaped anatase tio2 crystals czech and buda 2016 the role of sio2 in the cnt tio2 sio2 nanocomposite was to prevent transformation from the active anatase phase to the inactive rutile phase of tio2 and also as an effective agent for dispersing tio2 on the surface of cnts kibombo et al 2012 further photodegradation decreased the toxicity of treated waters as shown by microtox toxicity tests in another study the photocatalytic activity of cnt tio2 towards diclofenac was increased with the addition of dissolved oxygen and h2o2 as an electron scavenger martínez et al 2011a use of solar radiation for photocatalysis is promising for future photocatalytic systems yuan et al 2016 showed that cnt tio2 n exhibited high photocatalytic activity in degrading ibuprofen under visible light irradiation the function of n doping in the composite system was to reduce the band gap in addition the occurrence of cnts resulted in a higher adsorption capacity and increased activity because the cnts could act as electron scavengers this successful synergetic effect was mainly attributed to the good binding interaction between cnts tio2 and urea meanwhile the use of an authentic wastewater matrix affected the photodegradation removal of ppcp relative to ultrapure water murgolo et al 2015 these results clearly show that an idealized experiment i e experiment in ultrapure water has limited value for understanding real world treatment operations recently increased attention has been given to the need to recover and separate nanosized photocatalysts to reduce their negative impacts on the environment an effective method for preventing these potential impacts is immobilization of the photocatalyst on a supporting material two possible approaches are 1 embedding or immobilizing the photocatalyst in a matrix or layer e g electrospinning nanofibers woan et al 2009 and 2 attaching magnetic particles to the photocatalyst composite daneshvar tarigh et al 2015 singh and sarma 2016 zhang et al 2015 a thin film of cnt tio2 showed higher photocatalytic activity for the photodegradation of 4 chlorophenol compared to the tio2 thin film because the cnts acted as an electron sink and reduced the recombination rate zouzelka et al 2016 an immobilized photocatalyst system may be preferable for several reasons such as 1 thin films can be easily adopted for use in continuous flow systems 2 it can prevent photocatalyst agglomeration and 3 it does not require separation or filtration dong et al 2014 although photocatalyst immobilization provides an alternative solution to the separation problem the photochemical reactivity of supported cnt tio2 composites is typically reduced due to the decreased mass transfer rate hindrance of light harvesting by the inert support and reduction of photocatalyst active surface area to volume ratio mascolo et al 2007 adding magnetic particles to nanocomposites is an alternative technique for separation and recovery however it should be noted that attaching magnetic particles to cnt surfaces would decrease the sites available for attaching tio2 fei et al 2016 li et al 2015 in order to overcome this issue ateia et al 2017b explored the potential advantage of using the inherent magnetic impurities of magnetic carbon nanotubes mcnt which are due to magnetic particles trapped inside the graphene cylinders as a green and facile method of removing organic micropollutants from water cnt tio2 and ac tio2 composites show higher photocatalytic activity relative to pure tio2 enhancement of photocatalytic activity was correlated with surface area and the interaction between carbonaceous materials and tio2 for ac tio2 better photocatalytic activity was correlated with the surface area of photocatalytically active sites in contrast cnts also showed better interaction with tio2 uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra results resulting in a smaller band gap i e increased response to sunlight moreover the inherent magnetic properties of cnts showed good potential for use in photocatalytic applications as they would make the composites magnetic while preserving cnts surfaces for tio2 particles 4 3 graphene tio2 composites graphene is a two dimensional sheet of carbon atoms connected by sp2 bonds and with an aromatic π electron system novoselov et al 2004 graphene has a higher density of potential adsorption sites compared to cnts due to the open plane structure with three main types of adsorption sites 1 open up surface 2 longitudinally parallel external surface 3 and interstitial channels ersan et al 2017 graphene has many unique properties including a high electron mobility high mechanical strength high thermal conductivity and high specific surface area hu et al 2013 many efforts have been made to use graphene in diverse applications including sensors wang and arash 2014 energy conversion and storage bonaccorso et al 2015 polymer composites mittal et al 2015 drug delivery systems zhang et al 2017b and environmental applications chabot et al 2014 upadhyay et al 2014 in the environmental applications graphene nanomaterials can be used as catalysts and adsorbents or disinfectant agents graphene is the precursor of the graphene family nanomaterials e g graphene oxide reduced graphene oxide fullerene carbon nano onion and cnts suárez iglesias et al 2017 of these graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo show high efficiency for water treatment due to the presence of several surface functional groups e g hydroxyl carboxyl and epoxy that act as adsorption sites fei et al 2016 shen et al 2015 moreover go itself is photocatalytically active yeh et al 2011 go can be made by chemical functionalization of graphene in several ways such as 1 the brodie method b c brodie 1859 2 the staudenmaier method poh et al 2012 3 the hoffman method poh et al 2012 and 4 the hummers method hummers and offeman 1958 however go is electrically insulating due to the chemical disruption of the π network and the reduction of go i e conversion to reduced graphene oxide has become an important reaction for restoring the electrical conductivity of the material gao 2015 moreover reduction of go can be achieved using chemical treatment stankovich et al 2007 thermal mediation lin et al 2010 and electrochemical treatment shao et al 2010 reduced graphene oxide is characterized by graphene domains with residual oxygen functionalities on their surface and improved electrical conductivity relative to go compton and nguyen 2010 numerous studies using go or rgo as a co material with tio2 for photocatalysis have been performed graphene tio2 is a robust composite and can be synthesized by several methods such as solution mixing morales torres et al 2013 sol gel azizi 2017 hydrothermal wu et al 2015 electrostatic self assembly kim et al 2012 molecular grafting tang et al 2010 chemical exfoliation akhavan and ghaderi 2009 liquid phase deposition pastrana martinez et al 2012 and electrospinning peining et al 2012 each synthesis method can affect the graphene tio2 characteristics and photocatalytic activity faraldos and bahamonde 2017 a stronger interaction between graphene and tio2 would give enhance photocatalytic activity kamat 2010 tio2 nanosheet graphene 2d 2d composite showed higher removal of 2 4 dichlorophenol than bare tio2 due to strong electronic and physical coupling in the material sun et al 2013 this interaction lead to enhancement of electron transfer and thereby superior photocatalytic activity further minella et al 2017 demonstrated synergy using a graphene tio2 composite they observed electron transfer from reduced graphene oxide to tio2 and hole transfer from tio2 to reduced graphene oxide the formation of ti o c linkages between hydroxyl surface groups on tio2 and the oxygenated surface of go leads to narrower band gaps for the go tio2 composite e g 2 5 2 9 ev the surface chemistry also changed significantly because of the go content with a higher go content giving a reduced point of zero charge pzc and more acidic composites due to the abundance of oxygenated groups morales torres et al 2013 many researchers have tried to use visible light to drive graphene tio2 photocatalysts under visible irradiation rgo tio2 composites showed significant photodegradation of diphenhydramine relative to tio2 because rgo acted as a sensitizer pastrana martinez et al 2012 and electron sink gillespie and martsinovich 2017 similar synergism in graphene tio2 has also been seen in other carbonaceous tio2 composites e g cnt tio2 fullerene tio2 and ac tio2 yang et al 2013 zhang et al 2010 although go tio2 has similar enhancement mechanisms there are significant differences in the mass ratios of carbon to tio2 yang et al 2013 a lower mass ratio of go is necessary to achieve optimum photocatalytic activity compared to cnt tio2 the pore structure and aggregation behavior of go vary among cnts gos are composed of two dimensional graphene sheets and are more prone to restacking compared to cnts ersan et al 2017 thus higher go mass ratios i e above optimum lead to the aggregation of go tio2 composites lowering photocatalytic activity the enhanced photocatalytic activity of graphene tio2 composites make them an ideal material for remediating ppcp however one of the major obstacles to using nano scale catalysts in water treatment is the difficulty in separating and recovering the catalysts recently 3d porous rgo tio2 aerogel was shown to remove carbamazepine by more than 99 nawaz et al 2017 the macroporous 3d structure of the aerogel resulted in abundant surface sites effective charge separation improved mass transport of contaminants and easy separation immobilization of rgo tio2 on optical fibers for degradation of three different ppcp carbamazepine ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole resulted in excellent degradation ppcp removal up to 80 and high durability 45 h operation lin et al 2016b another method for solving the catalyst recovery issue is by using magnetic separation in this method magnetic nanoparticles are added to the surface of the composite a magnetically recyclable go tio2 composite showed up to 99 removal of carbamazepine and caffeine within 60 min under uv irradiation and this composite was fully recoverable and reusable by magnetic separation linley et al 2014 these three methods 3d aerogel immobilization and magnetic separation demonstrate a variety of solutions supporting the application of graphene tio2 composite overall table 3 summarizes the advantages and shortcomings of ac tio2 cnt tio2 and graphene tio2 it should be emphasized that carbonaceous tio2 composites are still in development stage and most studies have been performed at lab scale a variety of synthesis methods and operating conditions within the studies make it hard to compare directly to determine the appropriate synthesis method faraldos and bahamonde 2017 therefore the establishment of a standard method for evaluating the photocatalytic activity of carbonaceous tio2 followed by a pilot scale study are needed to assess the cost and support real world applications of carbonaceous tio2 5 the role of water chemistry in photocatalytic performance water chemistry e g ph temperature contaminant concentration dissolved oxygen natural organic matters and inorganic species has a significant effect on the photocatalysis of ppcp this section discusses the significance of these parameters for the performance of carbonaceous composites of tio2 5 1 effect of ph acidity affects the surface charge of the catalyst which makes it one of the most significant operating parameters in heterogeneous photocatalysis chong et al 2010 the net surface charge of the catalyst can be positive or negative due to the amphoteric behavior of the metal oxide catalyst e g tio2 mirzaei et al 2016 the ph of the point of zero charge phpzc helps define the effect of ph on the surface charge of the catalyst phpzc is the ph at which the surface charge of the catalyst is zero and it depends on the surface chemistry several studies found the phpzc of tio2 ac tio2 cnt tio2 and graphene tio2 materials to lie in the range of 6 8 7 9 4 6 and 4 5 respectively ahmadi et al 2016 andronic et al 2014 barroso bogeat et al 2016 hua et al 2016 malekshoar et al 2014 schindler and gamsjäger 1972 for acidic conditions ph phpzc the surface charge of the catalyst is positive and increases attraction for negatively charged contaminants while for basic conditions ph phpzc the catalyst surface charge is negative attracting positively charged pollutants chong et al 2010 the protonation and deprotonation of tio2 with ph is shown by the following reactions eqs 12 and 13 12 ph phpzc tioh h tioh2 13 ph phpzc tioh oh tio h2o at low ph photogenerated holes h are the dominant oxidizing species while under neutral or alkaline solutions hydroxyl radicals play the dominant role in the contaminant oxidation lee et al 2016 however at high ph photocatalytic reactions may be inhibited because oh anions act as hole h scavengers to form oh yuan et al 2016 followed by rapid scavenging of oh by bicarbonate species to produce radical carbonate anion which is less oxidizing than oh lai et al 2017b photocatalytic oxidation of ibuprofen using cnt tio2 co doping urea showed that the highest removal efficiency was achieved when the ph of the solution was 5 due to the catalyst surface charge yuan et al 2016 in this study the phpzc of the cnt tio2 composite with co doped urea was around 6 in this acidic conditions ibuprofen would deprotonate to become its conjugate base which has a negative charge hashim and khan 2011 at ph 5 the surface charge of the catalyst is positive and ibuprofen would have a negative charge in this example changing ph was able to create electrostatic attraction between the catalyst and the contaminant when the solution ph was greater than 5 repulsion between the catalyst and ibuprofen reduced surface affinity and therefore photocatalytic ability in a different study optimum photodegradation of amoxicillin using ac tio2 was achieved at ph 9 basha et al 2011 chlorotetracycline ctc removal using go tio2 showed an increase in degradation when the ph was increased from 1 to 4 due to the net charge of chlorotetracycline and an attractive π π interaction li et al 2017b therefore appropriate ph control must be considered for carbonaceous tio2 photocatalysis in order to achieve effective ppcp removal 5 2 effect of water temperature photocatalysis can occur at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure which is one of its advantage for water treatment lee et al 2016 the optimum reaction temperature for photocatalysis tio2 is in the range 20 80 c herrmann 1999 temperature effects e and h diffusion recombination rates and adsorption of pollutants to the photocatalyst surface sarkar et al 2014 an increase in temperature 80 c may reduce adsorption chong et al 2010 and promote recombination of charge carriers gaya and abdullah 2008 resulting in lower photocatalytic activity at very low temperatures 0 c the photocatalytic activity of tio2 decreases due to the increase in activation energy needed to excite a photocatalyst herrmann 1999 however we are not aware of any studies of the influence of temperature on the activity of carbonaceous tio2 photocatalysts the effect of temperature and the optimum conditions for effective ppcp removal by carbonaceous tio2 photocatalysis must be investigated 5 3 effect of initial concentration of ppcp the initial concentration of the contaminants is an important parameter in photocatalysis the highest removal efficiency of tetracycline 95 by photocatalytic cnt tio2 was achieved when the concentration of tetracycline was 0 5 mg l 1 however for the same cnt tio2 dosage increasing tetracycline to 30 mg l decreased the removal efficiency of tetracycline from the solution ahmadi et al 2016 in an ac tio2 study longer reaction times were needed to achieve complete removal of metoprolol when the initial concentration was 50 mg l 1 than when it was 10 mg l 1 rey et al 2012 at high ppcp concentrations more ppcp molecules are adsorbed on the surface of the carbonaceous tio2 and these adsorbed contaminants inhibit photocatalysis by absorbing light before it can reach the catalyst surface mirzaei et al 2016 in addition the competitive consumption of hydroxyl radicals by photogenerated products lee et al 2016 and light scattering ahmad et al 2016 can also reduce photocatalytic activity in highly concentrated solutions previous studies of photocatalytic remediation of ppcp have been conducted with initial concentrations up to 1000 mg l 1 table 1 however studies of photocatalytic oxidation of ppcp at high concentration on the order of mg l 1 may not be relevant for predicting photocatalytic degradation of ppcp under real conditions where ppcp concentrations are on the order of μg l 1 gulyas et al 2016 it is critical to study photocatalytic oxidation at realistic concentrations of up to μg l 1 to avoid the inhibiting effects of high pollutant load 5 4 effect of dissolved oxygen dissolved oxygen do is one of the important parameters that can affect photocatalysis do acts as an electron acceptor and the reaction of an electron e with do results in the formation of free oh hoffmann et al 1995 oh is unselective and mostly occurs at the photocatalyst h2o interface it may also diffuse into the bulk solution kondrakov et al 2014 the photocatalysis rate tends to increase with higher do because o2 aq has a strong affinity for e forming o2 and reducing the electron hole recombination rate martínez et al 2011a referring to eqs 5 and 6 the contribution of do to the formation of oh is small and h2o is still the main source of oh from the photocatalytic process kondrakov et al 2016 for eq 6 the generation of oh strongly depends on the availability of h instead of the availability of e to react with o2 ads to generate superoxide eq 5 generally the henry s law constant can be used to give an approximation of do in an aqueous system the henry s law constant for o2 solvation in water is as follows 14 c p k h 15 k h k h o exp c 1 t 1 t o where c is the concentration of o2 in the water p is the partial gas pressure of o2 and k h and k ho are the henry s law constant and the henry s law constant at 298 k respectively t and to are temperature and standard state temperature 298 k in kelvin and c is a constant 1700 k for o2 this equilibrium law clearly shows the reason for the decrease in do with increasing reaction temperature i e hot water therefore if the photocatalyst is not a photothermocatalyst it may be preferential to operate the photoreactor at ambient temperature to ensure the supply of do 5 5 effect of natural organic matter natural organic matter nom is a complex mixture of organic substances that include humic substance hydrophilic acids proteins lipids carbohydrates carboxylic acids amino acids and hydrocarbon commonly present in surface waters karanfil et al 1999 ateia et al 2017c shimizu et al 2018 the effect of organic matter on the performance of photocatalysts has been studied by using natural organic matter nom doll and frimmel 2005 drosos et al 2015 li and hu 2016 peng et al 2017 van doorslaer et al 2015 this highly variable reagent impacts the photocatalytic activity of tio2 towards ppcp at high concentrations ratio of nom tio2 is more than 4 mg g 1 nom can inhibit the ability of tio2 to degrade carbamazepine while at low concentrations of nom ratio of nom tio2 500 μg g 1 the degradation rate of carbamazepine was higher than for the pure blank solution without nom drosos et al 2015 this enhanced degradation was caused by the formation of reactive species from nom i e singlet molecular oxygen 1o2 superoxide anion o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 solvated electrons e aq triplet excited states of nom 3nom which can assist in energy transfer doll and frimmel 2003 the low degradation rate for carbamazepine at high concentrations of nom was caused by the ability of nom to absorb and scatter light frimmel 1994 in addition low nom concentrations can enhance photocatalytic removal of pollutants by creating π π interactions on the photocatalyst surface that attract contaminants while at high concentrations of nom nom will prevent ppcp from reaching the surface drosos et al 2015 the inhibitory effect of nom e g humic acid can be counteracted with phosphate because it leads to a more negatively charged surface that is more hydrophilic and change the adsorption bind of humic acid long et al 2016 moreover increasing do was seen to counteract the inhibitory effect of nom because it increased the generation of superoxide ren et al 2018 however the effect of nom on the photocatalysis of ppcp by carbonaceous tio2 is nonetheless limited generally photocatalysis is used as a tertiary treatment on effluent resulting from secondary treatment e g bioremediation borges et al 2014 effluent organic matter efom is a general term for organic matter from biologically treated wastewater abbt braun et al 2004 cai and lin 2016 michael kordatou et al 2015 the composition of efom is different from natural nom efom is a combination of nom soluble microbial products smps proteins surfactants and trace chemicals barker and stuckey 1999 bodhipaksha et al 2017 jarusutthirak and amy 2007 michael kordatou et al 2015 shon et al 2007 efom is relatively hydrophilic and has a high proportion of protein like substances with molecular sizes from 102 to 105 da zhou et al 2017 therefore the differences between efom and nom include differences in their physical and chemical behavior leading to differences in their photodegradation bodhipaksha et al 2017 5 6 effect of inorganic species inorganic species in wastewater can affect the photocatalytic remediation of ppcp inorganic species such as h2o2 s2o8 2 bro3 and so3 have a beneficial effect enhancing photodegradation of contaminants by acting as electron scavengers thereby increasing the production of hydroxyl radicals and generating other oxidizing species lee et al 2016 however excessive concentrations of inorganic species can suppress photodegradation by scavenging hydroxyl radicals the removal efficiency for clofibric acid by tio2 decreased with the presence of many inorganic species nacl fecl3 fecl2 cacl2 al2 so4 3 fe2 so4 3 na2so4 nahco3 and na2co3 due to the competition for free radicals change in the ph of the solution and blockage of catalyst active sites by adsorption of anionic or cationic species rioja et al 2016 uv light attenuation by iron solutions also plays a significant role because it gives a yellowish color to the solution other colored ions can have a similar effect radical scavenging by sulfates and carbonates appeared to be stronger than for chlorides for the case of nacl photodegradation of clofibric acid at low concentrations of nacl 10 000 mg l 1 inhibits photocatalysis while at higher nacl concentrations 10 000 mg l 1 the photodegradation rate was almost the same as for ultrapure water ionic strength has been indicated as an important parameter controlling photocatalytic activity at high ionic strength the repulsive force of contaminants can be mitigated and enhancing adsorption aguedach et al 2008 similarly the presence of bicarbonate and chloride increases the toxicity of ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide during photocatalysis because of photodegradation products not found in the ultrapure water reference reaction showing that inorganic species can promote alternative photodegradation pathways lai et al 2017a finally we are not aware of any studies of how inorganic species affect carbonaceous tio2 photocatalysis the occurrence of inorganic species in water can not be excluded from the investigation of carbonaceous tio2 photocatalysis in real world systems and pretreatment to remove inorganic species are essential for effective photocatalytic treatment 6 effect of system parameters on photocatalytic activity the removal efficiency τ co ct co is expressed in where co is initial ppcp concentration and ct is ppcp concentration at certain time and oxidation rate ln ct co k app t is expressed in min 1 where k app is pseudo first order rate and t is reaction time of photocatalytic processes depend on a number of parameters including excitation wavelength light flux at surface catalyst loading and material composition nature of carbonaceous material grain size crystal structure of tio2 and ratio of tio2 to carbonaceous material to achieve high photocatalytic activity these entangled parameters need to be optimized 6 1 effect of excitation wavelength photon energy must exceed the bandgap to excite a photocatalyst and the process is favored by a material s absorption and scattering coefficients all of these properties are material dependent for pure commercial tio2 band gap eg 3 2 ev light at wavelengths λ 400 nm is required herrmann 1999 the basic equation for converting bandgap to λ is 16 e h c λ 17 e ev 1240 8 λ nm where h is planck s constant 6 626 10 34 joule s c is the speed of light 3 10 8 m s 1 1 ev is equal to 1 602 10 19 joule and 1 ångström is equal to 10 10 m a simple equation relating wavelength to band gap is given by eq 13 the uv spectrum can be divided into the uv a 315 400 nm uv b 280 315 nm and uv c 100 280 nm regions rincón and pulgarin 2005 recently the potential excitation of carbonaceous tio2 with visible light has attracted a lot of attention carbonaceous tio2 composites have a band gap around 2 6 3 ev 413 477 nm ashkarran et al 2013 taleshi 2015 carbonaceous material as a substrate creates a carbon oxygen titanium linkage which can expand the absorption band into visible wavelengths mallakpour and khadem 2016 diclofenac degradation using a cnt tio2 sio2 photocatalyst under uv 365 nm and solar irradiation 550 nm showed good performance with removal efficiencies above 70 for uv and 90 for solar light czech and buda 2016 go nanofiber tio2 composite showed a higher photodegradation rate of 4 chlorophenol under visible light irradiation relative to pristine tio2 zhang et al 2017a in contrast ac itself did not have a sufficiently strong interaction with tio2 to induce a bandgap reduction in the visible light region leary and westwood 2011 therefore more work is needed to improve ac tio2 interaction to reduce the band gap 6 2 effect of the loading of carbonaceous tio2 the kinetic rates of the photocatalysis reactions are generally proportional to the mass of the catalyst inside the reactor but the reaction rates are become independent of catalyst mass above a certain level of loading due to the full absorption of photons by the photocatalytic bed herrmann 1999 various dosages of cnt tio2 0 1 g l 1 0 4 g l 1 were used in the treatment of tetracycline the highest removal efficiency was achieved at dosage of 0 2 g l 1 ahmadi et al 2016 adding cnt tio2 above its optimum loading can cause excessive light scattering chong et al 2010 below the optimum photocatalyst loading radical generation may be insufficient mirzaei et al 2016 a similar phenomenon occurred when using ac tio2 to treat pharmaceuticals e g amoxicillin ampicillin paracetamol and diclofenac loading ac tio2 at other than its optimum concentration will lead to compromised performance due to an insufficient abundance of active sites and increased turbidity gar alalm et al 2016 optimal photocatalyst loading depends on the size and geometry of the reactor fernández ibáñez et al 1999 and the hydrodynamic particle size smaller particle sizes are better due to the higher surface to mass ratio carbajo et al 2018 6 3 effect of the ratio of carbonaceous material to tio2 the mass ratio of carbonaceous materials to tio2 is a critical factor impacting performance the two materials have a synergistic effect on adsorption and photocatalysis carbonaceous material enhances total adsorption due to the enlarged surface with favorable polarizability enhancing physisorption due to the π cloud while tio2 acts as a photocatalyst hu et al 2015 rabieh et al 2016 increasing the ratio of carbonaceous materials to tio2 increases the amount of adsorbed ppcp available for reaction however at mass ratios higher than the optimum the carbonaceous material s surface is covered blocking light and leading to decreased photocatalytic activity cheng et al 2016 nawaz et al 2017 ahmadi et al 2016 tested different mass ratios of cnt to tio2 mass ratios of cnts of 1 5 enhanced tetracycline removal up to 73 relative to 0 5 and further increases of cnts up to 10 did not improve the removal efficiency of tetracycline the highest degradation rate at a mass ratio of 1 5 was attributed to the uniformity of anchoring of tio2 to support the photocatalytic reaction nawaz et al 2017 the decrease of tetracycline removal at high cnt mass ratios was likely due to screening of light preventing photocatalysis wang and zhang 2011 high mass ratios of tio2 inhibited cnt tio2 activity due to the aggregation of tio2 on cnts leading to the restriction of cnt tio2 contact negating the synergetic effects song et al 2012 the ratio of rgo to tio2 was seen to affect the wettability of the composite the water contact angle of the rgo tio2 composite with a tio2 mass ratio of 96 7 was 0 super hydrophilic while with a mass ratio of tio2 of 14 5 the water contact angle was 157 super hydrophobic liu et al 2015 these results show that the surface wettability of carbonaceous tio2 can be controlled by tuning the amount of tio2 therefore an optimum ratio of carbonaceous material to tio2 must be used when designing a carbonaceous tio2 composite to achieve maximum photodegradation of ppcp 7 conclusions and recommendations the occurrence of ppcp in surface waters is mainly due to incomplete removal of ppcp by sewage wastewater treatment plants and industrial wastewater treatment plants numerous techniques for removing ppcp have been tested including activated sludge wetlands adsorption membrane and advanced oxidation processes aops as one of the aop techniques photocatalysis based on tio2 has shown several advantages compared to the other techniques photocatalysis has the ability to degrade ppcp and further the photocatalyst can be recovered and recycled researchers have tried to optimize performance by combining photocatalysts with carbonaceous materials as a supporting material carbonaceous materials give further advantages compared to bare tio2 including high photocatalytic activity activity under solar irradiation and easy separation in the application of photocatalytic carbonaceous tio2 several interdependent parameters of water chemistry and the process are critical because of the many parameters additional studies are required to find the optimum conditions for improved photodegradation of ppcp the review above leads us to several recommendations many methods have been developed for preparing carbonaceous tio2 composites however many of them require a lot of various chemicals and are expensive complicated and time consuming therefore the development of relatively cheap easy scalable and environmentally friendly method is a very high priority in most cases researchers have used tio2 for the photocatalytic degradation of ppcp very few reports are available regarding the use of carbonaceous tio2 for removing ppcp moreover most of the investigations have used high concentrations of ppcp mg l 1 scale since carbonaceous tio2 can enhance the performance of photocatalytic systems relative to tio2 itself the performance of other ppcp photodegradation composites under more realistic concentrations up to μg l 1 is a high priority for future work the characteristics of carbonaceous tio2 e g hydrodynamic particle size surface wettability surface charge and chemistry pore size distribution specific surface area band gap ratio of carbonaceous material to tio2 and tio2 crystallite structure and background water chemistries e g ph temperature do nom and inorganic species can influence photocatalytic activity research needs to be done to understand the fundamental mechanism of photocatalytic destruction of ppcp by carbonaceous tio2 composite under different environmentally relevant conditions practical applications of carbonaceous tio2 composites are still limited because available studies have been conducted using artificial conditions and in batch experimental systems i e lab scale these are inadequate for evaluating the photocatalytic activity of carbonaceous tio2 in real treatment systems therefore field scale experiments must be performed to evaluate the reliability of photocatalytic carbonaceous tio2 systems the present review examined the current state of knowledge as well as the limitations in the application of carbonaceous tio2 for removing ppcp we hope this review will help to advance the field leading to further development of carbonaceous tio2 applications in water treatment acknowledgements dion awfa is grateful for a scholarship from indonesia endowment fund for education lpdp

19455,the high concentrations of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcp that found in water in many locations are of concern among the available water treatment methods heterogeneous photocatalysis using tio2 is an emerging and viable technology to overcome the occurrence of ppcp in natural and waste water the combination of carbonaceous materials e g activated carbon carbon nanotubes and graphene nanosheets with tio2 a recent development gives significantly improved performance in this article we present a critical review of the development and fabrication of carbonaceous tio2 and its application to ppcp removal including its influence on water chemistry and the relevant operational parameters finally we present an analysis of current priorities in the

purposes jiang et al 2013 omar et al 2016 yang et al 2017a ppcp can be further classified as antibiotics anticonvulsants contrast agents hormones nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids β blockers lipid regulators painkillers preservatives disinfectants insect repellants fungicides soaps and detergents fragrances and sunscreen uv filters yang et al 2017a ppcp are transported to the aqueous environment through domestic wastewater industrial wastewater runoff and landfill leachate cardoso et al 2014 chen et al 2016 kapelewska et al 2016 lu et al 2015 fig 1 of these treatment plants for sewage and industrial wastewater were found to be the largest sources of ppcp jiang et al 2013 lester et al 2013 previous studies found that concentrations of diclofenac as low as 5 μg l 1 can accumulate inside the bodies of rainbow trout schwaiger et al 2004 and a mixture of acetaminophen carbamazepine gemfibrozil and venlafaxine at concentration 0 5 and 10 μg l 1 can cause significant effects to zebrafish including tissue degeneration a decline in embryo production and increased in embryo mortalities galus et al 2013 it is therefore extremely troublesome that ppcp can be found in surface and ground waters at concentrations ranging up to 10 000 μg l 1 and 100 μg l 1 for pharmaceuticals and personal care products respectively yang et al 2017a numerous techniques for removing ppcp from water have been reported including activated sludge jewell et al 2016 fungi li et al 2016 microalgae bai and acharya 2016 matamoros et al 2016 wetlands rühmland et al 2015 zhang et al 2013a 2013b 2016 adsorption ali et al 2016 baghdadi et al 2016 lerman et al 2013 mailler et al 2016 nielsen and bandosz 2016 wei et al 2013 and membranes jin et al 2012 sheng et al 2016 wang et al 2016 conventional wastewater treatment plants use biological processes e g activated sludge and wetlands with removal efficiencies for ppcp in the range of 50 90 ibáñez et al 2013 zhang et al 2013b while ppcp removal becomes relatively high in some cases many of the ppcp are antimicrobial agents and designed to be persistent mcclellan and halden 2010 thus ppcp can be and are detected in the effluent of conventional wastewater treatment plants in many countries around the world yang et al 2017b there is therefore a need for improved physical treatment methods e g adsorption based systems and membranes for ppcp removal adsorption and membrane filtration have shown high removal efficiencies over 90 ali et al 2016 baghdadi et al 2016 jin et al 2012 sheng et al 2016 however adsorption based systems and membranes only trap ppcp they do not destroy them moreover the spent adsorbents and rejected water from the membrane processes are classified as secondary contaminants ateia et al 2018 xu et al 2017 several reviews have examined photocatalyst performance and the limitations and advanced modification of tio2 chong et al 2010 dong et al 2015 leary and westwood 2011 melchionna et al 2016 woan et al 2009 daghrir et al 2013 reviewed some modified forms of tio2 including anion and cation doping and coupling with narrow band gap semiconductors mxoy tio2 or mssy tio2 in addition khalid et al 2017 reviewed the modification of tio2 with carbonaceous nanomaterials as an alternative and innovative approach for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity all of these reviews suggest that intentionally modified tio2 have better photocatalytic activity than pristine tio2 one modified form in particular carbonaceous tio2 has attracted a lot of attention for environmental applications however in the case of ppcp photodegradation most reviews have focused on the use of tio2 tong et al 2012 reviewed the parameters governing tio2 photocatalysis for the removal of pharmaceuticals and the ecotoxicity of photoproducts in the recent years mahmoud et al 2017 also reviewed tio2 photocatalysis for removing pharmaceuticals and the possible formation of photodegradation by products kanakaraju et al 2014 presented an overview of tio2 photocatalysis for treatment of pharmaceuticals in wastewater lee et al 2017 reviewed the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment and the application of tio2 photocatalysis sarkar et al 2014 presented an in depth review of the application and process parameters that affect tio2 photocatalysis for the removal of pharmaceuticals in fig 2 we illustrate the compilation of all studies in the literature and the current trends for ppcp photocatalysis by carbonaceous tio2 ppcp even with the same molecular weight and under the same light conditions showed variations of half life which can be caused by the differences in the chemical backbone romão et al 2017 as well as in operating conditions to the best of our knowledge there is currently no review considering the use of carbonacoues tio2 composites for removing ppcp from contaminated water thus a comprehensive understanding of the use of carbonaceous tio2 for the remediation of ppcp would help optimize the development and implementation of this composite in this paper we present a critical review of recent developments and applications of carbonaceous tio2 composite photocatalysts for removing ppcp from water and the key water chemistry and operational parameters 2 pharmaceuticals and personal care products pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcp are a class of compounds that mainly consists of polar molecules with molecular weights ranging from 150 to 1000 daltons da and a wide variety of physicochemical properties barceló and petrovic 2007 kim and tanaka 2009 rahman et al 2009 suárez et al 2008 in the last decade the global annual consumption of ppcp has increased and top countries consumers include brazil russia india china and south africa tijani et al 2016 to date more than 3000 ppcp have been produced and the constant development of new chemical compounds has led to an increasing abundance and variety of ppcp in the environment chen et al 2016 of et al 2009 previous investigations showed that sewage treatment plants are the main source of ppcp into aquatic environments brunsch et al 2018 accordingly ppcp can be found in lakes bonvin et al 2011 ferguson et al 2013 subedi et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 zhu et al 2013 rivers carmona et al 2014 dai et al 2015 hanamoto et al 2018 hughes et al 2013 ground water del

2015 pereira et al 2016 and in drinking water aristizabal ciro et al 2017 batt et al 2017 benotti et al 2009 t lin et al 2016a currently the main methods for removing ppcp in conventional wastewater treatment plants are biotransformation biodegradation and or adsorption on conventional adsorbents e g activated carbon alvarino et al 2018 however conventional wastewater treatment plants are inefficient at removing ppcp due to their low biodegradability coelho et al 2009 lagesson et al 2016 mirzaei et al 2016 the continuous input of ppcp into the environment is a serious concern for instance wastewater containing a mix of pharmaceuticals caused significant reproductive and other health impacts for fish al salhi et al 2012 moreover ppcp e g acetaminophen caffeine 1 7 dimethylxanthine dehydronifedine tetracycline oxytetracycline sulfonamides macrolides and ormetoprim have been detected in fruits vegetables fish meat and milk due to uptake from an environment contaminated by ppcp baron et al 2014 done and halden 2015 pan et al 2014 alternative solutions such as advanced treatment processes should be implemented to diminish the release of ppcp into environment heterogeneous photocatalysis is considered as a sustainable technique 3 heterogeneous photocatalysis heterogeneous photocatalysis is an oxidation process occurring on semiconductor solid catalysts illuminated at suitable wavelengths ahmad et al 2016 sudha and sivakumar 2015 venkata laxma reddy et al 2011 among frequently used semiconductor materials tio2 shows the greatest potential among developing green chemistry technologies there are three different polymorphs of tio2 crystals namely anatase rutile and brookite friedmann et al 2010 when zhang et al 2014a compared the photocatalytic activity of the three polymorphs anatase tio2 was found to exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity the longest lifetime of the photoexcited electron and the fastest migration of photogenerated electrons therefore anatase is the preferred polymorph of tio2 in photocatalysis basically light with a certain energy λ 380 nm an energy that is greater than the band gap i e the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band in semiconductors of tio2 3 2 ev excites the electron from the valence band to the conduction band and creates an electron hole pair e and h electrons and holes on the surface of a semiconductor participate in redox reactions that produce reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide anion radicals o2 the key reactions in the photocatalytic oxidation and reduction mechanism are summarized in fig 3 1 photoexcitation tio2 hv e h 2 charge carrier trapping of e e cb e tr 3 charge carrier trapping of h h vb h

direct photoholes contaminants h intermediate s final degradation products 9 protonation of superoxide o2 h ho2 10 co scavenging of e ho2 e ho2 11 formation of h2o2 ho2 h h2o2 the surface trapped valence band electron e tr and conduction band hole h tr are formed by the processes shown in eqs 2 and eq 3 respectively these trapped carriers on the tio2 surface do not recombine immediately after photoexcitation chong et al 2010 in parallel in the absence of an electron scavenger the photoexcited electron recombines with the valence band hole in nanoseconds eq 4 schneider et al 2014 therefore the presence of electron scavengers is very important in photocatalysis to retard recombination the presence of oxygen prevents the recombination of the electron hole pair electron scavenger and allows the formation of superoxide o2 eq 5 superoxide radicals can be protonated to form hydroperoxyl radicals ho2 that can react further to form h2o2 eqs 9 11 it should be noted that all of these reactions to produce reactive oh occurred due to the presence of both dissolved oxygen and water the overall process of heterogeneous photocatalysis can be decomposed into five steps herrmann 1999 first ppcp move from the fluid phase to the interface region of the catalyst by diffusion second ppcp are adsorbed onto the surface of the photocatalyst third a chemical reaction occurs with oxidizing and or reducing species in the vicinity of the surface fourth by products desorb finally products are removed from the interface region into the bulk fluid previous studies showed that the photocatalytic degradation of ppcp using tio2 could reach up to 99 within one to three hours czech and buda 2016 lin et al 2016a murgolo et al 2015 however the use of bare tio2 has critical limitations such as lower activity under solar irradiation than uv light λ 400 nm low adsorption capability and the difficulty of recovering it from the treated water dong et al 2015 various techniques e g cation doped anion doped coupled semiconductor have been tested in the development of tio2 based systems daghrir et al 2013 despite significant efforts carbonaceous materials offer unique advantages e g chemical inertness stability electrical properties and tunable structure that have not been adequately tested combining tio2 with carbonaceous materials has attracted a lot of attention as a strategy for enhancing the performance of tio2 photocatalysts as described in the following section 4 carbonaceous tio2 photocatalysis activated carbon ac carbon nanotubes cnts and graphene are the main carbonaceous materials that have been tested for use in water and wastewater treatment santhosh et al 2016 these materials have large specific surface areas and high charge carrier mobility leary and westwood 2011 table 1 shows a summary of 29 studies on ppcp removal using three different carbonaceous tio2 composites published over the past seven years overall the composites of carbonaceous materials with tio2 have higher photocatalytic activity adsorption capacity electron scavenging and sensitization ability and extended visible light absorption relative to bare tio2 khalid et al 2017 table 1 summarizes studies of the ability of photocatalytic carbonaceous tio2 to degrade personal care products such studies are very limited compared for example to pharmaceuticals further studies of using photocatalytic carbonaceous tio2 for ppcp photodegradation in complex water matrices are limited overall cnt tio2 and graphene tio2 showed better response to visible light irradiation than ac tio2 due to better heterojunction interaction however synthesis methods affected the characteristics of carbonaceous tio2 as well as their photocatalytic activity table 2 presents a comparison among the common synthesis methods of carbonaceous tio2 composites the degradation of ppcp is enhanced when using composites of carbonaceous materials with tio2 because of four main mechanisms first the affinity and the mobility of ppcp on carbonaceous materials and the high specific surface areas of carbonaceous materials help to harvest the ppcp and concentrate them close to the tio2 active site for enhanced photodegradation kuvarega and mamba 2016 li puma et al 2008 carbonaceous material is well known as an effective adsorbent due to hydrophobic interaction π π interactions hydrogen bonding interactions and electrostatic and dispersion interactions ateia et al 2017a second carbonaceous materials acts as electron scavengers due to their large electron storage capacity this property which hinders electron recombination is known as the hoffmann mechanism woan et al 2009 simply when a photon with sufficient energy excites an electron from the valence band to the conduction band of tio2 a hole is created in the valence band h instead of returning to the valence band in carbonaceous materials the excited electrons are transferred into the graphitic π electron band retarding recombination because of entropy the electron becomes lost the holes that remain h on the tio2 are available to take part in redox reactions third carbonaceous materials act as sensitizers that provide electrons to tio2 these electrons can be excited by photons of the light energy thereby resulting in the generation of superoxide radicals from adsorbed molecular oxygen in addition the positively charged carbonaceous materials attract electrons from tio2 and create a hole h in the tio2 valence band which reacts with adsorbed water to create hydroxyl radicals fourth the presence of carbon oxygen titanium linkages in the composite system reduces the band gap and extends the absorption band into the lower energy visible range wang et al 2005 the carbonaceous tio2 photocatalysis mechanisms are summarized in fig 4 4 1 activated carbon tio2 composites activated carbon ac is a porous and amorphous solid carbon material which can be derived from coal or plants and is the most common carbonaceous material used for water or wastewater treatment ac is typically prepared in two stages carbonization i e heating at temperature between 400 and 600 c to drive off volatile components and activation i e increase surface area using an activating agent such as steam or co2 li puma et al 2008 ac has a rigid porosity on the macro 50 nm meso 2 50 nm and micro 2 nm scale pore range with a specific surface area ranging up to 1250 m2 g 1 leary and westwood 2011 mailler et al 2016 park et al 2015 patiño et al 2015 further ac has wide range of functional groups on its surface including carboxyl carbonyl phenol lactone and quinone groups that enhance the affinity of ac for ppcp bhatnagar et al 2013 for these reasons researchers have used ac as a supporting material in photocatalysis applications using methods such as sol gel rey et al 2012 chemical vapor deposition li puma et al 2008 impregnation gar alalm et al 2016 pyrolysis lara lópez et al 2017 precipitation otieno et al 2017 hydrothermal preparation liu et al 2007 microwave assisted synthesis orha et al 2017 sonochemical treatment tan et al 2013 dip coating omri and benzina 2015 and molecular self assembly sun et al 2016 ac tio2 composites have been extensively studied for ppcp degradation basha et al 2011 2010 el sheikh et al 2017 gar alalm et al 2016 keane et al 2011 khraisheh et al 2013 ma et al 2017 quiñones et al 2014 rey et al 2012 rosa et al 2017 they are effective due to their uniform pore structure that enhances photocatalytic activity and their high ability to adsorb and concentrate contaminants ma et al 2017 for instance khraisheh et al 2013 prepared activated charcoal from coconut shell material an inexpensive source of carbon known to also have superior quality and prepared a tio2 composite material ac tio2 had a highest removal efficiency and the composite removed carbamazepine up to 98 uvc intensity of 10 5 mw cm 2 for 40 min in addition response surface methodology rsm and a central composite design model ccd were used to evaluate the optimum parameters e g calcination temperature and ac loading amount for preparing ac tio2 composite this group of researchers demonstrated that surface area pore size distribution tio2 crystal structure and composite size have significant influences on the adsorption and photocatalytic activities of ac tio2 composites the complete removal of pharmaceuticals e g amoxicillin ampicillin paracetamol and diclofenac can be achieved using ac tio2 composites after 180 min of sunlight irradiation while using only tio2 could not match this performance gar alalm et al 2016 the enhanced performance is due to the transfer of sorbates on ac to photoactive tio2 through the common interface between them leary and westwood 2011 moreover in this study the total costs of ac tio2 was estimated to be around 2 3 3 19 per m3 of treated water which is similar to the total cost for tio2 therefore using ac tio2 rather than tio2 is recommended another study of ac tio2 composites showed higher adsorption and photodegradation of amoxicillin a β lactam antibiotic than for pure ac or tio2 basha et al 2011 this may occur due to chemisorption between amoxicillin and functional groups on the ac tio2 surface involving valence bond sharing or electron exchange basha et al 2010 moreover this ac tio2 maintained its photocatalytic activity over four consecutive cycles of treatment and cleaning this work shows that tio2 loadings and substrate adsorption are important factors affecting photocatalysis by ac tio2 composites meanwhile quiñones et al 2014 reported enhanced photocatalytic activity and reusability of magnetic ac tio2 fe by adding ozone i e photocatalytic ozonation photocatalytic ozonation of magnetic ac tio2 fe showed a high degree of mineralization of metoprolol 80 at 5 h reaction times moreover this material can be easily separated and the photocatalytic ozonation of this material exhibited no significant loss retaining the overall toc removal at 75 85 over 10 consecutive cycles the higher removal in this system could be attributed to the synergies of direct ozonation ozone photolytic decomposition heterogeneous photocatalysis fenton reaction and the photo fenton reaction the surface chemistry of ac plays an important role in the production of oxidants such as super oxide and hydroxyl radicals velo gala et al 2017 ac itself can act as a photocatalyst by promoting electrons from the valence band into the conduction band and increasing the generation of oh in the solution under uv or solar irradiation velo gala et al 2013 studies of the correlation between the surface chemistry of ac and the concentration of oxidants shows that 1 while an increase in lactone and anhydride surface groups leads to more oh under uv irradiation generation of oh decreased with increasing surface oxygen content e g carboxyl groups 2 an increase in physisorbed water enhanced production of superoxide o2 during uv irradiation 3 under solar irradiation oh concentrations increase with an increase in carboxyl surface groups but the concentration of o2 decreases as carboxyl and quinone surface groups increases 4 in both uv and solar irradiation aromatic ring and surface oxygen groups on ac contributed to the stabilization of photogenerated electrons and 5 ac with the lowest energy band gap favors enhanced oh production while the larger energy band gap of ac preferentially enhances production of o2 the extension of absorption bands to longer visible wavelengths is one of the proposed synergistic processes in ac tio2 composites however at present the photocatalytic activity of ac tio2 composites is limited due to insufficient interactions between ac and tio2 leary and westwood 2011 diffuse reflectance spectra of ac tio2 show absorption at wavelength shorter than uv vis 400 nm approximately 380 nm which is not so different with the bare tio2 385 nm omri et al 2014 wang et al 2013 thus there is minimal shifting towards the visible light region in the ac tio2 composite system tio2 loaded onto an ac fiber belt felt acf has a lower band gap 2 95 ev compared to pure tio2 3 22 ev due to perterbation of the tio2 absorption by its interaction with acf li et al 2017a this may be because of surface morphology the interactions that shift and scale absorption bands are intense but only over molecular distances kumar et al 2017 another study showed that f n codoped tio2 on magnetic ac exhibits an enhanced absorption at visible wavelengths with a significant red shift in the transition measured using uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra ma et al 2017 codoping with f and n gave a better match for excitation with sunlight the band gap of the magnetic ac f n tio2 composite was estimated to be 2 6 3 0 ev in addition the small particle size of this composite yields a greater surface defect density further increasing absorption at low band gap energies martins et al 2017 there are several studies however that show decreased photocatalytic activity for ac tio2 composites compared to pure tio2 rey et al 2012 rosa et al 2017 the photocatalytic activity of titania coated magnetically activated carbon tifec was not as high as pure tio2 degussa 25 for photodegradation of metoprolol very likely due to non uniform size and tio2 concentration in the composite particles rey et al 2012 however this tifec composite showed continued good reactivity through five series of photocatalytic experiments and it is easy to separate using an external magnetic field the superiority of pristine tio2 compared to the ac tio2 composite may be due to the higher availability of active sites and the physicochemical properties of ac cordero et al 2007 rosa et al 2017 in addition the incorrect use of the simplified langmuir hinshelwood equation for analyzing the photocatalytic kinetics of ac tio2 can lead to erroneous conclusions asenjo et al 2013 therefore the development of new synthesis methods for ac tio2 composites that are active under uv and solar irradiation is still needed in parallel an appropriate photocatalysis kinetics model for ac tio2 composites needs to be developed to provide a fundamental physical mechanism describing photodegradation rates as an evaluation of synergetic interaction 4 2 carbon nanotube tio2 composites recent decades have seen greatly increased interest in photocatalysis using carbon nanotubes tio2 cnts are composed of cylindrical graphene sheets and can be categorized as single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts and multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts iijima 1991 cnts have an usually high specific surface area to mass ratio e g 75 1020 m2 g 1 with exceptional sorption capability czech and buda 2016 jung et al 2015 lerman et al 2013 patiño et al 2015 peigney et al 2001 wang et al 2015 wei et al 2013 in contrast to ac cnts are prone to aggregation because of hydrophobic interactions van der waals forces and π π stacking these processes lead to the formation of four different types of adsorption sites inner cavities interstitial channels external grooves and outermost surfaces agnihotri et al 2006 apul and karanfil 2015 in addition cnts show superior hydrophobicity making them as a promising material chen et al 2007 jung et al 2015 yang and xing 2010 the sorption behavior of cnts mainly depends on their surface chemistries and the nature of contaminants due to the rehybridized sp2 c c bonds and one dimensional microstructure cnts exhibit unique mechanical thermal and semiconductor properties cao et al 2013 further cnts have many advantages such as large electron storage capacity superior metallic conductivity and light absorption at a broad range of wavelengths woan et al 2009 in general cnts are an attractive option for a supporting material to enhance photocatalytic activity due to their outstanding characteristics many efforts have been made to exploit cnts as a supporting material with preparation methods including hydrothermal yuan et al 2016 hydrolysis an et al 2007 restrained hydrolysis chen et al 2011 simple evaporation and drying yao et al 2008 sol gel abbas et al 2016 surfactant wrapping sol gel gao et al 2009 chemical vapor deposition cvd ma et al 2012 physical vapor deposition pvd fan et al 2006 electrophoretic deposition epd bordbar et al 2015 electrostatic attraction daneshvar tarigh et al 2015 solvothermal zhou et al 2010 and impregnation xu et al 2010 common to these methods is that tio2 is attached to the cnts by physical and chemical bonding tio2 binds more strongly to functionalized cnts i e chemisorption compared to physisorption on pristine cnts ayissi et al 2015 in addition chemical bonding provides better electron transfer than physical bonding due to proximity and chemical coupling the use of cnt tio2 nanocomposites for the photodegradation of ppcp has been of considerable scientific interest in one study functionalized cnts and larger tio2 crystal sizes were necessary to provide good contact between the cnts and tio2 this interaction lead to a better enhancement of photocatalytic activity for caffeine photodegradation marques et al 2013 in another study acid treated cnt tio2 sio2 showed better photodegradation of diclofenac relative to untreated cnt tio2 sio2 due to optimal structure and well shaped anatase tio2 crystals czech and buda 2016 the role of sio2 in the cnt tio2 sio2 nanocomposite was to prevent transformation from the active anatase phase to the inactive rutile phase of tio2 and also as an effective agent for dispersing tio2 on the surface of cnts kibombo et al 2012 further photodegradation decreased the toxicity of treated waters as shown by microtox toxicity tests in another study the photocatalytic activity of cnt tio2 towards diclofenac was increased with the addition of dissolved oxygen and h2o2 as an electron scavenger martínez et al 2011a use of solar radiation for photocatalysis is promising for future photocatalytic systems yuan et al 2016 showed that cnt tio2 n exhibited high photocatalytic activity in degrading ibuprofen under visible light irradiation the function of n doping in the composite system was to reduce the band gap in addition the occurrence of cnts resulted in a higher adsorption capacity and increased activity because the cnts could act as electron scavengers this successful synergetic effect was mainly attributed to the good binding interaction between cnts tio2 and urea meanwhile the use of an authentic wastewater matrix affected the photodegradation removal of ppcp relative to ultrapure water murgolo et al 2015 these results clearly show that an idealized experiment i e experiment in ultrapure water has limited value for understanding real world treatment operations recently increased attention has been given to the need to recover and separate nanosized photocatalysts to reduce their negative impacts on the environment an effective method for preventing these potential impacts is immobilization of the photocatalyst on a supporting material two possible approaches are 1 embedding or immobilizing the photocatalyst in a matrix or layer e g electrospinning nanofibers woan et al 2009 and 2 attaching magnetic particles to the photocatalyst composite daneshvar tarigh et al 2015 singh and sarma 2016 zhang et al 2015 a thin film of cnt tio2 showed higher photocatalytic activity for the photodegradation of 4 chlorophenol compared to the tio2 thin film because the cnts acted as an electron sink and reduced the recombination rate zouzelka et al 2016 an immobilized photocatalyst system may be preferable for several reasons such as 1 thin films can be easily adopted for use in continuous flow systems 2 it can prevent photocatalyst agglomeration and 3 it does not require separation or filtration dong et al 2014 although photocatalyst immobilization provides an alternative solution to the separation problem the photochemical reactivity of supported cnt tio2 composites is typically reduced due to the decreased mass transfer rate hindrance of light harvesting by the inert support and reduction of photocatalyst active surface area to volume ratio mascolo et al 2007 adding magnetic particles to nanocomposites is an alternative technique for separation and recovery however it should be noted that attaching magnetic particles to cnt surfaces would decrease the sites available for attaching tio2 fei et al 2016 li et al 2015 in order to overcome this issue ateia et al 2017b explored the potential advantage of using the inherent magnetic impurities of magnetic carbon nanotubes mcnt which are due to magnetic particles trapped inside the graphene cylinders as a green and facile method of removing organic micropollutants from water cnt tio2 and ac tio2 composites show higher photocatalytic activity relative to pure tio2 enhancement of photocatalytic activity was correlated with surface area and the interaction between carbonaceous materials and tio2 for ac tio2 better photocatalytic activity was correlated with the surface area of photocatalytically active sites in contrast cnts also showed better interaction with tio2 uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra results resulting in a smaller band gap i e increased response to sunlight moreover the inherent magnetic properties of cnts showed good potential for use in photocatalytic applications as they would make the composites magnetic while preserving cnts surfaces for tio2 particles 4 3 graphene tio2 composites graphene is a two dimensional sheet of carbon atoms connected by sp2 bonds and with an aromatic π electron system novoselov et al 2004 graphene has a higher density of potential adsorption sites compared to cnts due to the open plane structure with three main types of adsorption sites 1 open up surface 2 longitudinally parallel external surface 3 and interstitial channels ersan et al 2017 graphene has many unique properties including a high electron mobility high mechanical strength high thermal conductivity and high specific surface area hu et al 2013 many efforts have been made to use graphene in diverse applications including sensors wang and arash 2014 energy conversion and storage bonaccorso et al 2015 polymer composites mittal et al 2015 drug delivery systems zhang et al 2017b and environmental applications chabot et al 2014 upadhyay et al 2014 in the environmental applications graphene nanomaterials can be used as catalysts and adsorbents or disinfectant agents graphene is the precursor of the graphene family nanomaterials e g graphene oxide reduced graphene oxide fullerene carbon nano onion and cnts suárez iglesias et al 2017 of these graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo show high efficiency for water treatment due to the presence of several surface functional groups e g hydroxyl carboxyl and epoxy that act as adsorption sites fei et al 2016 shen et al 2015 moreover go itself is photocatalytically active yeh et al 2011 go can be made by chemical functionalization of graphene in several ways such as 1 the brodie method b c brodie 1859 2 the staudenmaier method poh et al 2012 3 the hoffman method poh et al 2012 and 4 the hummers method hummers and offeman 1958 however go is electrically insulating due to the chemical disruption of the π network and the reduction of go i e conversion to reduced graphene oxide has become an important reaction for restoring the electrical conductivity of the material gao 2015 moreover reduction of go can be achieved using chemical treatment stankovich et al 2007 thermal mediation lin et al 2010 and electrochemical treatment shao et al 2010 reduced graphene oxide is characterized by graphene domains with residual oxygen functionalities on their surface and improved electrical conductivity relative to go compton and nguyen 2010 numerous studies using go or rgo as a co material with tio2 for photocatalysis have been performed graphene tio2 is a robust composite and can be synthesized by several methods such as solution mixing morales torres et al 2013 sol gel azizi 2017 hydrothermal wu et al 2015 electrostatic self assembly kim et al 2012 molecular grafting tang et al 2010 chemical exfoliation akhavan and ghaderi 2009 liquid phase deposition pastrana martinez et al 2012 and electrospinning peining et al 2012 each synthesis method can affect the graphene tio2 characteristics and photocatalytic activity faraldos and bahamonde 2017 a stronger interaction between graphene and tio2 would give enhance photocatalytic activity kamat 2010 tio2 nanosheet graphene 2d 2d composite showed higher removal of 2 4 dichlorophenol than bare tio2 due to strong electronic and physical coupling in the material sun et al 2013 this interaction lead to enhancement of electron transfer and thereby superior photocatalytic activity further minella et al 2017 demonstrated synergy using a graphene tio2 composite they observed electron transfer from reduced graphene oxide to tio2 and hole transfer from tio2 to reduced graphene oxide the formation of ti o c linkages between hydroxyl surface groups on tio2 and the oxygenated surface of go leads to narrower band gaps for the go tio2 composite e g 2 5 2 9 ev the surface chemistry also changed significantly because of the go content with a higher go content giving a reduced point of zero charge pzc and more acidic composites due to the abundance of oxygenated groups morales torres et al 2013 many researchers have tried to use visible light to drive graphene tio2 photocatalysts under visible irradiation rgo tio2 composites showed significant photodegradation of diphenhydramine relative to tio2 because rgo acted as a sensitizer pastrana martinez et al 2012 and electron sink gillespie and martsinovich 2017 similar synergism in graphene tio2 has also been seen in other carbonaceous tio2 composites e g cnt tio2 fullerene tio2 and ac tio2 yang et al 2013 zhang et al 2010 although go tio2 has similar enhancement mechanisms there are significant differences in the mass ratios of carbon to tio2 yang et al 2013 a lower mass ratio of go is necessary to achieve optimum photocatalytic activity compared to cnt tio2 the pore structure and aggregation behavior of go vary among cnts gos are composed of two dimensional graphene sheets and are more prone to restacking compared to cnts ersan et al 2017 thus higher go mass ratios i e above optimum lead to the aggregation of go tio2 composites lowering photocatalytic activity the enhanced photocatalytic activity of graphene tio2 composites make them an ideal material for remediating ppcp however one of the major obstacles to using nano scale catalysts in water treatment is the difficulty in separating and recovering the catalysts recently 3d porous rgo tio2 aerogel was shown to remove carbamazepine by more than 99 nawaz et al 2017 the macroporous 3d structure of the aerogel resulted in abundant surface sites effective charge separation improved mass transport of contaminants and easy separation immobilization of rgo tio2 on optical fibers for degradation of three different ppcp carbamazepine ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole resulted in excellent degradation ppcp removal up to 80 and high durability 45 h operation lin et al 2016b another method for solving the catalyst recovery issue is by using magnetic separation in this method magnetic nanoparticles are added to the surface of the composite a magnetically recyclable go tio2 composite showed up to 99 removal of carbamazepine and caffeine within 60 min under uv irradiation and this composite was fully recoverable and reusable by magnetic separation linley et al 2014 these three methods 3d aerogel immobilization and magnetic separation demonstrate a variety of solutions supporting the application of graphene tio2 composite overall table 3 summarizes the advantages and shortcomings of ac tio2 cnt tio2 and graphene tio2 it should be emphasized that carbonaceous tio2 composites are still in development stage and most studies have been performed at lab scale a variety of synthesis methods and operating conditions within the studies make it hard to compare directly to determine the appropriate synthesis method faraldos and bahamonde 2017 therefore the establishment of a standard method for evaluating the photocatalytic activity of carbonaceous tio2 followed by a pilot scale study are needed to assess the cost and support real world applications of carbonaceous tio2 5 the role of water chemistry in photocatalytic performance water chemistry e g ph temperature contaminant concentration dissolved oxygen natural organic matters and inorganic species has a significant effect on the photocatalysis of ppcp this section discusses the significance of these parameters for the performance of carbonaceous composites of tio2 5 1 effect of ph acidity affects the surface charge of the catalyst which makes it one of the most significant operating parameters in heterogeneous photocatalysis chong et al 2010 the net surface charge of the catalyst can be positive or negative due to the amphoteric behavior of the metal oxide catalyst e g tio2 mirzaei et al 2016 the ph of the point of zero charge phpzc helps define the effect of ph on the surface charge of the catalyst phpzc is the ph at which the surface charge of the catalyst is zero and it depends on the surface chemistry several studies found the phpzc of tio2 ac tio2 cnt tio2 and graphene tio2 materials to lie in the range of 6 8 7 9 4 6 and 4 5 respectively ahmadi et al 2016 andronic et al 2014 barroso bogeat et al 2016 hua et al 2016 malekshoar et al 2014 schindler and gamsjäger 1972 for acidic conditions ph phpzc the surface charge of the catalyst is positive and increases attraction for negatively charged contaminants while for basic conditions ph phpzc the catalyst surface charge is negative attracting positively charged pollutants chong et al 2010 the protonation and deprotonation of tio2 with ph is shown by the following reactions eqs 12 and 13 12 ph phpzc tioh h tioh2 13 ph phpzc tioh oh tio h2o at low ph photogenerated holes h are the dominant oxidizing species while under neutral or alkaline solutions hydroxyl radicals play the dominant role in the contaminant oxidation lee et al 2016 however at high ph photocatalytic reactions may be inhibited because oh anions act as hole h scavengers to form oh yuan et al 2016 followed by rapid scavenging of oh by bicarbonate species to produce radical carbonate anion which is less oxidizing than oh lai et al 2017b photocatalytic oxidation of ibuprofen using cnt tio2 co doping urea showed that the highest removal efficiency was achieved when the ph of the solution was 5 due to the catalyst surface charge yuan et al 2016 in this study the phpzc of the cnt tio2 composite with co doped urea was around 6 in this acidic conditions ibuprofen would deprotonate to become its conjugate base which has a negative charge hashim and khan 2011 at ph 5 the surface charge of the catalyst is positive and ibuprofen would have a negative charge in this example changing ph was able to create electrostatic attraction between the catalyst and the contaminant when the solution ph was greater than 5 repulsion between the catalyst and ibuprofen reduced surface affinity and therefore photocatalytic ability in a different study optimum photodegradation of amoxicillin using ac tio2 was achieved at ph 9 basha et al 2011 chlorotetracycline ctc removal using go tio2 showed an increase in degradation when the ph was increased from 1 to 4 due to the net charge of chlorotetracycline and an attractive π π interaction li et al 2017b therefore appropriate ph control must be considered for carbonaceous tio2 photocatalysis in order to achieve effective ppcp removal 5 2 effect of water temperature photocatalysis can occur at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure which is one of its advantage for water treatment lee et al 2016 the optimum reaction temperature for photocatalysis tio2 is in the range 20 80 c herrmann 1999 temperature effects e and h diffusion recombination rates and adsorption of pollutants to the photocatalyst surface sarkar et al 2014 an increase in temperature 80 c may reduce adsorption chong et al 2010 and promote recombination of charge carriers gaya and abdullah 2008 resulting in lower photocatalytic activity at very low temperatures 0 c the photocatalytic activity of tio2 decreases due to the increase in activation energy needed to excite a photocatalyst herrmann 1999 however we are not aware of any studies of the influence of temperature on the activity of carbonaceous tio2 photocatalysts the effect of temperature and the optimum conditions for effective ppcp removal by carbonaceous tio2 photocatalysis must be investigated 5 3 effect of initial concentration of ppcp the initial concentration of the contaminants is an important parameter in photocatalysis the highest removal efficiency of tetracycline 95 by photocatalytic cnt tio2 was achieved when the concentration of tetracycline was 0 5 mg l 1 however for the same cnt tio2 dosage increasing tetracycline to 30 mg l decreased the removal efficiency of tetracycline from the solution ahmadi et al 2016 in an ac tio2 study longer reaction times were needed to achieve complete removal of metoprolol when the initial concentration was 50 mg l 1 than when it was 10 mg l 1 rey et al 2012 at high ppcp concentrations more ppcp molecules are adsorbed on the surface of the carbonaceous tio2 and these adsorbed contaminants inhibit photocatalysis by absorbing light before it can reach the catalyst surface mirzaei et al 2016 in addition the competitive consumption of hydroxyl radicals by photogenerated products lee et al 2016 and light scattering ahmad et al 2016 can also reduce photocatalytic activity in highly concentrated solutions previous studies of photocatalytic remediation of ppcp have been conducted with initial concentrations up to 1000 mg l 1 table 1 however studies of photocatalytic oxidation of ppcp at high concentration on the order of mg l 1 may not be relevant for predicting photocatalytic degradation of ppcp under real conditions where ppcp concentrations are on the order of μg l 1 gulyas et al 2016 it is critical to study photocatalytic oxidation at realistic concentrations of up to μg l 1 to avoid the inhibiting effects of high pollutant load 5 4 effect of dissolved oxygen dissolved oxygen do is one of the important parameters that can affect photocatalysis do acts as an electron acceptor and the reaction of an electron e with do results in the formation of free oh hoffmann et al 1995 oh is unselective and mostly occurs at the photocatalyst h2o interface it may also diffuse into the bulk solution kondrakov et al 2014 the photocatalysis rate tends to increase with higher do because o2 aq has a strong affinity for e forming o2 and reducing the electron hole recombination rate martínez et al 2011a referring to eqs 5 and 6 the contribution of do to the formation of oh is small and h2o is still the main source of oh from the photocatalytic process kondrakov et al 2016 for eq 6 the generation of oh strongly depends on the availability of h instead of the availability of e to react with o2 ads to generate superoxide eq 5 generally the henry s law constant can be used to give an approximation of do in an aqueous system the henry s law constant for o2 solvation in water is as follows 14 c p k h 15 k h k h o exp c 1 t 1 t o where c is the concentration of o2 in the water p is the partial gas pressure of o2 and k h and k ho are the henry s law constant and the henry s law constant at 298 k respectively t and to are temperature and standard state temperature 298 k in kelvin and c is a constant 1700 k for o2 this equilibrium law clearly shows the reason for the decrease in do with increasing reaction temperature i e hot water therefore if the photocatalyst is not a photothermocatalyst it may be preferential to operate the photoreactor at ambient temperature to ensure the supply of do 5 5 effect of natural organic matter natural organic matter nom is a complex mixture of organic substances that include humic substance hydrophilic acids proteins lipids carbohydrates carboxylic acids amino acids and hydrocarbon commonly present in surface waters karanfil et al 1999 ateia et al 2017c shimizu et al 2018 the effect of organic matter on the performance of photocatalysts has been studied by using natural organic matter nom doll and frimmel 2005 drosos et al 2015 li and hu 2016 peng et al 2017 van doorslaer et al 2015 this highly variable reagent impacts the photocatalytic activity of tio2 towards ppcp at high concentrations ratio of nom tio2 is more than 4 mg g 1 nom can inhibit the ability of tio2 to degrade carbamazepine while at low concentrations of nom ratio of nom tio2 500 μg g 1 the degradation rate of carbamazepine was higher than for the pure blank solution without nom drosos et al 2015 this enhanced degradation was caused by the formation of reactive species from nom i e singlet molecular oxygen 1o2 superoxide anion o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 solvated electrons e aq triplet excited states of nom 3nom which can assist in energy transfer doll and frimmel 2003 the low degradation rate for carbamazepine at high concentrations of nom was caused by the ability of nom to absorb and scatter light frimmel 1994 in addition low nom concentrations can enhance photocatalytic removal of pollutants by creating π π interactions on the photocatalyst surface that attract contaminants while at high concentrations of nom nom will prevent ppcp from reaching the surface drosos et al 2015 the inhibitory effect of nom e g humic acid can be counteracted with phosphate because it leads to a more negatively charged surface that is more hydrophilic and change the adsorption bind of humic acid long et al 2016 moreover increasing do was seen to counteract the inhibitory effect of nom because it increased the generation of superoxide ren et al 2018 however the effect of nom on the photocatalysis of ppcp by carbonaceous tio2 is nonetheless limited generally photocatalysis is used as a tertiary treatment on effluent resulting from secondary treatment e g bioremediation borges et al 2014 effluent organic matter efom is a general term for organic matter from biologically treated wastewater abbt braun et al 2004 cai and lin 2016 michael kordatou et al 2015 the composition of efom is different from natural nom efom is a combination of nom soluble microbial products smps proteins surfactants and trace chemicals barker and stuckey 1999 bodhipaksha et al 2017 jarusutthirak and amy 2007 michael kordatou et al 2015 shon et al 2007 efom is relatively hydrophilic and has a high proportion of protein like substances with molecular sizes from 102 to 105 da zhou et al 2017 therefore the differences between efom and nom include differences in their physical and chemical behavior leading to differences in their photodegradation bodhipaksha et al 2017 5 6 effect of inorganic species inorganic species in wastewater can affect the photocatalytic remediation of ppcp inorganic species such as h2o2 s2o8 2 bro3 and so3 have a beneficial effect enhancing photodegradation of contaminants by acting as electron scavengers thereby increasing the production of hydroxyl radicals and generating other oxidizing species lee et al 2016 however excessive concentrations of inorganic species can suppress photodegradation by scavenging hydroxyl radicals the removal efficiency for clofibric acid by tio2 decreased with the presence of many inorganic species nacl fecl3 fecl2 cacl2 al2 so4 3 fe2 so4 3 na2so4 nahco3 and na2co3 due to the competition for free radicals change in the ph of the solution and blockage of catalyst active sites by adsorption of anionic or cationic species rioja et al 2016 uv light attenuation by iron solutions also plays a significant role because it gives a yellowish color to the solution other colored ions can have a similar effect radical scavenging by sulfates and carbonates appeared to be stronger than for chlorides for the case of nacl photodegradation of clofibric acid at low concentrations of nacl 10 000 mg l 1 inhibits photocatalysis while at higher nacl concentrations 10 000 mg l 1 the photodegradation rate was almost the same as for ultrapure water ionic strength has been indicated as an important parameter controlling photocatalytic activity at high ionic strength the repulsive force of contaminants can be mitigated and enhancing adsorption aguedach et al 2008 similarly the presence of bicarbonate and chloride increases the toxicity of ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide during photocatalysis because of photodegradation products not found in the ultrapure water reference reaction showing that inorganic species can promote alternative photodegradation pathways lai et al 2017a finally we are not aware of any studies of how inorganic species affect carbonaceous tio2 photocatalysis the occurrence of inorganic species in water can not be excluded from the investigation of carbonaceous tio2 photocatalysis in real world systems and pretreatment to remove inorganic species are essential for effective photocatalytic treatment 6 effect of system parameters on photocatalytic activity the removal efficiency τ co ct co is expressed in where co is initial ppcp concentration and ct is ppcp concentration at certain time and oxidation rate ln ct co k app t is expressed in min 1 where k app is pseudo first order rate and t is reaction time of photocatalytic processes depend on a number of parameters including excitation wavelength light flux at surface catalyst loading and material composition nature of carbonaceous material grain size crystal structure of tio2 and ratio of tio2 to carbonaceous material to achieve high photocatalytic activity these entangled parameters need to be optimized 6 1 effect of excitation wavelength photon energy must exceed the bandgap to excite a photocatalyst and the process is favored by a material s absorption and scattering coefficients all of these properties are material dependent for pure commercial tio2 band gap eg 3 2 ev light at wavelengths λ 400 nm is required herrmann 1999 the basic equation for converting bandgap to λ is 16 e h c λ 17 e ev 1240 8 λ nm where h is planck s constant 6 626 10 34 joule s c is the speed of light 3 10 8 m s 1 1 ev is equal to 1 602 10 19 joule and 1 ångström is equal to 10 10 m a simple equation relating wavelength to band gap is given by eq 13 the uv spectrum can be divided into the uv a 315 400 nm uv b 280 315 nm and uv c 100 280 nm regions rincón and pulgarin 2005 recently the potential excitation of carbonaceous tio2 with visible light has attracted a lot of attention carbonaceous tio2 composites have a band gap around 2 6 3 ev 413 477 nm ashkarran et al 2013 taleshi 2015 carbonaceous material as a substrate creates a carbon oxygen titanium linkage which can expand the absorption band into visible wavelengths mallakpour and khadem 2016 diclofenac degradation using a cnt tio2 sio2 photocatalyst under uv 365 nm and solar irradiation 550 nm showed good performance with removal efficiencies above 70 for uv and 90 for solar light czech and buda 2016 go nanofiber tio2 composite showed a higher photodegradation rate of 4 chlorophenol under visible light irradiation relative to pristine tio2 zhang et al 2017a in contrast ac itself did not have a sufficiently strong interaction with tio2 to induce a bandgap reduction in the visible light region leary and westwood 2011 therefore more work is needed to improve ac tio2 interaction to reduce the band gap 6 2 effect of the loading of carbonaceous tio2 the kinetic rates of the photocatalysis reactions are generally proportional to the mass of the catalyst inside the reactor but the reaction rates are become independent of catalyst mass above a certain level of loading due to the full absorption of photons by the photocatalytic bed herrmann 1999 various dosages of cnt tio2 0 1 g l 1 0 4 g l 1 were used in the treatment of tetracycline the highest removal efficiency was achieved at dosage of 0 2 g l 1 ahmadi et al 2016 adding cnt tio2 above its optimum loading can cause excessive light scattering chong et al 2010 below the optimum photocatalyst loading radical generation may be insufficient mirzaei et al 2016 a similar phenomenon occurred when using ac tio2 to treat pharmaceuticals e g amoxicillin ampicillin paracetamol and diclofenac loading ac tio2 at other than its optimum concentration will lead to compromised performance due to an insufficient abundance of active sites and increased turbidity gar alalm et al 2016 optimal photocatalyst loading depends on the size and geometry of the reactor fernández ibáñez et al 1999 and the hydrodynamic particle size smaller particle sizes are better due to the higher surface to mass ratio carbajo et al 2018 6 3 effect of the ratio of carbonaceous material to tio2 the mass ratio of carbonaceous materials to tio2 is a critical factor impacting performance the two materials have a synergistic effect on adsorption and photocatalysis carbonaceous material enhances total adsorption due to the enlarged surface with favorable polarizability enhancing physisorption due to the π cloud while tio2 acts as a photocatalyst hu et al 2015 rabieh et al 2016 increasing the ratio of carbonaceous materials to tio2 increases the amount of adsorbed ppcp available for reaction however at mass ratios higher than the optimum the carbonaceous material s surface is covered blocking light and leading to decreased photocatalytic activity cheng et al 2016 nawaz et al 2017 ahmadi et al 2016 tested different mass ratios of cnt to tio2 mass ratios of cnts of 1 5 enhanced tetracycline removal up to 73 relative to 0 5 and further increases of cnts up to 10 did not improve the removal efficiency of tetracycline the highest degradation rate at a mass ratio of 1 5 was attributed to the uniformity of anchoring of tio2 to support the photocatalytic reaction nawaz et al 2017 the decrease of tetracycline removal at high cnt mass ratios was likely due to screening of light preventing photocatalysis wang and zhang 2011 high mass ratios of tio2 inhibited cnt tio2 activity due to the aggregation of tio2 on cnts leading to the restriction of cnt tio2 contact negating the synergetic effects song et al 2012 the ratio of rgo to tio2 was seen to affect the wettability of the composite the water contact angle of the rgo tio2 composite with a tio2 mass ratio of 96 7 was 0 super hydrophilic while with a mass ratio of tio2 of 14 5 the water contact angle was 157 super hydrophobic liu et al 2015 these results show that the surface wettability of carbonaceous tio2 can be controlled by tuning the amount of tio2 therefore an optimum ratio of carbonaceous material to tio2 must be used when designing a carbonaceous tio2 composite to achieve maximum photodegradation of ppcp 7 conclusions and recommendations the occurrence of ppcp in surface waters is mainly due to incomplete removal of ppcp by sewage wastewater treatment plants and industrial wastewater treatment plants numerous techniques for removing ppcp have been tested including activated sludge wetlands adsorption membrane and advanced oxidation processes aops as one of the aop techniques photocatalysis based on tio2 has shown several advantages compared to the other techniques photocatalysis has the ability to degrade ppcp and further the photocatalyst can be recovered and recycled researchers have tried to optimize performance by combining photocatalysts with carbonaceous materials as a supporting material carbonaceous materials give further advantages compared to bare tio2 including high photocatalytic activity activity under solar irradiation and easy separation in the application of photocatalytic carbonaceous tio2 several interdependent parameters of water chemistry and the process are critical because of the many parameters additional studies are required to find the optimum conditions for improved photodegradation of ppcp the review above leads us to several recommendations many methods have been developed for preparing carbonaceous tio2 composites however many of them require a lot of various chemicals and are expensive complicated and time consuming therefore the development of relatively cheap easy scalable and environmentally friendly method is a very high priority in most cases researchers have used tio2 for the photocatalytic degradation of ppcp very few reports are available regarding the use of carbonaceous tio2 for removing ppcp moreover most of the investigations have used high concentrations of ppcp mg l 1 scale since carbonaceous tio2 can enhance the performance of photocatalytic systems relative to tio2 itself the performance of other ppcp photodegradation composites under more realistic concentrations up to μg l 1 is a high priority for future work the characteristics of carbonaceous tio2 e g hydrodynamic particle size surface wettability surface charge and chemistry pore size distribution specific surface area band gap ratio of carbonaceous material to tio2 and tio2 crystallite structure and background water chemistries e g ph temperature do nom and inorganic species can influence photocatalytic activity research needs to be done to understand the fundamental mechanism of photocatalytic destruction of ppcp by carbonaceous tio2 composite under different environmentally relevant conditions practical applications of carbonaceous tio2 composites are still limited because available studies have been conducted using artificial conditions and in batch experimental systems i e lab scale these are inadequate for evaluating the photocatalytic activity of carbonaceous tio2 in real treatment systems therefore field scale experiments must be performed to evaluate the reliability of photocatalytic carbonaceous tio2 systems the present review examined the current state of knowledge as well as the limitations in the application of carbonaceous tio2 for removing ppcp we hope this review will help to advance

19456,widespread microplastic pollution is raising growing concerns as to its detrimental effects upon living organisms a realistic risk assessment must stand on representative data on the abundance size distribution and chemical composition of microplastics raman microscopy is an indispensable tool for the analysis of very small microplastics 20 μm still its use is far from widespread in part due to drawbacks such as long measurement time and proneness to spectral distortion induced by fluorescence this review discusses each drawback followed by a showcase of interesting and easily available solutions that contribute to faster and better identification of microplastics using raman spectroscopy among discussed topics are enhanced signal quality with better detectors and spectrum processing automated particle selection for faster raman mapping comprehensive reference libraries for successful spectral matching a last section introduces non conventional raman techniques non linear raman hyperspectral imaging standoff raman which permit more advanced applications such as real time raman detection and imaging of microplastics graphical abstract image keywords small microplastics automation fluorescent tagging library matching real time analysis stimulated raman scattering 1 introduction the advent of synthetic plastics ushered in a golden era of unprecedented technological advancement and improved levels of material comfort perfectly summed in the classic dupont slogan better living through chemistry yet this euphoric period of unbridled techno optimism inevitably abated in tandem with growing concerns regarding the harmful impacts of plastic waste among them the plight of widespread microplastic pollution in the biosphere according to a recent estimate there are currently more than 5 trillion plastic particles floating at sea totaling circa 270 000 tonnes eriksen et al 2014 as plastic degradation proceeds and each particle fragments into ever smaller pieces the total number of particles gallops upwards in an exponential fashion and so do the risks they pose to animal and human life avio et al 2017 karami et al 2016 ogonowski et al 2018 revel et al 2018 wright and kelly 2017 microplastics mps defined as plastic particles ranging from 1 μm to 5 mm in size are now ubiquitously present in aquatic and terrestrial environments duis and coors 2016 horton et al 2017b often finding their way into our food and drink alexander et al 2016 karami et al 2018 schymanski et al 2018 a realistic assessment of the ill effects of mps must commence with a representative large scale analysis of their abundance size distribution and chemical composition jahnke et al 2017 towards this end chemistry provides a set of identification tools capable of tackling the mp issue in its many facets hanvey et al 2017 shim et al 2017 silva et al 2018 such as vibrational spectroscopy densitometry differential scanning calorimetry dsc gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms based methods and the recently proposed technique hyperspectral imaging shan et al 2018 this review focuses on a particular characterization technique raman spectroscopy which is rapidly gaining ground in the analysis of small mps raman spectroscopy is a vibrational spectroscopy technique based on the inelastic scattering of light that provides information upon the molecular vibrations of a system in the form of a vibrational spectrum the raman spectrum is akin to a fingerprint of chemical structure allowing identification of the components present in the sample some of the advantages of raman spectroscopy are shared by ft ir techniques such as non destructiveness low sample amount requirement possibility for high throughput screening and environmental friendliness these are relevant advantages over other reported methods i e dsc pyr gc ms for mps analysis and characterization elert et al 2017 ribeiro claro et al 2017 indeed vibrational spectroscopy is a common choice for mp identification and has been recommended by the european union expert group on marine litter who advocate that all suspected mps in the 1 100 μm size range should have their polymer identity confirmed by spectroscopic analysis gago et al 2016 compared with ftir spectroscopy raman techniques show better spatial resolution down to 1 μm while that of ftir is 10 20 μm wider spectral coverage higher sensitivity to non polar functional groups lower water interference and narrower spectral bands on the downside raman spectroscopy is prone to fluorescence interference has an inherently low signal to noise ratio and might cause sample heating due to the use of a laser as light source leading to background emission occasionally followed by polymer degradation a more comprehensive explanation of the theoretical principles of raman spectroscopy its strengths and weaknesses for mp analysis as well as instrumentation details can be found elsewhere ivleva et al 2017 ribeiro claro et al 2017 silva et al 2018 smith and dent 2005 despite its many advantages the identification of mps through the use of raman spectroscopy is yet to attain the popularity of ft ir techniques although the number of publications is steeply increasing at this juncture may 2018 a search on isi web of knowledge researchgate and sciencedirect yields a total of 71 original articles on mp identification using raman spectroscopy out of these 86 employ raman microscopy μ raman the classical raman setup was only used in early studies and since then discontinued the surveyed works are listed and grouped into handy categories in table 1 additionally 6 book chapters and 21 reviews cover the topic with varying levels of detail with one book chapter from ribeiro claro et al 2017 completely dedicated to it yet the significant boom in μ raman detection of mps that took place since then warrants an updated digest of current limitations and emerging solutions before delving into that it is useful to demonstrate why raman spectroscopy is essential for the study of very small mps a domain where ftir techniques are wholly inadequate 2 the importance of going small it might be argued that relative to μ ftir the most attractive feature of μ raman is higher resolution which becomes especially relevant for identifying very small mps 20 μm elert et al 2017 ivleva et al 2017 kaeppler et al 2016 otherwise undetectable using infrared techniques as detailed in this section there is an urgent need for a fast and easily implementable monitoring tool capable of detecting small mps plastic particles exposed to environmental stressors undergo continuous fragmentation photo thermal and biodegradation so that the number of particles is expected to increase steeply for smaller sizes andrady 2017 cozar et al 2014 despite this fact the smaller fraction of mps has been consistently neglected in quantification studies conkle et al 2018 reviewed 41 surveys of aquatic mps in which plastic debris were collected using neuston nets circa 80 of these studies used nets with relatively large mesh size 300 μm thus entirely missing the smaller mp fraction and leading to a severe underestimation of the actual mp load in aquatic environments likewise a long term study beer et al 2018 on mp concentration in the baltic sea spanning three decades used a bongo net with mesh size 150 μm and did not find a significant increase in mp abundance between 1987 and 2015 the results might have been different for the mp fraction below 150 μm as highlighted in a study by enders et al 2015 among small mps 400 μm collected in the atlantic ocean and identified using μ raman 64 are under 40 μm in size and their distribution in the range 10 100 μm follows a power law with a scaling exponent of 1 96 as depicted in fig 1 these findings are supported by the conclusions of erni cassola et al erni cassola et al 2017 p who also used μ raman to identify mps 400 μm from the surface water of plymouth bay uk determining that the fraction of mps smaller than 40 μm accounts for roughly 50 of the total population therefore properly measuring the abundance of mps smaller than 40 μm is of paramount importance when estimating the total mp load in the environment moreover mp identification is increasingly becoming a consumer health issue in a recent statement alexander et al 2016 the european food safety authority efsa acknowledged the lack of legislation for microplastics and nanoplastics as contaminants in food and the need to develop reliable identification methods especially for smaller mps which present a higher chance of translocation across the gut barrier indeed μ raman analysis has found mps in edible fish tissues collard et al 2017a karami et al 2017c 2018 table salt gündoğdu 2018 karami et al 2017a and bottled water schymanski et al 2018 the latter study by schymanski and co workers analyzed 38 brands of bottled water plastic carton and glass containers and found mp contamination in all of them with 80 of found particles belonging to the 5 20 μm size range a comparison of ftir and raman techniques for mp identification performed by kaeppler et al 2016 illustrates the superior performance of μ raman for detecting small mps while for particles larger than 20 μm both techniques proved equally capable for smaller particles the detection success rate of μ ftir lagged behind μ raman detected mps as small as 5 μm yet μ ftir missed all particles in the 5 10 μm size range and 40 of mps in the 11 20 μm size range moreover even though μ ftir did succeed in identifying some mps in the 11 20 μm range the quality of the spectra suffered due to low signal to noise ratio a direct consequence of the size of the particle approaching that of the instrument s diffraction limit this issue is illustrated by comparing the ftir and raman spectra of a small 15 20 μm polypropylene pp particle as shown in fig 2 b where a clear raman spectrum left contrasts with a weak and noisy ftir spectrum right the efficiency of an ingenious post filtration system implemented in the wastewater treatment plant of oldenburg germany was evaluated by comparing the amount of mps present in wastewater samples collected upstream and downstream from the filtration point mintenig et al 2017 a removal efficiency of 100 was reported for mps 500 μm and of 93 for those 500 μm given that the filtration system consists of pile fabric with a mesh size of 10 15 μm and that particles smaller than 20 μm could not be detected using ftir imaging a significant portion of very small mps might be passing through unnoticed being so ftir imaging studies should be complemented by μ raman for properly accounting for mps in the smaller size range however μ raman is not used in the majority of mp identification studies 14 according to a recent review renner et al 2018 in great part due to its cumbersomeness e g fluorescence masking and long measurement time certainly the shortcomings of μ raman must be overcome prior to its large scale implementation recently a considerable effort has been made to optimize signal quality section 3 and automation routines section 4 that enable faster and more reliable μ raman identification of mps 3 enhancing signal quality two commonly cited drawbacks of classical raman scattering as a method for mp analysis are the inherent weakness of the signal only about 10 8 of the photons bombarding the sample are actually translated to raman signal borman 1982 and its proneness to fluorescence interference either intrinsic to the main constituent of the mp or due to impurities such as colouring agents biological material and degradation products a weak signal imposes the necessity of extending the integration time which in the best case scenario increases the duration of the measurement and in the worst case scenario results in laser induced degradation of the sample fluorescence results in a raised baseline which in the worst cases completely overshadows the raman signal there are many possible routes to minimize these problems a radical approach is to forego spontaneous raman scattering in favor of nonlinear raman techniques which by their very nature offer high signal to noise ratio while being free from the interference of fluorescence borman 1982 however nonlinear raman methods require expensive equipment and expert user knowledge so that their implementation in mp analysis is still incipient cole et al 2013 galloway et al 2017 watts et al 2016 2014 zada et al 2018 the present section focuses instead on offering examples of recently suggested good practices designed to minimize the weak signal and fluorescence problems of spontaneous raman spectroscopy in the specific context of mp analysis an obvious way of reducing fluorescence caused by organic debris and in some cases by organic dyes is the use of an appropriate cleaning protocol to remove the contaminants among the pre treatments proposed for cleaning mps are those employing acids bases oxidative and enzymatic agents as extensively discussed in a series of recent reviews blaesing and amelung 2018 lusher et al 2017 miller et al 2017 renner et al 2018 silva et al 2018 worthy of mention is the benchmark study of dehaut et al 2016 which assessed the efficiency and degradation effect of six digestion methods the authors concluded that digestion with nitric acid at the time the official method recommended by the international council for the exploration of the sea ices leads to significant polymer degradation and consequent mp underestimation instead the authors recommended digestion in a 10 koh solution similar conclusions were reached by enders et al 2017 who confirm the destructive effects of nitric acid digestion and in partnership with ices issued a new official recommendation for mp cleaning using a mixture of 30 koh naclo alternatively an enzymatic digestion method employing proteinase k efficiently cleaned samples of salmon viscera and fecal matter spiked with mps without significant polymer degradation karlsson et al 2017 alas even after thorough cleaning some samples will exhibit a problematic degree of fluorescence mainly due to the presence of hard to remove colouring agents a commonly cited solution is photo bleaching the sample that is placing it under the laser for the time necessary for degrading the fluorescing agent however besides being time consuming this strategy cannot be applied to samples prone to photo degradation or pyrolysis and even when applied it does not always work a speedy solution for enabling correct identification of fluorescing samples is proposed by ghosal et al 2018 who use an automated algorithm to remove the fluorescence background and reveal the underlying polymer spectrum a striking example of the algorithm s effectiveness is shown in fig 3 depicting a plastic particle partially covered in biofilm and raman spectra collected at covered red and bare black locations prior to background subtraction the spectrum of the covered surface is saturated with the fluorescence signal which completely overshadows the characteristic polymer peaks after processing the polymer peaks are clearly visible allowing polymer identification by a library matching software the source code for the algorithm which includes a graphical user interface is freely available at https github com michaelstchen modpolyfit an additional source of fluorescence may be the substrate underneath the mps i e the filter as noted by ossmann et al 2017 who compared the performance of six commercial filters commonly used for μ raman analysis and custom made polycarbonate substrates coated with three different metals the filter offering the best performance is made of polycarbonate coated with aluminum which not only minimizes fluorescence and burning of the sample but also optimizes optical contrast between filter and mps thereby easing automated particle search as mentioned before a drawback of raman spectroscopy is the notoriously weak intensity of raman scattering which requires relatively long acquisition times to achieve a decent signal to noise ratio one avenue for signal enhancement arises from the development of improved detector systems as illustrated by the comparison between conventional and electron multiplying charged coupled device detectors ccd vs em ccd relative to conventional ccd detectors em ccd detectors are equipped with a multiplication register that acts prior to the readout amplifying the gain up to 1000 times andor technology 2007 griffiths and miseo 2014 as a result em ccd detectors are expected to require less acquisition time to achieve the same signal to noise ratio as conventional ccd detectors rendering the former especially relevant for fast raman mapping and imaging applications griffiths and miseo 2014 the power of em ccd detectors applied to raman characterization of mps is clearly illustrated by the work of dieing and hollricher from which fig 4 has been retrieved dieing and hollricher 2008 fig 4a depicts the raman image of contaminated poly methyl methacrylate pmma on a glass slide obtained using a classical ccd detector and with an integration time of 36 ms spectrum the signal to noise ratio is low so that one can barely distinguish the vertical stripe in the center glass from the side regions pmma impurities using a em ccd detector the same signal to noise ratio is achieved in a tenth of the integration time fig 4b by setting the integration time at the same as that used for the ccd detector a superior image is obtained fig 4c where not only the glass is clearly distinguished from pmma but the streaks of impurities are also easily discernible 4 automated routines for raman mapping until recently the great majority of studies reporting mp load in environmental samples relied solely upon visual inspection usually under a microscope to determine the total number of plastic particles in the analyzed sample the perils of such approach have been highlighted in the impactful work of lenz et al 2015 who warn that visual inspection alone leads both to false positives e g paint particles and false negatives e g darkly coloured mps mistaken for naturally occurring particles visual detection relies upon morphological criteria to decide whether a given particle is made of plastic an approach that works reasonably well for bigger mps 100 μm but progressively fails as mp size diminishes and morphological features become less apparent thus among those mps 50 μm which were selected under the microscope only 63 could be confirmed as plastics after raman analysis lenz et al 2015 as the authors point out running a ftir or raman analysis following visual sorting eradicates the problem of false positives but perpetuates the issue of false negatives this concern is well expressed in the study of song et al 2015 which compares the effectiveness of visual pre sorting under a microscope followed by ftir analysis with that of analyzing the spectra of all particles present in the sample while full ftir analysis always leads to a larger estimate of mp abundance the contrast is most staggering for particles smaller than 50 μm for which the visual sorting procedure failed to account for roughly half of the mps detected using ftir one may argue that if raman had been used instead the difference would be even more striking it is then clear that visual pre sorting besides taking up far too much operator time likely leads to less than representative results an obvious solution to increase representativeness is to analyze every single particle in a given sample however such approach requires even more operator time than visual pre sorting a more viable solution is automated analysis and there are various ways of doing so one possibility is full point mapping where a whole filter section is analyzed by collecting spectra at various points along a grid with the aid of a motorized stage which moves the sample under the laser in small increments while thorough this approach is rather slow as illustrated in the work of kaeppler et al 2016 whose point by point μ raman mapping without pre selection took a whopping 38 h to scan 1 mm2 of the sample filter using a point distance of 10 μm and total integration time of 10 s per point by reducing the integration time to 0 5 s per point and using a topographical imaging tool to enhance focus the total measurement time was reduced to 90 min but the increase in speed came at the expense of detection success rate which was equivalent to that of the ftir imaging technique the major drawback in point by point mapping for mp analysis is that it does not detect whether there is an actual particle under the laser the whole grid is scanned so a good proportion of laser time will be wasted measuring the spectrum of the filter itself time can be saved by guiding the laser directly to a small area where a particle is located elert et al 2017 used this approach in their comparison of four techniques ftir imaging raman mapping mass spectrometry and chemical extraction for the analysis of soil spiked with reference mps particles ranging from 150 to 200 μm were visually selected under the microscope and the scanning area adjusted to fit each analyzed particle an undesirable practice for environmental studies but appropriate for comparison purposes a pre scan was run with a short integration time of 20 ms per point in order to create a spectral image of each particle then higher resolution spectra were collected only at specific points of interest i e a clear spot vs a fluorescing spot this procedure was more time efficient than full mapping taking circa 15 h per mm2 besides by focusing the analysis on a smaller area a shorter size step could be used 1 μm so that different chemical compositions at the particle surface could be distinguished while this approach is valuable for in depth studies routine monitoring protocols must be swifter an interesting strategy is the use of image analysis software which by enhancing contrast between particles and filter creates a map of all particles in a given area and raman spectra are collected only at those points schymanski et al 2018 used the single particle explorer rapid software to automatically detect particles larger than 5 μm up to a maximum of 5000 particles per scanned area chemical identification was achieved by library matching and all mps with a ranking score between 550 and 700 were then individually analyzed using longer integration times to improve signal to noise ratio despite the time consuming verification step the analysis was performed at a rate of 56 min mm2 a significant improvement relative to point mapping approaches frère et al frere et al 2016 achieved an even shorter measurement time of 20 s mm2 by performing an automated particle search using the particlefinder horiba software and collecting the spectrum of each detected particle the higher speed efficiency of this measurement relative to that of schymanski s study has to do with the size of the mps sampled 300 μm and the absence of a thorough verification step a comparison which nicely illustrates the trade off between meticulousness and celerity an optimized software for the automated detection of particles and fibres in the 1 μm 500 μm range is currently being developed by kaeppler and colleagues within the framework of the project micropoll eu bonus program oberbeckmann 2017 which might allow a more thorough analysis in a shorter time scale a truly innovative approach is the method for mp detection using a fluorescent dye initially suggested by andrady 2011 and demonstrated in recent works erni cassola et al 2017 maes et al 2017 shim et al 2016 which currently yields the best compromise between speed and accuracy nile red a solvatochromic fluorescent dye was found to selectively stain synthetic polymers but not tire rubber enabling their fast detection under a uv light as depicted in fig 5 this procedure might seem counterproductive as the fluorescence induced by the dye may mask the raman signal however one author maes et al 2017 claims that the very small amounts of nile red adsorbed on the particles did not interfere with ir or raman spectroscopy while another erni cassola et al 2017 reports an undesirable level of interference the authors minimize the deleterious effects of fluorescence by photo bleaching the sample for 5 min prior to raman analysis the great advantage of this method lies in the particle selection stage where an automated particle search is applied using imaging software and detecting only fluorescing particles so that only a fraction of the particles initially present under 10 are selected for further analysis not all of the stained particles are necessarily plastics non plastic fragments contaminated with hydrophobic biological material are stained as well however their detection can be minimized by combining an effective cleaning step prior to nile red staining and the use of a uv wavelength that induces green instead of red fluorescence plastic particles fluoresce better in green while organic material does not erni cassola et al 2017 following this strategy erni cassola and co workers located mps as small as 20 μm and determined their chemical composition using μ raman totaling a measurement time of almost 2 min per mm2 if the photo bleaching step had been omitted the total analysis time would be roughly 40 s per mm2 a more time efficient procedure would be to 1 run a first test without photo bleaching mps 2 run the raw spectra through an automated baseline correction script ghosal et al 2018 3 attempt automatic identification through library matching and 4 photo bleach and re analyze only those particles which could not be successfully identified in the first run the aforementioned studies of mp identification using μ raman have all relied on a mapping or point and shoot strategy which collects spectra one point at a time however it is already possible to image a whole area in a single scan using widefield techniques as discussed in section 6 such strategy is often implemented for ftir analysis of mps using a focal plane array fpa detector imaging a whole area in a single measurement promises gains in expediency and representativeness by dispensing with the step of particle selection and the use of a motorized stage yet at present ftir imaging with fpa is not necessarily more time efficient than raman mapping the measurement time mm2 of a few selected works employing either raman mapping or fpa to detect mps are presented in table 2 both categories showcase examples in which 1 mm2 of sample area was analyzed within a few minutes and even seconds on top of being comparable to ftir imaging in terms of analysis time raman mapping offers the possibility of identifying mps in the 1 20 μm range this competitive edge of raman mapping is likely to fade in coming years as advancements in instrumentation deliver affordable and time efficient devices for proper raman imaging 5 spectral libraries automated μ raman routines employ library matching software to compare the spectrum of the sample with that of custom made and or commercial libraries the likelihood of successful matching greatly depends upon the comprehensiveness of the spectral library however custom made libraries usually rely on spectra acquired from pristine polymer pellets and may differ significantly from those of mps collected from environmental compartments environmental mps mostly result from the fragmentation of commercial polymers available in different morphologies foam sheet fibre and include in their composition a variety of additives fillers and colouring agents these components in some instances overlay or even mask the underlying polymer spectrum the use of more comprehensive commercial libraries is a step in the right direction to enhancing matching scores especially if the matching algorithm uses multicomponent correlations lenz et al 2015 among 31 studies using automated matching software for mp identification 6 rely solely on custom made reference libraries 13 used solely commercial libraries although most of them use a collection of libraries from different vendors and 12 use a combination of commercial and custom made libraries the need for different commercial libraries often complemented with own reference spectra is a good indicator that no single commercial library is currently broad enough to assure extensive success rates perhaps part of this problem is due to the fact that both commercial and custom made libraries only include spectra from plastics that were not exposed to environmental degradation mps in the environment are continuously exposed to a variety of environmental stressors uv light heat biodegradation that result in plastic weathering andrady 2017 lenz et al 2015 for example polyvinylchloride pvc is prone to photo degradation in aquatic media as the leakage of additives such as photo stabilizers accelerates under high humidity conditions uv degradation significantly alters the spectral fingerprint of pvc showing a simultaneous intensity decrease of the neighboring peaks at 693 cm 1 and 637 cm 1 which stem from the characteristic c cl bonds of the polymer lenz et al 2015 for the spectrum corresponding to the highest uv exposure a complete absence of these double peaks and the appearance of two strong peaks at 1139 cm 1 and 1540 cm 1 assigned to carbon double bonds c c are observed a successful match through library search was impossible since the only reference for pvc was that of a pristine non degraded sample in the light of this drawback it is of utmost importance that spectra of degraded polymers at different degradation stages be included in the reference library thus increasing the chance of the matching software correctly identifying the polymeric composition it should however be noted that photo oxidation is not as problematic for mp identification using raman as it is when using ftir techniques photo oxidation of the most common polymers i e pe pp results in the formation of oxygenated moieties chiefly c o and oh which display strong intensities in the infrared spectrum andrady 2017 cai et al 2018 costa et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2018 contrasting with their typically weak raman signals for example cai et al 2018 found obvious differences among the infrared spectra of pristine and degraded pe pp and ps while the corresponding raman spectra only registered slight differences in band intensities this feature of raman may be considered as an advantage when the purpose is to simply identify plastic identity or a disadvantage for those studies focused on assessing the extent of polymer degradation moreover as lenz and colleagues have done it is of value to include the spectra of non plastic materials which are often confused with mps such as cellulose keratin inorganic particles and most important of all synthetic fibres i e viscose whose presence is ubiquitous among mp samples the obvious hurdle with this approach is that it is time consuming for each individual laboratory to build a comprehensive spectral library an open source curated spectral database would be of great utility the effort and material resources spent by each individual researcher would be minimized by avoiding repetition i e each group having to build their own library while achieving a degree of complexity and completeness currently unavailable in a single commercial library the inclusion of spectra from real environmental samples whose identity when in doubt could be confirmed through other identification techniques would greatly increase matching scores besides having access to a free library would encourage more mp identification studies for research groups with narrow funding thereby expanding our current perception of global mp pollution such an enterprise might seem far fetched however an open source database for mass spectra curatr has been developed at the european molecular biology laboratory germany palmer et al 2017 and is available at http curatr mcf embl de about curatr the spectra uploaded by authorized curators are converted into a format compatible with library matching software so that any user can easily download and use them in their own studies finally an interesting way of optimizing automated identification of mps with complex composition might be using the raman barcode strategy outlined by lawson and rodriguez 2016 for the fast identification of counterfeit drugs briefly both reference apis and sample counterfeit drug spectra are converted into a barcode where each line represents a spectral peak as illustrated in fig 6 the barcode of the sample is then identified through binary comparison with the reference barcodes thus speeding up matching and dispensing with spectral intensity normalization the barcode strategy has not yet been applied for the identification of microplastics although it could easily be adapted for that purpose the reference barcodes would be those of polymers colouring agents and common plastic additives the advantage of using the barcode for raman spectral matching is that ignoring spectral intensity would improve the identification rates for those mps whose spectra are overshadowed by the peaks of the colouring agent and or additives 6 future prospects emerging non conventional raman techniques this section discusses non conventional raman techniques these are not at present commonly used for the identification of environmental mps yet might grow in importance for mp research as the necessary instrumentation becomes more easily accessible a theoretical description of unconventional raman techniques falls outside the scope of this review having been comprehensively discussed elsewhere stewart et al 2012 opilik et al 2013 furthermore the aim here is not to delineate novel detection protocols but merely bringing the reader s attention to a wider set of possible raman tools using concrete examples from the available literature as mentioned before the majority of works employing μ raman for mp detection follows a mapping point by point strategy the spectra collected at each spatial location may then be put together to create a raman image however this cannot be considered a true imaging technique proper raman imaging may rely on either spontaneous or nonlinear processes in spontaneous raman imaging wide field raman a whole sample section is illuminated by defocusing the laser and collecting an image in a single measurement a strategy not yet applied for environmental mp analysis in contrast proper ftir imaging using fpas for mp detection has been demonstrated before an interesting example of wide field raman imaging is the proof of concept demonstration of schmaelzlin et al 2014 where a fiber coupled high performance astronomy spectrograph muse was used to image polystyrene ps 50 μm and pmma 100 μm microshperes scattered on a metal plate the exposure time was 2 min and after background subtraction and automated fluorescence correction the area of non overlapping characteristic peaks was integrated over the sample area to produce the false color images shown in fig 7 although the image presents poor spatial resolution the location and size of the ps and pmma microspheres are clearly defined the authors themselves warn that this preliminary test is intended to illustrate the lower limit of the technique s capabilities since the muse spectrograph designed for astrophysical exploration of distant galaxies had not been optimized for this specific purpose the next frontier in mp characterization is real time analysis of flowing particles conventional raman techniques based on spontaneous raman scattering are unfit for this purpose the inherently weak scattering intensity results in the necessity of long dwelling times milliseconds to seconds to achieve a good signal however the improved signal intensity achieved by nonlinear raman techniques such as coherent anti stokes raman scattering cars and stimulated raman scattering srs opens up new possibilities for real time mp analysis in cars and srs a strong signal is elicited only from the molecular vibrational modes of interest thus the signal is free from fluorescence even if strongly fluorescing contaminants are present as long as these are inactive at the frequency of interest the sample signal will not be influenced therefore a sufficient signal can be acquired quickly and sample preparation becomes less important an ideal scenario for real time detection of mps in environmental compartments the use of cars for locating mps within biological organisms has been demonstrated before for zooplankton cole et al 2013 and crabs watts et al 2016 2014 as briefly discussed elsewhere ribeiro claro et al 2017 and more recently fairy shrimp and zebrafish embryos galloway et al 2017 the latter study by galloway and colleagues detected nanoparticles of acrylic co polymers as small as 80 nm thereby pushing the limit of plastic particle detection from the micro to the nanoscale the potential of srs for fast analysis of mps did not go unnoticed by the microplastics research community as demonstrated in a recent proof of principle study by zada et al 2018 srs microscopy was used in a time efficient manner to detect and distinguish mps of five commonly encountered polymers the analysis was calibrated at six different wavenumbers fig 8 a selected by statistical methods to tell apart the mps from the background while maximizing polymer type discrimination fig 8b displays the srs identification images of model mps upper panel and its respective color maps identifying polymeric composition lower panel the technique was successfully applied in the detection of mps present in glitter nail polish and sediments from the rhine estuary zada et al report a total srs analysis time of 2 7 min per mm2 an impressive speed especially when taking into account that there was no particle pre selection the whole filter area was scanned for raman signals a comparable full mapping analysis using conventional raman took 38 h per mm2 as reported by the same authors with conventional raman short measurement times ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes per mm2 are achievable but only by drastically reducing the number of data collection points through automated particle pre selection see table 2 the advantage of the latter strategy is greater flexibility since it can detect a broad range of polymer types while the srs scheme suggested by zada and co workers only identifies the polymer classes included in the calibration step zhang et al c zhang et al 2017a demonstrated the capabilities of srs coupled with flow cytometry in the fast identification of plastic microspheres beads of pmma and ps 10 μm in size were suspended in water and run through a flow cytometry device coupled to a multichannel srs system fc srs the fc srs prototype includes a custom built signal amplifier allowing the collection of a raman spectrum in merely 5 μs with the flow speed set to 400 mm s 11 000 microspheres per second were successfully identified an astonishing detection rate compared with the timescales previously discussed in this review fig 9 left shows a time stack srs image corresponding to 1 8 ms a short time window during which 8 pmma and 5 ps beads were identified through their characteristic peaks in the ch stretching region shown in fig 9 right aided by multivariate curve resolution combining real time raman analysis and raman imaging liao et al 2017 recently proposed a handheld srs microscope with optical fibre laser delivery that permits in situ and in vivo chemical identification the device depicted in fig 10 permits imaging at a rate of 8 frames per second thereby reducing distortion generated by hand movement the raman image shown in fig 10 displaying the spatial locations of ps and pmma microbeads 5 μm as well cellulose fibers from the filter paper underneath was generated in a mere 3 s fast steady and accurate the handheld srs device might be an interesting option for real time monitoring of mps in food cosmetics and other consumer products the handheld device could be suspended above the production line treadmill attached to an automated arm which scans the surface of the product and rapidly detects the presence of mps while in the examples discussed throughout this review the sample is placed within close reach to the raman detector it is possible to collect raman spectra from afar at distances up to hundreds of meters this approach deemed standoff raman spectroscopy has been developed for detecting samples which are hard to reach and or dangerous to handle such as explosives gares et al 2016 stewart et al 2012 ostmark et al 2011 employed hyperspectral spontaneous raman imaging for distinguishing explosives from inorganic particles measuring circa 5 mm at a distance of 10 m the method was then successfully used to detect sulfur microparticles 20 μm dispersed over a brick surface bremer et al 2011 used standoff cars to identify explosives present in trace quantities in a complex chemical background a polymer solution of ps and pmma dispersed in toluene the raman images recorded from a distance of 1 m were not subject to any background subtraction or other processing procedures yet regions rich in pmma ps and dnt explosive were clearly distinguishable as shown in fig 11 standoff raman techniques may be particularly interesting for monitoring mps in the ocean surface by passing ships or indeed for monitoring any surface with the aid of a drone or a helicopter as currently done in the search for explosives in enemy territory using the lidar technology 7 conclusions this review outlined the major advantages and limitations of raman spectroscopy for the identification of environmental microplastics recently suggested good practices for overcoming the well known drawbacks of μ raman were discussed and some possible future trends for mp analysis briefly introduced in sum μ raman stands out as the method of choice for the non destructive identification of very small microplastics 20 μm commonly cited drawbacks of raman techniques such as weak signal and fluorescence interference can be overcome by following appropriate cleaning protocols applying baseline removal algorithms and using more efficient detectors the development of automated raman mapping routines enables fast detection of plastic particles with minimal operator time by streamlining particle pre selection through particle detection software and recently fluorescent tagging of microplastics the number of data points to be collected is greatly reduced without compromising representativeness the current great challenge in microplastic identification is real time monitoring a goal achievable through the use of ultrafast nonlinear raman techniques such as stimulated raman scattering which when coupled with flow cytometry proved feasible for high throughput screening of plastic microbeads the next decade promises to be a bustling period of activity for μ raman mp analysis the authors of this review sincerely hope their

19456,widespread microplastic pollution is raising growing concerns as to its detrimental effects upon living organisms a realistic risk assessment must stand on representative data on the abundance size distribution and chemical composition of microplastics raman microscopy is an indispensable tool for the analysis of very small microplastics 20 μm still its use is far from widespread in part due to drawbacks such as long measurement time and proneness to spectral distortion induced by fluorescence this review discusses each drawback followed by a showcase of interesting and easily available solutions that contribute to faster and better identification of microplastics using raman spectroscopy among discussed topics are enhanced signal quality with better detectors and spectrum processing automated particle selection for faster raman mapping comprehensive reference libraries for successful spectral matching a last section introduces non conventional raman techniques non linear raman hyperspectral imaging standoff raman which permit more advanced applications such as real time raman detection and imaging of microplastics graphical abstract image keywords small microplastics automation fluorescent tagging library matching real time analysis stimulated raman scattering 1 introduction the advent of synthetic plastics ushered in a golden era of unprecedented technological advancement and improved levels of material comfort perfectly summed in the classic dupont slogan better living through chemistry yet this euphoric period of unbridled techno optimism inevitably abated in tandem with growing concerns regarding the harmful impacts of plastic waste among them the plight of widespread microplastic pollution in the biosphere according to a recent estimate there are currently more than 5 trillion plastic particles floating at sea totaling circa 270 000 tonnes eriksen et al 2014 as plastic degradation proceeds and each particle fragments into ever smaller pieces the total number of particles gallops upwards in an exponential fashion and so do the risks they pose to animal and human life avio et al 2017 karami et al 2016 ogonowski et al 2018 revel et al 2018 wright and kelly 2017 microplastics mps defined as plastic particles ranging from 1 μm to 5 mm in size are now ubiquitously present in aquatic and terrestrial environments duis and coors 2016 horton et al 2017b often finding their way into our food and drink alexander et al 2016 karami et al 2018 schymanski et al 2018 a realistic assessment of the ill effects of mps must commence with a representative large scale analysis of their abundance size distribution and chemical composition jahnke et al 2017 towards this end chemistry provides a set of identification tools capable of tackling the mp issue in its many facets hanvey et al 2017 shim et al 2017 silva et al 2018 such as vibrational spectroscopy densitometry differential scanning calorimetry dsc gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms based methods and the recently proposed technique hyperspectral imaging shan et al 2018 this review focuses on a particular characterization technique raman spectroscopy which is rapidly gaining ground in the analysis of small mps raman spectroscopy is a vibrational spectroscopy technique based on the inelastic scattering of light that provides information upon the molecular vibrations of a system in the form of a vibrational spectrum the raman spectrum is akin to a fingerprint of chemical structure allowing identification of the components present in the sample some of the advantages of raman spectroscopy are shared by ft ir techniques such as non destructiveness low sample amount requirement possibility for high throughput screening and environmental friendliness these are relevant advantages over other reported methods i e dsc pyr gc ms for mps analysis and characterization elert et al 2017 ribeiro claro et al 2017 indeed vibrational spectroscopy is a common choice for mp identification and has been recommended by the european union expert group on marine litter who advocate that all suspected mps in the 1 100 μm size range should have their polymer identity confirmed by spectroscopic analysis gago et al 2016 compared with ftir spectroscopy raman techniques show better spatial resolution down to 1 μm while that of ftir is 10 20 μm wider spectral coverage higher sensitivity to non polar functional groups lower water interference and narrower spectral bands on the downside raman spectroscopy is prone to fluorescence interference has an inherently low signal to noise ratio and might cause sample heating due to the use of a laser as light source leading to background emission occasionally followed by polymer degradation a more comprehensive explanation of the theoretical principles of raman spectroscopy its strengths and weaknesses for mp analysis as well as instrumentation details can be found elsewhere ivleva et al 2017 ribeiro claro et al 2017 silva et al 2018 smith and dent 2005 despite its many advantages the identification of mps through the use of raman spectroscopy is yet to attain the popularity of ft ir techniques although the number of publications is steeply increasing at this juncture may 2018 a search on isi web of knowledge researchgate and sciencedirect yields a total of 71 original articles on mp identification using raman spectroscopy out of these 86 employ raman microscopy μ raman the classical raman setup was only used in early studies and since then discontinued the surveyed works are listed and grouped into handy categories in table 1 additionally 6 book chapters and 21 reviews cover the topic with varying levels of detail with one book chapter from ribeiro claro et al 2017 completely dedicated to it yet the significant boom in μ raman detection of mps that took place since then warrants an updated digest of current limitations and emerging solutions before delving into that it is useful to demonstrate why raman spectroscopy is essential for the study of very small mps a domain where ftir techniques are wholly inadequate 2 the importance of going small it might be argued that relative to μ ftir the most attractive feature of μ raman is higher resolution which becomes especially relevant for identifying very small mps 20 μm elert et al 2017 ivleva et al 2017 kaeppler et al 2016 otherwise undetectable using infrared techniques as detailed in this section there is an urgent need for a fast and easily implementable monitoring tool capable of detecting small mps plastic particles exposed to environmental stressors undergo continuous fragmentation photo thermal and biodegradation so that the number of particles is expected to increase steeply for smaller sizes andrady 2017 cozar et al 2014 despite this fact the smaller fraction of mps has been consistently neglected in quantification studies conkle et al 2018 reviewed 41 surveys of aquatic mps in which plastic debris were collected using neuston nets circa 80 of these studies used nets with relatively large mesh size 300 μm thus entirely missing the smaller mp fraction and leading to a severe underestimation of the actual mp load in aquatic environments likewise a long term study beer et al 2018 on mp concentration in the baltic sea spanning three decades used a bongo net with mesh size 150 μm and did not find a significant increase in mp abundance between 1987 and 2015 the results might have been different for the mp fraction below 150 μm as highlighted in a study by enders et al 2015 among small mps 400 μm collected in the atlantic ocean and identified using μ raman 64 are under 40 μm in size and their distribution in the range 10 100 μm follows a power law with a scaling exponent of 1 96 as depicted in fig 1 these findings are supported by the conclusions of erni cassola et al erni cassola et al 2017 p who also used μ raman to identify mps 400 μm from the surface water of plymouth bay uk determining that the fraction of mps smaller than 40 μm accounts for roughly 50 of the total population therefore properly measuring the abundance of mps smaller than 40 μm is of paramount importance when estimating the total mp load in the environment moreover mp identification is increasingly becoming a consumer health issue in a recent statement alexander et al 2016 the european food safety authority efsa acknowledged the lack of legislation for microplastics and nanoplastics as contaminants in food and the need to develop reliable identification methods especially for smaller mps which present a higher chance of translocation across the gut barrier indeed μ raman analysis has found mps in edible fish tissues collard et al 2017a karami et al 2017c 2018 table salt gündoğdu 2018 karami et al 2017a and bottled water schymanski et al 2018 the latter study by schymanski and co workers analyzed 38 brands of bottled water plastic carton and glass containers and found mp contamination in all of them with 80 of found particles belonging to the 5 20 μm size range a comparison of ftir and raman techniques for mp identification performed by kaeppler et al 2016 illustrates the superior performance of μ raman for detecting small mps while for particles larger than 20 μm both techniques proved equally capable for smaller particles the detection success rate of μ ftir lagged behind μ raman detected mps as small as 5 μm yet μ ftir missed all particles in the 5 10 μm size range and 40 of mps in the 11 20 μm size range moreover even though μ ftir did succeed in identifying some mps in the 11 20 μm range the quality of the spectra suffered due to low signal to noise ratio a direct consequence of the size of the particle approaching that of the instrument s diffraction limit this issue is illustrated by comparing the ftir and raman spectra of a small 15 20 μm polypropylene pp particle as shown in fig 2 b where a clear raman spectrum left contrasts with a weak and noisy ftir spectrum right the efficiency of an ingenious post filtration system implemented in the wastewater treatment plant of oldenburg germany was evaluated by comparing the amount of mps present in wastewater samples collected upstream and downstream from the filtration point mintenig et al 2017 a removal efficiency of 100 was reported for mps 500 μm and of 93 for those 500 μm given that the filtration system consists of pile fabric with a mesh size of 10 15 μm and that particles smaller than 20 μm could not be detected using ftir imaging a significant portion of very small mps might be passing through unnoticed being so ftir imaging studies should be complemented by μ raman for properly accounting for mps in the smaller size range however μ raman is not used in the majority of mp identification studies 14 according to a recent review renner et al 2018 in great part due to its cumbersomeness e g fluorescence masking and long measurement time certainly the shortcomings of μ raman must be overcome prior to its large scale implementation recently a considerable effort has been made to optimize signal quality section 3 and automation routines section 4 that enable faster and more reliable μ raman identification of mps 3 enhancing signal quality two commonly cited drawbacks of classical raman scattering as a method for mp analysis are the inherent weakness of the signal only about 10 8 of the photons bombarding the sample are actually translated to raman signal borman 1982 and its proneness to fluorescence interference either intrinsic to the main constituent of the mp or due to impurities such as colouring agents biological material and degradation products a weak signal imposes the necessity of extending the integration time which in the best case scenario increases the duration of the measurement and in the worst case scenario results in laser induced degradation of the sample fluorescence results in a raised baseline which in the worst cases completely overshadows the raman signal there are many possible routes to minimize these problems a radical approach is to forego spontaneous raman scattering in favor of nonlinear raman techniques which by their very nature offer high signal to noise ratio while being free from the interference of fluorescence borman 1982 however nonlinear raman methods require expensive equipment and expert user knowledge so that their implementation in mp analysis is still incipient cole et al 2013 galloway et al 2017 watts et al 2016 2014 zada et al 2018 the present section focuses instead on offering examples of recently suggested good practices designed to minimize the weak signal and fluorescence problems of spontaneous raman spectroscopy in the specific context of mp analysis an obvious way of reducing fluorescence caused by organic debris and in some cases by organic dyes is the use of an appropriate cleaning protocol to remove the contaminants among the pre treatments proposed for cleaning mps are those employing acids bases oxidative and enzymatic agents as extensively discussed in a series of recent reviews blaesing and amelung 2018 lusher et al 2017 miller et al 2017 renner et al 2018 silva et al 2018 worthy of mention is the benchmark study of dehaut et al 2016 which assessed the efficiency and degradation effect of six digestion methods the authors concluded that digestion with nitric acid at the time the official method recommended by the international council for the exploration of the sea ices leads to significant polymer degradation and consequent mp underestimation instead the authors recommended digestion in a 10 koh solution similar conclusions were reached by enders et al 2017 who confirm the destructive effects of nitric acid digestion and in partnership with ices issued a new official recommendation for mp cleaning using a mixture of 30 koh naclo alternatively an enzymatic digestion method employing proteinase k efficiently cleaned samples of salmon viscera and fecal matter spiked with mps without significant polymer degradation karlsson et al 2017 alas even after thorough cleaning some samples will exhibit a problematic degree of fluorescence mainly due to the presence of hard to remove colouring agents a commonly cited solution is photo bleaching the sample that is placing it under the laser for the time necessary for degrading the fluorescing agent however besides being time consuming this strategy cannot be applied to samples prone to photo degradation or pyrolysis and even when applied it does not always work a speedy solution for enabling correct identification of fluorescing samples is proposed by ghosal et al 2018 who use an automated algorithm to remove the fluorescence background and reveal the underlying polymer spectrum a striking example of the algorithm s effectiveness is shown in fig 3 depicting a plastic particle partially covered in biofilm and raman spectra collected at covered red and bare black locations prior to background subtraction the spectrum of the covered surface is saturated with the fluorescence signal which completely overshadows the characteristic polymer peaks after processing the polymer peaks are clearly visible allowing polymer identification by a library matching software the source code for the algorithm which includes a graphical user interface is freely available at https github com michaelstchen modpolyfit an additional source of fluorescence may be the substrate underneath the mps i e the filter as noted by ossmann et al 2017 who compared the performance of six commercial filters commonly used for μ raman analysis and custom made polycarbonate substrates coated with three different metals the filter offering the best performance is made of polycarbonate coated with aluminum which not only minimizes fluorescence and burning of the sample but also optimizes optical contrast between filter and mps thereby easing automated particle search as mentioned before a drawback of raman spectroscopy is the notoriously weak intensity of raman scattering which requires relatively long acquisition times to achieve a decent signal to noise ratio one avenue for signal enhancement arises from the development of improved detector systems as illustrated by the comparison between conventional and electron multiplying charged coupled device detectors ccd vs em ccd relative to conventional ccd detectors em ccd detectors are equipped with a multiplication register that acts prior to the readout amplifying the gain up to 1000 times andor technology 2007 griffiths and miseo 2014 as a result em ccd detectors are expected to require less acquisition time to achieve the same signal to noise ratio as conventional ccd detectors rendering the former especially relevant for fast raman mapping and imaging applications griffiths and miseo 2014 the power of em ccd detectors applied to raman characterization of mps is clearly illustrated by the work of dieing and hollricher from which fig 4 has been retrieved dieing and hollricher 2008 fig 4a depicts the raman image of contaminated poly methyl methacrylate pmma on a glass slide obtained using a classical ccd detector and with an integration time of 36 ms spectrum the signal to noise ratio is low so that one can barely distinguish the vertical stripe in the center glass from the side regions pmma impurities using a em ccd detector the same signal to noise ratio is achieved in a tenth of the integration time fig 4b by setting the integration time at the same as that used for the ccd detector a superior image is obtained fig 4c where not only the glass is clearly distinguished from pmma but the streaks of impurities are also easily discernible 4 automated routines for raman mapping until recently the great majority of studies reporting mp load in environmental samples relied solely upon visual inspection usually under a microscope to determine the total number of plastic particles in the analyzed sample the perils of such approach have been highlighted in the impactful work of lenz et al 2015 who warn that visual inspection alone leads both to false positives e g paint particles and false negatives e g darkly coloured mps mistaken for naturally occurring particles visual detection relies upon morphological criteria to decide whether a given particle is made of plastic an approach that works reasonably well for bigger mps 100 μm but progressively fails as mp size diminishes and morphological features become less apparent thus among those mps 50 μm which were selected under the microscope only 63 could be confirmed as plastics after raman analysis lenz et al 2015 as the authors point out running a ftir or raman analysis following visual sorting eradicates the problem of false positives but perpetuates the issue of false negatives this concern is well expressed in the study of song et al 2015 which compares the effectiveness of visual pre sorting under a microscope followed by ftir analysis with that of analyzing the spectra of all particles present in the sample while full ftir analysis always leads to a larger estimate of mp abundance the contrast is most staggering for particles smaller than 50 μm for which the visual sorting procedure failed to account for roughly half of the mps detected using ftir one may argue that if raman had been used instead the difference would be even more striking it is then clear that visual pre sorting besides taking up far too much operator time likely leads to less than representative results an obvious solution to increase representativeness is to analyze every single particle in a given sample however such approach requires even more operator time than visual pre sorting a more viable solution is automated analysis and there are various ways of doing so one possibility is full point mapping where a whole filter section is analyzed by collecting spectra at various points along a grid with the aid of a motorized stage which moves the sample under the laser in small increments while thorough this approach is rather slow as illustrated in the work of kaeppler et al 2016 whose point by point μ raman mapping without pre selection took a whopping 38 h to scan 1 mm2 of the sample filter using a point distance of 10 μm and total integration time of 10 s per point by reducing the integration time to 0 5 s per point and using a topographical imaging tool to enhance focus the total measurement time was reduced to 90 min but the increase in speed came at the expense of detection success rate which was equivalent to that of the ftir imaging technique the major drawback in point by point mapping for mp analysis is that it does not detect whether there is an actual particle under the laser the whole grid is scanned so a good proportion of laser time will be wasted measuring the spectrum of the filter itself time can be saved by guiding the laser directly to a small area where a particle is located elert et al 2017 used this approach in their comparison of four techniques ftir imaging raman mapping mass spectrometry and chemical extraction for the analysis of soil spiked with reference mps particles ranging from 150 to 200 μm were visually selected under the microscope and the scanning area adjusted to fit each analyzed particle an undesirable practice for environmental studies but appropriate for comparison purposes a pre scan was run with a short integration time of 20 ms per point in order to create a spectral image of each particle then higher resolution spectra were collected only at specific points of interest i e a clear spot vs a fluorescing spot this procedure was more time efficient than full mapping taking circa 15 h per mm2 besides by focusing the analysis on a smaller area a shorter size step could be used 1 μm so that different chemical compositions at the particle surface could be distinguished while this approach is valuable for in depth studies routine monitoring protocols must be swifter an interesting strategy is the use of image analysis software which by enhancing contrast between particles and filter creates a map of all particles in a given area and raman spectra are collected only at those points schymanski et al 2018 used the single particle explorer rapid software to automatically detect particles larger than 5 μm up to a maximum of 5000 particles per scanned area chemical identification was achieved by library matching and all mps with a ranking score between 550 and 700 were then individually analyzed using longer integration times to improve signal to noise ratio despite the time consuming verification step the analysis was performed at a rate of 56 min mm2 a significant improvement relative to point mapping approaches frère et al frere et al 2016 achieved an even shorter measurement time of 20 s mm2 by performing an automated particle search using the particlefinder horiba software and collecting the spectrum of each detected particle the higher speed efficiency of this measurement relative to that of schymanski s study has to do with the size of the mps sampled 300 μm and the absence of a thorough verification step a comparison which nicely illustrates the trade off between meticulousness and celerity an optimized software for the automated detection of particles and fibres in the 1 μm 500 μm range is currently being developed by kaeppler and colleagues within the framework of the project micropoll eu bonus program oberbeckmann 2017 which might allow a more thorough analysis in a shorter time scale a truly innovative approach is the method for mp detection using a fluorescent dye initially suggested by andrady 2011 and demonstrated in recent works erni cassola et al 2017 maes et al 2017 shim et al 2016 which currently yields the best compromise between speed and accuracy nile red a solvatochromic fluorescent dye was found to selectively stain synthetic polymers but not tire rubber enabling their fast detection under a uv light as depicted in fig 5 this procedure might seem counterproductive as the fluorescence induced by the dye may mask the raman signal however one author maes et al 2017 claims that the very small amounts of nile red adsorbed on the particles did not interfere with ir or raman spectroscopy while another erni cassola et al 2017 reports an undesirable level of interference the authors minimize the deleterious effects of fluorescence by photo bleaching the sample for 5 min prior to raman analysis the great advantage of this method lies in the particle selection stage where an automated particle search is applied using imaging software and detecting only fluorescing particles so that only a fraction of the particles initially present under 10 are selected for further analysis not all of the stained particles are necessarily plastics non plastic fragments contaminated with hydrophobic biological material are stained as well however their detection can be minimized by combining an effective cleaning step prior to nile red staining and the use of a uv wavelength that induces green instead of red fluorescence plastic particles fluoresce better in green while organic material does not erni cassola et al 2017 following this strategy erni cassola and co workers located mps as small as 20 μm and determined their chemical composition using μ raman totaling a measurement time of almost 2 min per mm2 if the photo bleaching step had been omitted the total analysis time would be roughly 40 s per mm2 a more time efficient procedure would be to 1 run a first test without photo bleaching mps 2 run the raw spectra through an automated baseline correction script ghosal et al 2018 3 attempt automatic identification through library matching and 4 photo bleach and re analyze only those particles which could not be successfully identified in the first run the aforementioned studies of mp identification using μ raman have all relied on a mapping or point and shoot strategy which collects spectra one point at a time however it is already possible to image a whole area in a single scan using widefield techniques as discussed in section 6 such strategy is often implemented for ftir analysis of mps using a focal plane array fpa detector imaging a whole area in a single measurement promises gains in expediency and representativeness by dispensing with the step of particle selection and the use of a motorized stage yet at present ftir imaging with fpa is not necessarily more time efficient than raman mapping the measurement time mm2 of a few selected works employing either raman mapping or fpa to detect mps are presented in table 2 both categories showcase examples in which 1 mm2 of sample area was analyzed within a few minutes and even seconds on top of being comparable to ftir imaging in terms of analysis time raman mapping offers the possibility of identifying mps in the 1 20 μm range this competitive edge of raman mapping is likely to fade in coming years as advancements in instrumentation deliver affordable and time efficient devices for proper raman imaging 5 spectral libraries automated μ raman routines employ library matching software to compare the spectrum of the sample with that of custom made and or commercial libraries the likelihood of successful matching greatly depends upon the comprehensiveness of the spectral library however custom made libraries usually rely on spectra acquired from pristine polymer pellets and may differ significantly from those of mps collected from environmental compartments environmental mps mostly result from the fragmentation of commercial polymers available in different morphologies foam sheet fibre and include in their composition a variety of additives fillers and colouring agents these components in some instances overlay or even mask the underlying polymer spectrum the use of more comprehensive commercial libraries is a step in the right direction to enhancing matching scores especially if the matching algorithm uses multicomponent correlations lenz et al 2015 among 31 studies using automated matching software for mp identification 6 rely solely on custom made reference libraries 13 used solely commercial libraries although most of them use a collection of libraries from different vendors and 12 use a combination of commercial and custom made libraries the need for different commercial libraries often complemented with own reference spectra is a good indicator that no single commercial library is currently broad enough to assure extensive success rates perhaps part of this problem is due to the fact that both commercial and custom made libraries only include spectra from plastics that were not exposed to environmental degradation mps in the environment are continuously exposed to a variety of environmental stressors uv light heat biodegradation that result in plastic weathering andrady 2017 lenz et al 2015 for example polyvinylchloride pvc is prone to photo degradation in aquatic media as the leakage of additives such as photo stabilizers accelerates under high humidity conditions uv degradation significantly alters the spectral fingerprint of pvc showing a simultaneous intensity decrease of the neighboring peaks at 693 cm 1 and 637 cm 1 which stem from the characteristic c cl bonds of the polymer lenz et al 2015 for the spectrum corresponding to the highest uv exposure a complete absence of these double peaks and the appearance of two strong peaks at 1139 cm 1 and 1540 cm 1 assigned to carbon double bonds c c are observed a successful match through library search was impossible since the only reference for pvc was that of a pristine non degraded sample in the light of this drawback it is of utmost importance that spectra of degraded polymers at different degradation stages be included in the reference library thus increasing the chance of the matching software correctly identifying the polymeric composition it should however be noted that photo oxidation is not as problematic for mp identification using raman as it is when using ftir techniques photo oxidation of the most common polymers i e pe pp results in the formation of oxygenated moieties chiefly c o and oh which display strong intensities in the infrared spectrum andrady 2017 cai et al 2018 costa et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2018 contrasting with their typically weak raman signals for example cai et al 2018 found obvious differences among the infrared spectra of pristine and degraded pe pp and ps while the corresponding raman spectra only registered slight differences in band intensities this feature of raman may be considered as an advantage when the purpose is to simply identify plastic identity or a disadvantage for those studies focused on assessing the extent of polymer degradation moreover as lenz and colleagues have done it is of value to include the spectra of non plastic materials which are often confused with mps such as cellulose keratin inorganic particles and most important of all synthetic fibres i e viscose whose presence is ubiquitous among mp samples the obvious hurdle with this approach is that it is time consuming for each individual laboratory to build a comprehensive spectral library an open source curated spectral database would be of great utility the effort and material resources spent by each individual researcher would be minimized by avoiding repetition i e each group having to build their own library while achieving a degree of complexity and completeness currently unavailable in a single commercial library the inclusion of spectra from real environmental samples whose identity when in doubt could be confirmed through other identification techniques would greatly increase matching scores besides having access to a free library would encourage more mp identification studies for research groups with narrow funding thereby expanding our current perception of global mp pollution such an enterprise might seem far fetched however an open source database for mass spectra curatr has been developed at the european molecular biology laboratory germany palmer et al 2017 and is available at http curatr mcf embl de about curatr the spectra uploaded by authorized curators are converted into a format compatible with library matching software so that any user can easily download and use them in their own studies finally an interesting way of optimizing automated identification of mps with complex composition might be using the raman barcode strategy outlined by lawson and rodriguez 2016 for the fast identification of counterfeit drugs briefly both reference apis and sample counterfeit drug spectra are converted into a barcode where each line represents a spectral peak as illustrated in fig 6 the barcode of the sample is then identified through binary comparison with the reference barcodes thus speeding up matching and dispensing with spectral intensity normalization the barcode strategy has not yet been applied for the identification of microplastics although it could easily be adapted for that purpose the reference barcodes would be those of polymers colouring agents and common plastic additives the advantage of using the barcode for raman spectral matching is that ignoring spectral intensity would improve the identification rates for those mps whose spectra are overshadowed by the peaks of the colouring agent and or additives 6 future prospects emerging non conventional raman techniques this section discusses non conventional raman techniques these are not at present commonly used for the identification of environmental mps yet might grow in importance for mp research as the necessary instrumentation becomes more easily accessible a theoretical description of unconventional raman techniques falls outside the scope of this review having been comprehensively discussed elsewhere stewart et al 2012 opilik et al 2013 furthermore the aim here is not to delineate novel detection protocols but merely bringing the reader s attention to a wider set of possible raman tools using concrete examples from the available literature as mentioned before the majority of works employing μ raman for mp detection follows a mapping point by point strategy the spectra collected at each spatial location may then be put together to create a raman image however this cannot be considered a true imaging technique proper raman imaging may rely on either spontaneous or nonlinear processes in spontaneous raman imaging wide field raman a whole sample section is illuminated by defocusing the laser and collecting an image in a single measurement a strategy not yet applied for environmental mp analysis in contrast proper ftir imaging using fpas for mp detection has been demonstrated before an interesting example of wide field raman imaging is the proof of concept demonstration of schmaelzlin et al 2014 where a fiber coupled high performance astronomy spectrograph muse was used to image polystyrene ps 50 μm and pmma 100 μm microshperes scattered on a metal plate the exposure time was 2 min and after background subtraction and automated fluorescence correction the area of non overlapping characteristic peaks was integrated over the sample area to produce the false color images shown in fig 7 although the image presents poor spatial resolution the location and size of the ps and pmma microspheres are clearly defined the authors themselves warn that this preliminary test is intended to illustrate the lower limit of the technique s capabilities since the muse spectrograph designed for astrophysical exploration of distant galaxies had not been optimized for this specific purpose the next frontier in mp characterization is real time analysis of flowing particles conventional raman techniques based on spontaneous raman scattering are unfit for this purpose the inherently weak scattering intensity results in the necessity of long dwelling times milliseconds to seconds to achieve a good signal however the improved signal intensity achieved by nonlinear raman techniques such as coherent anti stokes raman scattering cars and stimulated raman scattering srs opens up new possibilities for real time mp analysis in cars and srs a strong signal is elicited only from the molecular vibrational modes of interest thus the signal is free from fluorescence even if strongly fluorescing contaminants are present as long as these are inactive at the frequency of interest the sample signal will not be influenced therefore a sufficient signal can be acquired quickly and sample preparation becomes less important an ideal scenario for real time detection of mps in environmental compartments the use of cars for locating mps within biological organisms has been demonstrated before for zooplankton cole et al 2013 and crabs watts et al 2016 2014 as briefly discussed elsewhere ribeiro claro et al 2017 and more recently fairy shrimp and zebrafish embryos galloway et al 2017 the latter study by galloway and colleagues detected nanoparticles of acrylic co polymers as small as 80 nm thereby pushing the limit of plastic particle detection from the micro to the nanoscale the potential of srs for fast analysis of mps did not go unnoticed by the microplastics research community as demonstrated in a recent proof of principle study by zada et al 2018 srs microscopy was used in a time efficient manner to detect and distinguish mps of five commonly encountered polymers the analysis was calibrated at six different wavenumbers fig 8 a selected by statistical methods to tell apart the mps from the background while maximizing polymer type discrimination fig 8b displays the srs identification images of model mps upper panel and its respective color maps identifying polymeric composition lower panel the technique was successfully applied in the detection of mps present in glitter nail polish and sediments from the rhine estuary zada et al report a total srs analysis time of 2 7 min per mm2 an impressive speed especially when taking into account that there was no particle pre selection the whole filter area was scanned for raman signals a comparable full mapping analysis using conventional raman took 38 h per mm2 as reported by the same authors with conventional raman short measurement times ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes per mm2 are achievable but only by drastically reducing the number of data collection points through automated particle pre selection see table 2 the advantage of the latter strategy is greater flexibility since it can detect a broad range of polymer types while the srs scheme suggested by zada and co workers only identifies the polymer classes included in the calibration step zhang et al c zhang et al 2017a demonstrated the capabilities of srs coupled with flow cytometry in the fast identification of plastic microspheres beads of pmma and ps 10 μm in size were suspended in water and run through a flow cytometry device coupled to a multichannel srs system fc srs the fc srs prototype includes a custom built signal amplifier allowing the collection of a raman spectrum in merely 5 μs with the flow speed set to 400 mm s 11 000 microspheres per second were successfully identified an astonishing detection rate compared with the timescales previously discussed in this review fig 9 left shows a time stack srs image corresponding to 1 8 ms a short time window during which 8 pmma and 5 ps beads were identified through their characteristic peaks in the ch stretching region shown in fig 9 right aided by multivariate curve resolution combining real time raman analysis and raman imaging liao et al 2017 recently proposed a handheld srs microscope with optical fibre laser delivery that permits in situ and in vivo chemical identification the device depicted in fig 10 permits imaging at a rate of 8 frames per second thereby reducing distortion generated by hand movement the raman image shown in fig 10 displaying the spatial locations of ps and pmma microbeads 5 μm as well cellulose fibers from the filter paper underneath was generated in a mere 3 s fast steady and accurate the handheld srs device might be an interesting option for real time monitoring of mps in food cosmetics and other consumer products the handheld device could be suspended above the production line treadmill attached to an automated arm which scans the surface of the product and rapidly detects the presence of mps while in the examples discussed throughout this review the sample is placed within close reach to the raman detector it is possible to collect raman spectra from afar at distances up to hundreds of meters this approach deemed standoff raman spectroscopy has been developed for detecting samples which are hard to reach and or dangerous to handle such as explosives gares et al 2016 stewart et al 2012 ostmark et al 2011 employed hyperspectral spontaneous raman imaging for distinguishing explosives from inorganic particles measuring circa 5 mm at a distance of 10 m the method was then successfully used to detect sulfur microparticles 20 μm dispersed over a brick surface bremer et al 2011 used standoff cars to identify explosives present in trace quantities in a complex chemical background a polymer solution of ps and pmma dispersed in toluene the raman images recorded from a distance of 1 m were not subject to any background subtraction or other processing procedures yet regions rich in pmma ps and dnt explosive were clearly distinguishable as shown in fig 11 standoff raman techniques may be particularly interesting for monitoring mps in the ocean surface by passing ships or indeed for monitoring any surface with the aid of a drone or a helicopter as currently done in the search for explosives in enemy territory using the lidar technology 7 conclusions this review outlined the major advantages and limitations of raman spectroscopy for the identification of environmental microplastics recently suggested good practices for overcoming the well known drawbacks of μ raman were discussed and some possible future trends for mp analysis briefly introduced in sum μ raman stands out as the method of choice for the non destructive identification of very small microplastics 20 μm commonly cited drawbacks of raman techniques such as weak signal and fluorescence interference can be overcome by following appropriate cleaning protocols applying baseline removal algorithms and using more efficient detectors the development of automated raman mapping routines enables fast detection of plastic particles with minimal operator time by streamlining particle pre selection through particle detection software and recently fluorescent tagging of microplastics the number of data points to be collected is greatly reduced without compromising representativeness the current great challenge in microplastic identification is real time monitoring a goal achievable through the use of ultrafast nonlinear raman techniques such as stimulated raman scattering which when coupled with flow cytometry proved feasible for high throughput screening of plastic microbeads the next decade promises to be a bustling period of activity for μ raman mp analysis the authors of this review sincerely hope their

19457,this paper presents a method for microplastic mp mass quantification using a focal plane array based fourier transform infrared imaging technique it discusses the issue that particle number is not a conserved base quantity and hence less suited than mass to compare independent studies on mp in the environment it concludes that mp mass should be included when quantifying mp pollution in the environment supplementing the conventional approach of reporting particle numbers applying mass as the unit of mp measurement the paper presents data showing that danish wastewater treatment plants discharge around 3 t year of mp in the size range 10 500 μm this value corresponds to an annual per capita emission from these plants of 0 56 g mp capita year the distribution of polymer types by mass and particle number differed because the size of mp particles of the different material types varied graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic mass quantification wastewater treatment plants ft ir spectroscopy 1 introduction plastic is a versatile material which can be manufactured to suit multifarious applications making its usage unavoidable in modern life andrady 2011 the ever growing use of these artificial polymers however entails the increase of plastic litter due to the persistent nature of the material thompson et al 2004 the improper disposal of plastic waste has led to its widespread presence in the environment van cauwenberghe et al 2013 villarrubia gómez et al 2017 where the long term ubiquity of plastic litter poses various threats to different ecosystems and organisms at all trophic levels barnes et al 2009 browne et al 2011 the environmental impact and fate of plastic particles smaller than 5 mm called microplastics mp in particular has been the focus of interest for more than a decade hidalgo ruz et al 2013 based on the origin of the particles two types of mp are commonly distinguished primary mp is used as raw material in the production of plastic items and additives in cosmetic products whereas secondary mp is formed by the physical or photo oxidative breakdown of larger plastic items andrady 2011 both primary and secondary mp has been found in the marine environment as well as in freshwater systems mp particles are considered potentially harmful environmental contaminants by acting as vectors for organic pollutants and heavy metals or by causing physical harm to organisms upon ingestion cole et al 2011 although the exact and most significant sources of mp are yet to be discovered wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been found to be one of the urban sources releasing mp studies have shown that despite the high retention of mp in wwtps a considerable number of these particles enters the environment due to the high flux of wastewater murphy et al 2016 the mp research field has so far not established standardized analytical methods which is a significant obstacle in studying the occurrence of mp pollution in the environment although some studies have proposed techniques as standard procedures andrady 2011 hidalgo ruz et al 2013 löder et al 2015 a scientific consensus is yet to be reached in all aspects of mp research from sampling to data interpretation owing to the different methodologies the results of some studies can be difficult to compare creating uncertainties over the fate and impact of mp in the environment löder et al 2015 quantification of mp has focused on identifying particle numbers and sizes as impacts and behavior of mp is strongly linked to these parameters andrady 2011 however particle number data cannot be adequately compared with estimates of mp mass loads such as for example the one by lassen et al 2015 who estimated the danish mp discharge based on information on plastic use and wear owing to the brittle nature of mp particles aged in the environment andrady 2011 the incidental fragmentation of mp particles can affect particle number and result in a potential overestimation of their concentrations to varying degrees furthermore particle number cannot alone describe the extent of mp pollution as the size of these particles spans a range three orders of magnitudes wide for example a cubical particle of 1 mm side length takes up equal space in the environmental matrix as one billion cubical particles with 1 μm side length as particle volume comes in the third power of particle dimensions the fact that particles continuously break up in the environment andrady 2011 and can fragment during mp analysis entails that particle number cannot be viewed as a conserved base quantity mass opposed to particle number is a conserved base quantity and as such a consistent measure unaffected by the physical and chemical processes to which the mp is exposed supplementing determination of mp numbers by the mass of mp therefore would allow for the experimental quantification of mp loads to the environment and a direct comparison of the contribution from different sources rocha santos and duarte 2015 despite the apparent advantages of including mass as a measure of mp concentration it has to our best knowledge not been systematically estimated and reported in peer reviewed mp studies applying ft ir fourier transform infrared spectroscopy or similar quantification techniques plastic mass has been measured applying pyrolysis techniques for example with the purpose of quantifying car tire rubber unice et al 2013 additionally several studies have been conducted to assess the mass load to various environments based on theoretical considerations and information on plastic use and wear for example lassen et al 2015 sundt et al 2014 one objective of our study was to present a procedure to estimate the mass of mp in wastewater applying an ft ir based technique allowing both mass and particle number to be determined on the same samples we further aimed to gather information about the overall mp loads in typical danish municipal wastewater and discharges from the associated wwtps we sampled inlet and outlet wastewater at ten of the largest wwtps in denmark and assessed the mean mp load and mean removal efficiency of the wwtps we extracted particles in the size range of 10 500 μm from wastewater samples analyzed their material composition with a focal plane array fpa based ft ir imaging technique and estimated the mass of the identified mp particles 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling raw and treated wastewater was collected flow proportionally from 10 of the largest wwtps in denmark managing 26 of all danish wastewater mfvm 2017 nine of the examined wwtps manage wastewater mainly from households while one receives wastewater of 75 industrial origin wwtp 4 supplementary material table s1 all wwtps do biological n and p removal based on activated sludge technologies one of the plants wwtp 8 had rapid sand filtration as an additional polishing step samples were taken during dry weather defined as a maximum of 3 mm of precipitation for 48 h before and during sampling raw wastewater was collected from the inlet as flow proportional samples covering 24 h of inflow applying the auto samplers of the wwtps the samplers were all permanently installed after the screens and accredited for sampling of raw wastewater for monitoring and compliance purposes it was chosen to use the accredited sampling devices at the wwtps as these are certified to yield representative samples of the raw wastewater inflow while it is not ideal to use samplers containing plastic parts it was deemed a better alternative than taking grab samples at locations where representativeness of samples could not be ensured possible contamination by the auto samplers was not assessed as this was not practically feasible with the already installed samplers one liter of raw wastewater was subsampled at each wwtp and shipped for mp analysis treated wastewater was collected in glass bottles from the outlet flow and filtered on site through 10 μm ø47 mm stainless steel meshes until three filters had clogged the filtered effluent varied for each location depending on water quality from 4 1 to 81 5 l per site supplementary material table s1 except for the auto samplers at the treatment plants all equipment used for sampling was either metal or glass the wwtps are anonymized as only one inlet and outlet sample was taken from each plant the variability between sampling days is hence not quantified and the data not necessarily representative of that plant furthermore it is assumed that the two times ten wastewater samples could be viewed as random samples drawn from the same set raw and treated wastewater and that it hence is valid to combine them for further calculations regarding mp removal efficiency and material composition 2 2 extraction of microplastics 2 2 1 raw wastewater 1 l raw wastewater was wet sieved with a retsch as 200 vibratory sieve shaker through 2 mm 1 mm and 500 μm sieve meshes to eliminate particles and fibers larger than 500 μm sodium dodecyl sulfate sds as a surfactant was added to a final concentration of 0 15 g l before sieving to detach adhered mp particles from the larger solids enders et al 2015 afterwards 200 ml of the pre sieved wastewater was incubated with cellulase enzyme aspergillus sp sigma aldrich cas no 9012 54 8 for 48 h at 40 c to degrade cellulose fibers deriving mainly from toilet paper subsequently organic material was oxidized with hydrogen peroxide where iron ii was added to catalyze the reaction fenton reaction peroxide was added to a final concentration of 250 g l and iron ii sulfate to 2 5 g l masura et al 2015 temperature ph and the ratio of peroxide to ferrous ions are key factors to ensure maximum removal of organic matter babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 gulkaya et al 2006 the ph of the mixture was adjusted to approximately 3 with sodium hydroxide as the formation of complex species of ferric or ferrous ions reduce the amount of free iron ii ions and decelerate the reaction at ph values below 2 and above 4 babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 the reactor was kept in an ice bath to keep the temperature between 15 and 30 c as the oxidation reaction is exothermic and the mixture can boil violently keeping the designated temperature interval was critical as a yellow colored substance probably a ferric compound tended to precipitate at temperatures below 15 c subsequently the oxidized sample was wet sieved demineralized water with 0 15 g l sds into two size fractions through an 80 μm sieve mesh the effluent containing particles 80 μm was collected into a glass beaker particles 80 μm were removed from the sieve mesh into filtered demineralized water containing 0 15 g l sds by treatment in an elma s50r ultrasonic bath particles from this liquid and the collected effluent were gathered on separate 10 μm steel meshes particles were removed from the filters into 25 ml hplc grade ethanol by ultrasonic treatment the resulting particle ethanol suspensions of the two size fractions were transferred into glass vials where their final volume was set to 5 ml by evaporation with nitrogen gas 2 2 2 treated wastewater the collected solids were removed by ultrasonic treatment from the 10 μm steel filters used for sampling in the wwtp and collected in filtered demineralized water containing 0 15 g l sds the resulting suspension was incubated in a serum flask for 48 h at 40 c with the same cellulase enzyme used for raw wastewater samples were oxidized in 180 g l hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by 1 8 g l iron ii sulfate and ph adjusted to approximately three by sodium hydroxide the rest of the sample preparation was identical to that of raw wastewater i e size fractionation by wet sieving and transferring the particle ethanol suspension into glass vials 2 3 analysis the chemical composition of the extracted particles was determined with an fpa based ft ir imaging technique the equipment was a cary 620 ft ir microscope from agilent technologies coupled with a cary 670 ir spectroscope the microscope was equipped with 15x cassegrain objective and a 128 128 mercury cadmium telluride mct fpa detector of 5 5 μm pixel resolution the 10 80 μm particles were analyzed in transmission mode on a ø 13 mm 2 mm zinc selenide transmission window whereas 80 500 μm particles were scanned in reflection mode on a mirrir low e microscope reflection slide from kevley technologies samples were scanned in the spectral range of 3750 950 cm 1 at 8 cm 1 resolution applying 30 co added scans in both transmission and reflection mode the sample was homogenized with a vortexer and an aliquot corresponding to 2 6 of the sample was transferred onto either the transmission window or the reflection slide using disposable glass capillary pipettes samples were covered with a glass beaker and dried at 40 c on a heating plate and the area of the entire slide was scanned while representing a significant sub sampling corresponding to actual sample volumes between 0 14 and 4 05 l of treated wastewater the aliquots allowed quantification of 10 32 mp particles per sample in both treated and untreated wastewaters upon acquiring the infrared map which consisted of more than 3 million individual spectra organic particles were denoted by highlighting the aliphatic ch stretch fig 1 afterwards spectra of the highlighted organic particles were analyzed by comparing them to polymer spectra from commercial libraries using the knowitall software from bio rad and omnic 8 3 from thermo scientific at least 52 tiles in the arrangement of a double cross were examined for plastic particles approx 26 of the window or slide and a maximum of 98 tiles corresponding to half of the area of the window or slide identification was stopped when ten plastic particles were encountered or until the 98th tile was reached 2 4 mass calculation the major and minor dimensions of the identified mp particle were measured on the infrared image the major dimension was defined as the longest continuous axis in the center of the particle and the minor was the longest axis perpendicular to the major axis the ratio of the minor and major dimension of all the identified mp n 398 particles was calculated and yielded a median value of 0 67 0 22 it was assumed that the ratio of the thickness and the minor dimension of the particle was the same hence the thickness was estimated as 67 of the minor dimension the mass of the particle was calculated from the volume of the particle assuming an ellipsoid shape and the density of its material the volume of fibers was calculated presuming a cylindrical shape with 40 void fraction the density values of the identified polymers applied in the calculation are found in the supplementary material table s2 2 5 method validation 2 5 1 recovery recovery tests were performed with raw wastewater spiked with a known amount of red 100 μm ps beads sigma aldrich product no 56969 and with 80 150 μm green high density polyethylene hdpe particles of random shape supplementary material figure s1 the latter was produced by cryo milling a large piece of an hdpe water bottle and sieved to size fractions triplicate spiked samples were processed and the particles were extracted as described for raw wastewater extracted particles were transferred onto a glass microscope slide and since these particles had a distinct appearance they were identified and counted visually using a meiji techno mt4310 trinocular phase microscope 2 5 2 contamination precautions such as meticulous flushing of glassware before usage minimizing the application of plastic tools for sampling and analysis muffling of steel filters and covering glassware with aluminum foil were implemented to mitigate the contamination of samples nevertheless airborne contamination and contamination from tools will have occurred blanks were analyzed to assess the extent of contamination throughout the sample preparation procedure one liter of demineralized water filtered through 0 8 μm mixed cellulose ester filters was used as a model medium for this and triplicate samples were processed and analyzed as described for raw wastewater 2 5 3 statistical analysis normality of datasets was tested by a shapiro wilk normality test a non parametric anova kruskal wallis test by ranks was used to compare univariate groups both test types were performed in the software past v 3 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 method validation blank samples showed that each sample preparation gave rise to 2110 mp particles 84 μg of contamination per liter sample assuming that the demineralized water used for the contamination test was free of mp this contamination must have come from the equipment and the surrounding air during sample preparation for the raw wastewater this means that 16 3 of all the particles in raw wastewater regarding particle number and 28 4 regarding particle mass were associated with contamination these contamination levels are comparable to those of talvitie et al 2017 who reported 30 contamination of microlitter they might be above the contamination rates in mintenig et al 2017 reporting 21 particles and 130 fibers in 150 l tap water processed simultaneously to wastewater samples the limit of detection of mp in raw wastewater we determined from the blanks by the 3 sigma method to 89 μg l in terms of particle mass and 3093 particles l in terms of particle number mp concentration of raw wastewater consequently was below detection limit in the sample from wwtp 10 table 1 we did not explicitly quantify the contamination of the sample preparation for the treated wastewater as the preparation steps in the laboratory were nearly identical to those of the raw wastewater the concentration and polymer type of the identified mps in the three subsamples of blanks are shown in table s3 and the distribution of particle size in figure s3 in the supplementary material we performed recovery tests to evaluate the efficiency of the extraction method with triplicate raw wastewater samples spiked with ps microspheres and hdpe particles of irregular shape we recovered 77 7 11 6 of the ps microbeads and 57 6 25 1 of hdpe particles from the samples which we deemed acceptable the tendency to aggregation and overlapping of the hdpe particles could lead to their miscount which could explain the lower recovery and larger standard deviation compared to microbeads where aggregation and overlapping would not have affected the particle counting however the recovery rates are only indicative of the efficiency of the extraction method as the features of the mp particles used for spiking did not cover all the diversity of mp particles in the sample regarding their size material and shape therefore to avoid introducing an unknown bias data is not corrected for recovery 3 2 quantification of mps the concentration of mp regarding particle number and particle mass in the ten raw and treated wastewater samples along with the general removal efficiency of danish wwtps is presented in table 1 shapiro wilk normality tests showed that mp in units of number as well as mass were non normal distributed amongst wwtps mp numbers raw wastewater p 0 071 treat wastewater p 0 004 mp mass raw wastewater p 0 004 treat wastewater p 0 029 thus median values were considered to describe the overall concentrations of mp particles the median mp concentration of 7216 particles l and 54 particles l in influent and effluent wastewater respectively was high compared to previous studies magnusson and norén 2014 and murphy et al 2016 have reported approximately 15 particles l in influent wastewater the reported mp concentrations in effluent wastewater range from 6 10 3 particles l to 9 particles l in other studies magnusson and norén 2014 murphy et al 2016 mintenig et al 2017 talvitie et al 2017 the differences can be related to random natural variations among the studied treatment plants luo et al 2014 however this seems an unlikely explanation as our study covered ten individual wwtps and the previous studies also covered a significant number of wwtps more probable is that the variations in the number of detected particles were due to differences in size ranges addressed sampling sample preparation and in analytical methods ziajahromi et al 2016 our study focused on the smaller particle sizes and hence bound to find more particles per volume than studies that have addressed larger particle sizes it also applied an fpa detector for quantification which is likely to yield better estimates of especially the smallest particles than would single point ft ir tagg et al 2015 however the particle numbers of our study are also large compared to previous studies that applied fpas those studies did though use a somewhat higher pixel resolution and also a different substrate for the scanning whether or not these differences in quantification technique gave our study a better resolution of mp particles is however difficult to assess differences in sample preparation can also affect particle numbers for instance sonication steps during the sample preparation process could cause some particles to break up as especially aged particles can be brittle andrady 2011 and break due to ultrasonic treatment owing to the asserted mechanical stress on the particles löder and gerdts 2015 however the sample preparation method of our study has most likely been no more and no less harsh than that of other studies all in all we are of the opinion that the cause of the discrepancy between our and previous studies needs further investigation for example through inter laboratory comparison on identical samples and development of automated approaches for data analyses as suggested by primpke et al 2017 the removal efficiency of the wwtps did however correspond well with other studies and we also conclude that wwtps are efficient in retaining mps regarding particle number the determined efficiency was 99 3 previous studies showed over 98 removal efficiency regarding particle number carr et al 2016 magnusson and norén 2014 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017 with regards to particle mass 98 3 of the mp was removed in the wwtps the mass of mp particles in wastewater being it raw or treated has to our best knowledge not previously been reported and these values can hence not be compared to previous findings nevertheless high particle numbers do not necessarily mean that mp is a significant contributor to the total amount of suspended solids in raw wastewater as a high particle number is essentially not associated with high particle mass and vice versa comparing wwtp 5 and 6 raw wastewater table 1 illustrates this phenomenon well relating the particle numbers and masses to typical raw wastewater chemical oxygen demand cod and typical suspended solids ss 320 740 mg cod l and 190 450 mg ss l henze et al 1997 results in mp mass concentrations in raw wastewater of 7 80 10 4 3 37 10 4 mg mp mg cod and 1 31 10 3 5 55 10 4 mg mp mg ss respectively in other words mp accounts for roughly one thousandth of the raw wastewater constituent mass based on the total amount of wastewater in denmark 7 67 108 m3 year for 2015 mfvm 2017 and the median mp mass concentrations estimated in this study the sum of all danish wwtps receive approx 191 t mp over the course of one year the estimated mp load on the aquatic environment via the treated wastewater is slightly more than 3 t year to put it into context lassen et al 2015 estimated 600 3100 t year total mp emission in denmark indicating that wwtps are minor contributors to mp discharge relating the mp emission to the danish population approx 5 7 million yields an annual per capita emission from danish wwtps of 0 56 g mp capita year assuming that mp is not degraded in the wwtps the 188 t year mp removed from wastewater must have gathered in the sewage sludge of which in denmark roughly 70 is applied as agricultural fertilizer and 30 for energy recovery 3 3 polymer type of mps in raw and treated wastewater our research focused on the overall mp retention in the size range of 10 500 μm by wwtps in denmark since determining the material of such small particles with visual inspection is highly uncertain löder et al 2015 song et al 2015 an ft ir imaging technique was applied to identify the chemical composition of the examined particles however mp is a heterogeneous group of particles varying considerably in chemical composition size and shape and identification is not always straightforward even with the powerful tool of ft ir spectroscopy coupled with fpa imaging the diversity of particles was narrowed down by dividing the samples for ft ir imaging into suitable size ranges and applying scanning techniques optimized for each size range to improve the accuracy of identification however the quality of the acquired spectra regarding the resolution and intensity of the peaks varied that is because the variable shape and rough surface of the particles can result in light scattering causing baseline drift and noise interfering with spectral peaks see supplementary material furthermore residues of organic material attached to the particle surfaces or altered chemical composition of polymers caused by environmental impacts can hinder matching unknown spectra to those of commercial libraries and hence impede material identification andrady 2011 lenz et al 2015 vianello et al 2013 nevertheless as the sample preparation procedure described in this paper was efficient to remove the vast majority of the organic material in both raw and treated wastewater samples interference of organic matter with the particle s spectra was not a considerable obstacle in spectral identification with these caveats we could identify 176 particles as mps in the analyzed samples of raw wastewater and 222 of treated wastewater of these 393 were particles and 5 fibers the latter all were of polyester the number of particles of each identified polymer type in raw and treated wastewater is shown in table 2 fig 2 shows the distribution of polymers based on particle number and particle mass in raw and treated wastewater in raw wastewater based on particle number the most abundant type was acrylates 27 47 particles yet they contributed only 12 to the mass while pp contributed the most with 39 in treated wastewater pest 25 and pe 27 were the most abundant based on particle number while pest and acrylates contributed 34 and 20 respectively to the total mass of the identified particles and pe only 9 the reason for the different proportion of a polymer regarding particle number and mass can be related partly to the different density of polymers for instance pe particles were present in the highest number in treated wastewater but due to the lower density of pe table s2 compared to acrylates and pest the total mass of pe particles was lower than of the other two polymers another aspect is that the mass of a polymer type in the sample depends on both particle number and size in the case of the raw wastewaters pp particles contributed more to the mass than acrylates even though it consisted of fewer particles than the acrylates and the density of pp is lower than that of acrylates 3 4 size and mass of mps in fig 3 the major dimension of each particle from raw wastewater is shown against the particles minor dimension the size of the data points represents the calculated mass of the particles the figure reveals that the presence of one 200 300 μm sized pp particle with a considerable mass of 4 44 μg increased the mass fraction of this polymer type despite pp particles not being the most abundant they contributed the most to the total mass of mps which highlights the importance of describing mp concentrations not only by particle number but by plastic mass as well the method for calculating particle mass we present in this paper allows for estimating the mp mass in the sample rather than determining its absolute value for example identifying the margins of a particle on the ir image can be challenging as the quality of the ir spectra deteriorates gradually towards the edge of the particle without outlining a clear cut border further assumptions such as the extent of the particles third dimension their presumed ellipsoid shape for volume calculations and the applied density values are also associated with uncertainties of unknown degree while ir imaging techniques are suitable to estimate the mass of mp particles thermoanalytical techniques might have the potential to increase the accuracy of the plastic mass quantification dümichen et al 2015 fischer and scholz böttcher 2017 although particle size plays a fundamental role in mp research reporting this parameter alone seems inadequate and only gives an illustrative characterization of identified particles filella 2015 mps have been defined as plastic particles typically smaller than 5 mm in their diameter gesamp 2015 however mp particles are irregularly shaped meaning that describing their size with only one dimension can be insufficient and opens up data interpretation to bias for instance in the case of fibers which typically are rather long often several 100 of μm with small diameters 50 μm one dimension apparently cannot define size appropriately or provide sufficient information about its contribution to the total amount of mps in a sample therefore standard parameters already applied in colloid science could be used to obtain reliable and comparable data about the actual size of mp particles in a normalized manner filella 2015 merkus 2009 accordingly fig 4 a presents the particle size distribution based on the measured major dimension of the identified mp particles in raw wastewater the data for treated wastewater and raw wastewater based on the measured minor dimension can be found in the supplementary material figure s4 based on cozar et al 2014 we chose the increment of the bins to 0 1 on a logarithmic scale the figure also shows the abundance of particles normalized by the width of the size classes in microns the relative cumulative frequency of particles in raw and treated wastewater samples concerning major dimension is illustrated in fig 4b and figure s5 in the supplementary material regarding the minor dimension the figures show that the median minor dimension was 26 μm in raw and 30 μm in treated wastewater samples while the median major dimension was 48 μm and 45 μm in raw and treated wastewater samples respectively the d90 particle size in raw wastewater was 100 μm and 91 μm in treated wastewater regarding the major measured dimension meaning that smaller particles were more abundant in the samples a kruskal wallis test comparing the sizes of particles in inlet and outlet showed that the samples were not significantly different p 0 563 since the majority of mp particles originate from the breakdown of plastic fragments or larger plastic particles lassen et al 2015 higher abundance of smaller particles was expected another aspect is that larger volumes of wastewater than the volumes sampled in our study need to be collected to achieve a higher abundance of the larger particles mintenig et al 2017 reported that 59 of the mp particles in treated wastewater measured in their longest dimension ranged between 50 and 100 μm talvitie et al 2017 found 70 of particles in the range of 20 100 μm in effluent while approximately 40 of the same size range in influent wastewater unfortunately owing to the different size classes reported in the studies direct comparison of data is infeasible filella 2015 there was no significant difference between the mass of the identified particles in raw and treated wastewater samples kruskal wallis test p 0 778 the median particle mass was 13 45 ng and 13 52 ng of raw and treated wastewater samples respectively the non significant differences between inlet and outlet wastewater concerning particle size and mass indicate that there was no preferential removal of particles in the wwtps related to the size of the particles 4 conclusions our study has shown over 98 removal of 10 500 μm sized mp in danish wwtps the total annual mp discharge in this size range from the studied plants corresponded to approx 3 t year the mp discharge via wwtps related to the population of denmark was 0 56 g capita year and accounted for less than 0 5 of the total mp emission estimated for denmark this comparison to total emissions is though highly uncertain as the absence of harmonized sample treatment methods as well as data reporting currently impedes relating the significance of wwtps to other sources of mp our study is the first providing an estimate of the mass concentration of mp in wastewater and has pointed out the importance of describing mp by mass in addition to particle number we find mass concentrations to be a more robust measure less affected by differences in analytical procedures and targeted size ranges although fpa based ft ir imaging is a suitable technique to identify the material of particles in the micrometer size range it only allows for the rough estimation of the mp mass determination of microplastics would benefit from being supplemented by other methods e g thermoanalytical techniques to increase the certainty of measuring mp mass applying mp mass as the conserved base of mp quantification along with standardized sample treatment and analytical methods would enable to apprehend the extent of mp pollution and consistently compare sources and occurrence in the environment such knowledge allows for example the comparison of source strengths so that appropriate measures to decrease mp emission can be assessed and implemented acknowledgements we thank krüger a s aviaja a hansen for organizing the sampling

19457,this paper presents a method for microplastic mp mass quantification using a focal plane array based fourier transform infrared imaging technique it discusses the issue that particle number is not a conserved base quantity and hence less suited than mass to compare independent studies on mp in the environment it concludes that mp mass should be included when quantifying mp pollution in the environment supplementing the conventional approach of reporting particle numbers applying mass as the unit of mp measurement the paper presents data showing that danish wastewater treatment plants discharge around 3 t year of mp in the size range 10 500 μm this value corresponds to an annual per capita emission from these plants of 0 56 g mp capita year the distribution of polymer types by mass and particle number differed because the size of mp particles of the different material types varied graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic mass quantification wastewater treatment plants ft ir spectroscopy 1 introduction plastic is a versatile material which can be manufactured to suit multifarious applications making its usage unavoidable in modern life andrady 2011 the ever growing use of these artificial polymers however entails the increase of plastic litter due to the persistent nature of the material thompson et al 2004 the improper disposal of plastic waste has led to its widespread presence in the environment van cauwenberghe et al 2013 villarrubia gómez et al 2017 where the long term ubiquity of plastic litter poses various threats to different ecosystems and organisms at all trophic levels barnes et al 2009 browne et al 2011 the environmental impact and fate of plastic particles smaller than 5 mm called microplastics mp in particular has been the focus of interest for more than a decade hidalgo ruz et al 2013 based on the origin of the particles two types of mp are commonly distinguished primary mp is used as raw material in the production of plastic items and additives in cosmetic products whereas secondary mp is formed by the physical or photo oxidative breakdown of larger plastic items andrady 2011 both primary and secondary mp has been found in the marine environment as well as in freshwater systems mp particles are considered potentially harmful environmental contaminants by acting as vectors for organic pollutants and heavy metals or by causing physical harm to organisms upon ingestion cole et al 2011 although the exact and most significant sources of mp are yet to be discovered wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been found to be one of the urban sources releasing mp studies have shown that despite the high retention of mp in wwtps a considerable number of these particles enters the environment due to the high flux of wastewater murphy et al 2016 the mp research field has so far not established standardized analytical methods which is a significant obstacle in studying the occurrence of mp pollution in the environment although some studies have proposed techniques as standard procedures andrady 2011 hidalgo ruz et al 2013 löder et al 2015 a scientific consensus is yet to be reached in all aspects of mp research from sampling to data interpretation owing to the different methodologies the results of some studies can be difficult to compare creating uncertainties over the fate and impact of mp in the environment löder et al 2015 quantification of mp has focused on identifying particle numbers and sizes as impacts and behavior of mp is strongly linked to these parameters andrady 2011 however particle number data cannot be adequately compared with estimates of mp mass loads such as for example the one by lassen et al 2015 who estimated the danish mp discharge based on information on plastic use and wear owing to the brittle nature of mp particles aged in the environment andrady 2011 the incidental fragmentation of mp particles can affect particle number and result in a potential overestimation of their concentrations to varying degrees furthermore particle number cannot alone describe the extent of mp pollution as the size of these particles spans a range three orders of magnitudes wide for example a cubical particle of 1 mm side length takes up equal space in the environmental matrix as one billion cubical particles with 1 μm side length as particle volume comes in the third power of particle dimensions the fact that particles continuously break up in the environment andrady 2011 and can fragment during mp analysis entails that particle number cannot be viewed as a conserved base quantity mass opposed to particle number is a conserved base quantity and as such a consistent measure unaffected by the physical and chemical processes to which the mp is exposed supplementing determination of mp numbers by the mass of mp therefore would allow for the experimental quantification of mp loads to the environment and a direct comparison of the contribution from different sources rocha santos and duarte 2015 despite the apparent advantages of including mass as a measure of mp concentration it has to our best knowledge not been systematically estimated and reported in peer reviewed mp studies applying ft ir fourier transform infrared spectroscopy or similar quantification techniques plastic mass has been measured applying pyrolysis techniques for example with the purpose of quantifying car tire rubber unice et al 2013 additionally several studies have been conducted to assess the mass load to various environments based on theoretical considerations and information on plastic use and wear for example lassen et al 2015 sundt et al 2014 one objective of our study was to present a procedure to estimate the mass of mp in wastewater applying an ft ir based technique allowing both mass and particle number to be determined on the same samples we further aimed to gather information about the overall mp loads in typical danish municipal wastewater and discharges from the associated wwtps we sampled inlet and outlet wastewater at ten of the largest wwtps in denmark and assessed the mean mp load and mean removal efficiency of the wwtps we extracted particles in the size range of 10 500 μm from wastewater samples analyzed their material composition with a focal plane array fpa based ft ir imaging technique and estimated the mass of the identified mp particles 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling raw and treated wastewater was collected flow proportionally from 10 of the largest wwtps in denmark managing 26 of all danish wastewater mfvm 2017 nine of the examined wwtps manage wastewater mainly from households while one receives wastewater of 75 industrial origin wwtp 4 supplementary material table s1 all wwtps do biological n and p removal based on activated sludge technologies one of the plants wwtp 8 had rapid sand filtration as an additional polishing step samples were taken during dry weather defined as a maximum of 3 mm of precipitation for 48 h before and during sampling raw wastewater was collected from the inlet as flow proportional samples covering 24 h of inflow applying the auto samplers of the wwtps the samplers were all permanently installed after the screens and accredited for sampling of raw wastewater for monitoring and compliance purposes it was chosen to use the accredited sampling devices at the wwtps as these are certified to yield representative samples of the raw wastewater inflow while it is not ideal to use samplers containing plastic parts it was deemed a better alternative than taking grab samples at locations where representativeness of samples could not be ensured possible contamination by the auto samplers was not assessed as this was not practically feasible with the already installed samplers one liter of raw wastewater was subsampled at each wwtp and shipped for mp analysis treated wastewater was collected in glass bottles from the outlet flow and filtered on site through 10 μm ø47 mm stainless steel meshes until three filters had clogged the filtered effluent varied for each location depending on water quality from 4 1 to 81 5 l per site supplementary material table s1 except for the auto samplers at the treatment plants all equipment used for sampling was either metal or glass the wwtps are anonymized as only one inlet and outlet sample was taken from each plant the variability between sampling days is hence not quantified and the data not necessarily representative of that plant furthermore it is assumed that the two times ten wastewater samples could be viewed as random samples drawn from the same set raw and treated wastewater and that it hence is valid to combine them for further calculations regarding mp removal efficiency and material composition 2 2 extraction of microplastics 2 2 1 raw wastewater 1 l raw wastewater was wet sieved with a retsch as 200 vibratory sieve shaker through 2 mm 1 mm and 500 μm sieve meshes to eliminate particles and fibers larger than 500 μm sodium dodecyl sulfate sds as a surfactant was added to a final concentration of 0 15 g l before sieving to detach adhered mp particles from the larger solids enders et al 2015 afterwards 200 ml of the pre sieved wastewater was incubated with cellulase enzyme aspergillus sp sigma aldrich cas no 9012 54 8 for 48 h at 40 c to degrade cellulose fibers deriving mainly from toilet paper subsequently organic material was oxidized with hydrogen peroxide where iron ii was added to catalyze the reaction fenton reaction peroxide was added to a final concentration of 250 g l and iron ii sulfate to 2 5 g l masura et al 2015 temperature ph and the ratio of peroxide to ferrous ions are key factors to ensure maximum removal of organic matter babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 gulkaya et al 2006 the ph of the mixture was adjusted to approximately 3 with sodium hydroxide as the formation of complex species of ferric or ferrous ions reduce the amount of free iron ii ions and decelerate the reaction at ph values below 2 and above 4 babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 the reactor was kept in an ice bath to keep the temperature between 15 and 30 c as the oxidation reaction is exothermic and the mixture can boil violently keeping the designated temperature interval was critical as a yellow colored substance probably a ferric compound tended to precipitate at temperatures below 15 c subsequently the oxidized sample was wet sieved demineralized water with 0 15 g l sds into two size fractions through an 80 μm sieve mesh the effluent containing particles 80 μm was collected into a glass beaker particles 80 μm were removed from the sieve mesh into filtered demineralized water containing 0 15 g l sds by treatment in an elma s50r ultrasonic bath particles from this liquid and the collected effluent were gathered on separate 10 μm steel meshes particles were removed from the filters into 25 ml hplc grade ethanol by ultrasonic treatment the resulting particle ethanol suspensions of the two size fractions were transferred into glass vials where their final volume was set to 5 ml by evaporation with nitrogen gas 2 2 2 treated wastewater the collected solids were removed by ultrasonic treatment from the 10 μm steel filters used for sampling in the wwtp and collected in filtered demineralized water containing 0 15 g l sds the resulting suspension was incubated in a serum flask for 48 h at 40 c with the same cellulase enzyme used for raw wastewater samples were oxidized in 180 g l hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by 1 8 g l iron ii sulfate and ph adjusted to approximately three by sodium hydroxide the rest of the sample preparation was identical to that of raw wastewater i e size fractionation by wet sieving and transferring the particle ethanol suspension into glass vials 2 3 analysis the chemical composition of the extracted particles was determined with an fpa based ft ir imaging technique the equipment was a cary 620 ft ir microscope from agilent technologies coupled with a cary 670 ir spectroscope the microscope was equipped with 15x cassegrain objective and a 128 128 mercury cadmium telluride mct fpa detector of 5 5 μm pixel resolution the 10 80 μm particles were analyzed in transmission mode on a ø 13 mm 2 mm zinc selenide transmission window whereas 80 500 μm particles were scanned in reflection mode on a mirrir low e microscope reflection slide from kevley technologies samples were scanned in the spectral range of 3750 950 cm 1 at 8 cm 1 resolution applying 30 co added scans in both transmission and reflection mode the sample was homogenized with a vortexer and an aliquot corresponding to 2 6 of the sample was transferred onto either the transmission window or the reflection slide using disposable glass capillary pipettes samples were covered with a glass beaker and dried at 40 c on a heating plate and the area of the entire slide was scanned while representing a significant sub sampling corresponding to actual sample volumes between 0 14 and 4 05 l of treated wastewater the aliquots allowed quantification of 10 32 mp particles per sample in both treated and untreated wastewaters upon acquiring the infrared map which consisted of more than 3 million individual spectra organic particles were denoted by highlighting the aliphatic ch stretch fig 1 afterwards spectra of the highlighted organic particles were analyzed by comparing them to polymer spectra from commercial libraries using the knowitall software from bio rad and omnic 8 3 from thermo scientific at least 52 tiles in the arrangement of a double cross were examined for plastic particles approx 26 of the window or slide and a maximum of 98 tiles corresponding to half of the area of the window or slide identification was stopped when ten plastic particles were encountered or until the 98th tile was reached 2 4 mass calculation the major and minor dimensions of the identified mp particle were measured on the infrared image the major dimension was defined as the longest continuous axis in the center of the particle and the minor was the longest axis perpendicular to the major axis the ratio of the minor and major dimension of all the identified mp n 398 particles was calculated and yielded a median value of 0 67 0 22 it was assumed that the ratio of the thickness and the minor dimension of the particle was the same hence the thickness was estimated as 67 of the minor dimension the mass of the particle was calculated from the volume of the particle assuming an ellipsoid shape and the density of its material the volume of fibers was calculated presuming a cylindrical shape with 40 void fraction the density values of the identified polymers applied in the calculation are found in the supplementary material table s2 2 5 method validation 2 5 1 recovery recovery tests were performed with raw wastewater spiked with a known amount of red 100 μm ps beads sigma aldrich product no 56969 and with 80 150 μm green high density polyethylene hdpe particles of random shape supplementary material figure s1 the latter was produced by cryo milling a large piece of an hdpe water bottle and sieved to size fractions triplicate spiked samples were processed and the particles were extracted as described for raw wastewater extracted particles were transferred onto a glass microscope slide and since these particles had a distinct appearance they were identified and counted visually using a meiji techno mt4310 trinocular phase microscope 2 5 2 contamination precautions such as meticulous flushing of glassware before usage minimizing the application of plastic tools for sampling and analysis muffling of steel filters and covering glassware with aluminum foil were implemented to mitigate the contamination of samples nevertheless airborne contamination and contamination from tools will have occurred blanks were analyzed to assess the extent of contamination throughout the sample preparation procedure one liter of demineralized water filtered through 0 8 μm mixed cellulose ester filters was used as a model medium for this and triplicate samples were processed and analyzed as described for raw wastewater 2 5 3 statistical analysis normality of datasets was tested by a shapiro wilk normality test a non parametric anova kruskal wallis test by ranks was used to compare univariate groups both test types were performed in the software past v 3 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 method validation blank samples showed that each sample preparation gave rise to 2110 mp particles 84 μg of contamination per liter sample assuming that the demineralized water used for the contamination test was free of mp this contamination must have come from the equipment and the surrounding air during sample preparation for the raw wastewater this means that 16 3 of all the particles in raw wastewater regarding particle number and 28 4 regarding particle mass were associated with contamination these contamination levels are comparable to those of talvitie et al 2017 who reported 30 contamination of microlitter they might be above the contamination rates in mintenig et al 2017 reporting 21 particles and 130 fibers in 150 l tap water processed simultaneously to wastewater samples the limit of detection of mp in raw wastewater we determined from the blanks by the 3 sigma method to 89 μg l in terms of particle mass and 3093 particles l in terms of particle number mp concentration of raw wastewater consequently was below detection limit in the sample from wwtp 10 table 1 we did not explicitly quantify the contamination of the sample preparation for the treated wastewater as the preparation steps in the laboratory were nearly identical to those of the raw wastewater the concentration and polymer type of the identified mps in the three subsamples of blanks are shown in table s3 and the distribution of particle size in figure s3 in the supplementary material we performed recovery tests to evaluate the efficiency of the extraction method with triplicate raw wastewater samples spiked with ps microspheres and hdpe particles of irregular shape we recovered 77 7 11 6 of the ps microbeads and 57 6 25 1 of hdpe particles from the samples which we deemed acceptable the tendency to aggregation and overlapping of the hdpe particles could lead to their miscount which could explain the lower recovery and larger standard deviation compared to microbeads where aggregation and overlapping would not have affected the particle counting however the recovery rates are only indicative of the efficiency of the extraction method as the features of the mp particles used for spiking did not cover all the diversity of mp particles in the sample regarding their size material and shape therefore to avoid introducing an unknown bias data is not corrected for recovery 3 2 quantification of mps the concentration of mp regarding particle number and particle mass in the ten raw and treated wastewater samples along with the general removal efficiency of danish wwtps is presented in table 1 shapiro wilk normality tests showed that mp in units of number as well as mass were non normal distributed amongst wwtps mp numbers raw wastewater p 0 071 treat wastewater p 0 004 mp mass raw wastewater p 0 004 treat wastewater p 0 029 thus median values were considered to describe the overall concentrations of mp particles the median mp concentration of 7216 particles l and 54 particles l in influent and effluent wastewater respectively was high compared to previous studies magnusson and norén 2014 and murphy et al 2016 have reported approximately 15 particles l in influent wastewater the reported mp concentrations in effluent wastewater range from 6 10 3 particles l to 9 particles l in other studies magnusson and norén 2014 murphy et al 2016 mintenig et al 2017 talvitie et al 2017 the differences can be related to random natural variations among the studied treatment plants luo et al 2014 however this seems an unlikely explanation as our study covered ten individual wwtps and the previous studies also covered a significant number of wwtps more probable is that the variations in the number of detected particles were due to differences in size ranges addressed sampling sample preparation and in analytical methods ziajahromi et al 2016 our study focused on the smaller particle sizes and hence bound to find more particles per volume than studies that have addressed larger particle sizes it also applied an fpa detector for quantification which is likely to yield better estimates of especially the smallest particles than would single point ft ir tagg et al 2015 however the particle numbers of our study are also large compared to previous studies that applied fpas those studies did though use a somewhat higher pixel resolution and also a different substrate for the scanning whether or not these differences in quantification technique gave our study a better resolution of mp particles is however difficult to assess differences in sample preparation can also affect particle numbers for instance sonication steps during the sample preparation process could cause some particles to break up as especially aged particles can be brittle andrady 2011 and break due to ultrasonic treatment owing to the asserted mechanical stress on the particles löder and gerdts 2015 however the sample preparation method of our study has most likely been no more and no less harsh than that of other studies all in all we are of the opinion that the cause of the discrepancy between our and previous studies needs further investigation for example through inter laboratory comparison on identical samples and development of automated approaches for data analyses as suggested by primpke et al 2017 the removal efficiency of the wwtps did however correspond well with other studies and we also conclude that wwtps are efficient in retaining mps regarding particle number the determined efficiency was 99 3 previous studies showed over 98 removal efficiency regarding particle number carr et al 2016 magnusson and norén 2014 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017 with regards to particle mass 98 3 of the mp was removed in the wwtps the mass of mp particles in wastewater being it raw or treated has to our best knowledge not previously been reported and these values can hence not be compared to previous findings nevertheless high particle numbers do not necessarily mean that mp is a significant contributor to the total amount of suspended solids in raw wastewater as a high particle number is essentially not associated with high particle mass and vice versa comparing wwtp 5 and 6 raw wastewater table 1 illustrates this phenomenon well relating the particle numbers and masses to typical raw wastewater chemical oxygen demand cod and typical suspended solids ss 320 740 mg cod l and 190 450 mg ss l henze et al 1997 results in mp mass concentrations in raw wastewater of 7 80 10 4 3 37 10 4 mg mp mg cod and 1 31 10 3 5 55 10 4 mg mp mg ss respectively in other words mp accounts for roughly one thousandth of the raw wastewater constituent mass based on the total amount of wastewater in denmark 7 67 108 m3 year for 2015 mfvm 2017 and the median mp mass concentrations estimated in this study the sum of all danish wwtps receive approx 191 t mp over the course of one year the estimated mp load on the aquatic environment via the treated wastewater is slightly more than 3 t year to put it into context lassen et al 2015 estimated 600 3100 t year total mp emission in denmark indicating that wwtps are minor contributors to mp discharge relating the mp emission to the danish population approx 5 7 million yields an annual per capita emission from danish wwtps of 0 56 g mp capita year assuming that mp is not degraded in the wwtps the 188 t year mp removed from wastewater must have gathered in the sewage sludge of which in denmark roughly 70 is applied as agricultural fertilizer and 30 for energy recovery 3 3 polymer type of mps in raw and treated wastewater our research focused on the overall mp retention in the size range of 10 500 μm by wwtps in denmark since determining the material of such small particles with visual inspection is highly uncertain löder et al 2015 song et al 2015 an ft ir imaging technique was applied to identify the chemical composition of the examined particles however mp is a heterogeneous group of particles varying considerably in chemical composition size and shape and identification is not always straightforward even with the powerful tool of ft ir spectroscopy coupled with fpa imaging the diversity of particles was narrowed down by dividing the samples for ft ir imaging into suitable size ranges and applying scanning techniques optimized for each size range to improve the accuracy of identification however the quality of the acquired spectra regarding the resolution and intensity of the peaks varied that is because the variable shape and rough surface of the particles can result in light scattering causing baseline drift and noise interfering with spectral peaks see supplementary material furthermore residues of organic material attached to the particle surfaces or altered chemical composition of polymers caused by environmental impacts can hinder matching unknown spectra to those of commercial libraries and hence impede material identification andrady 2011 lenz et al 2015 vianello et al 2013 nevertheless as the sample preparation procedure described in this paper was efficient to remove the vast majority of the organic material in both raw and treated wastewater samples interference of organic matter with the particle s spectra was not a considerable obstacle in spectral identification with these caveats we could identify 176 particles as mps in the analyzed samples of raw wastewater and 222 of treated wastewater of these 393 were particles and 5 fibers the latter all were of polyester the number of particles of each identified polymer type in raw and treated wastewater is shown in table 2 fig 2 shows the distribution of polymers based on particle number and particle mass in raw and treated wastewater in raw wastewater based on particle number the most abundant type was acrylates 27 47 particles yet they contributed only 12 to the mass while pp contributed the most with 39 in treated wastewater pest 25 and pe 27 were the most abundant based on particle number while pest and acrylates contributed 34 and 20 respectively to the total mass of the identified particles and pe only 9 the reason for the different proportion of a polymer regarding particle number and mass can be related partly to the different density of polymers for instance pe particles were present in the highest number in treated wastewater but due to the lower density of pe table s2 compared to acrylates and pest the total mass of pe particles was lower than of the other two polymers another aspect is that the mass of a polymer type in the sample depends on both particle number and size in the case of the raw wastewaters pp particles contributed more to the mass than acrylates even though it consisted of fewer particles than the acrylates and the density of pp is lower than that of acrylates 3 4 size and mass of mps in fig 3 the major dimension of each particle from raw wastewater is shown against the particles minor dimension the size of the data points represents the calculated mass of the particles the figure reveals that the presence of one 200 300 μm sized pp particle with a considerable mass of 4 44 μg increased the mass fraction of this polymer type despite pp particles not being the most abundant they contributed the most to the total mass of mps which highlights the importance of describing mp concentrations not only by particle number but by plastic mass as well the method for calculating particle mass we present in this paper allows for estimating the mp mass in the sample rather than determining its absolute value for example identifying the margins of a particle on the ir image can be challenging as the quality of the ir spectra deteriorates gradually towards the edge of the particle without outlining a clear cut border further assumptions such as the extent of the particles third dimension their presumed ellipsoid shape for volume calculations and the applied density values are also associated with uncertainties of unknown degree while ir imaging techniques are suitable to estimate the mass of mp particles thermoanalytical techniques might have the potential to increase the accuracy of the plastic mass quantification dümichen et al 2015 fischer and scholz böttcher 2017 although particle size plays a fundamental role in mp research reporting this parameter alone seems inadequate and only gives an illustrative characterization of identified particles filella 2015 mps have been defined as plastic particles typically smaller than 5 mm in their diameter gesamp 2015 however mp particles are irregularly shaped meaning that describing their size with only one dimension can be insufficient and opens up data interpretation to bias for instance in the case of fibers which typically are rather long often several 100 of μm with small diameters 50 μm one dimension apparently cannot define size appropriately or provide sufficient information about its contribution to the total amount of mps in a sample therefore standard parameters already applied in colloid science could be used to obtain reliable and comparable data about the actual size of mp particles in a normalized manner filella 2015 merkus 2009 accordingly fig 4 a presents the particle size distribution based on the measured major dimension of the identified mp particles in raw wastewater the data for treated wastewater and raw wastewater based on the measured minor dimension can be found in the supplementary material figure s4 based on cozar et al 2014 we chose the increment of the bins to 0 1 on a logarithmic scale the figure also shows the abundance of particles normalized by the width of the size classes in microns the relative cumulative frequency of particles in raw and treated wastewater samples concerning major dimension is illustrated in fig 4b and figure s5 in the supplementary material regarding the minor dimension the figures show that the median minor dimension was 26 μm in raw and 30 μm in treated wastewater samples while the median major dimension was 48 μm and 45 μm in raw and treated wastewater samples respectively the d90 particle size in raw wastewater was 100 μm and 91 μm in treated wastewater regarding the major measured dimension meaning that smaller particles were more abundant in the samples a kruskal wallis test comparing the sizes of particles in inlet and outlet showed that the samples were not significantly different p 0 563 since the majority of mp particles originate from the breakdown of plastic fragments or larger plastic particles lassen et al 2015 higher abundance of smaller particles was expected another aspect is that larger volumes of wastewater than the volumes sampled in our study need to be collected to achieve a higher abundance of the larger particles mintenig et al 2017 reported that 59 of the mp particles in treated wastewater measured in their longest dimension ranged between 50 and 100 μm talvitie et al 2017 found 70 of particles in the range of 20 100 μm in effluent while approximately 40 of the same size range in influent wastewater unfortunately owing to the different size classes reported in the studies direct comparison of data is infeasible filella 2015 there was no significant difference between the mass of the identified particles in raw and treated wastewater samples kruskal wallis test p 0 778 the median particle mass was 13 45 ng and 13 52 ng of raw and treated wastewater samples respectively the non significant differences between inlet and outlet wastewater concerning particle size and mass indicate that there was no preferential removal of particles in the wwtps related to the size of the particles 4 conclusions our study has shown over 98 removal of 10 500 μm sized mp in danish wwtps the total annual mp discharge in this size range from the studied plants corresponded to approx 3 t year the mp discharge via wwtps related to the population of denmark was 0 56 g capita year and accounted for less than 0 5 of the total mp emission estimated for denmark this comparison to total emissions is though highly uncertain as the absence of harmonized sample treatment methods as well as data reporting currently impedes relating the significance of wwtps to other sources of mp our study is the first providing an estimate of the mass concentration of mp in wastewater and has pointed out the importance of describing mp by mass in addition to particle number we find mass concentrations to be a more robust measure less affected by differences in analytical procedures and targeted size ranges although fpa based ft ir imaging is a suitable technique to identify the material of particles in the micrometer size range it only allows for the rough estimation of the mp mass determination of microplastics would benefit from being supplemented by other methods e g thermoanalytical techniques to increase the certainty of measuring mp mass applying mp mass as the conserved base of mp quantification along with standardized sample treatment and analytical methods would enable to apprehend the extent of mp pollution and consistently compare sources and occurrence in the environment such knowledge allows for example the comparison of source strengths so that appropriate measures to decrease mp emission can be assessed and implemented acknowledgements we thank krüger a s aviaja a hansen for organizing the sampling

19458,to address the issues of eutrophication and the potential risk of phosphorus p shortage it is essential to remove and recover p from p containing streams to close this nutrient cycle electrochemical induced calcium phosphate cap precipitation was shown to be an efficient method for p recovery however the influence of natural organic matter nom is not known for this treatment in this paper the behavior of nom and its effect on cap precipitation was studied in contrast to studies where nom hindered cap precipitation results show that the interaction of nom with cap improves the removal of p independent of the types of nom the p removal at the average increased from 43 8 4 9 to 58 5 1 2 in the presence of 1 0 mg l 1 nom based on the yellow color of the cap product nom is co precipitated the bulk solution ph with and without buffers has totally different effects on the precipitation process without buffer cap precipitates on the cathode surface in a wide ph range ph 4 0 10 0 however the precipitation process is completely inhibited when the bulk solution is buffered at ph 4 0 and 6 0 this is probably due to neutralization of oh by the buffers regardless of the presence or absence of nom and solution ph the recovered products are mainly amorphous cap unless the electrolysis time was increased to seven days with 4 0 a m 2 in which crystalline cap formed these findings advance our understanding on the interaction of ca p and nom species for the application of electrochemical method for p recovery from real wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords natural organic matter calcium phosphate electrochemical precipitation buffer co precipitation 1 introduction phosphorus p plays an essential role for all living organisms desmidt et al 2014 p fertilizers are also needed to secure food production however the diminishing reserves of p rock are not adapted to the growing demand of p elser and bennett 2011 reijnders 2014 indeed on the one hand p can be a scarce resource in the future on the other hand plenty of p containing waste streams are discharged to water bodies resulting in an environmental catastrophe namely eutrophication elser and bennett 2011 however if we can recover the lost p and re use it as a constituent in fertilizer this can reduce the risk of p shortage and alleviate eutrophication problems mayer et al 2016 various methods including enhanced biological phosphorus removal tervahauta et al 2014 cunha et al 2018b adsorption kumar et al 2017 and chemical precipitation have been applied to remove p from waste streams among them the most common way is chemical precipitation because of its easy operation and efficiency ye et al 2017 for the sake of re use the chemical precipitation method has shifted from using fe and al salts which produce hardly bio reusable p salts to struvite mgnh4po4 and calcium phosphate cap which can be used as a slow release fertilizer or as raw materials for the fertilizer industry respectively tervahauta et al 2014 hao et al 2013 hug and udert 2013 previous studies indicate that the concentrations of the associated lattice ions and ph affect the removal performance of p since these variables determine the driving force for the precipitation of a species in chemical precipitation process song et al 2002 shih et al 2017 on the basis of this a variety of mg or ca sources such as natural brucite hovelmann and putnis 2016 building waste yang et al 2016 and steel slag barca et al 2012 had been applied to achieve efficient and cost effective p removal the advantage of these mg or ca sources is that they not only provide mg2 or ca2 but also able to increase solution ph particularly the membrane containing electrochemical system which can enrich phosphate concentration and increase solution ph simultaneously receives a lot of attention zhang et al 2013 kappel et al 2013 xie et al 2014 qiu et al 2015 however the associated fouling issues of membranes remain a challenge the inspiring point however is that several studies showed the possibility of a membrane free system for p removal and recovery wang et al 2010 cusick and logan 2012 lei et al 2017 recently reported an efficient membrane free system which induces cap precipitation at the cathode surface over a wide ph range it was proposed that the production of hydroxide ions on the surface of the titanium cathode through water electrolysis is responsible for p precipitation in the tests described in lei et al 2017 calcium nitrate and sodium phosphate in a background matrix of sodium sulfate in milliq 18 2 mω cm water was used further assessment of the applicability of the membrane free system requires adding other components that could be naturally present and that may interfere with the precipitation of cap previous non electrochemical studies have shown that both mg2 and carbonate inhibit cap precipitation by replacing lattice ca and decreasing free ca by complexation respectively cao and harris 2007 hermassi et al 2016 cunha et al 2018a in particular it was reported that natural organic matter nom inhibits the precipitation of cap by decreasing free aqueous ca ions and blocking nucleation sites song et al 2006 cao et al 2007 sindelar et al 2015 nom is a complex matrix of heterogeneous mixture of organic compounds matilainen et al 2010 and coexists with ca and p in every aquatic and soil system sindelar et al 2015 the complex structure and functional groups of nom allows ion exchange and complexation hahn et al 2017 and thereby may interact with lattice ions and thence influence cap precipitation however the interaction of nom on cap precipitation in electrochemical systems to our knowledge has not been studied nor the effect of nom from different sources or the combined effect of nom and solution ph on cap precipitation electrochemical induced cap precipitation depends on the local chemical environment near the cathode surface it is also known from literature that though nom in general shows inhibiting effects on cap precipitation in conventional chemical precipitation process the negative role can be overcome by increasing solution ph song et al 2006 sindelar et al 2015 since the electrochemical system can create a high local ph by oh production at the vicinity of the cathode the negative effects of nom may be eliminated in this system the objective of this study is to elucidate the influence of nom on cap precipitation in the electrochemical system specifically we studied the effects of nom from different sources at different ph conditions we also investigated the effect of electrolysis time on the electrochemical interaction of ca p and nom and the associated impact on chemical and physical properties of precipitates 2

electrode the constant current condition was provided by a potentiostat vertex ivium technologies the netherlands the cathode is a pure ti disc ø 8 0 cm thickness 0 1 cm grade a and is perpendicularly welded to a 12 cm long rod ø 0 3 cm the anode has the same design as the cathode and was coated with 10 g m2 ru ir the total solution in the electrochemical cell 800 ml is circulated with a pump at a flow rate of 70 ml min 2 3 batch experiments for preparation of the test solutions we used stock solutions of ca2 0 4 m and p po4 0 24 m to obtain final concentrations of 1 0 mm total ca and 0 6 mm p in this paper we used the term p to represent all soluble phosphorus species in the bulk solution in all batch tests we added 50 mm na2so4 to maintain the electrolyte conductivity we first chose nom1 as the typical reference nom and investigated its effect on cap precipitation in the range of 1 0 10 0 mg l 1 and subsequently studied the effects of nom sources we also examined the effects of ph in buffered and unbuffered solutions on p recovery we performed all the electrochemical experiments at a constant current density 4 0 a m 2 for 24 h at room temperature all the tests were at least done in duplicate the data is shown as mean plus standard deviation solids on the cathode surface were collected and dried at room temperature it should be noted that the solid precipitates were not washed with milliq 18 2 mω cm water in preventing of potential dissolution or recrystallization of precipitates 2 4 analysis the soluble ca and p concentrations were analysed by icp aes noms were

supersaturation index si of the possible species in the bulk solution the si is defined as eq 1 1 si log iap k sp where iap is the thermodynamic solubility product and ksp is the ion activity of the associated lattice ions 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of addition of nom we started our experiments with comparing p removal in the presence and the absence of nom1 experiments were run for 24 h fig 2 a shows the effect of 5 0 mg l 1 nom1 on ca and p removal at an initial ph 8 0 established after all chemicals in the presence of 5 0 mg l 1 nom1 the removal efficiency of ca and p increased by 14 6 and 16 9 respectively in comparison to the removal of ca and p in the absence of nom in contrast to results found for non electrochemical cap precipitation where an inhibitory effect of nom on cap precipitation was observed cao et al 2007 sindelar et al 2015 the lack of inhibition by nom on the removal of p in our system is probably due to the fact that the precipitation occurs in a local region where the ph is high enough to overcome the negative influence of nom indeed it is known from literature that nom shows negligible inhibition on both struvite and cap precipitation under strong alkaline conditions ph 9 0 song et al 2006 sindelar et al 2015 in the electrochemical system a local high ph at the vicinity of the ti cathode can be created through water reduction 2h2o 2e 2oh h2 as a result ca and p ions precipitate as solid cap phase even in the presence of nom this still does not explain why nom improves the precipitation of cap on the cathode one of the reasons could be that nom provides binding sites for ca once nom co precipitates with cap nuclei which are precursors of stable calcium phosphate particles nom due to its multi functional groups such as carboxyl group can easily adsorb ca2 the used nom1 has a charge density of 11 21 meq g carbon at ph 8 0 according to the data provided by ihss ritchie and perdue 2003 with 5 mg l 1 nom1 carbon content 50 7 theoretically only 0 0284 meq could be available for binding ca2 which accounts for 1 4 of 1 0 mm ca2 from this perspective the nom seemingly not play a role on complexation with ca however the charge density of humic substance increases systematically with ph once being adsorbed to the formed calcium phosphate and in contact with the local high ph the nom1 may able to further interact with the phosphate in this way the co precipitated nom enhanced the removal of p also it is reported that nom can react with electrons from the cathode or with h2 formed at the cathode surface rajic et al 2015 in our system the nom may work similarly once being adsorbed to the cathode surface the nom may interact with the ca2 and phosphate in the bulk solution and thus enhance the removal of p perassi and borgnino 2014 investigated the effect of humic acid on phosphate adsorption by calcite coated montmorillonite it was found that the order of adding humic acid and phosphate affects the adsorption significantly when humic acid and phosphate were added simultaneously or humic acid firstly the adsorption of phosphate on calcite coated montmorillonite was lower compared to the values observed in the absence of humic acid however when phosphate was added first the adsorption of phosphate on calcite coated montmorillonite increases when humic acid was added perassi and borgnino 2014 it was proposed that humic acid improves the adsorption of p onto calcite coated montmorillonite by preventing precipitation of cap in bulk solution the same mechanism may apply to our system as well indeed nom may prevent cap precipitation in the bulk solution through complexation with ca and enhance the removal of p in the presence of 1 0 mm ca and 0 6 mm phosphate at ph 8 0 the solution is already supersaturated though no visible precipitation can be noticed table s1 shows in the absence of nom at least four calcium phosphate species are saturated including amorphous calcium phosphate acp si 0 382 beta ca3 po4 2 si 1 052 ca4h po4 3 3h2o si 0 046 and hydroxyapatite hap si 8 634 this suggests that the ca may already form metastable phase with phosphate but due to kinetic reasons or surface tension that needs to be overcame did not precipitate the formation of such complex will decrease the availability of lattice ions in the bulk solution so as the diffusion of lattice ions toward the cathode however in the presence of 5 mg l 1 nom ca4h po4 3 3h2o si 0 049 is not saturated and the si of the rest species also decreased the decrease of si may increase the free phosphate in the bulk solution and so as the diffusion of phosphate towards the cathode the increased removal of p in the presence of nom did not change the structure of cap as shown by xrd fig 2b there are no crystalline cap phases that can be identified in the xrd patterns most of the sharp peaks in the absence of nom turn out to be na2so4 resulting from the background electrolyte the consistent broad peak around 30 can be assigned to acp this is further supported by the unchanged morphology of cap as shown in the sem images fig 2c and d whether in the absence or presence of nom the precipitates appear as small spherical particles which is typical for acp 3 2 effect of nom concentration after recognizing the promoting effect of nom1 on the quality of cap precipitation in 24 h we studied the influence of nom1 concentration fig 3 a shows the removal of p slightly increased from 43 8 4 9 0 mg l 1 to 58 5 1 2 1 0 mg l 1 and further to 62 5 1 9 in the presence of 10 mg l 1 nom1 in addition we found that the addition of nom1 changes the color of the recovered products fig 3b without nom1 the precipitate has the typical white color of cap however the color of precipitates changes to light yellow in the presence of 1 0 mg l 1 nom1 the color intensity of precipitates increases with increasing nom1 dosage fig 3b probably because the amount of adsorbed co precipitated nom1 increases the increased adsorption co precipitation of nom on cap may hinder the further adsorption of phosphate on initially precipitated cap it was documented that the simultaneous addition of humic acid and phosphate lowers the adsorption of phosphate on calcite coated montmorillonite perassi and borgnino 2014 overall the small increase of p removal with increasing nom1 concentration in our system as nom1 on the one hand promotes cap precipitation on the surface of cathode on the other hand at a later stage the co precipitated nom1 may hinder the further adsorption of phosphate on the initially precipitated cap moreover the complexation of nom with ca2 may not only decrease the free ca in the bulk solution but also the availability of ca in the local region at a high nom concentration i e 10 mg l 1 this negative effect may cancel out the positive effect of nom on cap precipitation at the surface of the cathode in conclusion the effect of nom1 on cap precipitation in the electrochemical system is dictated by the balance between the positive role and negative role as a result the increase of both p and ca removal is small with increasing nom concentration regardless of the dosage of nom the morphology of the precipitates is consistent all in special shape fig 3c which is often seen for acp it is widely reported that the presence of nom will inhibit the transfer of acp to crystalline cap alvarez et al 2004 as the precipitates collected in the absence of nom is acp it is not surprising that the precipitates remain in amorphous phase in the presence of nom apparently the co precipitation of nom with cap will lower the purity of product as cap however in terms of the value of cap either as a raw fertilizer or as a direct p fertilizer the co precipitation may be desirable according to the study of delgado et al 2002 and perassi and borgnino 2014 the presence of organic matter can increase the bioavailability of p in cap for plants this points out the potential of producing organic containing cap fertilizer by precipitating ca p and nom simultaneously by applying the electrochemical p recovery system 3 3 co precipitation mechanism although we found that nom co precipitates with cap and improves the removal of p in the electrochemical system we are not yet able to clarify the precipitation mechanism we assume that the co precipitation can be either as direct physical precipitation or an indirect chemical co precipitation or a combination of both as illustrated in fig 4 for the chemical co precipitation pathway ca2 forms a binary complex with nom nom ca initially and then diffuses to the cathode and forms insoluble p ca nom complex the crucial step of chemical co precipitation is the diffusion of nom ca towards the cathode however given the big molecular size of nom ca the diffusion rate of nom ca should be much slower than free ca2 and therefore it is unlikely that the nom ca complex participates in the precipitation of cap directly the most likely co precipitation mechanism is the adsorption of nom on acp fig 4 in this process the formation of acp by ca2 and phosphate is the first step due to the good adsorption ability of the initially formed acp and its unstable structure song et al 2006 nom can be easily adsorbed to the surface of acp zhou et al 2015 reported similar physical adsorption of nom on the surface of struvite crystals the adsorbed nom1 negatively charged may then interact with the ca2 through electrostatic interaction forming nom ca also it is reported that nom can react with electrons from the cathode or with h2 formed at the cathode surface rajic et al 2015 this may contribute to the formation of nom ca as well subsequently the nom ca may able to interact with the phosphate chemically leading to the formation of insoluble nom ca p in the same way nom and ca interaction enhances the fouling of membranes in nanofiltration process al amoudi 2010 therefore it is suggested that the physical adsorption of nom by acp is the dominant co precipitation pathway in the initial stage also because only a very small amount of ca2 can complex with nom in a later stage both physical and chemical adsorption may contribute to the enhanced removal of p in the presence of nom in the electrochemical p recovery system 3 4 effect of nom type fig 5 shows that there is no significant difference for ca and p removal among the three types of nom though the three noms are supposed to have different behaviors in cap precipitation due to their variation in molecular size and functional groups nom1 has a larger molecular weight and is regarded as a natural anionic polyelectrolyte nom2 is a mixture of hydrophilic non humic with hydrophobic humic matter while nom3 is the representative of fulvic acid with a low molecular weight semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 the characterization of the three noms by lc ocd figure s1 suggests that the order of humic acids carbon ha c content is nom1 1 78 0 09 mg l 1 nom3 1 49 0 04 mg l 1 nom2 1 03 0 03 mg l 1 all in the same dosage 5 mg l 1 the charge density of the noms is also different nom1 has a charge density of 11 21 meq g carbon while the value for nom3 is 7 09 ritchie and perdue 2003 note that the charge density of nom2 is not provided by ihss but it probably lies in the range of 7 09 11 21 meq g carbon if considering the ha c content efforts were made to relate the composition of the noms with the p and ca removal but no solid conclusions could be drawn though it is evident that all noms improve the removal of p fig 5a there is no significant variation between these noms the small difference might be because the noms were degraded by the anode or an anode mediated oxidation which result in the breakdown of nom molecules the breakdown of nom was confirmed by the decreased humic substances increased building blocks and the low molecular weight acids which is showed in the lc ocd chromatogram fig 5b however the color of recovered products is different figure s2 the precipitates with nom3 is in light yellow and even close to the color of samples collected in the absence of nom however the precipitates collected in the presence of nom1 and nom2 are yellow brown the difference in the color of precipitates is caused by the initial color of noms this again confirms the involvement of nom on the cap solids on top of this the small difference of p removal in response to the different types of nom may highlight the dominant co precipitation mechanism of nom as physical precipitation nom participates in the precipitation process mostly in the second step by adsorption to the surface of cap the initial formation of cap at the cathode surface may be not affected by the presence of nom nor by the nom type therefore the change of nom type did not result in significant changes of cap precipitation and the associated nom co precipitation however the complexity of this system makes it difficult to give a solid conclusion on the role of nom on cap precipitation in the electrochemical system 3 5 effect of solution ph in a previous study it was shown that the electrochemical system works efficiently in a wide ph range in the absence of nom and in non buffered solutions lei et al 2017 to investigate the performance of this system in the presence of nom the role of ph with and without buffer was studied in unbuffered solutions as without nom the system shows efficient p and ca removal over a wide ph range ph 4 0 10 0 fig 6 overall there is no big difference among different initial bulk solution ph values and the obtained p removal 60 however at ph 10 0 approximately 10 less p was removed from the solution this is in line with a previous study in the absence of nom that a low bulk solution ph results in slightly higher p removal lei et al 2017 however in buffered solutions the precipitation of ca and p was reduced specifically the presence of buffers at ph 4 0 and 6 0 block cap precipitation completely with almost no ca and p removed from solution this is because the strong buffers inhibit the increase of local ph by consuming the produced oh at the surface of cathode which was already documented honda et al 1998 jeremiasse et al 2009 for instance honda et al 1998 reported that the addition of glycine buffer 0 2 m drops the local ph from 12 5 to 2 5 for the solution buffered at ph 10 0 though borate buffer may hinder the increase of local ph as well the system still forms cap precipitates in the vicinity of cathode this is because at ph 10 0 the solution is already highly supersaturated with respect to cap this is supported by the 32 5 p and 31 6 ca removal in open circuit in 24 h fig 6 indeed we found precipitates on the surface of cathode anode and the bottom of the electrochemical cell in open circuit however under the same solution conditions in closed circuit most precipitates form at the surface of cathode it seems that in the electrochemical system in addition to the production of oh ions the migration of ca2 toward the ti cathode is enhanced by the applied current due to the self driven and electrochemical driven precipitation of cap in ph 10 0 buffered the highest p removal 67 7 was achieved 3 6 effects of electrolysis time the time dependence of p removal was evaluated by extending reaction time up to seven days in the presence of 5 0 mg l 1 nom1 under background solution ph 8 0 generally the removal of both ca and p was improved by a longer electrolysis time in the first day 60 0 p and 52 2 ca precipitate from the solution fig 7 a the removal percentage increases to 80 5 and 68 3 for p and ca respectively on the second day this is because the increase of electrolysis time not only produces more oh but also provides more time for the diffusion of ca and p towards the reaction zone near cathode however the further increase of electrolysis time does not increase the removal substantially the removal of ca and p increased only by about 10 even the electrolysis time was extended to seven days this is probably due to the decrease of ca and p ions concentration in the bulk solution after two days reaction the concentrations of ca and p decreased to 12 7 and 3 6 mg l 1 respectively the decrease of lattice ions concentration in the bulk solution will drop the availability of lattice ions in the local region where precipitation happens and so as the removal rate of lattice ions moreover the initially precipitated cap occupied most of the ti surface the space for further cap precipitation was limited consequently the removal of p only increased slightly with increasing the electrolysis time interestingly the removal percentage of p is always about 10 higher than ca during the whole precipitation process mass balance calculations show that the ca p molar ratio in the precipitates are 1 44 first day 1 41 second day 1 40 fourth day and 1 42 seventh day this is different from the ca p molar ratio in the absence of nom where the ca p ratio gradually increased from 1 43 in the first day to 1 66 on the seventh day lei et al 2017 the difference is likely caused by the presence of nom as discussed previously nom was adsorbed to the surface of acp on the cathode the transfer of initially formed acp to crystalline cap i e hap will be hindered delayed in the presence of nom alvarez et al 2004 indeed as shown by the sem images fig 7b the collected particles are spherical which is typical for acp till day seven when needle like shape hap co exists with the spherical shape therefore the precipitates collected after one day five and seven days were subjected to xrd characterization fig 7c as shown in fig 7c in 24 h and five days the corresponding xrd spectrum shows only broad peaks around 30 and 47 this suggests that the samples are dominantly acp however within seven days in addition to the same broadened peaks there are also some sharp peaks which match the reference hap cod 9002214 suggesting the presence of hap in the precipitates though in the presence of nom the crystallization process is delayed acp can still transfer to crystalline species depending on reaction time and ph 4 conclusions to conclude we confirmed for the first time that the presence of nom improves cap precipitation mainly via physical co precipitation with cap in the electrochemical p recovery system however the co precipitation of nom on cap surface delays the transfer of acp to hap and results in the formation of low ca p molar ratio species still part of the acp recrystallized to hap when the electrolysis time was extended to seven days interestingly the initial bulk solution ph does not have dramatic effects on the interaction of ca p and nom because the precipitation process is induced by the high local ph at the cathode however high concentrations of acidic buffer inhibit the precipitation of cap and the accompanied co precipitation of nom because buffers hinder the increase of local ph at the cathode acknowledgments this

19458,to address the issues of eutrophication and the potential risk of phosphorus p shortage it is essential to remove and recover p from p containing streams to close this nutrient cycle electrochemical induced calcium phosphate cap precipitation was shown to be an efficient method for p recovery however the influence of natural organic matter nom is not known for this treatment in this paper the behavior of nom and its effect on cap precipitation was studied in contrast to studies where nom hindered cap precipitation results show that the interaction of nom with cap improves the removal of p independent of the types of nom the p removal at the average increased from 43 8 4 9 to 58 5 1 2 in the presence of 1 0 mg l 1 nom based on the yellow color of the cap product nom is co precipitated the bulk solution ph with and without buffers has totally different effects on the precipitation process without buffer cap precipitates on the cathode surface in a wide ph range ph 4 0 10 0 however the precipitation process is completely inhibited when the bulk solution is buffered at ph 4 0 and 6 0 this is probably due to neutralization of oh by the buffers regardless of the presence or absence of nom and solution ph the recovered products are mainly amorphous cap unless the electrolysis time was increased to seven days with 4 0 a m 2 in which crystalline cap formed these findings advance our understanding on the interaction of ca p and nom species for the application of electrochemical method for p recovery from real wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords natural organic matter calcium phosphate electrochemical precipitation buffer co precipitation 1 introduction phosphorus p plays an essential role for all living organisms desmidt et al 2014 p fertilizers are also needed to secure food production however the diminishing reserves of p rock are not adapted to the growing demand of p elser and bennett 2011 reijnders 2014 indeed on the one hand p can be a scarce resource in the future on the other hand plenty of p containing waste streams are discharged to water bodies resulting in an environmental catastrophe namely eutrophication elser and bennett 2011 however if we can recover the lost p and re use it as a constituent in fertilizer this can reduce the risk of p shortage and alleviate eutrophication problems mayer et al 2016 various methods including enhanced biological phosphorus removal tervahauta et al 2014 cunha et al 2018b adsorption kumar et al 2017 and chemical precipitation have been applied to remove p from waste streams among them the most common way is chemical precipitation because of its easy operation and efficiency ye et al 2017 for the sake of re use the chemical precipitation method has shifted from using fe and al salts which produce hardly bio reusable p salts to struvite mgnh4po4 and calcium phosphate cap which can be used as a slow release fertilizer or as raw materials for the fertilizer industry respectively tervahauta et al 2014 hao et al 2013 hug and udert 2013 previous studies indicate that the concentrations of the associated lattice ions and ph affect the removal performance of p since these variables determine the driving force for the precipitation of a species in chemical precipitation process song et al 2002 shih et al 2017 on the basis of this a variety of mg or ca sources such as natural brucite hovelmann and putnis 2016 building waste yang et al 2016 and steel slag barca et al 2012 had been applied to achieve efficient and cost effective p removal the advantage of these mg or ca sources is that they not only provide mg2 or ca2 but also able to increase solution ph particularly the membrane containing electrochemical system which can enrich phosphate concentration and increase solution ph simultaneously receives a lot of attention zhang et al 2013 kappel et al 2013 xie et al 2014 qiu et al 2015 however the associated fouling issues of membranes remain a challenge the inspiring point however is that several studies showed the possibility of a membrane free system for p removal and recovery wang et al 2010 cusick and logan 2012 lei et al 2017 recently reported an efficient membrane free system which induces cap precipitation at the cathode surface over a wide ph range it was proposed that the production of hydroxide ions on the surface of the titanium cathode through water electrolysis is responsible for p precipitation in the tests described in lei et al 2017 calcium nitrate and sodium phosphate in a background matrix of sodium sulfate in milliq 18 2 mω cm water was used further assessment of the applicability of the membrane free system requires adding other components that could be naturally present and that may interfere with the precipitation of cap previous non electrochemical studies have shown that both mg2 and carbonate inhibit cap precipitation by replacing lattice ca and decreasing free ca by complexation respectively cao and harris 2007 hermassi et al 2016 cunha et al 2018a in particular it was reported that natural organic matter nom inhibits the precipitation of cap by decreasing free aqueous ca ions and blocking nucleation sites song et al 2006 cao et al 2007 sindelar et al 2015 nom is a complex matrix of heterogeneous mixture of organic compounds matilainen et al 2010 and coexists with ca and p in every aquatic and soil system sindelar et al 2015 the complex structure and functional groups of nom allows ion exchange and complexation hahn et al 2017 and thereby may interact with lattice ions and thence influence cap precipitation however the interaction of nom on cap precipitation in electrochemical systems to our knowledge has not been studied nor the effect of nom from different sources or the combined effect of nom and solution ph on cap precipitation electrochemical induced cap precipitation depends on the local chemical environment near the cathode surface it is also known from literature that though nom in general shows inhibiting effects on cap precipitation in conventional chemical precipitation process the negative role can be overcome by increasing solution ph song et al 2006 sindelar et al 2015 since the electrochemical system can create a high local ph by oh production at the vicinity of the cathode the negative effects of nom may be eliminated in this system the objective of this study is to elucidate the influence of nom on cap precipitation in the electrochemical system specifically we studied the effects of nom from different sources at different ph conditions we also investigated the effect of electrolysis time on the electrochemical interaction of ca p and nom and the associated impact on chemical and physical properties of precipitates 2

flow rate of 70 ml min 2 3 batch experiments for preparation of the test solutions we used stock solutions of ca2 0 4 m and p po4 0 24 m to obtain final concentrations of 1 0 mm total ca and 0 6 mm p in this paper we used the term p to represent all soluble phosphorus species in the bulk solution in all batch tests we added 50 mm na2so4 to maintain the electrolyte conductivity we first chose nom1 as the typical reference nom and investigated its effect on cap precipitation in the range of 1 0 10 0 mg l 1 and subsequently studied the effects of nom sources we also examined the effects of ph in buffered and unbuffered solutions on p recovery we performed all the electrochemical experiments at a constant current density 4 0 a m 2 for 24 h at room temperature all the tests were at least done in duplicate the data is shown as mean plus standard deviation solids on the cathode surface were collected and dried at room temperature it should be noted that the solid precipitates were not washed with milliq 18 2 mω cm water in preventing of potential dissolution or recrystallization of precipitates 2 4 analysis the soluble ca and p concentrations were analysed by icp aes noms were

supersaturation index si of the possible species in the bulk solution the si is defined as eq 1 1 si log iap k sp where iap is the thermodynamic solubility product and ksp is the ion activity of the associated lattice ions 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of addition of nom we started our experiments with comparing p removal in the presence and the absence of nom1 experiments were run for 24 h fig 2 a shows the effect of 5 0 mg l 1 nom1 on ca and p removal at an initial ph 8 0 established after all chemicals in the presence of 5 0 mg l 1 nom1 the removal efficiency of ca and p increased by 14 6 and 16 9 respectively in comparison to the removal of ca and p in the absence of nom in contrast to results found for non electrochemical cap precipitation where an inhibitory effect of nom on cap precipitation was observed cao et al 2007 sindelar et al 2015 the lack of inhibition by nom on the removal of p in our system is probably due to the fact that the precipitation occurs in a local region where the ph is high enough to overcome the negative influence of nom indeed it is known from literature that nom shows negligible inhibition on both struvite and cap precipitation under strong alkaline conditions ph 9 0 song et al 2006 sindelar et al 2015 in the electrochemical system a local high ph at the vicinity of the ti cathode can be created through water reduction 2h2o 2e 2oh h2 as a result ca and p ions precipitate as solid cap phase even in the presence of nom this still does not explain why nom improves the precipitation of cap on the cathode one of the reasons could be that nom provides binding sites for ca once nom co precipitates with cap nuclei which are precursors of stable calcium phosphate particles nom due to its multi functional groups such as carboxyl group can easily adsorb ca2 the used nom1 has a charge density of 11 21 meq g carbon at ph 8 0 according to the data provided by ihss ritchie and perdue 2003 with 5 mg l 1 nom1 carbon content 50 7 theoretically only 0 0284 meq could be available for binding ca2 which accounts for 1 4 of 1 0 mm ca2 from this perspective the nom seemingly not play a role on complexation with ca however the charge density of humic substance increases systematically with ph once being adsorbed to the formed calcium phosphate and in contact with the local high ph the nom1 may able to further interact with the phosphate in this way the co precipitated nom enhanced the removal of p also it is reported that nom can react with electrons from the cathode or with h2 formed at the cathode surface rajic et al 2015 in our system the nom may work similarly once being adsorbed to the cathode surface the nom may interact with the ca2 and phosphate in the bulk solution and thus enhance the removal of p perassi and borgnino 2014 investigated the effect of humic acid on phosphate adsorption by calcite coated montmorillonite it was found that the order of adding humic acid and phosphate affects the adsorption significantly when humic acid and phosphate were added simultaneously or humic acid firstly the adsorption of phosphate on calcite coated montmorillonite was lower compared to the values observed in the absence of humic acid however when phosphate was added first the adsorption of phosphate on calcite coated montmorillonite increases when humic acid was added perassi and borgnino 2014 it was proposed that humic acid improves the adsorption of p onto calcite coated montmorillonite by preventing precipitation of cap in bulk solution the same mechanism may apply to our system as well indeed nom may prevent cap precipitation in the bulk solution through complexation with ca and enhance the removal of p in the presence of 1 0 mm ca and 0 6 mm phosphate at ph 8 0 the solution is already supersaturated though no visible precipitation can be noticed table s1 shows in the absence of nom at least four calcium phosphate species are saturated including amorphous calcium phosphate acp si 0 382 beta ca3 po4 2 si 1 052 ca4h po4 3 3h2o si 0 046 and hydroxyapatite hap si 8 634 this suggests that the ca may already form metastable phase with phosphate but due to kinetic reasons or surface tension that needs to be overcame did not precipitate the formation of such complex will decrease the availability of lattice ions in the bulk solution so as the diffusion of lattice ions toward the cathode however in the presence of 5 mg l 1 nom ca4h po4 3 3h2o si 0 049 is not saturated and the si of the rest species also decreased the decrease of si may increase the free phosphate in the bulk solution and so as the diffusion of phosphate towards the cathode the increased removal of p in the presence of nom did not change the structure of cap as shown by xrd fig 2b there are no crystalline cap phases that can be identified in the xrd patterns most of the sharp peaks in the absence of nom turn out to be na2so4 resulting from the background electrolyte the consistent broad peak around 30 can be assigned to acp this is further supported by the unchanged morphology of cap as shown in the sem images fig 2c and d whether in the absence or presence of nom the precipitates appear as small spherical particles which is typical for acp 3 2 effect of nom concentration after recognizing the promoting effect of nom1 on the quality of cap precipitation in 24 h we studied the influence of nom1 concentration fig 3 a shows the removal of p slightly increased from 43 8 4 9 0 mg l 1 to 58 5 1 2 1 0 mg l 1 and further to 62 5 1 9 in the presence of 10 mg l 1 nom1 in addition we found that the addition of nom1 changes the color of the recovered products fig 3b without nom1 the precipitate has the typical white color of cap however the color of precipitates changes to light yellow in the presence of 1 0 mg l 1 nom1 the color intensity of precipitates increases with increasing nom1 dosage fig 3b probably because the amount of adsorbed co precipitated nom1 increases the increased adsorption co precipitation of nom on cap may hinder the further adsorption of phosphate on initially precipitated cap it was documented that the simultaneous addition of humic acid and phosphate lowers the adsorption of phosphate on calcite coated montmorillonite perassi and borgnino 2014 overall the small increase of p removal with increasing nom1 concentration in our system as nom1 on the one hand promotes cap precipitation on the surface of cathode on the other hand at a later stage the co precipitated nom1 may hinder the further adsorption of phosphate on the initially precipitated cap moreover the complexation of nom with ca2 may not only decrease the free ca in the bulk solution but also the availability of ca in the local region at a high nom concentration i e 10 mg l 1 this negative effect may cancel out the positive effect of nom on cap precipitation at the surface of the cathode in conclusion the effect of nom1 on cap precipitation in the electrochemical system is dictated by the balance between the positive role and negative role as a result the increase of both p and ca removal is small with increasing nom concentration regardless of the dosage of nom the morphology of the precipitates is consistent all in special shape fig 3c which is often seen for acp it is widely reported that the presence of nom will inhibit the transfer of acp to crystalline cap alvarez et al 2004 as the precipitates collected in the absence of nom is acp it is not surprising that the precipitates remain in amorphous phase in the presence of nom apparently the co precipitation of nom with cap will lower the purity of product as cap however in terms of the value of cap either as a raw fertilizer or as a direct p fertilizer the co precipitation may be desirable according to the study of delgado et al 2002 and perassi and borgnino 2014 the presence of organic matter can increase the bioavailability of p in cap for plants this points out the potential of producing organic containing cap fertilizer by precipitating ca p and nom simultaneously by applying the electrochemical p recovery system 3 3 co precipitation mechanism although we found that nom co precipitates with cap and improves the removal of p in the electrochemical system we are not yet able to clarify the precipitation mechanism we assume that the co precipitation can be either as direct physical precipitation or an indirect chemical co precipitation or a combination of both as illustrated in fig 4 for the chemical co precipitation pathway ca2 forms a binary complex with nom nom ca initially and then diffuses to the cathode and forms insoluble p ca nom complex the crucial step of chemical co precipitation is the diffusion of nom ca towards the cathode however given the big molecular size of nom ca the diffusion rate of nom ca should be much slower than free ca2 and therefore it is unlikely that the nom ca complex participates in the precipitation of cap directly the most likely co precipitation mechanism is the adsorption of nom on acp fig 4 in this process the formation of acp by ca2 and phosphate is the first step due to the good adsorption ability of the initially formed acp and its unstable structure song et al 2006 nom can be easily adsorbed to the surface of acp zhou et al 2015 reported similar physical adsorption of nom on the surface of struvite crystals the adsorbed nom1 negatively charged may then interact with the ca2 through electrostatic interaction forming nom ca also it is reported that nom can react with electrons from the cathode or with h2 formed at the cathode surface rajic et al 2015 this may contribute to the formation of nom ca as well subsequently the nom ca may able to interact with the phosphate chemically leading to the formation of insoluble nom ca p in the same way nom and ca interaction enhances the fouling of membranes in nanofiltration process al amoudi 2010 therefore it is suggested that the physical adsorption of nom by acp is the dominant co precipitation pathway in the initial stage also because only a very small amount of ca2 can complex with nom in a later stage both physical and chemical adsorption may contribute to the enhanced removal of p in the presence of nom in the electrochemical p recovery system 3 4 effect of nom type fig 5 shows that there is no significant difference for ca and p removal among the three types of nom though the three noms are supposed to have different behaviors in cap precipitation due to their variation in molecular size and functional groups nom1 has a larger molecular weight and is regarded as a natural anionic polyelectrolyte nom2 is a mixture of hydrophilic non humic with hydrophobic humic matter while nom3 is the representative of fulvic acid with a low molecular weight semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 the characterization of the three noms by lc ocd figure s1 suggests that the order of humic acids carbon ha c content is nom1 1 78 0 09 mg l 1 nom3 1 49 0 04 mg l 1 nom2 1 03 0 03 mg l 1 all in the same dosage 5 mg l 1 the charge density of the noms is also different nom1 has a charge density of 11 21 meq g carbon while the value for nom3 is 7 09 ritchie and perdue 2003 note that the charge density of nom2 is not provided by ihss but it probably lies in the range of 7 09 11 21 meq g carbon if considering the ha c content efforts were made to relate the composition of the noms with the p and ca removal but no solid conclusions could be drawn though it is evident that all noms improve the removal of p fig 5a there is no significant variation between these noms the small difference might be because the noms were degraded by the anode or an anode mediated oxidation which result in the breakdown of nom molecules the breakdown of nom was confirmed by the decreased humic substances increased building blocks and the low molecular weight acids which is showed in the lc ocd chromatogram fig 5b however the color of recovered products is different figure s2 the precipitates with nom3 is in light yellow and even close to the color of samples collected in the absence of nom however the precipitates collected in the presence of nom1 and nom2 are yellow brown the difference in the color of precipitates is caused by the initial color of noms this again confirms the involvement of nom on the cap solids on top of this the small difference of p removal in response to the different types of nom may highlight the dominant co precipitation mechanism of nom as physical precipitation nom participates in the precipitation process mostly in the second step by adsorption to the surface of cap the initial formation of cap at the cathode surface may be not affected by the presence of nom nor by the nom type therefore the change of nom type did not result in significant changes of cap precipitation and the associated nom co precipitation however the complexity of this system makes it difficult to give a solid conclusion on the role of nom on cap precipitation in the electrochemical system 3 5 effect of solution ph in a previous study it was shown that the electrochemical system works efficiently in a wide ph range in the absence of nom and in non buffered solutions lei et al 2017 to investigate the performance of this system in the presence of nom the role of ph with and without buffer was studied in unbuffered solutions as without nom the system shows efficient p and ca removal over a wide ph range ph 4 0 10 0 fig 6 overall there is no big difference among different initial bulk solution ph values and the obtained p removal 60 however at ph 10 0 approximately 10 less p was removed from the solution this is in line with a previous study in the absence of nom that a low bulk solution ph results in slightly higher p removal lei et al 2017 however in buffered solutions the precipitation of ca and p was reduced specifically the presence of buffers at ph 4 0 and 6 0 block cap precipitation completely with almost no ca and p removed from solution this is because the strong buffers inhibit the increase of local ph by consuming the produced oh at the surface of cathode which was already documented honda et al 1998 jeremiasse et al 2009 for instance honda et al 1998 reported that the addition of glycine buffer 0 2 m drops the local ph from 12 5 to 2 5 for the solution buffered at ph 10 0 though borate buffer may hinder the increase of local ph as well the system still forms cap precipitates in the vicinity of cathode this is because at ph 10 0 the solution is already highly supersaturated with respect to cap this is supported by the 32 5 p and 31 6 ca removal in open circuit in 24 h fig 6 indeed we found precipitates on the surface of cathode anode and the bottom of the electrochemical cell in open circuit however under the same solution conditions in closed circuit most precipitates form at the surface of cathode it seems that in the electrochemical system in addition to the production of oh ions the migration of ca2 toward the ti cathode is enhanced by the applied current due to the self driven and electrochemical driven precipitation of cap in ph 10 0 buffered the highest p removal 67 7 was achieved 3 6 effects of electrolysis time the time dependence of p removal was evaluated by extending reaction time up to seven days in the presence of 5 0 mg l 1 nom1 under background solution ph 8 0 generally the removal of both ca and p was improved by a longer electrolysis time in the first day 60 0 p and 52 2 ca precipitate from the solution fig 7 a the removal percentage increases to 80 5 and 68 3 for p and ca respectively on the second day this is because the increase of electrolysis time not only produces more oh but also provides more time for the diffusion of ca and p towards the reaction zone near cathode however the further increase of electrolysis time does not increase the removal substantially the removal of ca and p increased only by about 10 even the electrolysis time was extended to seven days this is probably due to the decrease of ca and p ions concentration in the bulk solution after two days reaction the concentrations of ca and p decreased to 12 7 and 3 6 mg l 1 respectively the decrease of lattice ions concentration in the bulk solution will drop the availability of lattice ions in the local region where precipitation happens and so as the removal rate of lattice ions moreover the initially precipitated cap occupied most of the ti surface the space for further cap precipitation was limited consequently the removal of p only increased slightly with increasing the electrolysis time interestingly the removal percentage of p is always about 10 higher than ca during the whole precipitation process mass balance calculations show that the ca p molar ratio in the precipitates are 1 44 first day 1 41 second day 1 40 fourth day and 1 42 seventh day this is different from the ca p molar ratio in the absence of nom where the ca p ratio gradually increased from 1 43 in the first day to 1 66 on the seventh day lei et al 2017 the difference is likely caused by the presence of nom as discussed previously nom was adsorbed to the surface of acp on the cathode the transfer of initially formed acp to crystalline cap i e hap will be hindered delayed in the presence of nom alvarez et al 2004 indeed as shown by the sem images fig 7b the collected particles are spherical which is typical for acp till day seven when needle like shape hap co exists with the spherical shape therefore the precipitates collected after one day five and seven days were subjected to xrd characterization fig 7c as shown in fig 7c in 24 h and five days the corresponding xrd spectrum shows only broad peaks around 30 and 47 this suggests that the samples are dominantly acp however within seven days in addition to the same broadened peaks there are also some sharp peaks which match the reference hap cod 9002214 suggesting the presence of hap in the precipitates though in the presence of nom the crystallization process is delayed acp can still transfer to crystalline species depending on reaction time and ph 4 conclusions to conclude we confirmed for the first time that the presence of nom improves cap precipitation mainly via physical co precipitation with cap in the electrochemical p recovery system however the co precipitation of nom on cap surface delays the transfer of acp to hap and results in the formation of low ca p molar ratio species still part of the acp recrystallized to hap when the electrolysis time was extended to seven days interestingly the initial bulk solution ph does not have dramatic effects on the interaction of ca p and nom because the precipitation process is induced by the high local ph at the cathode however high concentrations of acidic buffer inhibit the precipitation of cap and the accompanied co precipitation of nom because buffers hinder the increase of local ph at the cathode acknowledgments this

and declining flux that however stabilizes at low level peter varbanets et al 2010 2011 frechen et al 2011 as opposed to these systems bearing the misery of low flux we propose an alternative backwash and membrane cleaning concept temperature enhanced backwash teb it is driven by vapor pressure as the sealed product water tank is heated to above 100 c when the desired temperature and according vapor pressure is reached the backwash valve is opened to start the teb fed from either steam or liquid phase in addition to the driving pressure difference this concept provides steam sterilization as in an autoclave and thus disinfection of the product water tank in this way re contamination can be effectively prevented a similar cleaning method has been described by peng and tremblay 2008 using pressurized steam at 126 c and 2 41 bar gauge pressure to backwash a 1 4 μ m microfiltration membrane made of sintered carbon for an oil water emulsion fouling solution they have reported an increased cleaning efficacy with increasing cleaning temperature ignoring the feed state of matter temperature range 25 126 c in addition the teb resembles the principle of italian coffee makers so called moka described by navarini et al 2009 herein vapor pressure is used to drive a mixture of hot water and steam through the coffee filter in contrast to this simple principle the driving pressure gradient is explicitly controlled in teb in this study we introduce the membrane cleaning method temperature enhanced backwash in addition we investigate its characteristics and compare its cleaning efficacy to the one of a mechanical backwash using ceramic ultrafiltration membranes on a lab scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 membrane and module in all lab scale experiments tubular ceramic membranes with a al2o3 support structure and a selective layer of zro2 atech innovations gmbh germany were used the membrane surface area was 24 5 cm 2 inner diameter 6 mm and nominal molecular weight cut off 100 kda hydraulic resistance of provided membranes was r m e m b r a n e 1 6 0 4 10 12 m 1 corresponding to a permeability of approx 170 390 kg m 2 h 1 bar 1 at 20 2 c three way modules were made of stainless steel with ethylene propylene diene monomer epdm sealings prior to each experiment the membranes were conditioned with distilled water at a transmembrane pressure δ p of 1 5 bar for at least 15 min until flux was constant all given pressures are transmembrane or gauge pressures respectively unless stated otherwise 2 2 membrane permeation membrane permeation was investigated with different media i water at t 20 c δ p 0 5 2 7 bar using the filtration setup described in section 2 4 cf fig 1 ii boiling water at 115 141 c 0 7 2 7 bar using the teb setup described in section 2 4 cf fig 2 and iii saturated steam under same conditions as ii in case of saturated steam feed the membrane was previously dried in an oven at 130 c overnight for 16 22 h to eliminate condensed water in the pores 2 3 scaling and salt passage scaling does not occur in ultrafiltration at ambient temperature however during teb the liquid feed phase opposes the steam equilibrium phase on the permeate side at ambient pressure cf section 2 2 whether the expected partial evaporation leads to scaling was investigated using a teb feed solution with concentration of 1 84 mm caso4 caso 4 2 h 2 o from carl roth germany representing 12 5 of its solubility at 20 c salt concentration was quantified by hplc cation column metrosep c4 250 and ca 2 detection conductivity sensor 2 4 fouling and cleaning with model solutions one fouling and cleaning experiment consisted of six steps membrane conditioning and initial water permeation fouling with model solution rinsing and water permeation actual cleaning with different backwashes final water permeation and chemical enhanced backwash defined membrane fouling was conducted in dead end mode filtering inside out at constant pressure of 0 50 0 05 bar until 0 25 kg permeate were collected using the filtration setup displayed in fig 1 permeate mass flux and feed pressure were logged continuously with a balance δ m 0 2 g and pressure sensor 0 25 bar respectively ambient and permeate temperature were 20 2 c in all experiments prior to fouling water permeation was performed under the same conditions for 7 min after a constant resistance was obtained double distilled water was used for water permeation as well as for the preparation of fouling solutions two different model fouling solutions were prepared on a daily basis with a volume of 1 l each silica nanoparticles 130 mg l 1 colloidal silica ludox hs 40 sigma aldrich germany with a nominal diameter of 12 nm was dispersed in 20 mm na2hpo4 kh2po4 buffer of ph 8 this model fouling solution causes strong and well reproducible membrane fouling humic acid 20 mg l 1 humic acid sodium salt technical grade sigma aldrich germany was dissolved in 1 mm cacl2 solution cacl 2 2 h 2 o from carl roth germany ph was adjusted to 8 with 1 m naoh the obtained toc was approx 7 mg l 1 this model fouling solution has suitable membrane fouling properties and characteristics being close to natural water lee et al 2004 after fouling a rinsing step was conducted the fouling solution in the feed tank cf fig 1 was exchanged for double distilled water therefore the drain valve was slightly opened for about 1 min to release fouling solution drop by drop in this way the membrane was rinsed and air bubbles originating from solution exchange were eliminated then water permeation was performed under the same conditions as before the cleaning step consisted of different backwash methods using double distilled water in order to evaluate the cleaning efficacy of temperature enhanced backwash and reference mechanical backwash respectively temperature enhanced backwash teb the membrane module was mounted in the teb setup displayed in fig 2 in backwash mode outside in filtration the autoclave cv el 18 certoclav sterilizer gmbh austria was filled with 3 l water so that the membrane module was submerged at all times feed from liquid phase the autoclave was heated in steam atmosphere to 125 c 1 35 bar the plug valve was opened for 7 min to backwash the membrane reference backwash bw the membrane module was reversed outside in filtration in the filtration setup fig 1 permeate temperature was 20 2 c two different reference backwashes were performed for 7 min i pressure reference backwash with the same transmembrane pressure δ p of 1 35 bar and ii flux reference backwash with similar mass flux m the corresponding transmembrane pressure was estimated appyling darcy s law 1 r δ p η j δ p ν m with constant membrane resistance r and backwash flux j and m respectively assuming that liquid water permeated the pores in teb η 125 c l i q 2 2 10 4 pa s ν 125 c l i q 2 4 10 7 m 2 s 1 the corresponding transmembrane pressure was calculated to δ p 5 82 6 26 bar mainly depending on temperature and water density the upper bound of 6 26 bar was selected for the experiments and measured mass flux data verified this estimation after the cleaning step the membrane module was re mounted in the filtration setup fig 1 inside out filtration and final water permeation was conducted under the same conditions as before finally a chemical enhanced backwash was performed using 1 m naoh to restore the initial membrane resistance in this way membranes were reused in the experimental series of the same fouling solution 2 5 multi cycle fouling and cleaning with river water ten fouling cycles were conducted with rur river water feed samples were collected downstream of the waste water treatment plant niederzier krauthausen at n 50 50 99 1 e 6 26 32 6 on 13 05 and 27 06 2016 during dry weather the samples were stored at 5 c until usage prior to usage the samples were re suspended and temperature was re adjusted to ambient temperature the mean feed water characteristics are shown in table 1 during the initial filtration cycle 3 l of permeate were collected which corresponds to the minimum volume required to fill the volume of the autoclave for teb application each filtration cycle took 1 5 h at δ p 0 5 bar and 1 h except the initial cycle at δ p 1 5 bar all cleaning steps teb and reference backwashes were performed under the same conditions as in section 2 4 however no rinsing step was conducted furthermore permeate was used for the backwashes teb and reference bw finally the transmembrane pressure for the flux reference backwash was determined empirically in this case δ p 4 19 bar composite samples of feed permeate permeate after teb temperature treated during teb and wash water discarded water leaving the module during teb were taken during the last teb cycle and analyzed by liquid chromatography with organic carbon and nitrogen detection lc ocd ond the analysis was performed with lc ocd model 8 by doc labor dr huber germany according to huber et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane permeation fed from saturated steam and boiling liquid before conducting practical fouling and cleaning experiments the permeation behavior was studied in order to better understand the nature of the presented temperature enhanced backwash the state of matter of water when permeating through the membrane under teb conditions was evaluated using darcy s law eq 1 assuming constant hydraulic resistance of the membrane r m e m b r a n e this yielded an effective viscosity ν e f f that was compared to the corresponding viscosities of saturated steam ν s and boiling liquid ν l a linear interpolation resulted in the determination of liquid fraction α l permeating under teb conditions cf section 2 2 2 α l ν e f f r m e m b r a n e p t ν s p t ν l p t ν s p t basic assumption for this interpolation was that the steam liquid composition liquid fraction is constant in the pores in the selective membrane layer that dominate the membrane resistance δ p d p o r e 4 if this assumption was not correct only a semi quantitative classification of the effective viscosity would be possible applying equation 2 resulted in a liquid fraction in the pores of 98 100 liquid feed and 89 92 steam feed respectively compare fig 3 in case of liquid feed effective and liquid viscosity cannot be differentiated in case of steam feed the large liquid fraction in the pores can be explained by prevailing capillary condensation in mesopores jones et al 2016 have proposed a theoretical mechanism of even superheated liquid being stable in cylindrical μm pores and vincent et al 2017 experimentally have observed fast capillary condensation kinetics in pores of 4 nm from saturated steam being like imbibition from a contacting liquid phase in this study the pore size of the 100 kda membrane was about 10 20 nm identified by fesem imaging grain size in selective layer of approx 50 nm cf fig 4 and molecular weight cut off translating to a pore diameter of 9 13 nm according to sarbolouki 1982 supporting the supposed capillary condensation hence we validated the assumption of liquid water in the pores of section 2 4 3 2 scaling and salt passage as fig 5 shows no salt was rejected during teb due to the transport governed by transmembrane pressure convective transport no scaling of the little soluble caso4 could be observed by flux decline this finding is in agreement with predominating permeation in liquid state as evidenced in section 3 1 the ca concentration in the feed slightly rose from 73 9 to 82 6 mg l 1 during the experiment which was mainly attributed to evaporation from the feed during the heat up phase with opened vent valve which was necessary to yield steam atmosphere 3 3 effect of temperature and backwash flux on cleaning after model solution fouling cf fig 6 rinsing and the different backwashes teb and reference bws were conducted with varying temperature and flux their cleaning efficacy was evaluated using the normalized residual fouling resistance r r e s i d u a l f o u l i n g r f o u l i n g this measure bases on the resistance in series model with constant membrane resistance r m e m b r a n e and variable fouling resistance r f o u l i n g 3 r t o t a l r m e m b r a n e r f o u l i n g the term r r e s i d u a l f o u l i n g denotes the residual fouling resistance after a certain cleaning step either rinsing or backwash teb or reference bw the normalized residual fouling resistance r r e s i d u a l f o u l i n g r f o u l i n g equals 0 and 1 for a completely cleaned or not cleaned membrane respectively fouling with silica nanoparticles was well reproducible and the flux stabilized at approx 50 kg m 2 h 1 cf fig 6 we suppose that the stabilization originated from a temporary equilibrium between built up gel cake layer lowering the flux and backtransport of silica nanoparticles due to mutual electrostatic repulsion the rinsing step already removed parts of the fouling layer this removal is exhibited by the lowered normalized residual fouling resistance r r e s i d u a l f o u l i n g r f o u l i n g 1 cf fig 7 a hence we concluded that the silica nanoparticles predominantly formed a supposedly loose cake layer that can be removed by small shear force subsequent cleaning by teb yielded a significantly lower normalized residual fouling resistance and thus higher cleaning efficacy than the pressure reference backwash cf fig 7 a the normalized residual fouling resistance after teb was similar to the one after flux reference backwash increasing cleaning efficacy with increasing backwash flux was also reported by huang et al 2007 moreover the cleaning efficacy added to the one of the preceding rinsing step in all three conducted teb replicates this additional cleaning efficacy was not observed in two out of four bw replicates for both pressure and flux reference however since there was no statistically significant difference of normalized residual fouling resistance after teb and after flux reference bw respectively we assume that temperature itself is not an influence factor the functional hydroxyl groups of the virtually inert inorganic silica nanoparticles do not significantly respond to the temperature shift the vast majority of hydroxyl groups is deprotonized and present as silanolates ludox hs 40 pka 2 sulpizi et al 2012 leading to mutual repulsion on the contrary elevated temperature decreases gelation time for 30 wt ludox hs at ph 5 from approx 300 min 21 c to about 2 min 99 c dupont ludox colloidal silica product information without date which had no adverse effect on the cleaning efficacy in the conducted experiments hence we conclude that the cleaning efficacy correlated with the backwash flux under the investigated experimental conditions fouling with humic acid solution was less consistent as compared to silica nanoparticle fouling in particular the rinsing step increased the fouling resistance significantly in most of the cases r r e s i d u a l f o u l i n g r f o u l i n g 1 cf fig 7 b this increase in resistance was probably caused by decreasing solubility and thus precipitation of humic acid onto the membrane surface as the ph decreased from 8 fouling solution to approx 5 double distilled water kipton et al 1992 in the subsequent cleaning step teb and reference bw the removal of fouling resistance caused by humic acid was generally less than silica and also less consistent in particular two cases for teb could be differentiated low n 2 and high flux n 2 during teb respectively the former lead to even further increased resistance whereas the latter decreased the resistance consistently showing some cleaning efficacy since the experiments were all conducted with the same membrane sample effect of hysteresis could be excluded by the order of experiments thermally induced change of the chemical structure of humic acid was excluded by studies of chen et al 1978 and francioso et al 2005 they have found that for natural humic acids mainly decarboxylation of acidic groups and decomposition cleavage of c c bonds takes place around approx 300 c and above 370 c respectively dehydration of humic acids occurs at 60 120 c we verified that humic acid precipitated at elevated temperatures and precipitation tendency increased with increasing temperature and concentration cf fig 8 in particular precipitation also occurred at the feed concentration and 125 c hence we attribute the case of further increased resistance to precipitation of humic acid on the membrane surface it remains to elucidate what leads to favorable cleaning efficacies furthermore the effect of backwash flux on cleaning efficacy was not significant in general however the normalized residual fouling resistance after teb with high backwash flux was at least consistently lower than the one after rinsing at last we suppose humic acid to cause membrane fouling by adsorption present ca 2 ions possibly formed bridges that linked the negatively charged oxidic surface of the ceramic membrane zr o al o to the organic carboxyl groups of the humic acid vermöhlen et al 2000 aquino et al 2008 muneer and oades 1989 majzik and tombácz 2007 once precipitated on the inner membrane surface humic acid seemed to be hard to remove precipitation might be prevented by short temperature exposure times which will be subject to future studies 3 4 river water filtration the different cleaning methods were compared under real conditions using river water rur river downstream of a waste water treatment plant raw water characteristics for the third run pressure reference bw second raw water sampling were very similar as compared to the first sampling all average values within standard deviation except for uv254 9 8 and conductivity 32 due to a rain event preceding the second sampling each run was conducted with another membrane sample initial membrane resistances were similar hence the runs could be compared directly this was also confirmed by very similar retentions retentions for turbidity toc and uv254 were 95 3 8 12 and 4 3 respectively cf table 1 hence organic removal was low whereas particle removal was excellent and decoupled from the raw water level all permeate samples 0 3 ntu because the filtration time was fixed in cycles 2 to 10 the cleaning efficacy of the different backwashes teb and reference bws can be evaluated by the gross amount of permeate produced per membrane area m cf fig 9 our main finding is the following order of cleaning efficacy flux reference bw teb pressure reference bw hence the cleaning efficacy of the teb was similar to other mechanical backwash methods and notably it was higher than a backwash at the same transmembrane pressure all cleaning methods yielded stable operation over the investigated period the hydraulic resistance during all cleaning steps teb and reference bws cf open symbols in fig 9 was lower than during the fouling steps this fact was attributed to the respective cleaning efficacy and absent concentration polarization during the cleaning steps during teb the ph of the water shifted from 7 9 0 1 to 9 4 0 6 upon the temperature rise the solubility of co2 decreased and thus co2 was stripped from the backwash water decreasing its acidity lc ocd ond analysis was conducted in order to elucidate the fate of organics during filtration and teb lc ocd of relevant retention time cf fig 10 for exact definition of the different fractions namely biopolymers molecular weight 20 kg mol 1 humic substances molecular weight 1 kg mol 1 etc the reader is referred to huber et al 2011 during the filtration step biopolymers were well retained r 1 c p c f 66 whereas retention of humic substances was lower r 18 and seemed to depend on molecular weight displayed as lc retention time the temperature treatment during teb lead to agglomeration of humic substances cf permeate after teb in fig 10 identified by a decrease of the humic substance peak 28 and an increase of the biopolymer peak 160 that did not contain any detectable organic nitrogen cf table 2 thus a protein origin of this signal was excluded analyzing the wash water the discarded water leaving the module during backwash revealed that the biopolymer content was even higher and did not contain any detectable organic nitrogen we concluded that this organic fraction originated from temperature induced agglomeration of humic substances and or removed organic filter cake in addition this data suggests that organic nitrogen entered the membrane module during filtration of river water but most of it was not flushed out during cleaning hence we assume that protein deposition significantly contributed to the observed fouling either by gel cake layer formation kim et al 1992 mourouzidis mourouzis and karabelas 2006 or internal adsorption clark et al 1991 4 conclusions in this study an alternative membrane cleaning method is proposed and investigated the so called temperature enhanced backwash teb the teb is a vapor pressure driven membrane permeation process that coincides with evaporation in at the end of membrane pores from this study the following conclusions can be drawn for the tested 100 kda membranes water predominantly permeated in liquid state under teb conditions with temperature t ranging from 115 to 141 c and according vapor pressure δ p ranging from 0 7 to 2 7 bar gauge teb t 125 c δ p 1 35 bar for membranes previously fouled with silica nanoparticle dispersions was better or as good as mechanical backwashing δ p 1 35 6 26 bar at ambient temperature the cleaning efficacy mainly depended on the mass flux during backwashing it increased with increasing mass flux the teb was proofed to be a competitive cleaning method in multi cycle fouling and cleaning using river water the fate of organics was elucidated by lc ocd ond to sum up the teb showed competitive cleaning efficacy compared to mechanical backwashing as demonstrated experimentally using silica nanoparticles humic acid and river water hence we conceive a potential application of teb in decentralized drinking water treatment together with gravity driven filtration because the overall process can be operated with intermittent or even without electrical power input

at least 15 min until flux was constant all given pressures are transmembrane or gauge pressures respectively unless stated otherwise 2 2 membrane permeation membrane permeation was investigated with different media i water at t 20 c δ p 0 5 2 7 bar using the filtration setup described in section 2 4 cf fig 1 ii boiling water at 115 141 c 0 7 2 7 bar using the teb setup described in section 2 4 cf fig 2 and iii saturated steam under same conditions as ii in case of saturated steam feed the membrane was previously dried in an oven at 130 c overnight for 16 22 h to eliminate condensed water in the pores 2 3 scaling and salt passage scaling does not occur in ultrafiltration at ambient temperature however during teb the liquid feed phase opposes the steam equilibrium phase on the permeate side at ambient pressure cf section 2 2 whether the expected partial evaporation leads to scaling was investigated using a teb feed solution with concentration of 1 84 mm caso4 caso 4 2 h 2 o from carl roth germany representing 12 5 of its solubility at 20 c salt concentration was quantified by hplc cation column metrosep c4 250 and ca 2 detection conductivity sensor 2 4 fouling and cleaning with model solutions one fouling and cleaning experiment consisted of six steps membrane conditioning and initial water permeation fouling with model solution rinsing and water permeation actual cleaning with different backwashes final water permeation and chemical enhanced backwash defined membrane fouling was conducted in dead end mode filtering inside out at constant pressure of 0 50 0 05 bar until 0 25 kg permeate were collected using the filtration setup displayed in fig 1 permeate mass flux and feed pressure were logged continuously with a balance δ m 0 2 g and pressure sensor 0 25 bar respectively ambient and permeate temperature were 20 2 c in all experiments prior to fouling water permeation was performed under the same conditions for 7 min after a constant resistance was obtained double distilled water was used for water permeation as well as for the preparation of fouling solutions two different model fouling solutions were prepared on a daily basis with a volume of 1 l each silica nanoparticles 130 mg l 1 colloidal silica ludox hs 40 sigma aldrich germany with a nominal diameter of 12 nm was dispersed in 20 mm na2hpo4 kh2po4 buffer of ph 8 this model fouling solution causes strong and well reproducible membrane fouling humic acid 20 mg l 1 humic acid sodium salt technical grade sigma aldrich germany was dissolved in 1 mm cacl2 solution cacl 2 2 h 2 o from carl roth germany ph was adjusted to 8 with 1 m naoh the obtained toc was approx 7 mg l 1 this model fouling solution has suitable membrane fouling properties and characteristics being close to natural water lee et al 2004 after fouling a rinsing step was conducted the fouling solution in the feed tank cf fig 1 was exchanged for double distilled water therefore the drain valve was slightly opened for about 1 min to release fouling solution drop by drop in this way the membrane was rinsed and air bubbles originating from solution exchange were eliminated then water permeation was performed under the same conditions as before the cleaning step consisted of different backwash methods using double distilled water in order to evaluate the cleaning efficacy of temperature enhanced backwash and reference mechanical backwash respectively temperature enhanced backwash teb the membrane module was mounted in the teb setup displayed in fig 2 in backwash mode outside in filtration the autoclave cv el 18 certoclav sterilizer gmbh austria was filled with 3 l water so that the membrane module was submerged at all times feed from liquid phase the autoclave was heated in steam atmosphere to 125 c 1 35 bar the plug valve was opened for 7 min to backwash the membrane reference backwash bw the membrane module was reversed outside in filtration in the filtration setup fig 1 permeate temperature was 20 2 c two different reference backwashes were performed for 7 min i pressure reference backwash with the same transmembrane pressure δ p of 1 35 bar and ii flux reference backwash with similar mass flux m the corresponding transmembrane pressure was estimated appyling darcy s law 1 r δ p η j δ p ν m with constant membrane resistance r and backwash flux j and m respectively assuming that liquid water permeated the pores in teb η 125 c l i q 2 2 10 4 pa s ν 125 c l i q 2 4 10 7 m 2 s 1 the corresponding transmembrane pressure was calculated to δ p 5 82 6 26 bar mainly depending on temperature and water density the upper bound of 6 26 bar was selected for the experiments and measured mass flux data verified this estimation after the cleaning step the membrane module was re mounted in the filtration setup fig 1 inside out filtration and final water permeation was conducted under the same conditions as before finally a chemical enhanced backwash was performed using 1 m naoh to restore the initial membrane resistance in this way membranes were reused in the experimental series of the same fouling solution 2 5 multi cycle fouling and cleaning with river water ten fouling cycles were conducted with rur river water feed samples were collected downstream of the waste water treatment plant niederzier krauthausen at n 50 50 99 1 e 6 26 32 6 on 13 05 and 27 06 2016 during dry weather the samples were stored at 5 c until usage prior to usage the samples were re suspended and temperature was re adjusted to ambient temperature the mean feed water characteristics are shown in table 1 during the initial filtration cycle 3 l of permeate were collected which corresponds to the minimum volume required to fill the volume of the autoclave for teb application each filtration cycle took 1 5 h at δ p 0 5 bar and 1 h except the initial cycle at δ p 1 5 bar all cleaning steps teb and reference backwashes were performed under the same conditions as in section 2 4 however no rinsing step was conducted furthermore permeate was used for the backwashes teb and reference bw finally the transmembrane pressure for the flux reference backwash was determined empirically in this case δ p 4 19 bar composite samples of feed permeate permeate after teb temperature treated during teb and wash water discarded water leaving the module during teb were taken during the last teb cycle and analyzed by liquid chromatography with organic carbon and nitrogen detection lc ocd ond the analysis was performed with lc ocd model 8 by doc labor dr huber germany according to huber et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane permeation fed from saturated steam and boiling liquid before conducting practical fouling and cleaning experiments the permeation behavior was studied in order to better understand the nature of the presented temperature enhanced backwash the state of matter of water when permeating through the membrane under teb conditions was evaluated using darcy s law eq 1 assuming constant hydraulic resistance of the membrane r m e m b r a n e this yielded an effective viscosity ν e f f that was compared to the corresponding viscosities of saturated steam ν s and boiling liquid ν l a linear interpolation resulted in the determination of liquid fraction α l permeating under teb conditions cf section 2 2 2 α l ν e f f r m e m b r a n e p t ν s p t ν l p t ν s p t basic assumption for this interpolation was that the steam liquid composition liquid fraction is constant in the pores in the selective membrane layer that dominate the membrane resistance δ p d p o r e 4 if this assumption was not correct only a semi quantitative classification of the effective viscosity would be possible applying equation 2 resulted in a liquid fraction in the pores of 98 100 liquid feed and 89 92 steam feed respectively compare fig 3 in case of liquid feed effective and liquid viscosity cannot be differentiated in case of steam feed the large liquid fraction in the pores can be explained by prevailing capillary condensation in mesopores jones et al 2016 have proposed a theoretical mechanism of even superheated liquid being stable in cylindrical μm pores and vincent et al 2017 experimentally have observed fast capillary condensation kinetics in pores of 4 nm from saturated steam being like imbibition from a contacting liquid phase in this study the pore size of the 100 kda membrane was about 10 20 nm identified by fesem imaging grain size in selective layer of approx 50 nm cf fig 4 and molecular weight cut off translating to a pore diameter of 9 13 nm according to sarbolouki 1982 supporting the supposed capillary condensation hence we validated the assumption of liquid water in the pores of section 2 4 3 2 scaling and salt passage as fig 5 shows no salt was rejected during teb due to the transport governed by transmembrane pressure convective transport no scaling of the little soluble caso4 could be observed by flux decline this finding is in agreement with predominating permeation in liquid state as evidenced in section 3 1 the ca concentration in the feed slightly rose from 73 9 to 82 6 mg l 1 during the experiment which was mainly attributed to evaporation from the feed during the heat up phase with opened vent valve which was necessary to yield steam atmosphere 3 3 effect of temperature and backwash flux on cleaning after model solution fouling cf fig 6 rinsing and the different backwashes teb and reference bws were conducted with varying temperature and flux their cleaning efficacy was evaluated using the normalized residual fouling resistance r r e s i d u a l f o u l i n g r f o u l i n g this measure bases on the resistance in series model with constant membrane resistance r m e m b r a n e and variable fouling resistance r f o u l i n g 3 r t o t a l r m e m b r a n e r f o u l i n g the term r r e s i d u a l f o u l i n g denotes the residual fouling resistance after a certain cleaning step either rinsing or backwash teb or reference bw the normalized residual fouling resistance r r e s i d u a l f o u l i n g r f o u l i n g equals 0 and 1 for a completely cleaned or not cleaned membrane respectively fouling with silica nanoparticles was well reproducible and the flux stabilized at approx 50 kg m 2 h 1 cf fig 6 we suppose that the stabilization originated from a temporary equilibrium between built up gel cake layer lowering the flux and backtransport of silica nanoparticles due to mutual electrostatic repulsion the rinsing step already removed parts of the fouling layer this removal is exhibited by the lowered normalized residual fouling resistance r r e s i d u a l f o u l i n g r f o u l i n g 1 cf fig 7 a hence we concluded that the silica nanoparticles predominantly formed a supposedly loose cake layer that can be removed by small shear force subsequent cleaning by teb yielded a significantly lower normalized residual fouling resistance and thus higher cleaning efficacy than the pressure reference backwash cf fig 7 a the normalized residual fouling resistance after teb was similar to the one after flux reference backwash increasing cleaning efficacy with increasing backwash flux was also reported by huang et al 2007 moreover the cleaning efficacy added to the one of the preceding rinsing step in all three conducted teb replicates this additional cleaning efficacy was not observed in two out of four bw replicates for both pressure and flux reference however since there was no statistically significant difference of normalized residual fouling resistance after teb and after flux reference bw respectively we assume that temperature itself is not an influence factor the functional hydroxyl groups of the virtually inert inorganic silica nanoparticles do not significantly respond to the temperature shift the vast majority of hydroxyl groups is deprotonized and present as silanolates ludox hs 40 pka 2 sulpizi et al 2012 leading to mutual repulsion on the contrary elevated temperature decreases gelation time for 30 wt ludox hs at ph 5 from approx 300 min 21 c to about 2 min 99 c dupont ludox colloidal silica product information without date which had no adverse effect on the cleaning efficacy in the conducted experiments hence we conclude that the cleaning efficacy correlated with the backwash flux under the investigated experimental conditions fouling with humic acid solution was less consistent as compared to silica nanoparticle fouling in particular the rinsing step increased the fouling resistance significantly in most of the cases r r e s i d u a l f o u l i n g r f o u l i n g 1 cf fig 7 b this increase in resistance was probably caused by decreasing solubility and thus precipitation of humic acid onto the membrane surface as the ph decreased from 8 fouling solution to approx 5 double distilled water kipton et al 1992 in the subsequent cleaning step teb and reference bw the removal of fouling resistance caused by humic acid was generally less than silica and also less consistent in particular two cases for teb could be differentiated low n 2 and high flux n 2 during teb respectively the former lead to even further increased resistance whereas the latter decreased the resistance consistently showing some cleaning efficacy since the experiments were all conducted with the same membrane sample effect of hysteresis could be excluded by the order of experiments thermally induced change of the chemical structure of humic acid was excluded by studies of chen et al 1978 and francioso et al 2005 they have found that for natural humic acids mainly decarboxylation of acidic groups and decomposition cleavage of c c bonds takes place around approx 300 c and above 370 c respectively dehydration of humic acids occurs at 60 120 c we verified that humic acid precipitated at elevated temperatures and precipitation tendency increased with increasing temperature and concentration cf fig 8 in particular precipitation also occurred at the feed concentration and 125 c hence we attribute the case of further increased resistance to precipitation of humic acid on the membrane surface it remains to elucidate what leads to favorable cleaning efficacies furthermore the effect of backwash flux on cleaning efficacy was not significant in general however the normalized residual fouling resistance after teb with high backwash flux was at least consistently lower than the one after rinsing at last we suppose humic acid to cause membrane fouling by adsorption present ca 2 ions possibly formed bridges that linked the negatively charged oxidic surface of the ceramic membrane zr o al o to the organic carboxyl groups of the humic acid vermöhlen et al 2000 aquino et al 2008 muneer and oades 1989 majzik and tombácz 2007 once precipitated on the inner membrane surface humic acid seemed to be hard to remove precipitation might be prevented by short temperature exposure times which will be subject to future studies 3 4 river water filtration the different cleaning methods were compared under real conditions using river water rur river downstream of a waste water treatment plant raw water characteristics for the third run pressure reference bw second raw water sampling were very similar as compared to the first sampling all average values within standard deviation except for uv254 9 8 and conductivity 32 due to a rain event preceding the second sampling each run was conducted with another membrane sample initial membrane resistances were similar hence the runs could be compared directly this was also confirmed by very similar retentions retentions for turbidity toc and uv254 were 95 3 8 12 and 4 3 respectively cf table 1 hence organic removal was low whereas particle removal was excellent and decoupled from the raw water level all permeate samples 0 3 ntu because the filtration time was fixed in cycles 2 to 10 the cleaning efficacy of the different backwashes teb and reference bws can be evaluated by the gross amount of permeate produced per membrane area m cf fig 9 our main finding is the following order of cleaning efficacy flux reference bw teb pressure reference bw hence the cleaning efficacy of the teb was similar to other mechanical backwash methods and notably it was higher than a backwash at the same transmembrane pressure all cleaning methods yielded stable operation over the investigated period the hydraulic resistance during all cleaning steps teb and reference bws cf open symbols in fig 9 was lower than during the fouling steps this fact was attributed to the respective cleaning efficacy and absent concentration polarization during the cleaning steps during teb the ph of the water shifted from 7 9 0 1 to 9 4 0 6 upon the temperature rise the solubility of co2 decreased and thus co2 was stripped from the backwash water decreasing its acidity lc ocd ond analysis was conducted in order to elucidate the fate of organics during filtration and teb lc ocd of relevant retention time cf fig 10 for exact definition of the different fractions namely biopolymers molecular weight 20 kg mol 1 humic substances molecular weight 1 kg mol 1 etc the reader is referred to huber et al 2011 during the filtration step biopolymers were well retained r 1 c p c f 66 whereas retention of humic substances was lower r 18 and seemed to depend on molecular weight displayed as lc retention time the temperature treatment during teb lead to agglomeration of humic substances cf permeate after teb in fig 10 identified by a decrease of the humic substance peak 28 and an increase of the biopolymer peak 160 that did not contain any detectable organic nitrogen cf table 2 thus a protein origin of this signal was excluded analyzing the wash water the discarded water leaving the module during backwash revealed that the biopolymer content was even higher and did not contain any detectable organic nitrogen we concluded that this organic fraction originated from temperature induced agglomeration of humic substances and or removed organic filter cake in addition this data suggests that organic nitrogen entered the membrane module during filtration of river water but most of it was not flushed out during cleaning hence we assume that protein deposition significantly contributed to the observed fouling either by gel cake layer formation kim et al 1992 mourouzidis mourouzis and karabelas 2006 or internal adsorption clark et al 1991 4 conclusions in this study an alternative membrane cleaning method is proposed and investigated the so called temperature enhanced backwash teb the teb is a vapor pressure driven membrane permeation process that coincides with evaporation in at the end of membrane pores from this study the following conclusions can be drawn for the tested 100 kda membranes water predominantly permeated in liquid state under teb conditions with temperature t ranging from 115 to 141 c and according vapor pressure δ p ranging from 0 7 to 2 7 bar gauge teb t 125 c δ p 1 35 bar for membranes previously fouled with silica nanoparticle dispersions was better or as good as mechanical backwashing δ p 1 35 6 26 bar at ambient temperature the cleaning efficacy mainly depended on the mass flux during backwashing it increased with increasing mass flux the teb was proofed to be a competitive cleaning method in multi cycle fouling and cleaning using river water the fate of organics was elucidated by lc ocd ond to sum up the teb showed competitive cleaning efficacy compared to mechanical backwashing as demonstrated experimentally using silica nanoparticles humic acid and river water hence we conceive a potential application of teb in decentralized drinking water treatment together with gravity driven filtration because the overall process can be operated with intermittent or even without electrical power input
