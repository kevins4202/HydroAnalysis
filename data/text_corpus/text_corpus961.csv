4805,the aquifer at varzeqan plain with multiple confined unconfined and hard rock boundaries is exposed to risks from several contaminants nitrate n fluoride and arsenic originated by anthropogenic and or geogenic activities which are possibly accelerating by anthropogenic activities the study is a research initiative driven by impacts of poor or non existent planning regulation practices to produce insights despite the sparsity of the available data and the unknown baseline a methodology is given which seeks total information management by pooling together the following five dimensions i a perceptual model to collect existing knowledge base ii a conceptual model to analyse a sample of ion concentrations by a set of existing techniques e g statistical graphical and multivariate analysis iii risk cells to contextualise each contaminant iv soft modelling to firm up information by learning from convergences and or divergences within the conceptual model and v study the processes within each risk cell through the osprc framework origins sources pathways receptors and consequence the research caters for inherent variabilities in the study area by 15 risk cells delineated within the boundaries of confined unconfined and hard rock aquifers as follows 4 risk cells account for minor ions of nitrate n pollution of anthropogenic origins 6 for minor ions of fluoride and 5 for trace ions of geogenic arsenic anomalies it further identifies the possibility of anthropogenic activities encouraging geogenic anomalies the findings are presented as a descriptive model but this will be transformed into quantitative models in due course when more data become available keywords anthropogenic geogenic complex aquifer confined unconfined hard rock osprc risk cells soft modelling graphical method multivariate analysis varzeqan plain 1 introduction the concepts of risk cells and soft modelling for the detection of arsenic anomalies as introduced by nadiri et al 2018a are extended and applied in this paper to take up the challenge of aggregating risks in multiple aquifers with confined unconfined and hard rock boundaries exposed to more than one contaminant from anthropogenic and or geogenic origins the challenge takes shape by a framework in five dimensions and refers to it the total information management tim in a generic fashion as follows i a perceptual model to summarise existing data and past studies ii a conceptual model to identify contaminants by using any set of traditional techniques statistical graphical multivariate analysis and geological survey iii risk cells to define the domain of each contaminant iv soft modelling to learn from convergences and or divergences of the diverse set of conceptual models to firm up the emerging insight into a study area and v risk cell to study inherent processes by the well known framework of origins sources pathways receptors and consequence osprc where origin was added by the authors to the familiar sprc framework these dimensions are illustrated in fig 1 each detailed in due course the problems within the scope of the paper are better understood within a global perspective on risks to aquifers by the following two basic developments since the world war ii i crop production and livestock were increased significantly by the green revolution since the 1950s but impacted on the environment by using nitrate n based fertilisers tilman et al 2001 galloway et al 2008 ii a policy driven planning system is replacing past ad hoc procedures to mitigate past impacts but such practices are yet to penetrate globally the emerging policy driven systems put a grip over impacts of the green revolution which are complemented by participatory decision making procedures e g the aarhus convention as adopted in europe https ec europa eu environment aarhus legislation htm however policymaking and research require drivers to set their action plans missions and visions and the paper is inspired by i the united nations sustainable goals https www un org sustainabledevelopment ii international water association iwa principles for water wise cities https iwa network org projects water wise cities and iii and the iwa strategic plan for 2019 2024 https iwa network org wp content uploads 2015 12 iwa strategic plan 2019 2024 pdf the tim takes up the challenge by developing tools inspired by the above drivers for complex aquifers exposed to multiple contaminants when data are sparse through studying practical problems i of identifying origins sources of contaminants a review for which is outlined in table 1 and ii of risk aggregation problems as reviewed later an overview of the state of the art on nitrate n fluorides and arsenic is presented in appendices and their salient features are pooled together in table 1 without introducing each of their published works these techniques are fragmented and consist of a set of discrete techniques significant gaps evidenced by the table are outlined as follows knowledge integration is not quite feasible there is no risk aggregation methodology which is not even topical the tendency is to identify single multiple contaminants with no aggregated risks as stated by grassi et al 2014 and nakaya et al 2018 the state of the art suffices to detecting contamination origins in managing groundwater contamination the widely practiced technique to assess risks to aquifers from contaminants is the use of human health risk assessment hhra given by usepa 2004 see also selvam et al 2020 this includes a protocol of indices to calculate carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risks from contaminants to humans using data samples including a set of prescribed values the risk aggregation problem sought by the paper is not based on these protocols as the paper explores a different approach aggregation of risk in aquifers in response to multiple contaminants is not a topical research yet but this is feasible through tim the authors introduced the concept of risk cells see nadiri et al 2017 nadiri et al 2018a sadeghfam et al 2018a and sadeghfam et al 2018b to aggregated risk indices from anthropogenic contaminants such as nitrate n and from geogenic contaminants such as fluoride and arsenic nadiri et al 2017 only used such cells on a qualitative basis nadiri et al 2018a developed it for a quantitative aggregation of risks from anthropogenic nitrate n and geogenic arsenic origins both with diffuse sources but without hydrogeochemical analysis and sadeghfam et al 2018a sadeghfam et al 2018b aggregate anthropogenic risks from point and diffuse sources using total dissolved matter evidently the problem of aggregating risks from multiple aquifers and multiple contaminants is yet to be investigated and this forms a gap in research topics the authors recognise the gap and the paper shows that taking up the challenge is feasible through the tim framework using the above five dimensions depicted in fig 1 the dimensions of risk aggregation problem have been discussed in varying details by the authors e g nadiri et al 2017 2018a and sadeghfam et al 2018a 2018b but overall these applications are at their infancy particularly those concerning the last three dimensions tim gives rise collectively to an emerging capability to potentially aggregate risks from multiple origins with multiple point sources and diffuse sources and multiple contaminant the five dimensions of tim are implicit in authors past works but are made explicit in this paper and their justifications are outlined in due course the basin area under investigation is aharchay aharchayi the river ahar in the east azerbaijan province northwest iran as outlined in more details in due course the study is in a background where planning and regulation practices are poor ineffective or non existent and sparsity of the available data is a chronic problem as a result the baseline condition for the study of the aquifer is necessarily based on recent samples taken for this study due to the absence of a program of monitoring the health of the aquifer the goal of the paper is to explain impacts of major minor and trace ions in the study area and to maximise the information extracted from the sparse data to formulate perceptual and conceptual models and use them to build a qualitative risk aggregation model for nitrate n fluoride and arsenic anomalies 2 study area 2 1 geographical and geomorphological context of study area contaminant risks have realised at the system of the aharchay basin aharchay or ahar chay or the river ahar which is a complex system with multiple aquifers underlying varzeqan plain the sizeable city of varzeqan is located 70 km from northwest of tabriz east azerbaijan northwest iran see fig 2 the basin is approximately 1000 km2 and is divided into the eastern ahar sub basin not studied here and the western varzeqan sub basin forming the study area the plain is drained by aharchay or ahar chay the river ahar where ahar is another city in the east azerbaijan province approx 45 km east of varzeqan aharchay flows across the plain and is impounded by sattarkhan dam in ahar plain which is just outside the eastern end of the study area the eastern sub basin of aharchay basin just upstream of the dam is approx 500 km2 and forms the larger study area which is known varzeqan sub basin since the 1990s the region is subjected to considerable changes including a major open cast sungun mines at the northwest of the study area with possible impacts at more than one basin numerous lesser mines in the region an embankment reservoir at sattarkhan dam animal farming factories and using fertilisers in agricultural practices there is not much measured information on hydrology environmental factors to relate the current status to its past 2 2 hydrology and hydrogeology of study area aharchay flows from west to east and is impounded by the sattarkhan hydroelectric dam just outside of varzeqan plain at the east although a tailing dam to the north of varzeqan plain impounds water it is not certain to the authors on its significance as the mining activities are located outside the aharchay catchment the hydrostratigraphic layers of the alluvium aquifers are studied using the 27 exploratory wells drilled in the aquifers grain size of alluvial deposits in the northern part is coarser than other parts evidence was collected from geophysical studies exploratory wells piezometer and observation logs to identify the types of aquifers which comprise i hard rock aquifer with approx 293 km2 and ii alluvium aquifer including unconfined approx 150 km2 and confined approx 57 km2 aquifers nadiri et al 2017b confined aquifers are surrounded by the unconfined aquifer and these aquifers are surrounded by the hard rock aquifer varzeqan alluvium has given rise to aquifers classified into three main hydraulic conductivity sections see also fig 3 i high hydraulic conductivity approx 90 m d areas in the eastern part of the plain composed of coarse grain sizes ii moderate hydraulic conductivity approx 25 m d areas in the central part of the plain composed of sand gravel and silt grains iii low hydraulic conductivity approx 8 m d areas in the western part of the plain composed of silt clay with slight sand contents nadiri et al 2017b and iv hard rock aquifer with variable hydraulic conductivity surrounding unconfined and confined aquifers are composed of volcanic rock including andesite to andesitic tuff andesitic volcano sediment granite to diorite and rhyolitic to rhyodacitic volcano breccia using the data from 19 observation wells the overall groundwater flow direction is from west to east along a hydraulic gradient of 0 to 0 9 fig 3 which thought to coincide with the surface water flow direction the confined aquifer has just two piezometers and hence the detection of their groundwater flow directions is more challenging hard rock aquifers drain through 150 springs but alluvial aquifers through 252 withdrawal wells and 20 qanats groundwater withdrawals impact on the general shape of the groundwater level distribution map and generate depressions as in northern parts of the plain see fig 3 hard rock aquifer of the varzeqan sub basin are exposed to numerous volcanic and tectonic activities tectonic activities play an important role in occurrences of springs and recharging unconfined aquifers demand for water has increased over the years since 1990 from agricultural industrial and domestic supplies in the region including the city of varzeqan the highest groundwater level would occur in may due to highest recharge and the lowest groundwater level would occur in august due to over abstraction for irrigation through the last three months the mean rate of decline in groundwater levels is approx 0 3 m year over the past few decades the quality of groundwater and surface water resources of the region can also be affected by the wastewater from the sungun copper mine see figs 2 and 4 which has only one tailing dam but somehow outside the mine at the north of varzeqan plain 2 3 geology the focus of this study is on the confined and unconfined aquifers within the eastern sub basin of aharchay fig 4 impacted by anthropogenic activities and by the flanking hard rock aquifer surrounding the plain at its north west and south the rock formations outside the hard rock aquifer within the basin are likely to play a role on the water quality within the confined and unconfined aquifers of varzeqan sub basin confined aquifers are partially composed of clay and fine sediments covering the older alluvium sheet whereas the unconfined aquifer is mostly younger alluvium and composed of coarse grains which surrounds pockets of the confined aquifers alluvial confined and unconfined aquifers are located in piedmont fans of quaternary formations closer to aharchay and its tributaries in the varzeqan sub basin mehrpartou et al 1992 quaternary alluvial sediments overlie pliocene formations as a basement and these sediments are composed of conglomerate the quaternary alluvial sediments are by and large composed of silt sand and clay grain size the central quaternary and pliocene formations are surrounded by older formations including intrusive igneous rocks at the north such as granite to diorite and extrusive igneous rocks at the south such as rhyolitic to rhyodacitic volcano breccia see fig 4 the northwest of the sub basin is covered by andesite and trachyandesite with upper cretaceous period age volcanic and volcanogenic rocks of eocene cover remaining areas see nadiri et al 2017b 2 4 groundwater monitoring network and available data there are 21 piezometers installed in varzeqan plain to monitor groundwater levels distributed over the entire region shown in fig 4 these together with further wells were installed to measure water quality for the study area in october 2015 for which the total number of wells was 50 their data from these withdrawal wells and springs were measured in 2015 these samples are analysed in due course which provide evidence that the study area is exposed to risks from nitrate fluoride and arsenic ions the samples taken in 2015 for this study were analysed in the hydrogeological laboratory at the university of tabriz which included major ions and a set of minor and trace ions as well as ph electric conductivity ec by standard methods apha 1998 see table 3 later for all the 50 samples major and minor ions were analysed but of which only 38 samples have measurements of arsenic concentration therefore the graphical method uses 50 sample for interpretation but the multivariate analysis uses 38 samples for arsenic concentrations 3 methodology to aggregate risks this section presents the methodology for total information management to aggregate risks with multiple aquifers from multiple contaminants using the five dimensions introduced above 3 1 existing capabilities on risk to human health although the paper is not minded with using the protocol of indices related to human health risk assessment hhra given by usepa 2004 it is outlined to minimise confusions hhra combines risk and the concepts of human health to estimate the degree of harm by carcinogenic or non carcinogenic contaminants to human body exposures through such pathways as inhalation oral and dermal intakes where the term pathways in health problems is quite different than those in the osprc framework hhra identifies i hazard identification when exceeding allowable contamination level ii dose response assessment expressing a relationship between exposures and adverse health responses iii exposure assessment to a pollutant by considering oral and dermal pathways and iv risk characterisation to estimate probabilities of exposures to contaminants the paper precludes such indices 3 2 total information management 3 2 1 dimension 1 the perceptual model perceptual and conceptual models are well established both in research and practice but without the explicit branding as used in the paper the generic features of a perceptual model is the identification of past desktop studies using observations from site visits and collecting published general purpose data on geological formations of the site risk assessment exercises and any other studies the scope of a perceptual model is to identify the primary building blocks without necessarily producing evidence for the aim of formulating the risk aggregation problem for a site these building blocks include aquifer details their interactions land use potential pollutants to flag anthropogenic hazards mineral composition of the underlying strata to flag possible geogenic processes perceptual models should be more than initial opinions formed by experts 3 2 2 dimension 2 conceptual model the generic features of conceptual models are driven by modelling activities and in hydrogeochemical studies these comprise a diverse set of techniques including statistical techniques graphical techniques multivariate analysis and geological survey there is no requirement on using all of these techniques but only those are selected that provide a sufficient insight into an understanding of a particular problem in research activities the focus is normally on the state of the art multivariate analysis and in practice the focus is on graphical techniques however the paper advocates a collective understanding to be drawn from all of these techniques through soft modelling as presented in section 5 in conceptual models the focus is on seeking evidence for delineating risk cells for a study area as outlined below 3 2 3 dimension 3 delineating risk cells building on nadiri et al 2017 nadiri et al 2018a sadeghfam et al 2018a and sadeghfam et al 2018b a study area is broken down into as many risk cells as required each of which defines a complete domain and allows the appropriate signals to pass through a risk cell occupies a spatial layout which may partially coincide with other risk cells but each allows the passage of information on individual risks through the process of osprc to be discussed in due course this is analogous to telephone lines which allow many different communications lines without interference 3 2 4 dimension 4 soft modelling knowledge integration in existing hydrogeochemical studies is retarded by investigating samples of concentrations of ions as the available techniques statistical analysis graphical methods multivariate analysis or isotope analysis are fragmented arguably different techniques often indicate partial convergences with similar results or divergences with conflicting results nadiri et al 2018a introduced soft modelling to use a collection of existing techniques in which the term soft modelling is adopted for hydrogeochemical studies by analogy to soft systems by checkland and scholes 1981 where each technique focuses on certain aspects of the problem e g identifying dissolutions and origin chemical processes such as ion exchange reverse ion exchange and detecting water types arguably knowledge integration is overlooked in hydrogeochemical studies but soft modelling aims to remove inherent barriers soft modelling treats knowledge integration by categorising the available techniques into levels of increasing complexity see nadiri et al 2018a where the idea derives from traditional modelling procedure as reviewed by khatibi 2012 in which models are treated through collecting data building preliminary models calibration validation and applications in these categorisation the information is sequentially firmed up through a knowledgebase outlined in appendix i table i 1 as follows level 0 to parse out available data and to form perceptual conceptual models level 1 to use statistical analysis of the sample data for learning inherent processes and chemical dissolutions level 2 to develop graphical diagrams hounslow 1995 with a degree of top down knowledgebase to learn types and sources of the ions in the dissolution in aquifers level 3 to use more mathematical techniques such as multivariate analysis cloutier et al 2008 delgado outeiriño et al 2009 to learn from data on pollutant sources attention is drawn to the primary difference of soft modelling with traditional techniques where soft models learn from convergences divergences through classifying the techniques at levels as outlined in table i 1 in appendix i however traditional use of the hydrogeochemical techniques are discrete and fragmented generally research papers suffice to techniques at level 3 or higher but the paper is rather detailed to illustrate soft modelling as there are three contaminants in the study area table 2 provides the knowledgebase available to the authrs to study the osprc processes appropriate to each contaminant 3 2 5 dimension 5 osprc risk cells the sprc framework was introduced recently to groundwater contamination studies by nadiri et al 2017 nadiri et al 2018a sadeghfam et al 2018a and sadeghfam et al 2018b in which they extended the framework to include the origin dimension hence osprc framework the original sprc framework is reviewed in detail by khatibi 2008 who suggests its suitability for the aggregation of multiple flood risks notably a framework refers to the consensual use of each of the dimensions as there is no theoretical or empirical basis for the choice of each dimension the osprc framework allows a unified approach for studying processes in risk aggregation problems its proof of concept is evident in the authors research for aggregating risk from arsenic anomalies contaminating a series of patchy aquifers driven by the geogenic origin where the risk was local but an impounding reservoir transformed the situation to a system wide risk in a study area in the east azerbaijan province northwest iran see nadiri et al 2017 whilst risk cells just delineate possible domains for each contaminant without taking on board the processes to study risks the osprc framework provides a basis to study inherent processes in a coherent manner the initial thinking in the sprc framework was the establishment of a descriptive approach for the processes linking hazard to consequence of a particular risk and more so of risk of floods e g see nathanail et al 2005 thorne et al 2007 khatibi 2008 in these processes source pathway and receptor refer to the physical process whereas consequence is a matter of societal values however to make the osprc framework a quantitative risk aggregation tool a further step is needed to make tim suitable for quantitative risk aggregation problems by dividing each risk cell to grids and study the osprc through the grids of risk cells this is a further step that is planned for future research activities 3 3 descriptive and quantitative risk aggregation the ultimate aim of the paper is to estimate risk indices by fully considering the osprc processes through the tim framework however this requires that the domain of each contaminant is identified in advance using its risk cell where their diffusions can be extrapolated under this condition anthropogenic contaminants can be studied by say the drastic framework and geogenic contaminants by say the spectr framework e g for fe and as similar to nadiri et al 2018b and sadeghfam et al 2018a sadeghfam et al 2018b the transformation of vulnerability mapping into risk mapping is then feasible and the authors have produced proof of concept for such risk mapping and risk aggregation problems these tasks did not involve hydrogeochemical studies of identifying origins sources and processes the paper takes a step forward and aims to integrate this problem with risk aggregation problems however a quantitative approach is not yet feasible as the domain of each contaminant needs further data to warrant a quantitative studies 4 preliminary results the results are presented at two stages of preliminary and detailed in which preliminary results brings together the analysis at level 0 and outlines any possible decisions for the next stage only dimension 1 2 and 3 contribute to preliminary results with the outcome of identifying risk cells and decisions on risk aggregation detailed results are then carried out by using the information from the latter four dimensions 4 1 preliminary results 4 1 1 dimension 1 results of perceptual model to contextualise the study area the basis for the perceptual model is the main characterisation of the study area presented in section 2 which contextualises the aquifer system as follows i there are two confined aquifers ii these are surrounded by one unconfined aquifer and iii both confined and unconfined aquifer are collectively surrounded by a larger hard rock aquifer allowing subterranean flows from upper catchments to springs with possible connectivity from upper catchment to specific points within the aquifer these aquifer divisions are the basis for building up a perceptual model a further aspect of the perceptual model of the study area is that up to 1970 it was in a rural agrarian region where the balance between land use and its rural agrarian economy was in balance with each other and sustainable water records show that i there is some decline in water table in recent years due to increased pumpage from the aquifers and ii there are pollution problems as shown by nadiri et al 2017b and 2018c and the present paper 4 1 2 dimensions 2 and 3 results of conceptual model and risk cells a conceptual model of the study area is developed at a preliminary stage by using the data sample outlined in section 2 4 and displayed in fig 4 with the map of the pie diagram of the samples the data are further summarised in table 3 which shows the statistical summary of the data and their maximum permissible concentration for natural water as per who 2004 as well as notes on data quality checks the table shows nitrate n that fluoride and arsenic values exceed their corresponding maximum permissible values a further parsing of the data indicates that both fluoride and arsenic concentrations are evidently high and local although they are not much diffused near their surroundings this is a key finding that there is a discontinuity in their distribution that needs to be explained the above findings serves as the knowledge base to delineate risk cells which are presented in fig 5 b d the salient features of which include i there are nearly 4 hotspots of nitrate n pollutions but most of the other observation wells also suffer from excess concentrations as per who 2004 permissible values and hence this risk is distributed system wide with variable concentrations ii there are 6 hotspots of fluoride concentrations but each surrounded by rather low values and hence this risk is currently viewed as local but under further investigations and iii there are 5 hotspots of arsenic contamination but other observation wells are within permissible ranges and hence this risk is currently viewed as local but under further investigations investigation of the dominant processes and identifying their origins are the main goal of this research the statistical summary in table 3 is that i most of the sampled major ions exceed their permissible values for drinking water standard who 2004 by a moderate margin but they are not alarming yet ii the study area is exposed to hotspots of nitrate n pollutions from anthropogenic origins reaching as much as five times the maximum allowed by the world health organisation who 2004 standards at 10 mg l iii hotspots of fluoride contaminations from geogenic origins reach as much as five times the maximum allowed by who standards at 1 5 mg l and iv hotspots of arsenic anomalies reach 0 1 μg l which is 10 times greater than the world health organisation who 2004 limit of 0 01 μg l the results presented in section 3 2 through table 2 confirm that the ions of nitrate n fluoride and arsenic are excessive enough to pose risks the emerging information was essential to delineate risk cells it further shows that electrical conductivity ec of the samples is between 200 and 2 520 μs cm 1 where high ec values often stem from fine grained particles impacting on residence time as it is increased for samples at central parts of the plain in the vicinity of the interfaces between the confined and unconfined aquifers the ph values range between 6 81 and 8 8 and hence the aquifers are in the range from neutral to basic water 4 1 3 dimension 3 results of soft models the above results are sufficient to show that the study area is impacted by nitrate n fluoride and arsenic concentrations and to delineate it to risk cells as displayed in fig 5b d which are further supported by the results given later in table 4 the primary feature of these results is that samples with excessively large concentrations do not seem to be diffusing to surroundings but there is not enough information yet to understand the discontinuity in their spatial variations the authors have reported in detail on the distribution of nitrate n within the complex aquifer system nadiri et al 2018 and 2017 and therefore there is no technical problem to a quantitative nitrate risk indexing model of the study area however as per fig 5b d the hotspots for both fluoride and arsenic are surrounded by lower values and the mechanism for developing risk indexing model can lead to gross errors without an insight to the spatial extend of diffusion of the contaminants hence the paper approach the problem of risk aggregation in qualitative terms 4 2 detailed results 4 2 1 overview risk cells identified in section 4 1 are in broad scale each of which can be studied through the osprc processes the focus of soft modelling is to firm up the information with respect to the dimension of origin and source and this section is focussed on both of these dimensions for each of the risk cells and as such it pools together the thinking for dimensions 2 3 and 4 hydrogeochemical studies presented in this section are under dimension 2 as a set of fragmented conceptual models but the extracted information from a set of these techniques are integrated through dimension 4 related to soft modelling in such a way that the information inherent in each technique is firmed up when they converge but table 4 flags their divergence the knowledgebase developed by the paper is summarised in appendix i table i 1 which bring together such concepts as chemical dissolutions their reduction or oxidation through ion exchange reverse ion exchange and identifying their origins as per nadiri et al 2018a 4 2 2 levels 1 2 the strength of tim is to integrate information and due to the discontinuity in the diffusion of fluoride and arsenic concentration the paper suffices to only a broad scale integration of information as explained before in relation to origin or source of the contaminants the information base is therefore extracted and presented in table ii 1 based on the results at levels 1 2 and 3 the actual modelling details are detailed in appendix ii correlation matrix is used at level 1 which is routine and therefore detailed in appendix ii its contributions to the aggregated information in table 4 include i strong correlations of ec with cl 0 87 hco3 0 9 so4 2 0 91 mg2 0 8 indicate the prevalence of water rock interactions in study area ii the r value of 0 68 of sodium with chloride indicates that sources of sodium are halite solution in groundwater and other sources iii correlation of both calcium and magnesium with sodium and potassium indicates the groundwater aquifer system encourages a possible ion exchange process iv weak correlation between ec and k 0 34 as well as that with no3 0 33 indicates that most of the ions are involved in a range of physiochemical reactions such as oxidation reduction and ion exchange in the groundwater aquifer system v the low correlation of fluoride with other ions may stem from different behaviours of fluorides releasing to water the following techniques are used at level 2 scatter diagram piper diagram and stiff diagram these are also routine and therefore are detailed in appendix ii their contributions to the aggregated information in table 4 based on the fig ii 1 include i most of the samples show dissolutions of calcite dolomite anhydrite gypsum or the simple dissolution process kumar et al 2006 venugopal et al 2009 iii ion exchange processes iii reverse ion exchange processes iv calcite dissolution see fisher and mulican 1997 based on the fig ii 1b na is found to be outcomes of halite dissolution or ion exchange based on fig ii 1c the zones prevailing in the study area are b temporary hardness d alkali carbonate and e mixing zone and based on fig ii 1d groundwater samples of this study area are from five diverse origins i limestone class c1 ii acidic igneous rocks class c2 iii basic igneous rocks class c3 iv mixing process class c4 v gypsiferous formations class c5 4 2 3 level 3 hierarchical cluster analysis hca hierarchical cluster analysis hca is a technique at level 3 of soft modelling which is a state of the art research tool to study site specific contamination problems it uses a set of multivariate techniques to group the data in appropriate classes reghunath et al 2002 which brings similar ions together in the same cluster hca uses 38 samples in terms of concentrations of ca2 mg2 na k cl s o 4 2 h c o 3 n o 3 ec f and as as well as chemical properties of ec and ph the dataset was scaled by z transformation and grouped by the ward s method ward 2012 and calculated similarity of samples by linkage with euclidean distance deza deza 2009 the dendrogram of hca results is given in fig 6 a which groups the data together by adopting a threshold value equal to 6 5 for the linkage distance based on the expert opinion the dendrogram infers a level of hydrochemical comparison among the three clusters and their cluster analysis shows the influence of nitrate n concentration in the classification where such an analysis is beyond the capability of the graphical methods as shown in fig 6a three cluster are identified and their salient features are as follows cluster i corresponds to 66 of all samples from groundwater for which major ions identified in their order of abundance through a detailed examination of the results as follows ca2 na mg2 k and hco3 cl so4 2 meq l evidently these results are indicative of abundance of limestone both in terms of the occurrence of ca2 and hco3 ions at areas recharged by rainfall and likely to be from volcanic rocks with high ph values whereas the samples are located in areas with bicarbonate type of groundwater notably these results quite converge with those identified by graphical techniques furthermore cluster i is associated with high nitrate n concentrations and high fluoride concentrations in hard rock aquifer cluster i brings the samples from wells 29 21 23 14 19 4 15 20 5 25 6 28 22 49 46 8 9 7 27 2 18 24 31 10 and 44 into one group cluster ii corresponds to 26 of all samples from the groundwater in which an examination of the results show that calcium and magnesium are at high levels due to containing fine grained silt and clay where their presence explains high ec values and high residence time as the cause for high groundwater salinity the excessive nitrate n and arsenic values occur in this cluster and the highest pollution of nitrate n occurs in the unconfined aquifer whereas the confined aquifer shows the least nitrate n pollution cluster ii brings the samples from wells 40 45 17 26 16 11 13 3 1 and 12 into one group cluster iii corresponds to 8 of all samples from the groundwater and located in the unconfined aquifer cluster iii brings the samples from wells 39 30 and 42 into one group and is located in alluvium with high nitrate n pollution 4 2 4 level 3 factor analysis fa factor analysis fa finds effective factors impacting on the hydrogeochemistry and the significance of correlation between factors and data variables table 5 presents the loading bars of three principal components and their representative variance the rotated factors are identified by high positive and negative loadings and near zero loadings as per davis 1986 maximum variance of the factors is extracted by the highest range of the positive or negative loadings the analysis identifies three factors with eigenvalues greater than one and their distribution presented in fig 6b d which is indicative of the relation between factors and the hydrogeological characteristics the three factors explain 72 of the variance factor i as per table 5 this factor is associated with high positive loadings of cl so4 2 mg2 ca2 hco3 na ec and these are suggestive of i water rock interactions and ii a general trend for dissolutions in groundwater at the study area an examination of detailed results shows that water rock interactions through the above ions would control approximately 39 73 of the groundwater chemical processes the interactions are not limited to one location but the flow through the aquifer encourages the trend for further interactions and dissolution processes this factor increases in the direction from west to east where the highest impacts arise at the basin centre see fig 6b factor ii as per table 5 this factor is associated with high positive factor loadings of no3 and ec arguably the presence of strong loading of no3 ions is indicative of an anthropogenic input to the groundwater system through the leaching from fertilisers in agricultural lands which is related to infiltrated surface water interacting with geological formations this would impact on groundwater quality and create contaminations stemming from anthropogenic activities largely related to agriculture with minor contributions from domestic sewage this factor controls approximately 19 34 of the data variance it affects the dissolution of minerals contained in fine grained sediments shale marl sodium and high salinity the highest impact of the factor is in discharge margins and within the confined aquifer characterised by more fine grained sediments and high salinity where the ion exchange process is quite dominant see fig 6c factor iii this factor control approximately 12 57 percent of data variance as per table 5 this factor is associated with high positive factor loadings of k and arsenic and high negative loading of fluoride but of low nitrate n loading bar and as such it indicates that the source of arsenic and fluoride is not anthropogenic high k may suggest that pollution is geogenic and caused by weathering of acidic igneous rocks include potassium feldspar leucite biotite or muscovite fluoride and arsenic anomalies originate largely from geogenic activities samples with high arsenic concentration have lower fluoride concentrations and this is reflected by negative values of fluoride loads such negative values between arsenic and fluoride loading should not signify reversal of chemical processes but of the absence of the appropriate load fig 6d shows areas of high fluoride and arsenic impacts 4 3 overview of mechanism to disperse pollutants an important focus of the results by graphical methods at level 2 is that groundwater samples in the varzeqan basin are largely located in zone b associated with temporal hardness and of good quality this is explained as follows i varzeqan aquifer is shallow and has low groundwater resistance time ii recharge areas of the aquifer comprise hard rock formations with minimum water rock interactions for the infiltrated water iii high quality surface water through the plain is in interaction with groundwater where the watercourses contribute to recharging the aquifer in the eastern parts of the plain but the aquifer drains to watercourses at its western parts and thereby reduces its residence time the results also give a focus on deteriorating groundwater quality at the interface between unconfined confined aquifers largely composed of fine grain sizes adversely increasing residence times two samples samples 32 37 located at the interface of aquifer margins between hard rock and unconfined aquifers are at zone d which reflect impacts of rhyolite igneous formations on hydrochemical processes of the aquifer nitrate n pollution the low nitrate n concentration in groundwater occurs at samples in high elevation areas e g r1 4 where lands are not suitable for agricultural activities moderate concentrations occur at unconfined aquifer r1 3 and within confined aquifers r1 2 high concentrations occur at margins of the interfaces between the confined and unconfined aquifers this nitrate n distribution is explained as follows i as agricultural activities are the main preoccupation in the study area they give rise to widespread nitrate n at the ground surface due to fertilisers ii groundwater from the surface at the plain is likely to percolate uniformly and this would act as a diffuse source by infiltrating waters washing high nitrate n concentration through percolation notably final concentration values are outcomes of the following intrinsic processes i nitrate n concentration at the ground surface ii amounts of groundwater recharge at the surface and iii the characteristics of aquifer media fluoride contamination based on the results of multivariate analysis fluoride contamination is geogenic due to the occurrence of fluoride bearing minerals in porphyry copper deposits system e g fluorite fluorapatite topaz mica cryolite and amphiboles these are found at the varzeqan basin and can spread through the study area which differ from other contaminants fluoride loads show random behaviour but their hotspots do not seem to be diffused widely in the study area arsenic contamination based on the results of multivariate analysis arsenic contamination in the study area is geogenic the origins of which are attributed to porphyry copper deposits these are found widely at the varzeqan basin and can spread through joints and faults they are also activated by hydrothermal activities arsenic loads are likely to be found at joints and faults of northern parts of the study area see osprc cells 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 the samples with high arsenic concentration show low sulphate high bicarbonate concentration and a ph value of approx equal to 7 these collectively indicate releasing of arsenic to water in reductive dissolution under anoxic condition the study identifies arsenic concentrations hotspots which do not seem to be diffused widely in the study area this is discussed further in section 5 6 4 4 possible interactions between anthropogenic geogenic processes the paper is minded with the difficult question that is there any interactions between anthropogenic and geogenic activities the results presented above are now refocussed towards answering the question and in a simple term the summary is that anthropogenic activities encourage geogenic processes these are detailed below confined aquifers at r1 1 and r1 2 are located in agricultural areas where nitrate n concentrations are the lowest this is explained on the grounds of low permeability of the topsoil and by the dominance of anoxic condition oxygen 5 mg l within the confined aquifers the process of nitrifying nh4 is under anoxic conditions at soil media which gives rise to controlled leaching of nitrate n to groundwater see raju et al 2015 now consider alluvial sandy soils in the unconfined aquifer r1 3 characterised by high nitrate n residence time and high permeability which gives rise to low nitrate n contamination in the groundwater see raju et al 2015 as anthropogenic activities maintain infiltrating nitrate ammonia through clayey soils the denitrification process is encouraged due to the natural presence of oxygen in clayey soils at the interface margins due to charge balances see also raju et al 2015 for noting similar processes hence geogenic factors could inadvertently control the amount of nitrogen leaching out already introduced to groundwater by anthropogenic activities the origin of arsenic loads at osprc cells 3 4a b confined aquifers and osprc cell 3 5 unconfined aquifer are not fully explained at this stage and the scale and the rate of the diffusion of existing anomalies are unknown this is one reason as the study is presented at a qualitative risk aggregation problem until further data are obtained for a better understanding however perceptual models are outlined below to pave the ground for conceptualisation of arsenic anomalies at osprc cells r3 4a b and r3 5 through the following perceptual models model 1 there are local arsenic bearing soil lenses and this is capable of explaining the above high local contaminations model 2 presence of uncontrolled widespread mining activities in recent years could contribute to the local hotspots of both fluoride and arsenic concentrations model 3 arsenic is distributed within the aquifer but in a diluted state up to recent years and therefore did not pose a serious source of risk whereas the declining water table in recent years at an average rate of 0 4 m annum reduces the dilution volume of water and thereby increases its arsenic concentration notably this would be an instance of anthropogenic activities triggering geogenic risks and likely to be the case nonetheless further information is needed to understand the process in a clearer term 4 5 dimension 5 osprc view of risk cells identification of contaminants their respective risk cells together with their origins and sources table 4 paves the ground for a quantitative mapping of the risk aggregation problem however the paper identified an apparent discontinuity in the spatial distribution of the fluoride and arsenic contaminants and therefore a study of the vulnerability within the aquifer and potential risk exposures are not technically feasible until the problem is explained if the above discontinuity was not the case the spatial distribution of nitrate n concentrations could have been modelled by using the drastic framework and those of fluoride and arsenic by using the spectr framework as introduced by the authors similar to nadiri et al 2018b and sadeghfam et al 2018a sadeghfam et al 2018b in the subsequent modelling procedure the risk cells would be superimposed on a grid cell where the authors refer to the combined cells as osprc cells the production of vulnerability and risk indices for the study area would then be a matter for following the procedure nonetheless the paper presents a qualitative osprc assessment of risk for the three contaminants through the study area in appendix iii 5 discussion the results at the early stage of the research identified a discontinuous diffusion of fluoride and arsenic concentrations risk mapping was not therefore possible until the domain of each contaminant at each risk cell was identified through a further samples to explain the nature of diffusion hence the remit of the paper is descriptive at this stage which also includes an account of the study with respect to other published works as well tiering the risks within its site regional and global contexts further discussion of the results the various aspects of the results were discussed in the previous sections but the following further issues are discussed in relation to nitrate n and calcium concentrations it is widely known that anthropogenic activities e g agricultural activities are the main origin for nitrate n contaminations see ref sacch et al 2013 and this is also true for the study area as exemplified by r1 2 and r1 3 nonetheless geogenic and or aquifer processes may also impact nitrate n contaminations for instance nitrate n concentration increases in the study area are impacted by the following factors i intense agricultural activities trigger increased nitrate n concentrations at ground surfaces ii characteristics of aquifer media or infiltration potential through the unsaturated zones play their roles and iii along some of the boundaries from the confined to unconfined aquifers there is some discontinuity results indicate that the concentration of calcium ions in the study area is significant but below that of the normal range in natural groundwater therefore calcium ions are not expected to no significant impacts on human health calcium ions in the study area are from two different origins i gypsiferous layers are partially the sources for calcium ions in the region which relate to the quaternary sediments and the r value of 0 92 table i 2 between calcium and sulphate suggests that gypsum may be a source of calcium ions ii there are calcite dissolution processes in the recharge areas of the aquifer where calcium ions are originated by high hco 3 concentrations introduced by rainfall water to the study area through hydro chemical processes fig 5a risk indexing a qualitative risk indexing would be possible for nitrate n but its quantitative aggregation with risks from fluoride and arsenic was seen to suffer from undue uncertainties without a better insight into the propagation of risks within the complex aquifer system in this study area the objective of the study was therefore transformed from a quantitative risk mapping into a qualitative risk study and their propagation in the aquifer is understood a quantitative risk aggregation problem can be formulated similar to authors work reported similar to nadiri et al 2018a nadiri et al 2018c and iii sadeghfam et al 2018a sadeghfam et al 2018b to the best knowledge of the authors there is no other published work to compare with the present results regional perspective the study area is now exposed to i the pollution risks from chemical and organic fertilisers ii the pollution risks from mining are not controlled or any control is ineffective and iii geogenic contaminations from hydrogeochemical processes within the aquifers increase some geogenic contaminant such as arsenic and fluoride prior to the arrival of mechanisation there was often a balance among interacting hydrosphere lithosphere biosphere and anthroposphere in the form of natural regimes local anthropogenic activities were often at a lower level and did not pose any regional risks there were no available data samples prior to those commissioned by this study but the results presented in table 3 suggest that none of the ions were at a scale to pose any hazard except for nitrate n fluoride and arsenic the baseline is unknown but it is safe to assume that the quality state of the aquifer was sustainable prior to 1970 the state of verzeqan aquifer is in decline with respect to water table and the quality of water for both drinking and agriculture since circa 1970 this is explained by the absence of any effective planning system as a result of which the tragedy of the commons is in evidence in the form of declining water table in the aquifers and deterioration of water quality global perspective risks to aquifers have amplified since the green revolution which increased food availability but simultaneously produced diffuse nitrate n pollutions impacting surface water and groundwater with major environmental impacts vitousek et al 1997 agren and bosatta 1988 galloway et al 2008 as such the amount of nitrogen transported into the oceans by the rivers in the world has roughly doubled since the 19th century and rates of nitrogen transport from developed areas have increased 10 to 50 folds meybeck 1982 the knowledge on a wide range of arsenic contaminations has emerged since the 1980s and as per rgs 2008 arsenic in drinking water was recognised as a serious problem in argentina chile and taiwan circa the early 1980s following its recognition in bangladesh during the late 1980s it developed into an international issue arsenic contamination has often a well defined relationship to particular geological units and hence to particular depth of wells plans for further research the qualitative risk aggregation problem presented by the paper is regarded as the first step towards its next phase of developing its quantitative risk aggregation model this requires further detailed sampling data gathering social data on impacts of the nitrate n pollution and fluoride and arsenic contaminations although currently this may not be likely gathering more geological data with a focus on the distribution of fluoride and arsenic and possibly other contaminants and surveying the operation of the vast mining industries in the area the greatest problem would be securing a sufficient budget for gathering data and therefore this phase may itself be carried out in phases to firm up the emerging knowledgebase until the full explanation of the underlying problems 6 conclusion with 50 000 inhabitants in in the study area in the varzeqan basin using groundwater as the main water resources for drinking and agriculture industry and mining the aquifer is now distressed including the decline of water table nitrate n fluoride and arsenic contaminations which are caused by the absence of an effective planning system the paper is an academic strive to understand the scale and scope of the problem and to produce tools that can in time help planners to treat the inherent problems the approach pooled together five dimensions comprising a perceptual model a conceptual models formulation of risk cells soft modelling using a set of traditional techniques but arranging them in hierarchical levels these are generic and can be applied to any aquifer problem as a generic tool for risk aggregation problems the emerging insight into the study area from the dimension of tim is capable of treating multiple contaminants and multiple aquifers the study of the perceptual model sets the context of the study by identifying the boundaries of confined unconfined and hard rock aquifers and also delineating risk cells to conceptualise the study by basic results of ion concentrations the presented methodology delineated 15 risk cells at a qualitative level where the problem of risks from nitrate n fluoride and arsenic contaminants can be studied and their emerging knowledge can be aggregated quantitative approaches require further data become available the approach developed in the paper provides the following insights into the study area i the baseline prior to 1970 was likely to have been good quality water ii with respect to major ions groundwater quality of study area now remains acceptable but variations in ec signifies active hydrochemical processes iii with respect to minor ions nitrate n pollution originates from intensive agricultural activities and exposes the porous media of the study area to risks from diffuse source of anthropogenic origins iv with respect to trace ions fluoride contamination is likely to originate from geogenic processes and to expose the porous media of the study area to seemingly local fluoride risks v likewise with respect to trace ions groundwater arsenic contamination is likely to originate from geological formation and to expose the aquifer to risks from geogenic origins the study reveals that anthropogenic activities may encourage geogenic risk exposures and without a sufficient amount of understanding the inherent processes mitigation measures can be haphazardly and hence the plan is to take the study to its next phase credit authorship contribution statement ata allah nadiri conceptualization methodology software data curation writing review editing supervision project

for soft modelling the information content of table i 1 derives from hounslow 1995 as formatted by nadiri et al 2018a and presents the relevant information in the tabular format the authors are

major ions iii minor ions iv arsenic concentration as a trace element and v physicochemical parameters appendix ii detailed results of soft modelling at level 1 and level 2 techniques at level 1 statistical analysis the paper uses pearson correlation r and scatter diagrams of binary ions the r values for the measured ions are given in table ii 1 which uses a bivariate correlation analysis between pairs of hydrochemical parameters the table also gives four designated bands to associate the strength of the r values with inherent processes overall a positive r value between two ions is suggestive of their common origins but negative values are of differing origins and processes table ii 1 summarises r values between the various ions and classifies them as four designated bands the salient features for which are presented below band for good correlation there is no particular ion in this band to signify the exclusive presence of a dissolution in the aquifer but the r value of 0 92 between calcium and sulphate indicates that gypsum may be a source of calcium in groundwater originating from gypsiferous layer in the region related to quaternary sediments strong correlation band as per subba 2002 the samples in this band are taken to be in a water rock interaction state where inherent processes may include some ion exchange and oxidation reduction reactions and dissolved ions would contribute to high r values between the ions and ec strong correlations of ec with cl 0 87 hco3 0 9 so4 2 0 91 mg2 0 8 indicate the trend for chemical activities and this may be explained by i the decline of water table in the basin due to over abstraction and a gradual loss of dilutions ii increasing residential time of groundwater and water rock interaction in low hydraulic conductivity area such as the interfaces between confined and unconfined aquifers moderate correlation band as per drever 1997 and mahlknecht 2003 the r value of 0 68 of sodium with chloride indicates that sources of sodium are halite solution in groundwater and other sources and that of both calcium and magnesium with sodium and potassium indicates the groundwater aquifer system encourages a possible ion exchange process notably strong correlation between ec and cl 0 87 hco3 0 9 so4 2 0 91 mg2 0 8 and weak correlation between ec and k 0 34 as well as that with no3 0 33 indicate that most of the ions are involved in a range of physiochemical reactions such as oxidation reduction and ion exchange in the groundwater aquifer system the low correlation of fluoride with other ions may stem from different behaviours of fluorides releasing to water scatter diagram of binary ions whilst r values provide an indication of ion dissolutions and their tendencies towards ion exchange or reverse iron exchange processes further information is extracted on the evolution of trends groundwater samples are studied as the binary ion of ca 2 mg 2 versus hco 3 so 4 2 to form a scatter diagram see fig ii 1 a the key feature on the figure is the 1 1 equiline with the following patterns of information i the samples close to the equiline would represent dominant reactions in forming dissolutions of calcite dolomite anhydrite or gypsum kumar et al 2006 venugopal et al 2009 which is referred to as the simple dissolution process guler et al 2002 ii the closeness of the majority of the sample points to the equiline is indicative of the solution of gypsum in the aquifer iii ion exchange processes are encouraged at sample points scattered away from the equiline towards high cation contents by an excess of hco 3 so 4 2 iii reverse ion exchange processes are encouraged in samples scattered away due to a large excess of ca 2 mg 2 over hco 3 so 4 2 iv fig ii 1 a indicates samples display calcite dissolution driven by adding hco 3 see fisher and mulican 1997 a further information is extracted from the sample data as per hounslow 1995 on the dissolution process being either saline water or halite dissolution it is realised that halite minerals of the pliocene formation in the study area are partially responsible for na in groundwater however approximately 80 of the water samples have na cl ratios significantly greater than 0 5 indicating existence of another sodium source which can be ion exchange in the study area red point shown in fig ii 1b indicates the ion exchange process for sample 26 from locations at the sighindil or syghyndil village in southeast study area the main processes contributing to chemical compositions in groundwater of the study area are the dissolution along the flow path the mixing with groundwater at the downstream area the ion exchange reactions these geochemical processes are responsible for the seasonal and spatial variations in groundwater

in the piper diagram see fig ii 1c the diamond plot is divided into five zones a b c d and e to distinguish different types of groundwater each zone is associated with certain anions and cations

basic igneous rocks class c3 iv mixing process class c4 v gypsiferous formation class c5 the results summarised in table 4 as per above results and those in fig ii 1 the quality of groundwater decreases gradually which is reflected by high ec values at the interfaces between unconfined and confined aquifers and subsequent increasing residence time appendix iii descriptive account of dimension 5 osprc processes the osprc framework is presented to study the full processes for each contaminant iii 1 outline of nitrate n osprc processes aquifers are exposed to the risk of nitrate n pollutions from two main origins i natural occurrences by oxidising organic matter at baseline conditions but panno et al 2006 indicate that natural nitrate n levels in relatively unmodified areas do not exceed 1 2 mg l ii anthropogenic activities which often arise from fertiliser overuses animal manures and domestic industrial sewage discharges see xue et al 2009 dubrovsky et al 2010 gu et al 2012 kaushal et al 2011 nakagawa et al 2017 and bondu et al 2018 an osprc overview of nitrate n occurrences is outlined below origins nitrate n risks from different origins expose aquifers to risks as i point source nitrate n often relate to accidental releases but this is not addressed by the paper or ii diffuse sources as investigated by the paper this often arises from dry depositions dissolved nitrogen in precipitation irrigation return flows fertilisers manure applications and leguminous crops the study area is primarily impacted by fertilisers and this will be evidenced by multivariate analysis presented in section 5 4 the process of oxidisation of fertilisers is the main source of nitrogen in the study area where oxidisation refers to the gain of oxygen or loss of electrons by a substance during a chemical reaction pathways nitrate n diffused into aquifers is no longer local but its pathways can be defined by flow and transport equations receptors nitrate n through groundwater will eventually cross the boundaries to receptors through the abstraction wells baseflows fed to watercourses plants and crops affecting food production consequences of human exposures to high nitrate n concentrations are severe health impacts such as methamoglobinaemia gastric problems in adults almasri 2005 thyroid gland hypothyroidism and cancer bryan and loscalzo 2017 iii 2 outline

dissanayake 1980 and rao negendra 2003 notably the mean concentration of the fluoride ions in the study area is 2 8 mg l and its maximum value is approx 8 1 mg l high fluoride concentration in

anthropogenic due to the use of fertilisers water rock interactions are often responsible for generating fluoride ions in aquifers within various geological settings saxena and ahmed 2003 nadiri et al 2013b source fluoride contaminations in groundwater may vary due to contribution of i dry and rainy seasons saxena and ahmed 2001 ii physicochemical parameters ozsvath 2006 iii geological settings gupta et al 2005 iv tectonic activities handa 1975 and v regional climates davraz et al 2008 presence of water in aquifers trigger a dissolution and the release of fluoride ions in alkaline media ph 7 6 to 8 6 and moderate electric conductivity ranging from 750 to 1750 µs cm see saxena and ahmed 2001 receptors are similar to the above anthropogenic pollutants consequence fluoride in small amounts is an essential component for normal mineralisation of bones and formation of dental enamel bell and ludwig 1970 exceedance of safe limits of fluoride poses risks to life due to undermining bones and dents structure its occurrence in water resources is risk to human health with such impacts as dental and skeleton fluorosis mahramanlioglu et al 2002 iii 3 outline of arsenic osprc processes arsenic is naturally found in the atmosphere water soil rocks and organisms in various organic or inorganic compounds occurrence of arsenic in natural forms is widespread and these are often described as arsenic loads a trace amount of arsenic is necessary for the sustenance of life and as such it does not necessarily pose risk to humans uthus 1992 generally arsenic contamination in water environments is geogenic and leaches out from salt minerals specially from the geological formations bearing sodium salts anwar et al 2003 origin presence of arsenic can occur through following origins geogenic nickson et al 2000 delgado outeiriño et al 2009 shukla et al 2010 bondu et al 2018 wen et al 2018 nadiri et al 2018a and xing et al 2019 biological li et al 2017 anthropogenic bundschuh et al 2011 khaska et al 2015 muhammad et al 2016 martin et al 2017 geogenic and anthropogenic he and charlet 2013 and wang et al 2014 high arsenic anomalies in groundwater are often geogenic also called natural tisserand et al 2014 pi et al 2018 cao et al 2018 and bondu et al 2018 main natural origins of arsenic include basin fill deposits guo et al 2014 xie et al 2016 wen et al 2018 geothermal and volcanic activities sengupta et al 2014 alsina et al 2013 peña reyes et al 2015 the paper is focussed on geogenic and anthropogenic origins the processes triggering the release of ionic arsenic from arsenic loads in aquifers include i reductive dissolution under anoxic aquifers ii alkali desorption under oxidic aquifers at ph 8 iii sulphide oxidisation under oxidic aquifers at ph 7 see unicef 2008 source arsenic anomalies can be mobilised from geogenic origins in aquifers at common groundwater ph values i e 6 5 ph 8 5 under both oxidising and reducing conditions through leaching out sorbed arsenic ions with the likelihood of adverse effects pathways are exclusively the aquifers but can also be plants with their roots penetrating to water table receptors are similar to those of anthropogenic pollutants consequence exceedance of safe limits of arsenic poses risks to life as it is a highly toxic and carcinogenic metalloid and its occurrence in water resources is risk to human health with such impacts as vascular and cerebrovascular diseases cancers infant mortality dermatologic disease kapaj et al 2006 bhattacharya et al 2007 2017 bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 hossain et al 2017

4805,the aquifer at varzeqan plain with multiple confined unconfined and hard rock boundaries is exposed to risks from several contaminants nitrate n fluoride and arsenic originated by anthropogenic and or geogenic activities which are possibly accelerating by anthropogenic activities the study is a research initiative driven by impacts of poor or non existent planning regulation practices to produce insights despite the sparsity of the available data and the unknown baseline a methodology is given which seeks total information management by pooling together the following five dimensions i a perceptual model to collect existing knowledge base ii a conceptual model to analyse a sample of ion concentrations by a set of existing techniques e g statistical graphical and multivariate analysis iii risk cells to contextualise each contaminant iv soft modelling to firm up information by learning from convergences and or divergences within the conceptual model and v study the processes within each risk cell through the osprc framework origins sources pathways receptors and consequence the research caters for inherent variabilities in the study area by 15 risk cells delineated within the boundaries of confined unconfined and hard rock aquifers as follows 4 risk cells account for minor ions of nitrate n pollution of anthropogenic origins 6 for minor ions of fluoride and 5 for trace ions of geogenic arsenic anomalies it further identifies the possibility of anthropogenic activities encouraging geogenic anomalies the findings are presented as a descriptive model but this will be transformed into quantitative models in due course when more data become available keywords anthropogenic geogenic complex aquifer confined unconfined hard rock osprc risk cells soft modelling graphical method multivariate analysis varzeqan plain 1 introduction the concepts of risk cells and soft modelling for the detection of arsenic anomalies as introduced by nadiri et al 2018a are extended and applied in this paper to take up the challenge of aggregating risks in multiple aquifers with confined unconfined and hard rock boundaries exposed to more than one contaminant from anthropogenic and or geogenic origins the challenge takes shape by a framework in five dimensions and refers to it the total information management tim in a generic fashion as follows i a perceptual model to summarise existing data and past studies ii a conceptual model to identify contaminants by using any set of traditional techniques statistical graphical multivariate analysis and geological survey iii risk cells to define the domain of each contaminant iv soft modelling to learn from convergences and or divergences of the diverse set of conceptual models to firm up the emerging insight into a study area and v risk cell to study inherent processes by the well known framework of origins sources pathways receptors and consequence osprc where origin was added by the authors to the familiar sprc framework these dimensions are illustrated in fig 1 each detailed in due course the problems within the scope of the paper are better understood within a global perspective on risks to aquifers by the following two basic developments since the world war ii i crop production and livestock were increased significantly by the green revolution since the 1950s but impacted on the environment by using nitrate n based fertilisers tilman et al 2001 galloway et al 2008 ii a policy driven planning system is replacing past ad hoc procedures to mitigate past impacts but such practices are yet to penetrate globally the emerging policy driven systems put a grip over impacts of the green revolution which are complemented by participatory decision making procedures e g the aarhus convention as adopted in europe https ec europa eu environment aarhus legislation htm however policymaking and research require drivers to set their action plans missions and visions and the paper is inspired by i the united nations sustainable goals https www un org sustainabledevelopment ii international water association iwa principles for water wise cities https iwa network org projects water wise cities and iii and the iwa strategic plan for 2019 2024 https iwa network org wp content uploads 2015 12 iwa strategic plan 2019 2024 pdf the tim takes up the challenge by developing tools inspired by the above drivers for complex aquifers exposed to multiple contaminants when data are sparse through studying practical problems i of identifying origins sources of contaminants a review for which is outlined in table 1 and ii of risk aggregation problems as reviewed later an overview of the state of the art on nitrate n fluorides and arsenic is presented in appendices and their salient features are pooled together in table 1 without introducing each of their published works these techniques are fragmented and consist of a set of discrete techniques significant gaps evidenced by the table are outlined as follows knowledge integration is not quite feasible there is no risk aggregation methodology which is not even topical the tendency is to identify single multiple contaminants with no aggregated risks as stated by grassi et al 2014 and nakaya et al 2018 the state of the art suffices to detecting contamination origins in managing groundwater contamination the widely practiced technique to assess risks to aquifers from contaminants is the use of human health risk assessment hhra given by usepa 2004 see also selvam et al 2020 this includes a protocol of indices to calculate carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risks from contaminants to humans using data samples including a set of prescribed values the risk aggregation problem sought by the paper is not based on these protocols as the paper explores a different approach aggregation of risk in aquifers in response to multiple contaminants is not a topical research yet but this is feasible through tim the authors introduced the concept of risk cells see nadiri et al 2017 nadiri et al 2018a sadeghfam et al 2018a and sadeghfam et al 2018b to aggregated risk indices from anthropogenic contaminants such as nitrate n and from geogenic contaminants such as fluoride and arsenic nadiri et al 2017 only used such cells on a qualitative basis nadiri et al 2018a developed it for a quantitative aggregation of risks from anthropogenic nitrate n and geogenic arsenic origins both with diffuse sources but without hydrogeochemical analysis and sadeghfam et al 2018a sadeghfam et al 2018b aggregate anthropogenic risks from point and diffuse sources using total dissolved matter evidently the problem of aggregating risks from multiple aquifers and multiple contaminants is yet to be investigated and this forms a gap in research topics the authors recognise the gap and the paper shows that taking up the challenge is feasible through the tim framework using the above five dimensions depicted in fig 1 the dimensions of risk aggregation problem have been discussed in varying details by the authors e g nadiri et al 2017 2018a and sadeghfam et al 2018a 2018b but overall these applications are at their infancy particularly those concerning the last three dimensions tim gives rise collectively to an emerging capability to potentially aggregate risks from multiple origins with multiple point sources and diffuse sources and multiple contaminant the five dimensions of tim are implicit in authors past works but are made explicit in this paper and their justifications are outlined in due course the basin area under investigation is aharchay aharchayi the river ahar in the east azerbaijan province northwest iran as outlined in more details in due course the study is in a background where planning and regulation practices are poor ineffective or non existent and sparsity of the available data is a chronic problem as a result the baseline condition for the study of the aquifer is necessarily based on recent samples taken for this study due to the absence of a program of monitoring the health of the aquifer the goal of the paper is to explain impacts of major minor and trace ions in the study area and to maximise the information extracted from the sparse data to formulate perceptual and conceptual models and use them to build a qualitative risk aggregation model for nitrate n fluoride and arsenic anomalies 2 study area 2 1 geographical and geomorphological context of study area contaminant risks have realised at the system of the aharchay basin aharchay or ahar chay or the river ahar which is a complex system with multiple aquifers underlying varzeqan plain the sizeable city of varzeqan is located 70 km from northwest of tabriz east azerbaijan northwest iran see fig 2 the basin is approximately 1000 km2 and is divided into the eastern ahar sub basin not studied here and the western varzeqan sub basin forming the study area the plain is drained by aharchay or ahar chay the river ahar where ahar is another city in the east azerbaijan province approx 45 km east of varzeqan aharchay flows across the plain and is impounded by sattarkhan dam in ahar plain which is just outside the eastern end of the study area the eastern sub basin of aharchay basin just upstream of the dam is approx 500 km2 and forms the larger study area which is known varzeqan sub basin since the 1990s the region is subjected to considerable changes including a major open cast sungun mines at the northwest of the study area with possible impacts at more than one basin numerous lesser mines in the region an embankment reservoir at sattarkhan dam animal farming factories and using fertilisers in agricultural practices there is not much measured information on hydrology environmental factors to relate the current status to its past 2 2 hydrology and hydrogeology of study area aharchay flows from west to east and is impounded by the sattarkhan hydroelectric dam just outside of varzeqan plain at the east although a tailing dam to the north of varzeqan plain impounds water it is not certain to the authors on its significance as the mining activities are located outside the aharchay catchment the hydrostratigraphic layers of the alluvium aquifers are studied using the 27 exploratory wells drilled in the aquifers grain size of alluvial deposits in the northern part is coarser than other parts evidence was collected from geophysical studies exploratory wells piezometer and observation logs to identify the types of aquifers which comprise i hard rock aquifer with approx 293 km2 and ii alluvium aquifer including unconfined approx 150 km2 and confined approx 57 km2 aquifers nadiri et al 2017b confined aquifers are surrounded by the unconfined aquifer and these aquifers are surrounded by the hard rock aquifer varzeqan alluvium has given rise to aquifers classified into three main hydraulic conductivity sections see also fig 3 i high hydraulic conductivity approx 90 m d areas in the eastern part of the plain composed of coarse grain sizes ii moderate hydraulic conductivity approx 25 m d areas in the central part of the plain composed of sand gravel and silt grains iii low hydraulic conductivity approx 8 m d areas in the western part of the plain composed of silt clay with slight sand contents nadiri et al 2017b and iv hard rock aquifer with variable hydraulic conductivity surrounding unconfined and confined aquifers are composed of volcanic rock including andesite to andesitic tuff andesitic volcano sediment granite to diorite and rhyolitic to rhyodacitic volcano breccia using the data from 19 observation wells the overall groundwater flow direction is from west to east along a hydraulic gradient of 0 to 0 9 fig 3 which thought to coincide with the surface water flow direction the confined aquifer has just two piezometers and hence the detection of their groundwater flow directions is more challenging hard rock aquifers drain through 150 springs but alluvial aquifers through 252 withdrawal wells and 20 qanats groundwater withdrawals impact on the general shape of the groundwater level distribution map and generate depressions as in northern parts of the plain see fig 3 hard rock aquifer of the varzeqan sub basin are exposed to numerous volcanic and tectonic activities tectonic activities play an important role in occurrences of springs and recharging unconfined aquifers demand for water has increased over the years since 1990 from agricultural industrial and domestic supplies in the region including the city of varzeqan the highest groundwater level would occur in may due to highest recharge and the lowest groundwater level would occur in august due to over abstraction for irrigation through the last three months the mean rate of decline in groundwater levels is approx 0 3 m year over the past few decades the quality of groundwater and surface water resources of the region can also be affected by the wastewater from the sungun copper mine see figs 2 and 4 which has only one tailing dam but somehow outside the mine at the north of varzeqan plain 2 3 geology the focus of this study is on the confined and unconfined aquifers within the eastern sub basin of aharchay fig 4 impacted by anthropogenic activities and by the flanking hard rock aquifer surrounding the plain at its north west and south the rock formations outside the hard rock aquifer within the basin are likely to play a role on the water quality within the confined and unconfined aquifers of varzeqan sub basin confined aquifers are partially composed of clay and fine sediments covering the older alluvium sheet whereas the unconfined aquifer is mostly younger alluvium and composed of coarse grains which surrounds pockets of the confined aquifers alluvial confined and unconfined aquifers are located in piedmont fans of quaternary formations closer to aharchay and its tributaries in the varzeqan sub basin mehrpartou et al 1992 quaternary alluvial sediments overlie pliocene formations as a basement and these sediments are composed of conglomerate the quaternary alluvial sediments are by and large composed of silt sand and clay grain size the central quaternary and pliocene formations are surrounded by older formations including intrusive igneous rocks at the north such as granite to diorite and extrusive igneous rocks at the south such as rhyolitic to rhyodacitic volcano breccia see fig 4 the northwest of the sub basin is covered by andesite and trachyandesite with upper cretaceous period age volcanic and volcanogenic rocks of eocene cover remaining areas see nadiri et al 2017b 2 4 groundwater monitoring network and available data there are 21 piezometers installed in varzeqan plain to monitor groundwater levels distributed over the entire region shown in fig 4 these together with further wells were installed to measure water quality for the study area in october 2015 for which the total number of wells was 50 their data from these withdrawal wells and springs were measured in 2015 these samples are analysed in due course which provide evidence that the study area is exposed to risks from nitrate fluoride and arsenic ions the samples taken in 2015 for this study were analysed in the hydrogeological laboratory at the university of tabriz which included major ions and a set of minor and trace ions as well as ph electric conductivity ec by standard methods apha 1998 see table 3 later for all the 50 samples major and minor ions were analysed but of which only 38 samples have measurements of arsenic concentration therefore the graphical method uses 50 sample for interpretation but the multivariate analysis uses 38 samples for arsenic concentrations 3 methodology to aggregate risks this section presents the methodology for total information management to aggregate risks with multiple aquifers from multiple contaminants using the five dimensions introduced above 3 1 existing capabilities on risk to human health although the paper is not minded with using the protocol of indices related to human health risk assessment hhra given by usepa 2004 it is outlined to minimise confusions hhra combines risk and the concepts of human health to estimate the degree of harm by carcinogenic or non carcinogenic contaminants to human body exposures through such pathways as inhalation oral and dermal intakes where the term pathways in health problems is quite different than those in the osprc framework hhra identifies i hazard identification when exceeding allowable contamination level ii dose response assessment expressing a relationship between exposures and adverse health responses iii exposure assessment to a pollutant by considering oral and dermal pathways and iv risk characterisation to estimate probabilities of exposures to contaminants the paper precludes such indices 3 2 total information management 3 2 1 dimension 1 the perceptual model perceptual and conceptual models are well established both in research and practice but without the explicit branding as used in the paper the generic features of a perceptual model is the identification of past desktop studies using observations from site visits and collecting published general purpose data on geological formations of the site risk assessment exercises and any other studies the scope of a perceptual model is to identify the primary building blocks without necessarily producing evidence for the aim of formulating the risk aggregation problem for a site these building blocks include aquifer details their interactions land use potential pollutants to flag anthropogenic hazards mineral composition of the underlying strata to flag possible geogenic processes perceptual models should be more than initial opinions formed by experts 3 2 2 dimension 2 conceptual model the generic features of conceptual models are driven by modelling activities and in hydrogeochemical studies these comprise a diverse set of techniques including statistical techniques graphical techniques multivariate analysis and geological survey there is no requirement on using all of these techniques but only those are selected that provide a sufficient insight into an understanding of a particular problem in research activities the focus is normally on the state of the art multivariate analysis and in practice the focus is on graphical techniques however the paper advocates a collective understanding to be drawn from all of these techniques through soft modelling as presented in section 5 in conceptual models the focus is on seeking evidence for delineating risk cells for a study area as outlined below 3 2 3 dimension 3 delineating risk cells building on nadiri et al 2017 nadiri et al 2018a sadeghfam et al 2018a and sadeghfam et al 2018b a study area is broken down into as many risk cells as required each of which defines a complete domain and allows the appropriate signals to pass through a risk cell occupies a spatial layout which may partially coincide with other risk cells but each allows the passage of information on individual risks through the process of osprc to be discussed in due course this is analogous to telephone lines which allow many different communications lines without interference 3 2 4 dimension 4 soft modelling knowledge integration in existing hydrogeochemical studies is retarded by investigating samples of concentrations of ions as the available techniques statistical analysis graphical methods multivariate analysis or isotope analysis are fragmented arguably different techniques often indicate partial convergences with similar results or divergences with conflicting results nadiri et al 2018a introduced soft modelling to use a collection of existing techniques in which the term soft modelling is adopted for hydrogeochemical studies by analogy to soft systems by checkland and scholes 1981 where each technique focuses on certain aspects of the problem e g identifying dissolutions and origin chemical processes such as ion exchange reverse ion exchange and detecting water types arguably knowledge integration is overlooked in hydrogeochemical studies but soft modelling aims to remove inherent barriers soft modelling treats knowledge integration by categorising the available techniques into levels of increasing complexity see nadiri et al 2018a where the idea derives from traditional modelling procedure as reviewed by khatibi 2012 in which models are treated through collecting data building preliminary models calibration validation and applications in these categorisation the information is sequentially firmed up through a knowledgebase outlined in appendix i table i 1 as follows level 0 to parse out available data and to form perceptual conceptual models level 1 to use statistical analysis of the sample data for learning inherent processes and chemical dissolutions level 2 to develop graphical diagrams hounslow 1995 with a degree of top down knowledgebase to learn types and sources of the ions in the dissolution in aquifers level 3 to use more mathematical techniques such as multivariate analysis cloutier et al 2008 delgado outeiriño et al 2009 to learn from data on pollutant sources attention is drawn to the primary difference of soft modelling with traditional techniques where soft models learn from convergences divergences through classifying the techniques at levels as outlined in table i 1 in appendix i however traditional use of the hydrogeochemical techniques are discrete and fragmented generally research papers suffice to techniques at level 3 or higher but the paper is rather detailed to illustrate soft modelling as there are three contaminants in the study area table 2 provides the knowledgebase available to the authrs to study the osprc processes appropriate to each contaminant 3 2 5 dimension 5 osprc risk cells the sprc framework was introduced recently to groundwater contamination studies by nadiri et al 2017 nadiri et al 2018a sadeghfam et al 2018a and sadeghfam et al 2018b in which they extended the framework to include the origin dimension hence osprc framework the original sprc framework is reviewed in detail by khatibi 2008 who suggests its suitability for the aggregation of multiple flood risks notably a framework refers to the consensual use of each of the dimensions as there is no theoretical or empirical basis for the choice of each dimension the osprc framework allows a unified approach for studying processes in risk aggregation problems its proof of concept is evident in the authors research for aggregating risk from arsenic anomalies contaminating a series of patchy aquifers driven by the geogenic origin where the risk was local but an impounding reservoir transformed the situation to a system wide risk in a study area in the east azerbaijan province northwest iran see nadiri et al 2017 whilst risk cells just delineate possible domains for each contaminant without taking on board the processes to study risks the osprc framework provides a basis to study inherent processes in a coherent manner the initial thinking in the sprc framework was the establishment of a descriptive approach for the processes linking hazard to consequence of a particular risk and more so of risk of floods e g see nathanail et al 2005 thorne et al 2007 khatibi 2008 in these processes source pathway and receptor refer to the physical process whereas consequence is a matter of societal values however to make the osprc framework a quantitative risk aggregation tool a further step is needed to make tim suitable for quantitative risk aggregation problems by dividing each risk cell to grids and study the osprc through the grids of risk cells this is a further step that is planned for future research activities 3 3 descriptive and quantitative risk aggregation the ultimate aim of the paper is to estimate risk indices by fully considering the osprc processes through the tim framework however this requires that the domain of each contaminant is identified in advance using its risk cell where their diffusions can be extrapolated under this condition anthropogenic contaminants can be studied by say the drastic framework and geogenic contaminants by say the spectr framework e g for fe and as similar to nadiri et al 2018b and sadeghfam et al 2018a sadeghfam et al 2018b the transformation of vulnerability mapping into risk mapping is then feasible and the authors have produced proof of concept for such risk mapping and risk aggregation problems these tasks did not involve hydrogeochemical studies of identifying origins sources and processes the paper takes a step forward and aims to integrate this problem with risk aggregation problems however a quantitative approach is not yet feasible as the domain of each contaminant needs further data to warrant a quantitative studies 4 preliminary results the results are presented at two stages of preliminary and detailed in which preliminary results brings together the analysis at level 0 and outlines any possible decisions for the next stage only dimension 1 2 and 3 contribute to preliminary results with the outcome of identifying risk cells and decisions on risk aggregation detailed results are then carried out by using the information from the latter four dimensions 4 1 preliminary results 4 1 1 dimension 1 results of perceptual model to contextualise the study area the basis for the perceptual model is the main characterisation of the study area presented in section 2 which contextualises the aquifer system as follows i there are two confined aquifers ii these are surrounded by one unconfined aquifer and iii both confined and unconfined aquifer are collectively surrounded by a larger hard rock aquifer allowing subterranean flows from upper catchments to springs with possible connectivity from upper catchment to specific points within the aquifer these aquifer divisions are the basis for building up a perceptual model a further aspect of the perceptual model of the study area is that up to 1970 it was in a rural agrarian region where the balance between land use and its rural agrarian economy was in balance with each other and sustainable water records show that i there is some decline in water table in recent years due to increased pumpage from the aquifers and ii there are pollution problems as shown by nadiri et al 2017b and 2018c and the present paper 4 1 2 dimensions 2 and 3 results of conceptual model and risk cells a conceptual model of the study area is developed at a preliminary stage by using the data sample outlined in section 2 4 and displayed in fig 4 with the map of the pie diagram of the samples the data are further summarised in table 3 which shows the statistical summary of the data and their maximum permissible concentration for natural water as per who 2004 as well as notes on data quality checks the table shows nitrate n that fluoride and arsenic values exceed their corresponding maximum permissible values a further parsing of the data indicates that both fluoride and arsenic concentrations are evidently high and local although they are not much diffused near their surroundings this is a key finding that there is a discontinuity in their distribution that needs to be explained the above findings serves as the knowledge base to delineate risk cells which are presented in fig 5 b d the salient features of which include i there are nearly 4 hotspots of nitrate n pollutions but most of the other observation wells also suffer from excess concentrations as per who 2004 permissible values and hence this risk is distributed system wide with variable concentrations ii there are 6 hotspots of fluoride concentrations but each surrounded by rather low values and hence this risk is currently viewed as local but under further investigations and iii there are 5 hotspots of arsenic contamination but other observation wells are within permissible ranges and hence this risk is currently viewed as local but under further investigations investigation of the dominant processes and identifying their origins are the main goal of this research the statistical summary in table 3 is that i most of the sampled major ions exceed their permissible values for drinking water standard who 2004 by a moderate margin but they are not alarming yet ii the study area is exposed to hotspots of nitrate n pollutions from anthropogenic origins reaching as much as five times the maximum allowed by the world health organisation who 2004 standards at 10 mg l iii hotspots of fluoride contaminations from geogenic origins reach as much as five times the maximum allowed by who standards at 1 5 mg l and iv hotspots of arsenic anomalies reach 0 1 μg l which is 10 times greater than the world health organisation who 2004 limit of 0 01 μg l the results presented in section 3 2 through table 2 confirm that the ions of nitrate n fluoride and arsenic are excessive enough to pose risks the emerging information was essential to delineate risk cells it further shows that electrical conductivity ec of the samples is between 200 and 2 520 μs cm 1 where high ec values often stem from fine grained particles impacting on residence time as it is increased for samples at central parts of the plain in the vicinity of the interfaces between the confined and unconfined aquifers the ph values range between 6 81 and 8 8 and hence the aquifers are in the range from neutral to basic water 4 1 3 dimension 3 results of soft models the above results are sufficient to show that the study area is impacted by nitrate n fluoride and arsenic concentrations and to delineate it to risk cells as displayed in fig 5b d which are further supported by the results given later in table 4 the primary feature of these results is that samples with excessively large concentrations do not seem to be diffusing to surroundings but there is not enough information yet to understand the discontinuity in their spatial variations the authors have reported in detail on the distribution of nitrate n within the complex aquifer system nadiri et al 2018 and 2017 and therefore there is no technical problem to a quantitative nitrate risk indexing model of the study area however as per fig 5b d the hotspots for both fluoride and arsenic are surrounded by lower values and the mechanism for developing risk indexing model can lead to gross errors without an insight to the spatial extend of diffusion of the contaminants hence the paper approach the problem of risk aggregation in qualitative terms 4 2 detailed results 4 2 1 overview risk cells identified in section 4 1 are in broad scale each of which can be studied through the osprc processes the focus of soft modelling is to firm up the information with respect to the dimension of origin and source and this section is focussed on both of these dimensions for each of the risk cells and as such it pools together the thinking for dimensions 2 3 and 4 hydrogeochemical studies presented in this section are under dimension 2 as a set of fragmented conceptual models but the extracted information from a set of these techniques are integrated through dimension 4 related to soft modelling in such a way that the information inherent in each technique is firmed up when they converge but table 4 flags their divergence the knowledgebase developed by the paper is summarised in appendix i table i 1 which bring together such concepts as chemical dissolutions their reduction or oxidation through ion exchange reverse ion exchange and identifying their origins as per nadiri et al 2018a 4 2 2 levels 1 2 the strength of tim is to integrate information and due to the discontinuity in the diffusion of fluoride and arsenic concentration the paper suffices to only a broad scale integration of information as explained before in relation to origin or source of the contaminants the information base is therefore extracted and presented in table ii 1 based on the results at levels 1 2 and 3 the actual modelling details are detailed in appendix ii correlation matrix is used at level 1 which is routine and therefore detailed in appendix ii its contributions to the aggregated information in table 4 include i strong correlations of ec with cl 0 87 hco3 0 9 so4 2 0 91 mg2 0 8 indicate the prevalence of water rock interactions in study area ii the r value of 0 68 of sodium with chloride indicates that sources of sodium are halite solution in groundwater and other sources iii correlation of both calcium and magnesium with sodium and potassium indicates the groundwater aquifer system encourages a possible ion exchange process iv weak correlation between ec and k 0 34 as well as that with no3 0 33 indicates that most of the ions are involved in a range of physiochemical reactions such as oxidation reduction and ion exchange in the groundwater aquifer system v the low correlation of fluoride with other ions may stem from different behaviours of fluorides releasing to water the following techniques are used at level 2 scatter diagram piper diagram and stiff diagram these are also routine and therefore are detailed in appendix ii their contributions to the aggregated information in table 4 based on the fig ii 1 include i most of the samples show dissolutions of calcite dolomite anhydrite gypsum or the simple dissolution process kumar et al 2006 venugopal et al 2009 iii ion exchange processes iii reverse ion exchange processes iv calcite dissolution see fisher and mulican 1997 based on the fig ii 1b na is found to be outcomes of halite dissolution or ion exchange based on fig ii 1c the zones prevailing in the study area are b temporary hardness d alkali carbonate and e mixing zone and based on fig ii 1d groundwater samples of this study area are from five diverse origins i limestone class c1 ii acidic igneous rocks class c2 iii basic igneous rocks class c3 iv mixing process class c4 v gypsiferous formations class c5 4 2 3 level 3 hierarchical cluster analysis hca hierarchical cluster analysis hca is a technique at level 3 of soft modelling which is a state of the art research tool to study site specific contamination problems it uses a set of multivariate techniques to group the data in appropriate classes reghunath et al 2002 which brings similar ions together in the same cluster hca uses 38 samples in terms of concentrations of ca2 mg2 na k cl s o 4 2 h c o 3 n o 3 ec f and as as well as chemical properties of ec and ph the dataset was scaled by z transformation and grouped by the ward s method ward 2012 and calculated similarity of samples by linkage with euclidean distance deza deza 2009 the dendrogram of hca results is given in fig 6 a which groups the data together by adopting a threshold value equal to 6 5 for the linkage distance based on the expert opinion the dendrogram infers a level of hydrochemical comparison among the three clusters and their cluster analysis shows the influence of nitrate n concentration in the classification where such an analysis is beyond the capability of the graphical methods as shown in fig 6a three cluster are identified and their salient features are as follows cluster i corresponds to 66 of all samples from groundwater for which major ions identified in their order of abundance through a detailed examination of the results as follows ca2 na mg2 k and hco3 cl so4 2 meq l evidently these results are indicative of abundance of limestone both in terms of the occurrence of ca2 and hco3 ions at areas recharged by rainfall and likely to be from volcanic rocks with high ph values whereas the samples are located in areas with bicarbonate type of groundwater notably these results quite converge with those identified by graphical techniques furthermore cluster i is associated with high nitrate n concentrations and high fluoride concentrations in hard rock aquifer cluster i brings the samples from wells 29 21 23 14 19 4 15 20 5 25 6 28 22 49 46 8 9 7 27 2 18 24 31 10 and 44 into one group cluster ii corresponds to 26 of all samples from the groundwater in which an examination of the results show that calcium and magnesium are at high levels due to containing fine grained silt and clay where their presence explains high ec values and high residence time as the cause for high groundwater salinity the excessive nitrate n and arsenic values occur in this cluster and the highest pollution of nitrate n occurs in the unconfined aquifer whereas the confined aquifer shows the least nitrate n pollution cluster ii brings the samples from wells 40 45 17 26 16 11 13 3 1 and 12 into one group cluster iii corresponds to 8 of all samples from the groundwater and located in the unconfined aquifer cluster iii brings the samples from wells 39 30 and 42 into one group and is located in alluvium with high nitrate n pollution 4 2 4 level 3 factor analysis fa factor analysis fa finds effective factors impacting on the hydrogeochemistry and the significance of correlation between factors and data variables table 5 presents the loading bars of three principal components and their representative variance the rotated factors are identified by high positive and negative loadings and near zero loadings as per davis 1986 maximum variance of the factors is extracted by the highest range of the positive or negative loadings the analysis identifies three factors with eigenvalues greater than one and their distribution presented in fig 6b d which is indicative of the relation between factors and the hydrogeological characteristics the three factors explain 72 of the variance factor i as per table 5 this factor is associated with high positive loadings of cl so4 2 mg2 ca2 hco3 na ec and these are suggestive of i water rock interactions and ii a general trend for dissolutions in groundwater at the study area an examination of detailed results shows that water rock interactions through the above ions would control approximately 39 73 of the groundwater chemical processes the interactions are not limited to one location but the flow through the aquifer encourages the trend for further interactions and dissolution processes this factor increases in the direction from west to east where the highest impacts arise at the basin centre see fig 6b factor ii as per table 5 this factor is associated with high positive factor loadings of no3 and ec arguably the presence of strong loading of no3 ions is indicative of an anthropogenic input to the groundwater system through the leaching from fertilisers in agricultural lands which is related to infiltrated surface water interacting with geological formations this would impact on groundwater quality and create contaminations stemming from anthropogenic activities largely related to agriculture with minor contributions from domestic sewage this factor controls approximately 19 34 of the data variance it affects the dissolution of minerals contained in fine grained sediments shale marl sodium and high salinity the highest impact of the factor is in discharge margins and within the confined aquifer characterised by more fine grained sediments and high salinity where the ion exchange process is quite dominant see fig 6c factor iii this factor control approximately 12 57 percent of data variance as per table 5 this factor is associated with high positive factor loadings of k and arsenic and high negative loading of fluoride but of low nitrate n loading bar and as such it indicates that the source of arsenic and fluoride is not anthropogenic high k may suggest that pollution is geogenic and caused by weathering of acidic igneous rocks include potassium feldspar leucite biotite or muscovite fluoride and arsenic anomalies originate largely from geogenic activities samples with high arsenic concentration have lower fluoride concentrations and this is reflected by negative values of fluoride loads such negative values between arsenic and fluoride loading should not signify reversal of chemical processes but of the absence of the appropriate load fig 6d shows areas of high fluoride and arsenic impacts 4 3 overview of mechanism to disperse pollutants an important focus of the results by graphical methods at level 2 is that groundwater samples in the varzeqan basin are largely located in zone b associated with temporal hardness and of good quality this is explained as follows i varzeqan aquifer is shallow and has low groundwater resistance time ii recharge areas of the aquifer comprise hard rock formations with minimum water rock interactions for the infiltrated water iii high quality surface water through the plain is in interaction with groundwater where the watercourses contribute to recharging the aquifer in the eastern parts of the plain but the aquifer drains to watercourses at its western parts and thereby reduces its residence time the results also give a focus on deteriorating groundwater quality at the interface between unconfined confined aquifers largely composed of fine grain sizes adversely increasing residence times two samples samples 32 37 located at the interface of aquifer margins between hard rock and unconfined aquifers are at zone d which reflect impacts of rhyolite igneous formations on hydrochemical processes of the aquifer nitrate n pollution the low nitrate n concentration in groundwater occurs at samples in high elevation areas e g r1 4 where lands are not suitable for agricultural activities moderate concentrations occur at unconfined aquifer r1 3 and within confined aquifers r1 2 high concentrations occur at margins of the interfaces between the confined and unconfined aquifers this nitrate n distribution is explained as follows i as agricultural activities are the main preoccupation in the study area they give rise to widespread nitrate n at the ground surface due to fertilisers ii groundwater from the surface at the plain is likely to percolate uniformly and this would act as a diffuse source by infiltrating waters washing high nitrate n concentration through percolation notably final concentration values are outcomes of the following intrinsic processes i nitrate n concentration at the ground surface ii amounts of groundwater recharge at the surface and iii the characteristics of aquifer media fluoride contamination based on the results of multivariate analysis fluoride contamination is geogenic due to the occurrence of fluoride bearing minerals in porphyry copper deposits system e g fluorite fluorapatite topaz mica cryolite and amphiboles these are found at the varzeqan basin and can spread through the study area which differ from other contaminants fluoride loads show random behaviour but their hotspots do not seem to be diffused widely in the study area arsenic contamination based on the results of multivariate analysis arsenic contamination in the study area is geogenic the origins of which are attributed to porphyry copper deposits these are found widely at the varzeqan basin and can spread through joints and faults they are also activated by hydrothermal activities arsenic loads are likely to be found at joints and faults of northern parts of the study area see osprc cells 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 the samples with high arsenic concentration show low sulphate high bicarbonate concentration and a ph value of approx equal to 7 these collectively indicate releasing of arsenic to water in reductive dissolution under anoxic condition the study identifies arsenic concentrations hotspots which do not seem to be diffused widely in the study area this is discussed further in section 5 6 4 4 possible interactions between anthropogenic geogenic processes the paper is minded with the difficult question that is there any interactions between anthropogenic and geogenic activities the results presented above are now refocussed towards answering the question and in a simple term the summary is that anthropogenic activities encourage geogenic processes these are detailed below confined aquifers at r1 1 and r1 2 are located in agricultural areas where nitrate n concentrations are the lowest this is explained on the grounds of low permeability of the topsoil and by the dominance of anoxic condition oxygen 5 mg l within the confined aquifers the process of nitrifying nh4 is under anoxic conditions at soil media which gives rise to controlled leaching of nitrate n to groundwater see raju et al 2015 now consider alluvial sandy soils in the unconfined aquifer r1 3 characterised by high nitrate n residence time and high permeability which gives rise to low nitrate n contamination in the groundwater see raju et al 2015 as anthropogenic activities maintain infiltrating nitrate ammonia through clayey soils the denitrification process is encouraged due to the natural presence of oxygen in clayey soils at the interface margins due to charge balances see also raju et al 2015 for noting similar processes hence geogenic factors could inadvertently control the amount of nitrogen leaching out already introduced to groundwater by anthropogenic activities the origin of arsenic loads at osprc cells 3 4a b confined aquifers and osprc cell 3 5 unconfined aquifer are not fully explained at this stage and the scale and the rate of the diffusion of existing anomalies are unknown this is one reason as the study is presented at a qualitative risk aggregation problem until further data are obtained for a better understanding however perceptual models are outlined below to pave the ground for conceptualisation of arsenic anomalies at osprc cells r3 4a b and r3 5 through the following perceptual models model 1 there are local arsenic bearing soil lenses and this is capable of explaining the above high local contaminations model 2 presence of uncontrolled widespread mining activities in recent years could contribute to the local hotspots of both fluoride and arsenic concentrations model 3 arsenic is distributed within the aquifer but in a diluted state up to recent years and therefore did not pose a serious source of risk whereas the declining water table in recent years at an average rate of 0 4 m annum reduces the dilution volume of water and thereby increases its arsenic concentration notably this would be an instance of anthropogenic activities triggering geogenic risks and likely to be the case nonetheless further information is needed to understand the process in a clearer term 4 5 dimension 5 osprc view of risk cells identification of contaminants their respective risk cells together with their origins and sources table 4 paves the ground for a quantitative mapping of the risk aggregation problem however the paper identified an apparent discontinuity in the spatial distribution of the fluoride and arsenic contaminants and therefore a study of the vulnerability within the aquifer and potential risk exposures are not technically feasible until the problem is explained if the above discontinuity was not the case the spatial distribution of nitrate n concentrations could have been modelled by using the drastic framework and those of fluoride and arsenic by using the spectr framework as introduced by the authors similar to nadiri et al 2018b and sadeghfam et al 2018a sadeghfam et al 2018b in the subsequent modelling procedure the risk cells would be superimposed on a grid cell where the authors refer to the combined cells as osprc cells the production of vulnerability and risk indices for the study area would then be a matter for following the procedure nonetheless the paper presents a qualitative osprc assessment of risk for the three contaminants through the study area in appendix iii 5 discussion the results at the early stage of the research identified a discontinuous diffusion of fluoride and arsenic concentrations risk mapping was not therefore possible until the domain of each contaminant at each risk cell was identified through a further samples to explain the nature of diffusion hence the remit of the paper is descriptive at this stage which also includes an account of the study with respect to other published works as well tiering the risks within its site regional and global contexts further discussion of the results the various aspects of the results were discussed in the previous sections but the following further issues are discussed in relation to nitrate n and calcium concentrations it is widely known that anthropogenic activities e g agricultural activities are the main origin for nitrate n contaminations see ref sacch et al 2013 and this is also true for the study area as exemplified by r1 2 and r1 3 nonetheless geogenic and or aquifer processes may also impact nitrate n contaminations for instance nitrate n concentration increases in the study area are impacted by the following factors i intense agricultural activities trigger increased nitrate n concentrations at ground surfaces ii characteristics of aquifer media or infiltration potential through the unsaturated zones play their roles and iii along some of the boundaries from the confined to unconfined aquifers there is some discontinuity results indicate that the concentration of calcium ions in the study area is significant but below that of the normal range in natural groundwater therefore calcium ions are not expected to no significant impacts on human health calcium ions in the study area are from two different origins i gypsiferous layers are partially the sources for calcium ions in the region which relate to the quaternary sediments and the r value of 0 92 table i 2 between calcium and sulphate suggests that gypsum may be a source of calcium ions ii there are calcite dissolution processes in the recharge areas of the aquifer where calcium ions are originated by high hco 3 concentrations introduced by rainfall water to the study area through hydro chemical processes fig 5a risk indexing a qualitative risk indexing would be possible for nitrate n but its quantitative aggregation with risks from fluoride and arsenic was seen to suffer from undue uncertainties without a better insight into the propagation of risks within the complex aquifer system in this study area the objective of the study was therefore transformed from a quantitative risk mapping into a qualitative risk study and their propagation in the aquifer is understood a quantitative risk aggregation problem can be formulated similar to authors work reported similar to nadiri et al 2018a nadiri et al 2018c and iii sadeghfam et al 2018a sadeghfam et al 2018b to the best knowledge of the authors there is no other published work to compare with the present results regional perspective the study area is now exposed to i the pollution risks from chemical and organic fertilisers ii the pollution risks from mining are not controlled or any control is ineffective and iii geogenic contaminations from hydrogeochemical processes within the aquifers increase some geogenic contaminant such as arsenic and fluoride prior to the arrival of mechanisation there was often a balance among interacting hydrosphere lithosphere biosphere and anthroposphere in the form of natural regimes local anthropogenic activities were often at a lower level and did not pose any regional risks there were no available data samples prior to those commissioned by this study but the results presented in table 3 suggest that none of the ions were at a scale to pose any hazard except for nitrate n fluoride and arsenic the baseline is unknown but it is safe to assume that the quality state of the aquifer was sustainable prior to 1970 the state of verzeqan aquifer is in decline with respect to water table and the quality of water for both drinking and agriculture since circa 1970 this is explained by the absence of any effective planning system as a result of which the tragedy of the commons is in evidence in the form of declining water table in the aquifers and deterioration of water quality global perspective risks to aquifers have amplified since the green revolution which increased food availability but simultaneously produced diffuse nitrate n pollutions impacting surface water and groundwater with major environmental impacts vitousek et al 1997 agren and bosatta 1988 galloway et al 2008 as such the amount of nitrogen transported into the oceans by the rivers in the world has roughly doubled since the 19th century and rates of nitrogen transport from developed areas have increased 10 to 50 folds meybeck 1982 the knowledge on a wide range of arsenic contaminations has emerged since the 1980s and as per rgs 2008 arsenic in drinking water was recognised as a serious problem in argentina chile and taiwan circa the early 1980s following its recognition in bangladesh during the late 1980s it developed into an international issue arsenic contamination has often a well defined relationship to particular geological units and hence to particular depth of wells plans for further research the qualitative risk aggregation problem presented by the paper is regarded as the first step towards its next phase of developing its quantitative risk aggregation model this requires further detailed sampling data gathering social data on impacts of the nitrate n pollution and fluoride and arsenic contaminations although currently this may not be likely gathering more geological data with a focus on the distribution of fluoride and arsenic and possibly other contaminants and surveying the operation of the vast mining industries in the area the greatest problem would be securing a sufficient budget for gathering data and therefore this phase may itself be carried out in phases to firm up the emerging knowledgebase until the full explanation of the underlying problems 6 conclusion with 50 000 inhabitants in in the study area in the varzeqan basin using groundwater as the main water resources for drinking and agriculture industry and mining the aquifer is now distressed including the decline of water table nitrate n fluoride and arsenic contaminations which are caused by the absence of an effective planning system the paper is an academic strive to understand the scale and scope of the problem and to produce tools that can in time help planners to treat the inherent problems the approach pooled together five dimensions comprising a perceptual model a conceptual models formulation of risk cells soft modelling using a set of traditional techniques but arranging them in hierarchical levels these are generic and can be applied to any aquifer problem as a generic tool for risk aggregation problems the emerging insight into the study area from the dimension of tim is capable of treating multiple contaminants and multiple aquifers the study of the perceptual model sets the context of the study by identifying the boundaries of confined unconfined and hard rock aquifers and also delineating risk cells to conceptualise the study by basic results of ion concentrations the presented methodology delineated 15 risk cells at a qualitative level where the problem of risks from nitrate n fluoride and arsenic contaminants can be studied and their emerging knowledge can be aggregated quantitative approaches require further data become available the approach developed in the paper provides the following insights into the study area i the baseline prior to 1970 was likely to have been good quality water ii with respect to major ions groundwater quality of study area now remains acceptable but variations in ec signifies active hydrochemical processes iii with respect to minor ions nitrate n pollution originates from intensive agricultural activities and exposes the porous media of the study area to risks from diffuse source of anthropogenic origins iv with respect to trace ions fluoride contamination is likely to originate from geogenic processes and to expose the porous media of the study area to seemingly local fluoride risks v likewise with respect to trace ions groundwater arsenic contamination is likely to originate from geological formation and to expose the aquifer to risks from geogenic origins the study reveals that anthropogenic activities may encourage geogenic risk exposures and without a sufficient amount of understanding the inherent processes mitigation measures can be haphazardly and hence the plan is to take the study to its next phase credit authorship contribution statement ata allah nadiri conceptualization methodology software data curation writing review editing supervision project

for soft modelling the information content of table i 1 derives from hounslow 1995 as formatted by nadiri et al 2018a and presents the relevant information in the tabular format the authors are planning to develop an expert system to capture existing knowledge of the emerging capability available data from study area is presented in table i 2 this table including i location of samples ii major ions iii minor ions iv arsenic concentration as a trace element and v physicochemical parameters appendix ii detailed results of soft modelling at level 1 and level 2 techniques at level 1 statistical analysis the paper uses pearson correlation r and scatter diagrams of binary ions the r values for the measured ions are given in table ii 1 which uses a bivariate correlation analysis between pairs of hydrochemical parameters the table also gives four designated bands to associate the strength of the r values with inherent processes overall a positive r value between two ions is suggestive of their common origins but negative values are of differing origins and processes table ii 1 summarises r values between the various ions and classifies them as four designated bands the salient features for which are presented below band for good correlation there is no particular ion in this band to signify the exclusive presence of a dissolution in the aquifer but the r value of 0 92 between calcium and sulphate indicates that gypsum may be a source of calcium in groundwater originating from gypsiferous layer in the region related to quaternary sediments strong correlation band as per subba 2002 the samples in this band are taken to be in a water rock interaction state where inherent processes may include some ion exchange and oxidation reduction reactions and dissolved ions would contribute to high r values between the ions and ec strong correlations of ec with cl 0 87 hco3 0 9 so4 2 0 91 mg2 0 8 indicate the trend for chemical activities and this may be explained by i the decline of water table in the basin due to over abstraction and a gradual loss of dilutions ii increasing residential time of groundwater and water rock interaction in low hydraulic conductivity area such as the interfaces between confined and unconfined aquifers moderate correlation band as per drever 1997 and mahlknecht 2003 the r value of 0 68 of sodium with chloride indicates that sources of sodium are halite solution in groundwater and other sources and that of both calcium and magnesium with sodium and potassium indicates the groundwater aquifer system encourages a possible ion exchange process notably strong correlation between ec and cl 0 87 hco3 0 9 so4 2 0 91 mg2 0 8 and weak correlation between ec and k 0 34 as well as that with no3 0 33 indicate that most of the ions are involved in a range of physiochemical reactions such as oxidation reduction and ion exchange in the groundwater aquifer system the low correlation of fluoride with other ions may stem from different behaviours of fluorides releasing to water scatter diagram of binary ions whilst r values provide an indication of ion dissolutions and their tendencies towards ion exchange or reverse iron exchange processes further information is extracted on the evolution of trends groundwater samples are studied as the binary ion of ca 2 mg 2 versus hco 3 so 4 2 to form a scatter diagram see fig ii 1 a the key feature on the figure is the 1 1 equiline with the following patterns of information i the samples close to the equiline would represent dominant reactions in forming dissolutions of calcite dolomite anhydrite or gypsum kumar et al 2006 venugopal et al 2009 which is referred to as the simple dissolution process guler et al 2002 ii the closeness of the majority of the sample points to the equiline is indicative of the solution of gypsum in the aquifer iii ion exchange processes are encouraged at sample points scattered away from the equiline towards high cation contents by an excess of hco 3 so 4 2 iii reverse ion exchange processes are encouraged in samples scattered away due to a large excess of ca 2 mg 2 over hco 3 so 4 2 iv fig ii 1 a indicates samples display calcite dissolution driven by adding hco 3 see fisher and mulican 1997 a further information is extracted from the sample data as per hounslow 1995 on the dissolution process being either saline water or halite dissolution it is realised that halite minerals of the pliocene formation in the study area are partially responsible for na in groundwater however approximately 80 of the water samples have na cl ratios significantly greater than 0 5 indicating existence of another sodium source which can be ion exchange in the study area red point shown in fig ii 1b indicates the ion exchange process for sample 26 from locations at the sighindil or syghyndil village in southeast study area the main processes contributing to chemical compositions in groundwater of the study area are the dissolution along the flow path the mixing with groundwater at the downstream area the ion exchange reactions these geochemical processes are responsible for the seasonal and spatial variations in groundwater

in the piper diagram see fig ii 1c the diamond plot is divided into five zones a b c d and e to distinguish different types of groundwater each zone is associated with certain anions and cations associated with an appropriate type as shown in fig ii 1c the zones prevailing in the study area are laid out in table 4 and comprise b temporary hardness d alkali carbonate and e mixing zone stiff diagram based on hounslow 1995 the stiff diagram fig ii 1d indicates that groundwater samples of this study area are from five diverse origins i limestone class c1 ii acidic igneous rocks class c2 iii basic igneous rocks class c3 iv mixing process class c4 v gypsiferous formation class c5 the results summarised in table 4 as per above results and those in fig ii 1 the quality of groundwater decreases gradually which is reflected by high ec values at the interfaces between unconfined and confined aquifers and subsequent increasing residence time appendix iii descriptive account of dimension 5 osprc processes the osprc framework is presented to study the full processes for each contaminant iii 1 outline of nitrate n osprc processes aquifers are exposed to the risk of nitrate n pollutions from two main origins i natural occurrences by oxidising organic matter at baseline conditions but panno et al 2006 indicate that natural nitrate n levels in relatively unmodified areas do not exceed 1 2 mg l ii anthropogenic activities which often arise from fertiliser overuses animal manures and domestic industrial sewage discharges see xue et al 2009 dubrovsky et al 2010 gu et al 2012 kaushal et al 2011 nakagawa et al 2017 and bondu et al 2018 an osprc overview of nitrate n occurrences is outlined below origins nitrate n risks from different origins expose aquifers to risks as i point source nitrate n often relate to accidental releases but this is not addressed by the paper or ii diffuse sources as investigated by the paper this often arises from dry depositions dissolved nitrogen in precipitation irrigation return flows fertilisers manure applications and leguminous crops the study area is primarily impacted by fertilisers and this will be evidenced by multivariate analysis presented in section 5 4 the process of oxidisation of fertilisers is the main source of nitrogen in the study area where oxidisation refers to the gain of oxygen or loss of electrons by a substance during a chemical reaction pathways nitrate n diffused into aquifers is no longer local but its pathways can be defined by flow and transport equations receptors nitrate n through groundwater will eventually cross the boundaries to receptors through the abstraction wells baseflows fed to watercourses plants and crops affecting food production consequences of human exposures to high nitrate n concentrations are severe health impacts such as methamoglobinaemia gastric problems in adults almasri 2005 thyroid gland hypothyroidism and cancer bryan and loscalzo 2017 iii 2 outline

dissanayake 1980 and rao negendra 2003 notably the mean concentration of the fluoride ions in the study area is 2 8 mg l and its maximum value is approx 8 1 mg l high fluoride concentration in

anthropogenic due to the use of fertilisers water rock interactions are often responsible for generating fluoride ions in aquifers within various geological settings saxena and ahmed 2003 nadiri et al

gupta et al 2005 iv tectonic activities handa 1975 and v regional climates davraz et al 2008 presence of water in aquifers trigger a dissolution and the release of fluoride ions in alkaline media ph 7 6 to 8 6 and moderate electric conductivity ranging from 750 to 1750 µs cm see saxena and ahmed 2001 receptors are similar to the above anthropogenic pollutants consequence fluoride in small amounts is an essential component for normal mineralisation of bones and formation of dental enamel bell and ludwig 1970 exceedance of safe limits of fluoride poses risks to life due to undermining bones and dents structure its occurrence in water resources is risk to human health with such impacts as dental and skeleton fluorosis mahramanlioglu et al 2002 iii 3 outline of arsenic osprc processes arsenic is naturally found in the atmosphere water soil rocks and organisms in various organic or inorganic compounds occurrence of arsenic in natural forms is widespread and these are often described as arsenic loads a trace amount of arsenic is necessary for the sustenance of life and as such it does not necessarily pose risk to humans uthus 1992 generally arsenic contamination in water environments is geogenic and leaches out from salt minerals specially from the geological formations bearing sodium salts anwar et al 2003 origin presence of arsenic can occur through following origins geogenic

tisserand et al 2014 pi et al 2018 cao et al 2018 and bondu et al 2018 main natural origins of arsenic include basin fill deposits guo et al 2014 xie et al 2016 wen et al 2018 geothermal and volcanic activities sengupta et al 2014 alsina et al 2013 peña reyes et al 2015 the paper is focussed on geogenic and anthropogenic origins the processes triggering the release of ionic arsenic from arsenic loads in aquifers include i reductive dissolution under anoxic aquifers ii alkali desorption under oxidic aquifers at ph 8 iii sulphide oxidisation under oxidic aquifers at ph 7 see unicef 2008 source arsenic anomalies can be mobilised from geogenic origins in aquifers at common groundwater ph values i e 6 5 ph 8 5 under both oxidising and reducing conditions through leaching out sorbed arsenic ions with the likelihood of adverse effects pathways are exclusively the aquifers but can also be plants with their roots penetrating to water table receptors are similar to those of anthropogenic pollutants consequence exceedance of safe limits of arsenic poses risks to life as it is a highly toxic and carcinogenic metalloid and its occurrence in water resources is risk to human health with

4806,pressure on freshwater resources has resulted in greater greywater reuse for irrigation laundry greywater is one of the largest yet potentially soil damaging streams of domestic greywater there is limited research on the susceptibility of soils with various properties to degradation by laundry greywater thus the aim of this laboratory study was to investigate the effect of typical liquid and powdered laundry detergent greywater application on humus removal and hydraulic conductivity on a range of urban soils from the cape town region south africa powdered detergent pd greywater was significantly more detrimental in terms of soil humus removal and decreasing hydraulic conductivity compared to the liquid detergent ld greywater attributed to its alkaline ph ph 9 95 and 30 fold higher na content sandy soils were the most susceptible to humus losses due to pd greywater application 7 5 soil c lost while fe oxide rich chromic soils were the least 1 5 soil c lost granite derived kaolinitic soils were most susceptible to reduction in hydraulic conductivity 81 reduction due to pd greywater application while fe rich chromic soils were the least 47 reduction pd greywater should not be used for irrigating soils due to its aggressive soil degrading qualities while ld greywater should be used cautiously keywords laundry greywater soil degradation soil humus clay dispersion soil infiltration urban soils 1 introduction increasing population growth urbanisation and climate change have resulted in an increased global focus on the reuse of wastewater sources in particular domestic greywater which is considered less polluted than other streams ghaitidak and yadav 2013 maimon and gross 2018 global climate change models are predicting that mediterranean climatic regions of south africa cape town region australia and south western usa will become even hotter and drier putting severe strain on fresh water resources lu et al 2019 the effects of drought are more pronounced in mediterranean climates due to the fact that precipitation is absent during the hottest time of the year when water demand for irrigation is greatest recent 2015 2018 severe drought conditions forced the city of cape town south africa and surrounding municipalities to prohibit residents from using potable water for irrigating gardens including food gardens in 2017 2019 inhabitants were thus forced to use alternative water sources such as groundwater rainwater and domestic greywater for irrigation abstracting groundwater requires the installation of boreholes which could be very expensive rainwater harvesting tanks are more affordable but still require substantial capital inputs and space to install enough storage capacity to last through the dry summer thus the majority of the inhabitants are compelled to rely on re using greywater for food garden irrigation which has also been strongly publicly encouraged by the city of cape town city of cape town 2019 however there is limited research conducted to justify these recommendations maimon and gross 2018 some of the main concerns with reuse of greywater include health risks from pathogens and environmental risks due to alkalinity salts and micropollutants contained in detergents eriksson et al 2003 ghaitidak and yadav 2013 mohamed et al 2013 lubbe et al 2016 maimon and gross 2018 laundry greywater is one of the largest streams of domestic greywater ghaitidak and yadav 2013 that is also relatively easy to capture and apply for garden irrigation misra and sivongxay 2009 the drainage hose of a washing machine can be easily extended to allow direct irrigation of the garden unlike other sources of greywater such as basins baths and showers where direct access to drains are needed powdered and liquid laundry detergents have profoundly different chemical properties due to their main chemical ingredients powdered detergents pds are sodium carbonate based whereas the main ingredient of liquid detergents lds is water smulders and sung 2012 both types of detergents contain a host of ionic and non ionic surfactants ion sequestering agents bleaching agents and enzymes which assist with the removal of soil and organic material from fabrics smulders et al 2012 and therefore by their very nature would cause degradation of the soil when used for irrigation in a previous laboratory study misra and sivongxay 2009 demonstrated that the application of laundry ld greywater on a well aggregated australian red clay soil 40 clay ph 6 5 significantly reduced the soil s saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat to 84 95 compared to tap water tw as well as reducing the water holding capacity this was attributed to the high ph 9 21 and sodium absorption ratio sar value 12 3 of the ld greywater which resulted in dispersion of clay particles similarly mohamed et al 2018 showed that the single application of laundry ld and pd greywater to an acid ph 3 8 clay soil from malaysia significantly increased soil ph and electrical conductivity ec and reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat by 75 and 65 respectively they attributed the reduction in ksat due to the clogging of the soil pores by ingredients in the detergents and the resultant swelling of clays however it is also likely that the reduction in ksat was due to the dispersion of soil clay particles and pore clogging due to high ph and na content of the greywaters mcbride 1994 brady and weil 2014 increasing occupation of clay cation exchange surfaces by the strongly hydrating weakly complexing monovalent na ion promotes clay particle dispersion and high ph promotes generation of stronger negative charges on clays promoting repulsion and dispersion mcbride 1994 dispersed clay moves with applied water thus leading to pore clogging especially in finer textured soils brady and weil 2014 these undesirable chemical properties of laundry detergents would also likely enhance dispersion and removal of soil humus mcbride 1994 which is one of the most important contributors to soil quality lal 2016 application of laundry greywater could have different effects on soils with different textures c contents and metal oxide contents due to differences in pore structures and structural stability bronick and lal 2005 there is very limited research on the role of soil properties such as soil texture and clay mineralogy on the susceptibility of soils to degradation by laundry greywater previous laundry greywater studies have been restricted to a single clay soil 30 clay misra and sivongxay 2009 mohamed et al 2018 with little known about the impact of greywater application to lighter textured soils furthermore no previous studies have investigated the removal of soil humus by irrigation with greywater therefore the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of typical liquid and powdered detergent greywater application on hydraulic conductivity and humus removal on a range of urban soils with varying physical and chemical properties from the mediterranean climatic region of cape town south africa 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil sampling and characterization twenty topsoil samples were taken from gardens in urban areas of cape town and surrounding stellenbosch south africa collected samples were representative of five major soil types identified using regional soil maps provided by the agricultural research council institute for soil climate and water arc iscw pretoria fig s1 supplementary information these soil types were 1 aeolian sands which typically occur near coastal areas sands group arenosols iuss working group wrb 2014 2 alluvial deposits near rivers alluvial group fluvisols 3 soils originating from granite parent material granite group planosols lixisols 4 soils originating from shale parent material shale group lixisols acrisols and 5 highly weathered apedal red or yellow colluvial soils chromic group chromic lixisols acrisols the clay fraction of soils from this region are dominated by low activity clays mainly kaolinite with variable amounts of goethite hematite and gibbsite fig s2 supplementary information the aeolian sands are marine derived windblown sands that occur along the low altitude coastal regions they can be divided into two groups the calcareous sands closer to the ocean and the more leached acidic sands that occur 5 15 km from the coast schloms et al 1983 the alluvial soils occur in valley bottoms and have a loamy sand texture the granitic soils occur on the weakly dissected upland planes as well as at higher elevations on the mid to footslopes of the cape fold mountains many of these soils are duplex in nature with colluvial granitic material overlying truncated granitic pallid zones related to the african erosion surface the shale soils are found in a similar terrain position as the granitic soils and also predominantly duplex soils in both the duplex shale and granite derived soils that were sampled a degree of subsoil and topsoil mixing had taken place during garden preparation or house construction the deep chromic red and yellow colluvial soils occur on the lower midslopes of the cape fold mountains between altitudes of 150 and 300 m and are derived from highly weathered colluvial deposits dating back to the early tertiary period hendey 1983 they are considered palaeosols as their ferrallitic weathering occurred under more humid conditions compared to the modern mediterranean climate lambrechts 1983 all soil samples were air dried and sieved 2 mm

complete list of soils their respective groups sampling locations chemical and physical properties are given in table 1 the clay mineralogy of selected soil samples was determined by x ray diffraction harris and white 2008 fig s2 supplementary information 2 2 soil group properties statistical differences in clay and cbd fe content were observed between the different soil groups fig 1 the shale and chromic soil groups contained significantly higher clay content 20 23 than the aeolian sands 5 alluvium 10 and granite 11 groups the chromic soils contained significantly higher cbd fe 2 than the other groups fig 1b there were no significant differences in total c content between the groups however total c tended to increase with clay content fig 1c the total c contents of the garden soils were relatively high 1 7 3 7 compared to the average c content of 1 2 reported for south african topsoils du preez et al 2011 the granite and shale soils tended to contain a higher proportion of water dispersible clay in the clay fraction 41 42 than the sands 18 alluvium 22 or chromic soils 32 fig 1d although the differences were only statistically significant between the granite and sand groups none of the soils were classified as sodic exchangeable na ranged between 1 and 7 table 1 soil ph values ranged from 5 3 to 8 0 table 1 with a mean value of 7 0 urban soils are frequently affected by cement contamination due to their proximity to building structures which results in neutral to basic ph values and high ca exchangeable ca ranged between 77 and 93 and base base saturation ranged between 97 and 100 saturation percentages table 1 2 3 laundry detergent greywater characterization a selection of leading commercial brands of liquid seven and powdered six laundry detergents were obtained from local supermarkets the majority of these brands are also available internationally as they are manufactured by large multinational manufacturers such as unilever and proctor and gamble the detergents were used to make up solutions of greywater following the manufactures recommended guidelines stated on each product and using the total volume of water used by domestic washing machines for a typical normal wash cycle obtained from washing machine manufacturers websites this amounted to a typical application rate of 1 ml of liquid detergent ld and 2 4 ml of powdered detergent pd added per l of tap water tw the ph and ec values of these detergent solutions corresponded with the ph and ec of liquid and powdered laundry greywaters obtained from actual laundry loads performed in a variety of washing machines on a regular cycle the ph ec basic cation concentrations and sodium adsorption ratio sar of each detergent solution was determined after comparison of ph ec and sar values of the detergent solutions a representative liquid and powdered detergent was selected which provided the closest match to the average values of these parameters for each detergent type

laundry greywaters are given in table 1 2 4 soil leaching column study soil columns with a height of 100 mm and diameter of 35 mm were constructed from pvc piping fig s3 end caps with five equally spaced large holes 4 mm diameter were glued to the bottom of each column the inner walls of the soil columns were coated with a 1 1 fine and medium sand mixture adhered with pvc glue to minimize preferential flow along the sides a 15 mm layer of washed gravel 2 4 mm ø was place at the bottom of each soil column to promote free drainage of leachates and was covered with half a gram of glass wool to prevent soil loss through the gravel and drainage holes soil was placed in the columns packed at the normal expected textural class bulk density of the soil hillel 1980 to a height of 7 cm in each column a burette was set up above the leaching columns to allow the treatment solution to drip and maintain a 1 cm constant water head at the top of each column fig s3 each soil column was treated with a total amount of 200 mm of tap water ld or pd greywater solution fig s4 each treatment was replicated three times on each of the 20 different soil samples thus there were a total of 180 leaching columns the ksat of each soil with each solution treatment was determined by measuring the volume of leachate collected from the columns in 5 min intervals once the leachate volume had reached a steady state no change in volume collected between intervals the ksat was calculated using the following formula k sat vl ta δ h where v is volume of water l is column height t is the time interval a is the cross sectional area of the column and δh is the hydraulic head difference lal and shukla 2004 the ph ec turbidity orion aquafast thermoscientific ltd usa and uv visible absorbance

fine material clay fine silt and humus losses from each soil the uv visible absorbance at 350 nm was selected as an indicator of soluble humus losses ghabbour and davies 2009 selected leachate samples 30 were also analysed for total c content elementar vario macro cube elementar gmbh germany normalised to greywater or tap water total c content this enabled us to generate a linear regression curve between absorbance at 350 nm and total c content of the leachates r2 0 75 and therefore to estimate total c losses from the soil with each treatment at the end of the leaching experiment the wdc content of two contrasting greywater treated soils from the granite sp1 and chromic bd1 soil groups were determined to assess the effect of greywater application on clay dispersion 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis of soil and leachate data were performed using statistica 13 software package all results were expressed as an average of three replicates with standard error shown data were statistically analysed by a two way anova procedure results of two way anova analysis showed that the interaction between water treatments and soil groups was statistically significant at p 0 05 differences among treatment soil group means were separated by fisher s lsd test at p 0 05 the correlations p 0 05 between soil properties and treatment effects were assessed using spearman ranked r test due to the low number n 30 observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 greywater and tap water properties as anticipated the ld and pd greywater solutions differed dramatically in terms of ph ec and tds contents table 2 the pd greywater had a ph near 10 whereas the tw and ld ph values were near neutral the ec value of the pd greywater was 491 ms m 1 while that of ld was 18 9 ms m 1 the pd greywater was dominated by na 1338 mg l 1 carbonate 1280 mg l 1 and sulfate 1542 mg l 1 and had an extremely high sar value of 147 8 in contrast the ld greywater had a na content of 44 mg l 1 a sulfate content of 126 mg l 1 and an sar value of 4 7 when screening all the laundry detergents prior to selection it was found that greywater solution ec values strongly positively correlated with the na content of the solutions r 0 99 p 0 001 indicating the na was the main electrolyte in the greywaters both ld and pd contained high cod values of 1170 and 1353 mg l 1 resp in comparison misra and sivongxay 2009 reported a higher ph 9 2 ec 75 2 ms m 1 na content 125 mg l 1 and an sar value 12 3 for ld greywater used in their study mohamed et al 2013 and ghaitidak and yadav 2013 reported typical laundry greywater chemical properties from the literature as ph values of 7 10 ec values of 19 703 ms m 1 and cod values between 58 and 1339 mg l 1 thus our greywaters had similar values to those reported in the literature the most common surfactants in laundry detergents are linear alkylbenzenesulfonates las alcohol ethoxylates ae alkylphenol ethoxylates ape and linear or branched alkyl sulfates smulders and sung 2012 all of these surfactants are usually in the na complexed form which could explain the high na and sulfate content of the detergents table 1 other major ingredients in powdered detergents include builders such as na carbonate and polycarboxylates ca complexing agents such as sodium triphosphate and ion exchangers such as zeolites smulders and sung 2012 minor components include protease enzymes and bleaches such as sodium peroxoborate hydrate or inorganic peroxides the mixture of surfactants builders and ion sequestering agents are designed to promote dispersion of soil from textiles and prevent precipitation in washing machines smulders and sung 2012 according to the south african water quality guidelines for agricultural irrigation use dwaf 1996 the pd greywater does not meet the target water quality in terms of ph 6 5 8 4 ec 40 ds m 1 sar 2 or na content 70 mg l 1 whereas ld greywater does not meet the sar 2 target quality 3 2 leachate ph and ec the pd leachates ph values ph 7 6 8 7 were significantly higher than that of the ld or tw leachates fig 2 the pd leachates tended to have ph values 1 2 units lower 7 6 8 7 than the initial greywater solution ph 9 95 whereas the ld ph 6 7 7 4 and tw ph 6 5 7 5 leachate ph were more similar to the initial solutions fig 2 indicating that the soil neutralized some of the alkalinity in the pd greywater solution the tw and ld leachates tended to have higher ec values than the initial solutions fig 3 indicating the removal of ions whereas the pd leachate ec values were lower than that of the initial solution likely due to the neutralization of alkalinity oh fig 2 or to the adsorption of ions hydroxyl ions conduct current four times better than na ions and thus also contribute to ec readings mcbride 1994 thus it is clear that the pd greywater added alkalinity and salts mainly na ions to the soils which is highly undesirable in terms of soil fertility 3 3 humus removal the uv absorbance values of the pd leachates were significantly higher than that of the ld and tw treatments indicating the greatest losses of humus fig 4 there were no significant differences in the absorbance values between the tw and ld treatments except in the aeolian sands group fig 4 the significantly greater absorbance values of the pd leachates is likely due to the high ph 9 95 of the pd greywater compared to the ld 6 86 or tw 7 18 treatments table 2 which would promote the dispersion and solubilisation of humus due to formation maximum net negative charge mcbride 1994 the chromic group had significantly lower absorbance values than the other soil groups whereas the sands had the highest values fig 4 this is likely due to stronger chemical stabilization mechanisms of humus operating in the chromic soils involving ligand exchange reactions with broken edges of fe oxides or 1 1 clays von lützow et al 2006 sandy soils offer the least chemical stabilization of humus von lützow et al 2006 and also have a larger pore size distribution which leads to greater rates of hydraulic conductivity fig 6 thus enhancing humus removal pd and ld leachate absorbance was strongly negatively correlated with clay r 0 68 p 0 05 table 3 confirming the role of clay minerals in stabilization of humus whereas the tw leachate absorbance was strongly positively correlated with total soil c r 0 70 p 0 05 table 3 when the pd leachate absorbance values were converted to total c losses and expressed as a percentage of soil total c lost it was observed that c losses were significantly higher in the aeolian sands 7 5 and alluvium 4 4 groups compared to the granite 3 3 shale 2 5 or chromic groups 1 5 fig 5 the total c losses from tw 0 7 1 2 and ld 0 8 1 9 treatments were significantly lower than that of the pd treatment except in the chromic group fig 5 significant negative correlations were observed between pd treatment soil total c losses and clay r 0 75 p 0 05 and cbd fe r 0 52 p 0 05 table 3 similar strong negative correlations were observed for the ld treatment but not for the tw treatment table 3 therefore it can be concluded that the chromic soils are the least susceptible to humus removal by pd greywater solutions whereas the sands are the most the susceptible 3 4 saturated hydraulic conductivity and leachate turbidity application of pd greywater significantly decreased the ksat of all soil groups 47 82 reduction compared to application of tw fig 6 however application of ld only significantly reduced ksat of aeolian sands alluvium and shale soil groups 24 54 reduction compared to tw fig 6 when comparing the ksat of tw treatments relative to ld and pd treatments fig 7 a it can be seen that at steady state tw infiltrated the soil groups 1 3 to 2 6 times faster than ld greywater and 2 2 to 8 5 times faster than pd greywater fig 7a the reduction in ksat due to the application of the greywaters is attributed to the significant enhancement of dispersion of soil clay particles fig 8 which results in sealing of pores particularly in the more clay rich soils with finer pore size distribution hillel 1998 low activity clays such as the clays dominant in these soils kaolinite and crystalline metal oxides are more susceptible to dispersion due to their low surface area and charge nelson et al 1999 laundry detergents contain a host of surfactants builders and ion sequestering agents which are specifically designed to enhance clay and organic matter dispersion in soiled clothing smulders and sung 2012 the pd resulted in significantly greater reduction of ksat likely due to its substantially higher ph sar and na content table 2 which significantly enhanced clay dispersion fig 8 compared to tw or ld the ksat of tw and ld treatments were most strongly negatively correlated with soil clay content r 0 69 and 0 75 p 0 05 resp whereas ksat of pd treatments was only strongly negatively correlated with soil water dispersible clay content expressed as a percentage of total soil mass r 0 71 p 0 05 and as a percentage of clay mass r 0 68 p 0 05 table 3 this could indicate that in the case of the more aggressively dispersive pd greywater that the total amount of wdc had a greater role in pore sealing and subsequent reduction in ksat whereas in the tw and ld treatments ksat was mainly determined by soil texture sandy soils are known to be least susceptible to pore sealing due to application of high sar irrigation water brady and weil 2014 there were no significant differences in the tw ld ksat ratios between the different soil groups fig 7a however the tw pd ksat ratio of the granite soil group 8 5 was significantly higher than all other soil groups except the shale group 6 1 fig 7a this indicates that the granite and shale soils tended to be more susceptible to clay dispersion and pore sealing by pd greywater application compared to the other soils groups these soil groups also tended to inherently contain a higher proportion of water dispersible clay in the clay fraction compared to the other soil groups fig 1d this was also confirmed when comparing the percentage wdc of clay content of a selected granite and chromic greywater treated soil fig 8 the greywater treated granite soil sp1 contained significantly higher proportion of wdc of clay content tw 42 5 ld 56 3 and pd 95 5 compared to the chromic soil bd1 tw 9 0 ld 17 7 and pd 36 7 the granite soil group had a significantly lower clay content 11 than the shale group 20 which could indicate that it was easier for dispersed clay to migrate and seal pores than in the shale group soils the chromic soil group had a significantly lower tw pd ksat ratio 2 2 than the shale and granite groups and tended to be lower than the aeolian sand and alluvial groups 3 9 4 2 fig 7a iron oxides have net positive charge at acid ph ranges with zero points of charge at ph 6 8 sparks 2003 therefore they are known to contribute to enhanced soil structural stability at common soil ph ranges peng et al 2015 however it is likely at the alkaline ph of the pd greywater fig 2 that they would be developing some net negative charge which could limit their contribution to clay stabilization significant negative correlations were observed between cbd fe content and tw pd r 0 46 p 0 05 and ld pd r 0 73 p 0 05 ksat ratios table 2 indicating that fe oxides did play a role in the resistance of the soil to pore sealing by pd greywater compared to tw or ld greywater granite derived soils from the same region also showed a decrease in hydraulic conductivity after application of k and na rich winery wastewater mulidzi et al 2015 highlighting the susceptibility of these soils to clay dispersion the cape granites have an inherently low around 3 fe content farina et al 2012 and many granitic soils in the region are derived from bleached kaolinized saprolitic granite pallid zones that have been stripped of any fe oxide the leachate turbidity results indicated that significantly more fine material clay fine silt and humus was removed from the aeolian sands by ld and pd greywater compared to the other groups fig 9 this is likely due to the larger number of macro and meso pores within the sandy soil which could contribute to higher water flow velocities and turbulences hillel 1998 and also due to the lower extent of physical and chemical stabilization the pd and ld leachates were significantly more turbid than tw treatment except for the shale group where ld was not significantly different from tw fig 9 the leachate turbidity of the ld and pd treatments were significantly negatively correlated with cbd fe r 0 52 p 0 05 and silt content r 0 59 p 0 05 respectively table 3 indicating that these fractions play a role in reducing the loss of clay and humus from the soils with ld and pd greywater treatment 4 environmental significance and conclusions the results from this study demonstrated that the application of 200 mm of pd greywater to soils results in significant deterioration of soil quality in terms of stripping the soil of humus 1 5 7 5 c loss decreasing the hydraulic conductivity 47 82 decrease increasing the soil salinity and alkalinity together the dispersed clay and humus could also lead to surface crusting and sealing further inhibiting soil water infiltration brady and weil 2014 reduced rate of soil infiltration ultimately means more surface run off which leads to less water stored in the soil and possibly even topsoil erosion brady and weil 2014 dispersion of clay and resultant pore sealing also leads to lower soil water holding capacity due to lower porosity misra and sivongxay 2009 while ld greywater did not promote significant removal of soil c it did tend to reduce ksat of the soils 25 54 which could lead to serious physical degradation with continuous use the results also demonstrate certain soils are more susceptible to the negative effects of pd laundry greywater application than others sandy and alluvial soils accounting for approximately 58 of the greater cape town soils lost a substantial proportion of their organic matter due to single greywater application which would reduce the water holding capacity and health of the soils granitic and shale soils 24 of the greater cape town soils demonstrated a substantial decrease in hydraulic conductivity as a result of sensitivity to clay dispersion the soils that were the most resilient to laundry greywater degradation were the fe rich cbd fe 2 chromic soils which only constitute a minor proportion approximately 14 of the soils of greater cape town area although more resilient chromic soils would still be prone to becoming sodic and saline making it harder for plants to grow thus exacerbating drought stresses in the dry summer months based on these results it is recommended that powdered laundry detergent greywaters are not applied to soils liquid laundry detergents are substantially less damaging to soils but the short term gains in terms of irrigation need to be weighed up against the accumulated negative effects of repeated grey water application on soil quality and long term drought resilience of

4806,pressure on freshwater resources has resulted in greater greywater reuse for irrigation laundry greywater is one of the largest yet potentially soil damaging streams of domestic greywater there is limited research on the susceptibility of soils with various properties to degradation by laundry greywater thus the aim of this laboratory study was to investigate the effect of typical liquid and powdered laundry detergent greywater application on humus removal and hydraulic conductivity on a range of urban soils from the cape town region south africa powdered detergent pd greywater was significantly more detrimental in terms of soil humus removal and decreasing hydraulic conductivity compared to the liquid detergent ld greywater attributed to its alkaline ph ph 9 95 and 30 fold

kaolinitic soils were most susceptible to reduction in hydraulic conductivity 81 reduction due to pd greywater application while fe rich chromic soils were the least 47 reduction pd greywater should not be used for irrigating soils due to its aggressive soil degrading qualities while ld greywater should be used cautiously keywords laundry greywater soil degradation soil humus clay dispersion soil infiltration urban soils 1 introduction increasing population growth urbanisation and climate change have resulted in an increased global focus on the reuse of wastewater sources in particular domestic greywater which is considered less polluted than other streams ghaitidak and yadav 2013 maimon and gross 2018 global climate change models are predicting that mediterranean climatic regions of south africa cape town region australia and south western usa will become even hotter and drier putting severe strain on fresh water resources lu et al 2019 the effects of drought are more pronounced in mediterranean climates due to the fact that precipitation is absent during the hottest time of the year when water demand for irrigation is greatest recent 2015 2018 severe drought conditions forced the city of cape town south africa and surrounding municipalities to prohibit residents from using potable water for irrigating gardens including food gardens in 2017 2019 inhabitants were thus forced to use alternative water sources such as groundwater rainwater and domestic greywater for irrigation abstracting groundwater requires the installation of boreholes which could be very expensive rainwater harvesting tanks are more affordable but still require substantial capital inputs and space to install enough storage capacity to last through the dry summer thus the majority of the inhabitants are compelled to rely on re using greywater for food garden irrigation which has also been strongly publicly encouraged by the city of cape town city of cape town 2019 however there is limited research conducted to justify these recommendations maimon and gross 2018 some of the main concerns with reuse of greywater include health risks from pathogens and environmental risks due to alkalinity salts and micropollutants contained in detergents eriksson et al 2003 ghaitidak and yadav 2013 mohamed et al 2013 lubbe et al 2016 maimon and gross 2018 laundry greywater is one of the largest streams of domestic greywater ghaitidak and yadav 2013 that is also relatively easy to capture and apply for garden irrigation misra and sivongxay 2009 the drainage hose of a washing machine can be easily extended to allow direct irrigation of the garden unlike other sources of greywater such as basins baths and showers where direct access to drains are needed powdered and liquid laundry detergents have profoundly different chemical properties due to their main chemical ingredients powdered detergents pds are sodium carbonate based whereas the main ingredient of liquid detergents lds is water smulders and sung 2012 both types of detergents contain a host of ionic and non ionic surfactants ion sequestering agents bleaching agents and enzymes which assist with the removal of soil and organic material from fabrics smulders et al 2012 and therefore by their very nature would cause degradation of the soil when used for irrigation in a previous laboratory study misra and sivongxay 2009 demonstrated that the application of laundry ld greywater on a well aggregated australian red clay soil 40 clay ph 6 5 significantly reduced the soil s saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat to 84 95 compared to tap water tw as well as reducing the water holding capacity this was attributed to the high ph 9 21 and sodium absorption ratio sar value 12 3 of the ld greywater which resulted in dispersion of clay particles similarly mohamed et al 2018 showed that the single application of laundry ld and pd greywater to an acid ph 3 8 clay soil from malaysia significantly increased soil ph and electrical conductivity ec and reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat by 75 and 65 respectively they attributed the reduction in ksat due to the clogging of the soil pores by ingredients in the detergents and the resultant swelling of clays however it is also likely that the reduction in ksat was due to the dispersion of soil clay particles and pore clogging due to high ph and na content of the greywaters mcbride 1994 brady and weil 2014 increasing occupation of clay cation exchange surfaces by the strongly hydrating weakly complexing monovalent na ion promotes clay particle dispersion and high ph promotes generation of stronger negative charges on clays promoting repulsion and dispersion mcbride 1994 dispersed clay moves with applied water thus leading to pore clogging especially in finer textured soils brady and weil 2014 these undesirable chemical properties of laundry detergents would also likely enhance dispersion and removal of soil humus mcbride 1994 which is one of the most important contributors to soil quality lal 2016 application of laundry greywater could have different effects on soils with different textures c contents and metal oxide contents due to differences in pore structures and structural stability bronick and lal 2005 there is very limited research on the role of soil properties such as soil texture and clay mineralogy on the susceptibility of soils to degradation by laundry greywater previous laundry greywater studies have been restricted to a single clay soil 30 clay misra and sivongxay 2009 mohamed et al 2018 with little known about the impact of greywater application to lighter textured soils furthermore no previous studies have investigated the removal of soil humus by irrigation with greywater therefore the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of typical liquid and powdered detergent greywater application on hydraulic conductivity and humus removal on a range of urban soils with varying physical and chemical properties from the mediterranean climatic region of cape town south africa 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil sampling and characterization twenty topsoil samples were taken from gardens in urban areas of cape town and surrounding stellenbosch south africa collected samples were representative of five major soil types identified using regional soil maps provided by the agricultural research council institute for soil climate and water arc iscw pretoria fig s1 supplementary information these soil types were 1 aeolian sands which typically occur near coastal areas sands group arenosols iuss working group wrb 2014 2 alluvial deposits near rivers alluvial group fluvisols 3 soils originating from granite parent material granite group planosols lixisols 4 soils originating from shale parent material shale group lixisols acrisols and 5 highly weathered apedal red or yellow colluvial soils chromic group chromic lixisols acrisols the clay fraction of soils from this region are dominated by low activity clays mainly kaolinite with variable amounts of goethite hematite and gibbsite fig s2 supplementary information the aeolian sands are marine derived windblown sands that occur along the low altitude coastal regions they can be divided into two groups the calcareous sands closer to the ocean and the more leached acidic sands that occur 5 15 km from the coast schloms et al 1983 the alluvial soils occur in valley bottoms and have a loamy sand texture the granitic soils occur on the weakly dissected upland planes as well as at higher elevations on the mid to footslopes of the cape fold mountains many of these soils are duplex in nature with colluvial granitic material overlying truncated granitic pallid zones related to the african erosion surface the shale soils are found in a similar terrain position as the granitic soils and also predominantly duplex soils in both the duplex shale and granite derived soils that were sampled a degree of subsoil and topsoil mixing had taken place during garden preparation or house construction the deep chromic red and yellow colluvial soils occur on the lower midslopes of the cape fold mountains between altitudes of 150 and 300 m and are derived from highly weathered colluvial deposits dating back to the early tertiary period hendey 1983 they are considered palaeosols as their ferrallitic weathering occurred under more humid conditions compared to the modern mediterranean climate lambrechts 1983 all soil samples were air dried and sieved 2 mm

complete list of soils their respective groups sampling locations chemical and physical properties are given in table 1 the clay mineralogy of selected soil samples was determined by x ray diffraction harris and white 2008 fig s2 supplementary information 2 2 soil group properties statistical differences in clay and cbd fe content were observed between the different soil groups fig 1 the shale and chromic soil groups contained significantly higher clay content 20 23 than the aeolian sands 5 alluvium 10 and granite 11 groups the chromic soils contained significantly higher cbd fe 2 than the other groups fig 1b there were no significant differences in total c content between the groups however total c tended to increase with clay content fig 1c the total c contents of the garden soils were relatively high 1 7 3 7 compared to the average c content of 1 2 reported for south african topsoils du preez et al 2011 the granite and shale soils tended to contain a higher proportion of water dispersible clay in the clay fraction 41 42 than the sands 18 alluvium 22 or chromic soils 32 fig 1d although the differences were only statistically significant between the granite and sand groups none of the soils were classified as sodic exchangeable na ranged between 1 and 7 table 1 soil ph values ranged from 5 3 to 8 0 table 1 with a mean value of 7 0 urban soils are frequently affected by cement contamination due to their proximity to building structures which results in neutral to basic ph values and high ca exchangeable ca ranged between 77 and 93 and base base saturation ranged between 97 and 100 saturation percentages table 1 2 3 laundry detergent greywater characterization a selection of leading commercial brands of liquid seven and powdered six laundry detergents were obtained from local supermarkets the majority of these brands are also available internationally as they are manufactured by large multinational manufacturers such as unilever and proctor and gamble the detergents were used to make up solutions of greywater following the manufactures recommended guidelines stated on each product and using the total volume of water used by domestic washing machines for a typical normal wash cycle obtained from washing machine manufacturers websites this amounted to a typical application rate of 1 ml of liquid detergent ld and 2 4 ml of powdered detergent pd added per l of tap water tw the ph and ec values of these detergent solutions corresponded with the ph and ec of liquid and powdered laundry greywaters obtained from actual laundry loads performed in a variety of washing machines on a regular cycle the ph ec basic cation concentrations and sodium adsorption ratio sar of each detergent solution was determined after comparison of ph ec and sar values of the detergent solutions a representative liquid and powdered detergent was selected which provided the closest match to the average values of these parameters for each detergent type the tap water and chosen detergents greywater solutions were then analysed in duplicate for total elemental analysis p ca mg k na b fe mn cu and zn mineral n nh4 and no3 anion content cl so4 2 f alkalinity hco3 and co3 2 and chemical oxygen demand cod by an accredited commercial water laboratory bemlab pty ltd south africa the complete chemical analysis of tw and the selected ld and pd laundry greywaters are given in table 1 2 4 soil leaching column study soil columns with a height of 100 mm and diameter of 35 mm were constructed from pvc piping fig s3 end caps with five equally spaced large holes 4 mm diameter were glued to the bottom of each column the inner walls of the soil columns were coated with a 1 1 fine and medium sand mixture adhered with pvc glue to minimize preferential flow along the sides a 15 mm layer of washed gravel 2 4 mm ø was place at the bottom of each soil column to promote free drainage of leachates and was covered with half a gram of glass wool to prevent soil loss through the gravel and drainage holes soil was placed in the columns packed at the normal expected textural class bulk density of the soil hillel 1980 to a height of 7 cm in each column a burette was set up above the leaching columns to allow the treatment solution to drip and maintain a 1 cm constant water head at the top of each column fig s3 each soil column was treated with a total amount of 200 mm of tap water ld or pd greywater solution fig s4 each treatment was replicated three times on each of the 20 different soil samples thus there were a total of 180 leaching columns the ksat of each soil with each solution treatment was determined by measuring the volume of leachate collected from the columns in 5 min intervals once the leachate volume had reached a steady state no change in volume collected between intervals the ksat was calculated using the following formula k sat vl ta δ h where v is volume of water l is column height t is the time interval a is the cross sectional area of the column and δh is the hydraulic head difference lal and shukla 2004 the ph ec turbidity orion aquafast thermoscientific ltd usa and uv visible absorbance

fine material clay fine silt and humus losses from each soil the uv visible absorbance at 350 nm was selected as an indicator of soluble humus losses ghabbour and davies 2009 selected leachate samples 30 were also analysed for total c content elementar vario macro cube elementar gmbh germany normalised to greywater or tap water total c content this enabled us to generate a linear regression curve between absorbance at 350 nm and total c content of the leachates r2 0 75 and therefore to estimate total c losses from the soil with each treatment at the end of the leaching experiment the wdc content of two contrasting greywater treated soils from the granite sp1 and chromic bd1 soil groups were determined to assess the effect of greywater application on clay dispersion 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis of soil and leachate data were performed using statistica 13 software package all results were expressed as an average of three replicates with standard error shown data were statistically analysed by a two way anova procedure results of two way anova analysis showed that the interaction between water treatments and soil groups was statistically significant at p 0 05 differences among treatment soil group means were separated by fisher s lsd test at p 0 05 the correlations p 0 05 between soil properties and treatment effects were assessed using spearman ranked r test due to the low number n 30 observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 greywater and tap water properties as anticipated the ld and pd greywater solutions differed dramatically in terms of ph ec and tds contents table 2 the pd greywater had a ph near 10 whereas the tw and ld ph values were near neutral the ec value of the pd greywater was 491 ms m 1 while that of ld was 18 9 ms m 1 the pd greywater was dominated by na 1338 mg l 1 carbonate 1280 mg l 1 and sulfate 1542 mg l 1 and had an extremely high sar value of 147 8 in contrast the ld greywater had a na content of 44 mg l 1 a sulfate content of 126 mg l 1 and an sar value of 4 7 when screening all the laundry detergents prior to selection it was found that greywater solution ec values strongly positively correlated with the na content of the solutions r 0 99 p 0 001 indicating the na was the main electrolyte in the greywaters both ld and pd contained high cod values of 1170 and 1353 mg l 1 resp in comparison misra and sivongxay 2009 reported a higher ph 9 2 ec 75 2 ms m 1 na content 125 mg l 1 and an sar value 12 3 for ld greywater used in their study mohamed et al 2013 and ghaitidak and yadav 2013 reported typical laundry greywater chemical properties from the literature as ph values of 7 10 ec values of 19 703 ms m 1 and cod values between 58 and 1339 mg l 1 thus our greywaters had similar values to those reported in the literature the most common surfactants in laundry detergents are linear alkylbenzenesulfonates las alcohol ethoxylates ae alkylphenol ethoxylates ape and linear or branched alkyl sulfates smulders and sung 2012 all of these surfactants are usually in the na complexed form which could explain the high na and sulfate content of the detergents table 1 other major ingredients in powdered detergents include builders such as na carbonate and polycarboxylates ca complexing agents such as sodium triphosphate and ion exchangers such as zeolites smulders and sung 2012 minor components include protease enzymes and bleaches such as sodium peroxoborate hydrate or inorganic peroxides the mixture of surfactants builders and ion sequestering agents are designed to promote dispersion of soil from textiles and prevent precipitation in washing machines smulders and sung 2012 according to the south african water quality guidelines for agricultural irrigation use dwaf 1996 the pd greywater does not meet the target water quality in terms of ph 6 5 8 4 ec 40 ds m 1 sar 2 or na content 70 mg l 1 whereas ld greywater does not meet the sar 2 target quality 3 2 leachate ph and ec the pd leachates ph values ph 7 6 8 7 were significantly higher than that of the ld or tw leachates fig 2 the pd leachates tended to have ph values 1 2 units lower 7 6 8 7 than the initial greywater solution ph 9 95 whereas the ld ph 6 7 7 4 and tw ph 6 5 7 5 leachate ph were more similar to the initial solutions fig 2 indicating that the soil neutralized some of the alkalinity in the pd greywater solution the tw and ld leachates tended to have higher ec values than the initial solutions fig 3 indicating the removal of ions whereas the pd leachate ec values were lower than that of the initial solution likely due to the neutralization of alkalinity oh fig 2 or to the adsorption of ions hydroxyl ions conduct current four times better than na ions and thus also contribute to ec readings mcbride 1994 thus it is clear that the pd greywater added alkalinity and salts mainly na ions to the soils which is highly undesirable in terms of soil fertility 3 3 humus removal the uv absorbance values of the pd leachates were significantly higher than that of the ld and tw treatments indicating the greatest losses of humus fig 4 there were no significant differences in the absorbance values between the tw and ld treatments except in the aeolian sands group fig 4 the significantly greater absorbance values of the pd leachates is likely due to the high ph 9 95 of the pd greywater compared to the ld 6 86 or tw 7 18 treatments table 2 which would promote the dispersion and solubilisation of humus due to formation maximum net negative charge mcbride 1994 the chromic group had significantly lower absorbance values than the other soil groups whereas the sands had the highest values fig 4 this is likely due to stronger chemical stabilization mechanisms of humus operating in the chromic soils involving ligand exchange reactions with broken edges of fe oxides or 1 1 clays von lützow et al 2006 sandy soils offer the least chemical stabilization of humus von lützow et al 2006 and also have a larger pore size distribution which leads to greater rates of hydraulic conductivity fig 6 thus enhancing humus removal pd and ld leachate absorbance was strongly negatively correlated with clay r 0 68 p 0 05 table 3 confirming the role of clay minerals in stabilization of humus whereas the tw leachate absorbance was strongly positively correlated with total soil c r 0 70 p 0 05 table 3 when the pd leachate absorbance values were converted to total c losses and expressed as a percentage of soil total c lost it was observed that c losses were significantly higher in the aeolian sands 7 5 and alluvium 4 4 groups compared to the granite 3 3 shale 2 5 or chromic groups 1 5 fig 5 the total c losses from tw 0 7 1 2 and ld 0 8 1 9 treatments were significantly lower than that of the pd treatment except in the chromic group fig 5 significant negative correlations were observed between pd treatment soil total c losses and clay r 0 75 p 0 05 and cbd fe r 0 52 p 0 05 table 3 similar strong negative correlations were observed for the ld treatment but not for the tw treatment table 3 therefore it can be concluded that the chromic soils are the least susceptible to humus removal by pd greywater solutions whereas the sands are the most the susceptible 3 4 saturated hydraulic conductivity and leachate turbidity application of pd greywater significantly decreased the ksat of all soil groups 47 82 reduction compared to application of tw fig 6 however application of ld only significantly reduced ksat of aeolian sands alluvium and shale soil groups 24 54 reduction compared to tw fig 6 when comparing the ksat of tw treatments relative to ld and pd treatments fig 7 a it can be seen that at steady state tw infiltrated the soil groups 1 3 to 2 6 times faster than ld greywater and 2 2 to 8 5 times faster than pd greywater fig 7a the reduction in ksat due to the application of the greywaters is attributed to the significant enhancement of dispersion of soil clay particles fig 8 which results in sealing of pores particularly in the more clay rich soils with finer pore size distribution hillel 1998 low activity clays such as the clays dominant in these soils kaolinite and crystalline metal oxides are more susceptible to dispersion due to their low surface area and charge nelson et al 1999 laundry detergents contain a host of surfactants builders and ion sequestering agents which are specifically designed to enhance clay and organic matter dispersion in soiled clothing smulders and sung 2012 the pd resulted in significantly greater reduction of ksat likely due to its substantially higher ph sar and na content table 2 which significantly enhanced clay dispersion fig 8 compared to tw or ld the ksat of tw and ld treatments were most strongly negatively correlated with soil clay content r 0 69 and 0 75 p 0 05 resp whereas ksat of pd treatments was only strongly negatively correlated with soil water dispersible clay content expressed as a percentage of total soil mass r 0 71 p 0 05 and as a percentage of clay mass r 0 68 p 0 05 table 3 this could indicate that in the case of the more aggressively dispersive pd greywater that the total amount of wdc had a greater role in pore sealing and subsequent reduction in ksat whereas in the tw and ld treatments ksat was mainly determined by soil texture sandy soils are known to be least susceptible to pore sealing due to application of high sar irrigation water brady and weil 2014 there were no significant differences in the tw ld ksat ratios between the different soil groups fig 7a however the tw pd ksat ratio of the granite soil group 8 5 was significantly higher than all other soil groups except the shale group 6 1 fig 7a this indicates that the granite and shale soils tended to be more susceptible to clay dispersion and pore sealing by pd greywater application compared to the other soils groups these soil groups also tended to inherently contain a higher proportion of water dispersible clay in the clay fraction compared to the other soil groups fig 1d this was also confirmed when comparing the percentage wdc of clay content of a selected granite and chromic greywater treated soil fig 8 the greywater treated granite soil sp1 contained significantly higher proportion of wdc of clay content tw 42 5 ld 56 3 and pd 95 5 compared to the chromic soil bd1 tw 9 0 ld 17 7 and pd 36 7 the granite soil group had a significantly lower clay content 11 than the shale group 20 which could indicate that it was easier for dispersed clay to migrate and seal pores than in the shale group soils the chromic soil group had a significantly lower tw pd ksat ratio 2 2 than the shale and granite groups and tended to be lower than the aeolian sand and alluvial groups 3 9 4 2 fig 7a iron oxides have net positive charge at acid ph ranges with zero points of charge at ph 6 8 sparks 2003 therefore they are known to contribute to enhanced soil structural stability at common soil ph ranges peng et al 2015 however it is likely at the alkaline ph of the pd greywater fig 2 that they would be developing some net negative charge which could limit their contribution to clay stabilization significant negative correlations were observed between cbd fe content and tw pd r 0 46 p 0 05 and ld pd r 0 73 p 0 05 ksat ratios table 2 indicating that fe oxides did play a role in the resistance of the soil to pore sealing by pd greywater compared to tw or ld greywater granite derived soils from the same region also showed a decrease in hydraulic conductivity after application of k and na rich winery wastewater mulidzi et al 2015 highlighting the susceptibility of these soils to clay dispersion the cape granites have an inherently low around 3 fe content farina et al 2012 and many granitic soils in the region are derived from bleached kaolinized saprolitic granite pallid zones that have been stripped of any fe oxide the leachate turbidity results indicated that significantly more fine material clay fine silt and humus was removed from the aeolian sands by ld and pd greywater compared to the other groups fig 9 this is likely due to the larger number of macro and meso pores within the sandy soil which could contribute to higher water flow velocities and turbulences hillel 1998 and also due to the lower extent of physical and chemical stabilization the pd and ld leachates were significantly more turbid than tw treatment except for the shale group where ld was not significantly different from tw fig 9 the leachate turbidity of the ld and pd treatments were significantly negatively correlated with cbd fe r 0 52 p 0 05 and silt content r 0 59 p 0 05 respectively table 3 indicating that these fractions play a role in reducing the loss of clay and humus from the soils with ld and pd greywater treatment 4 environmental significance and conclusions the results from this study demonstrated that the application of 200 mm of pd greywater to soils results in significant deterioration of soil quality in terms of stripping the soil of humus 1 5 7 5 c loss decreasing the hydraulic conductivity 47 82 decrease increasing the soil salinity and alkalinity together the dispersed clay and humus could also lead to surface crusting and sealing further inhibiting soil water infiltration brady and weil 2014 reduced rate of soil infiltration ultimately means more surface run off which leads to less water stored in the soil and possibly even topsoil erosion brady and weil 2014 dispersion of clay and resultant pore sealing also leads to lower soil water holding capacity due to lower porosity misra and sivongxay 2009 while ld greywater did not promote significant removal of soil c it did tend to reduce ksat of the soils 25 54 which could lead to serious physical degradation with continuous use the results also demonstrate certain soils are more susceptible to the negative effects of pd laundry greywater application than others sandy and alluvial soils accounting for approximately 58 of the greater cape town soils lost a substantial proportion of their organic matter due to single greywater application which would reduce the water holding capacity and health of the soils granitic and shale soils 24 of the greater cape town soils demonstrated a substantial decrease in hydraulic conductivity as a result of sensitivity to clay dispersion the soils that were the most resilient to laundry greywater degradation were the fe rich cbd fe 2 chromic soils which only constitute a minor proportion approximately 14 of the soils of greater cape town area although more resilient chromic soils would still be prone to becoming sodic and saline making it harder for plants to grow thus exacerbating drought stresses in the dry summer months based on these results it is recommended that powdered laundry detergent greywaters are not applied to soils liquid laundry detergents are substantially less damaging to soils but the short term gains in terms of irrigation need to be weighed up against the accumulated negative effects of repeated grey water application on soil quality and long term drought resilience of

4807,rainfall in mountainous watershed presents high spatial variability due to elevation effects and this introduces uncertainty in forecasting hydrological hazards such as water floods and debris flows this study investigated the spatial variation of rainfall in a small watershed with a network of 10 rain gauges a rainfall elevation relationship was established based on data from 52 rainstorm events which provides a method for rainfall estimation within the watershed result indicated that lower errors of interpolation occur when the rainfall amount is high and that it is more difficult to estimate rainfall in high elevation regions rain gauges become less representative when the distance between gauges is 3 0 km the spatial variation of rainfall suggests that the gauge at the lowest elevation or a single gauge within the source region shows non negligible errors with regard to calculating water flood discharge and identifying rainfall thresholds for debris flows this study contributes to the understanding of event rainfall distribution and its impact on hydrological hazard forecasting in a small mountainous watershed keywords rainfall spatial variability rainfall estimation rain gauge network debris flow 1 introduction rainfall is the most common inducing factor of hydrological hazards e g water floods and debris flows in mountainous watersheds with areas of 50 km2 and large elevation differences wieczorek 1996 jakob et al 2012 hungr et al 2014 cui et al 2018 forecasting of such events is achievable through physical based simulation e g hydrological modeling and or empirical methods e g statistical rainfall thresholds both relying on rainfall as input however the rainfall data is highly uncertain due to measurement errors systematic errors of interpolations and intrinsic errors of rainfall randomness these errors propagate through the model and directly impact the accuracy of forecasting therefore a good knowledge of the uncertainty of rainfall data is essential for a correct forecasting of hydrological hazards obtaining accurate rainfall data in mountainous region represents a major challenge krajewski et al 2000 2003 radar and satellite remote sensing can provide nearly complete qualitative distributions of rainfall at high temporal and spatial resolutions and both have become viable techniques for supplementing rainfall information e g fabry et al 1994 bradley et al 2002 kirschbaum et al 2012 rossi et al 2012 marra et al 2014 2016 however the coverage in many mountainous regions is poor thus in most cases ground based rain gauge networks remain the only viable option for measurement of local rainfall habib et al 2001 unfortunately the density of a rain gauge network is often too low to provide sufficient data therefore estimations are often produced based on data recorded at neighboring gauges e g aleotti 2004 godt et al 2006 brunetti et al 2010 berti et al 2012 in such cases huge discrepancies can arise the implications of which were clearly illustrated by the catastrophic debris flows in zhouqu china on august 8 2010 which caused 1765 fatalities in the event a gauge 16 km from the headwaters recorded 96 mm of rainfall whereas the gauge at the outlet recorded only 3 mm hu et al 2010 cui et al 2013 such results exemplify the scale of the variation and uncertainty associated with rainfall in mountainous watersheds the spatial distribution of rainfall is complicated and influenced by many orographic parameters e g elevation slope aspect shadowing and curvature and climatic factors e g wind e g goovaerts 2000 lloyd 2005 tobin et al 2011 but it is hard to identify the major factors responsible for the high spatial variability of rainfall in small watershed dore et al 1982 for a better understanding and characterization the local key influencing parameters should be considered for instance spreen 1947 found that elevation alone explains 30 of the seasonal variance of rainfall while the combination of altitude slope exposure and orientation explained 88 basist et al 1994 found slope gradient orientation elevation and exposure as the best mean annual precipitation predictors for 10 mountains strong winds may also redistribute the precipitation facilitating largest amounts in the valleys ye et al 2004 yang et al 2005 among the parameters elevation can be considered as the most important because its influence remains constant while that form others varies with events hevesi et al 1992a 1992b goovaerts 2000 tobin et al 2011 in most cases on a given slope rainfall typically increases with elevation which is commonly called the orographic effect e g hutchinson 1968 vuglinski 1972 hibbert 1977 smith 1979 kumari et al 2017 and generally local rainfall increases with elevation in linear form which has proved an acceptable approximation in many situations e g hibbert 1977 houghton 1979 obsorn 1984 buytaert et al 2006 however the characteristics of the relationship can vary appreciably from hillslope to hillslope this make it difficult to obtain a usable relationship unless rainfall stations are grouped into regions that control for such factors basist et al 1994 kumari et al 2017 although systematic uncertainties exist for measuring the rainfall amounts by gauges with regard to many factors they can be reduced significantly by long term and dense rainfall monitoring networks ye et al 2004 zhang et al 2004 xu et al 2013 ma et al 2015 kumari et al 2017 objectives of rain gauge network design include effective rainfall measurement and determination of the effects of rainfall uncertainty to other hydrological variables bras et al 1988 gauge distribution significantly influences rainfall estimation it has been suggested that only densely distributed gauges are adequate for forecasting of rainfall induced floods and debris flows haberlandt 2007 wagner et al 2012 interpolation based on geostatistical theory which relies on a robust anisotropic variogram to define the spatial rainfall structure is useful for rainfall estimation e g goovaerts 1997 2000 2013 price et al 2000 lloyd 2005 hancock and hutchinson 2006 tobin et al 2011 wagner et al 2012 ly et al 2011 krivoruchko 2012 krivoruchko and gribov 2019 unfortunately the validation approach depends on the number and distribution of gauges which are generally inadequate in data sparse watersheds hattermann et al 2005 therefore both the design of an effective monitoring network and choice of an interpolation method require insight into the variability and uncertainty of rainfall goovaerts 2000 buytaert et al 2006 several studies have proposed techniques to address the rainfall estimation uncertainty and its effects on hydrological hazard prediction jakob et al 2012 nikolopoulos et al 2014 2015 most related studies have been conducted on long term i e monthly daily rainfall over large regions rather than on short term rainfall events in small watersheds the distinction is important because rainfall is more heterogeneous and pronounced over short timescales and the degree of uncertainty is influenced primarily by the density of gauges nikolopoulos et al 2014 in general despite the complxity of mechanisms for spatial variation of rainfall orographic variables are undoubtedly the tangible agencies among which the elevation is the most conspicuous lloyd 2005 tobin et al 2011 therefore in this study we analyzed the relationship between rainfall and elevation in a small mountainous watershed with large elevation difference and proposed a rainfall estimation method in addition we assessed the estimation errors associated with elevation rainfall amount and gauge density using rainfall interpolation methods finally the uncertainty of using different rainfall input data for forecasting floods and debris flows was evaluated to determine the effect of the representativeness of rain gauges 2 study area water floods and debris flows occur frequently and are widely distributed throughout the basin of the xiaojiang river a tributary of the jinsha river in southwest china fig 1 this semiarid mountainous area has high tectonic activity abundant fragmented rocks and large elevation differences it is known for its poor ecological conditions and environmental disasters such as landslides debris flows soil erosion and land debrisization in addition to the geological and topographic conditions that are favorable for debris flow development the mountains stimulate the occurrence of hydrological hazards by providing abundant rainfall and runoff for soil movement in headwater regions forecasting of the hazards is difficult because of the spatial variation of rainfall the jiangjia gully is located within the xiaojiang river it has an area of 48 6 km2 and it extends from its drainage divide at an elevation of 3269 m to its outlet at 1042 m it has been frequently impacted by tectonic activities e g earthquakes and has deeply cut sloping terrain over a large elevation range this valley is known for frequent debris flow occurrences and long term rainfall observations cui et al 2005 guo et al 2013 2016 many studies have examined the mechanisms and triggering conditions of debris flows e g li et al 2003 2004 2008 cui et al 2005 2007 we selected it for this case study because of its dense rain gauge distribution fig 1 the valley can be divided into three climatic regimes 1 a subtropical dry and hot valley climate extending from the outlet up to 1600 m where the mean annual precipitation map is 600 700 mm mean annual temperature mat is 20 c and mean annual evaporation mae is 3700 mm 2 a subtropical semiarid climate between 1600 and 2200 m where map is 700 850 mm mat is 13 c and mae is 1700 mm 3 a humid climate above 2200 m where map is 850 1200 mm mat is 7 c and mae is 1350 mm the variations in precipitation temperature and evaporation affect both vegetation distribution and rock weathering and thus contribute in varying degrees to the occurrence of debris flows cui et al 2015 guo et al 2020 to date debris flows are mainly formed in the menqian gully which is the northern branch fig 1 ten rain gauges r1 r10 have been installed in the watershed fig 1 based on monitoring data 2006 2017 the rainy season may september accounts for approximately 85 of map for example at gauges r1 and r9 rainfall during the rainy season accounts for 83 0 and 89 7 of the total annual rainfall respectively the maximum daily rainfall amounts recorded at r1 and r9 are 53 5 and 63 1 mm respectively accounting for 9 4 and 10 0 of the total annual rainfall torrential rainstorms in summer are the main factor contributing to the frequent occurrence of debris flows 3 data source and methods 3 1 data source the length of the data records of the 10 rain gauges extends for more than a decade the lowest placed gauge r1 is at the elevation of 1351 m in the downstream section fig 1 whereas the others are all in the headwater regions at various elevations as listed in table 1 each rain gauge measures real time rainfall using a 0 1 mm tipping bucket and the data are transmitted via the general packet radio service rainfall events are separated with 6 h dry hiatuses restrepo posada and eagleson 1982 the rainfall amount of the event rainfall was therefore cumulated quantitatively from the beginning to the end of the rainfall to identify the spatial characteristics of event rainfall within the watershed we assessed the rainfall data recorded during 2006 2017 and selected 52 events in which the rainfall amount exceeded 10 0 mm at all gauges 3 2 methods 1 statistical methods two pairs of rain gauges were employed r9 2831 m and r10 2892 m and r4 2316 m and r5 2334 m to analyze the correlation and differences of rainfall data recorded at two gauges at similar elevation the pearson correlation coefficient kendall and stuart 1963 a common statistical method was used to reflect the level of similarity between the 52 rainfall events the kolmogorov smirnov k s normality test gauthier and hawley 2007 a special goodness of fit hypothesis test was used to determine whether two datasets differed significantly the k s test has the advantage of making no assumption about the distribution of the data i e it is nonparametric and distribution free 2 rainfall interpolation to investigate the uncertainty of gauge selection we used three interpolation methods that included deterministic and probabilistic methods inverse distance weighting idw empirical bayesian kriging ebk and spline overall the interpolated value of rainfall at a location is given by the weighted summation of known rainfall estimates i e rain gauge data such geostatistical theories and methods are used widely used for rainfall interpolation lebel et al 1987 cressie 1991 goovaerts 1997 2000 webster and oliver 2007 bargaoui and chebbi 2009 krivoruchko 2012 krivoruchko and gribov 2019 3 rain gauge network configurations we numerically generated rain gauge networks to investigate the effect of gauge densities and locations on interpolation results rain gauge networks were generated using tools in arcgis esri 2011 the geometric center of the watershed was set as the center of a square grid having side lengths of l rain gauges were set at each grid intersection with no consideration of topographic constraints on installation essentially the real rainfall values from real gauges corresponding to the locations of the simulated gauge locations were used to mimic sampling of the rainfall field from a gauge network of the same density the distance between two neighboring gauges were defined as l in this case the number of rain gauges i e intersections corresponded to sampling densities of l set to 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 3 5 and 4 km respectively the gauge density as a key factor in analyzing rainfall estimation uncertainty was characterized by the distance between simulated gauges typically the selection of mimic gauge locations relied on field experience especially in low density cases however we found that rainfall interpolation results were similar for several configurations 4 water flood and debris flow forecasting a combination of the scs cn loss method for runoff yield and the kinematic wave method for slope and channel routing calculation was applied to evaluate the uncertainty of flood and debris flow forecasting scs 1985 mishra and singh 2003 lumbroso and gaume 2012 capra et al 2018 guo et al 2020 the key parameters in the methods are the cn value and the slope and channel roughness coefficients n 1 and n 2 respectively the parameters can be identified via lookup tables scs 1985 in this work the cn value for the watershed was set to 75 and coefficients n 1 and n 2 were set to 0 3 and 0 08 respectively these values were held constant for each rainfall event and rainfall input scenario the intensity duration i d relationship for rainfall threshold is used for debris flow forecasting here the duration d is defined as the period from the beginning of the rainfall event to onset of debris flow and rainfall intensity i is considered as the mean intensity during period d e g caine 1980 guzzetti et al 2007 2008 badoux et al 2012 berti et al 2012 4 elevation influence on rainfall within the study area elevation as mentioned above is generally considered the most important topographic variable hevesi et al 1992a 1992b goovaerts 2000 tobin et al 2011 in the study area although most of the gauges are located in headwater regions the local landform is open flat ground therefore as the effects of the other factors are difficult to quantify the effect of elevation was primarily investigated 4 1 rainfall variation with elevation the mean rainfall amount for each event was determined by averaging the values from all gauges the values of each specific gauge were also averaged for all events these data showed that r1 had the lowest mean rainfall 18 4 mm while r7 had the highest mean rainfall 31 9 mm examination of these results also showed that rainfall varied markedly with elevation in almost all cases and for both mean and maximum values rainfall increased with elevation fig 2 the elevation of each gauge was normalized by dividing its elevation by that of r1 1351 m to avoid the exponent parameter becoming too small then the relationship between mean event rainfall values and normalized elevation appears as 1 r m 8 9 e 0 44 h r 2 0 7902 where rm is the mean event rainfall amount mm and h is the normalized elevation it was also found that the value of each rainfall was related to elevation and that 39 of the 52 events 75 present exponential relationships with r 2 0 5 fig 3 based on 10 events this suggests that eq 2 could be used to approximate the spatial variation of rainfall in most cases 2 r a e bh where r is the rainfall amount mm and h is the normalized elevation and coefficient a range 4 50 35 83 and exponent b range 0 255 0 857 define the rainfall variance 4 2 differences between gauges at similar elevations we assessed the correlation between the rainfall measured at similar elevations using data from two pairs of gauges r4 2316 m and r5 2334 m and r9 2831 m and r10 2892 m the horizontal distance between the gauge pairs was 4 1 r4 r5 and 1 8 km r9 r10 the expectation e and standard deviation σ of the rainfalls are listed in table 2 the pearson correlation coefficient p was used to evaluate the similarity of the rainfall for each pair at a significance level of 0 01 p was 0 857 and 0 789 respectively for r4 r5 and r9 r10 indicating high similarity event rainfall for each pair is presented on 1 1 scatterplots in fig 4 a and 4b the average deviation was 18 8 and 7 5 respectively indicating a certain degree of variance the results of the k s normality test which was used to analyze the difference between the two data series indicated no significant difference the high correlation and non significant difference between the mean rainfall amounts for the two gauge sets where each component shared the same elevation with its pair indicate that evident effect of the elevation to the rainfall variation 4 3 rainfall estimation based on elevation the rainfall value at a specific location can be calculated by weighted summation of rainfall records however such interpolation relies on a dense network of rain gauges which is typically unavailable in mountainous regions if strong correlation exists between rainfall and topographic variables then the variables could be used for rainfall estimation lloyd 2005 tobin et al 2011 recorded data indicat that the coefficient a is linearly related to the minimum rainfall i e r 1 as represented by record at r1 and exponent b reflects the increase in rainfall with elevation fig 5 3 a mr 1 n 4 b clna d where m n c and d are constant coefficients in this study the values of the coefficients were set as c 1 53 d 0 32 m 0 69 and n 1 04 combining eqs 2 3 and 4 the relationship between rainfall amount and gauge elevation can be expressed as 5 r e ch m r 1 n ch 1 r 1 d h 0 69 r 1 1 04 r 1 0 32 h e 1 53 h where r is the rainfall at a specified location in the watershed mm r 1 is the rainfall collected at rain gauge r1 mm and h is the elevation relative to r1 using eq 5 the rainfall value at each point within the watershed was calculated based on the r1 value for each rainfall event the errors associated with this method are shown in fig 6 in fig 6 the error of the ebk method is used as the x axis and it can be seen that the error of both the idw and the spline methods is close to that of the ebk method the average errors of the idw ebk and spline methods are 2 0 1 1 and 1 5 at r4 respectively and 8 5 7 5 and 8 6 at r6 respectively in most cases 22 of 26 events at r4 and 37 of 45 events at r6 the value calculated using eq 5 was an overestimation compared with the recorded rainfall amount the errors of 7 9 and 17 8 at r4 and r6 respectively are much larger than those of traditional interpolation methods this is expected and acceptable because this estimation depends on a single gauge i e the lowest gauge which is generally located at the watershed outlet rather than on a dense rain gauge network approximately the higher the rainfall value at r1 the lower the absolute error values at both r4 and r6 fig 7 if an error of 40 were acceptable for rainfall estimations at both r4 and r6 then the rainfall recorded at r1 should be 15 0 and 17 5 mm respectively given that r6 has a longer record than r4 a 17 5 mm rainfall threshold is adopted as the condition on r1 for eq 5 it ensures that the higher the rainfall amount the stronger the relationship between rainfall and elevation and thus the better the estimations 5 uncertainties of rainfall interpolation and effects of gauge distance density and location of ground based rain gauges are crucial factors that require careful consideration as they significantly affect the accuracy of rainfall induced hazard parameter calculations duncan et al 1993 the distance between gauges which reflects the representative range of each gauge requires careful evaluation bradley et al 2002 villarini et al 2008 2014 5 1 rain gauge network configurations we numerically generated rain gauge networks to investigate the effect of gauge density and location on the interpolation results the distance l between two gauges was set separately as 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 and 4 0 km which represent different gauge densities and numbers as shown in fig 8 rainfall values were assigned to each gauge based on the rainfall distribution within the watershed therefore for each rainfall event we used eq 5 to calculate the rainfall amount at each simulated gauge and at the watershed center point cc subsequently rainfall was interpolated over the entire watershed using the idw ebk and spline methods interpolation results for each real gauge were compared with background values calculated using eq 5 which provided reference values for the analysis 5 2 uncertainty of rainfall interpolation progressively denser rain gauge networks are belived to produce increasingly accurate rainfall interpolation results in this case the interpolation errors were presented with a gauge separation distance of 0 5 km i e the densest configuration the results for four gauges r1 cc r4 and r10 at elevation of 1351 1838 2316 and 2892 m respectively are shown in fig 9 based on which the following observations can be made 1 the absolute error of any of the three methods was no higher than 6 suggesting high accuracy as if the data used for the interpolation were abundant 2 the error property positive or negative for each interpolation method was the same for each gauge in general the mean error was negative indicating that rainfall was underestimated by all interpolation methods and in all rain gauge density scenarios except at r1 this also indicates that on average rainfall was overestimated by eq 5 3 lower errors of interpolation occurred when rainfall amounts were high this pattern was consistent for all interpolation methods although the error rate varied among the different methods the relationship between estimation error and gauge elevation was investigated under each gauge configuration as the idw ebk and spline methods showed similar tendency with elevation only the results obtained using idw are discussed here all errors were arithmetically averaged by the absolute values of the real errors and they are shown by the black line in fig 10 error values were small at low elevations and the mean error increased with elevation over the elevation range 1300 1900 m r1 r2 and cc errors were 1 4 10 2 with average of 4 9 6 3 over the elevation range 2000 2400 m r3 r5 errors were 2 7 10 8 with average of 6 1 9 2 errors increased to 3 7 19 4 average 10 4 15 6 over elevation range 2600 2900 m at the headwater region of the watershed r6 r10 these results imply that it is more difficult to estimate rainfall in high elevation regions 5 3 effective distance for rain gauges rain gauge density might cause significant bias in estimation of rainfall thresholds for debris flows nikolopoulos et al 2014 although the interpolation errors were different for all three studied methods their tendencies were similar as such the results obtained using the idw method are used to illustrate the effect of gauge density on interpolation error inclusion of more rain gauges within a network might be expected to produce more accurate interpolation results nikolopoulos et al 2014 however this was not the case in this study instead the interpolation errors reflected the variation of gauge configuration it can be seen that the error lines associated with each rainfall event are parallel fig 11 taking r1 and r2 as examples the maximum and minimum errors for each rainfall event for all 10 rain gauges are shown in fig 12 in most cases the errors changed smoothly over gauge distances of 0 5 2 5 km but changed abruptly for distances of 2 5 3 0 km this is apparent in the error data for the average watershed rainfall shown in fig 13 although the errors decreased as the grid length increased over the 0 5 2 5 km range the error variations are very small 1 to 5 in contrast the errors increased abruptly at the 3 0 km grid length leading to less reliable results these findings suggest that rain gauge placement should be considered carefully when the horizontal distance between gauges in a network is 3 0 km 6 effect of uncertainties of gauge selection on hydrological hazard forecasting the quality of rainfall data significantly affects the accuracy of hydrological modeling and hazard forecasting but dense gauge network is impractical in most mountainous regions at best in most circumstances the arrangement consists of one gauge at the outlet or inside the watershed if there is an established local village this deficiency presents a serious challenge because data from one gauge might not be sufficiently representative of the watershed especially in regions with high spatial variation in the distribution of rainfall thus the following section discusses the uncertainties caused by the selection of different gauges from the perspectives of water flood discharge simulation and the determination of rainfall thresholds for debris flow forecasting 6 1 influence of gauge selection on hydrological simulation in the study region water floods are doubly problematic because in addition to causing their own catastrophic damage they are also responsible for triggering debris flows we selected eight rainfall events to investigate the influence of rain gauge selection on peak discharge and total water quantity measurements by setting up different inputs for hydrological simulations these eight events represented a range of varying rainfall amounts and durations four rainfall input scenarios were designed that consisted of interpolation based on the following i all 10 rain gauges ii one of the rain gauges in the high elevation headwater region r9 iii the lowest station in the jiangjia gully main channel r1 and iv rainfall calculated using eq 5 among them scenario i is regarded as the most accurate input thus results from the other scenarios were compared with this scenario a combination of the scs cn loss method for runoff yield and the kinematic wave method for slope and channel routing calculation was applied the cn value for the watershed was set to 75 and this was held constant for each rainfall event and rainfall input scenario the simulation results are shown in figs 14 and 15 results for scenario iii using r1 at the lowest elevation to represent rainfall conditions throughout the entire watershed show that the water flood was seriously underestimated in all cases with non referential results in contrast the results for scenario ii using r9 in the headwater region show that the water flood was overestimated in most cases 7 in 8 cases this not only demonstrates that rainfall increases with elevation but also highlights the uncertainties caused by inappropriate rain gauge selection however when using the estimation of eq 5 as the rainfall input scenario iv the errors were much smaller the peak discharge simulation errors were in the range of 14 0 23 5 while the errors of the total water flood amount are in the range of 11 8 16 4 these results exhibit acceptable accuracy especially considering the difficulty of obtaining rainfall data in mountainous areas 6 2 effect of uncertainties of gauge selection on rainfall thresholds for debris flows the i d relationship is a common approach for identification of rainfall thresholds in debris flow forecasting e g caine 1980 guzzetti et al 2007 2008 the determination of rainfall thresholds is often performed based on long term historical rainfall data to estimate the magnitude of the errors in threshold identification caused by the rainfall estimation we used the 52 rainfall events 19 of which triggered debris flows the rainfall was selected from the following 1 the most representative gauge which was determined based on detailed analysis of the rainfall and the monitoring of the debris flow processes as debris flow initiation in the source regions was not monitored when a debris flow appeared at the monitoring section the rainfall process was investigated based on gauges located in the source regions in particular consideration was given to both the time lag between debris flow appearance and peak rainfall and the differences in the rainfall process between the gauges guo et al 2020 2 r1 located at the mouth of the watershed 3 r7 at elevation in the source areas about 5 km from the catchment center fig 1 and 4 the rainfall estimated using eq 5 this examination considers both the influence of elevation and gauge distance in essence the rainfall thresholds were compared with the actual i d threshold to evaluate the effectiveness of using rainfall data from different sources the threshold was identified as i 11 23 d 0 710 by selecting the most representative gauge the false alarm and false negative rates defined as percentages of the total numbers were 34 and 0 respectively and the results obtained for the other three scenarios were compared with these results it has been suggested that debris flows in this watershed are most likely triggered during rainfall events with duration of 16 8 h fig 16 therefore considering the traditional duration used in forecasting by the china meteorological department rainfall durations of 1 12 and 24 h were assumed and the 1 h 12 h and 24 h rainfall amounts required to trigger debris flows were estimated the results are shown in fig 17 when using r1 as the rainfall information source the threshold was identified as i 8 28 d 0 751 with false alarm and false negative rates of 47 and 0 respectively and the required 1 12 and 24 h rainfall amounts were evidently underestimated when using the rainfall from r7 the threshold was i 15 81 d 0 748 the false alarm and false negative rates were 24 and 32 respectively and the error of the 1 h rainfall amount was overestimated by as much as 40 8 however for the rainfall calculated using eq 5 the rainfall threshold was identified as i 12 98 d 0 707 which is closer to the real threshold and the false alarm and false negative rates were 30 and 11 respectively in addition the error evaluation results were substantially lower than for the other two scenarios fig 17 the results indicate that the rain gauge should be selected carefully when identifying the rainfall conditions in the source region responsible for initiation of debris flows the rain gauge at the watershed outlet which is commonly used in mountainous regions generally underestimates the rainfall condition in addition representativeness should also be considered when using an alternative gauge within the watershed but with a distance of 3 km from the debris flow source region in contrast the better performance achieved using eq 5 indicates that the spatial variation of rainfall cannot be neglected and that the relationship between rainfall and elevation could be used for estimating rainfall within a watershed 7 discussion as rainfall is a crucial factor for hydrological hazards many advanced approaches e g radar and satellite remote sensing have been developed in recent years for rainfall estimation radar quantitative precipitation estimation is an active and vibrant field with numerous accomplishments resulting in practical applications e g germann et al 2006 yoshikawa et al 2012 chen et al 2017 shimamura et al 2016 chandrasekar et al 2018 it is expected to improve our knowledge of rainfall processes by providing greater dynamic range more detailed information on microphysics and better accuracies in rainfall estimation this information will not only give us insight into microphysical processes but also provide detailed properties of the rainfall chandrasekar et al 2008 with the local bias correction of the ground gauge data it has been used for hydrological hazards forecasting recently peleg et al 2013 mei et al 2014 espinosa et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 willie et al 2017 shi et al 2018 yet even with the success more complete coverage is needed both spatially and temporally especially for a small mountainous catchment and an event rainfall scale in regions such as the study area gauge measurements remain the most effective means for data collection some recent studies have proposed that ground based measurements of rainfall are to some extent not sufficiently reliable for interpolation purposes however this largely reflects the insufficient quantity of gauges e g frei and schar 1998 goovaerts 2000 lloyd 2005 ly et al 2011 tobin et al 2011 marra et al 2014 2016 thakur et al 2020 in the previous research it has been found that rainfall increases with elevation which commonly called the orographic enhancement typically approximate a linear form in most cases is evident hibbert 1977 houghton 1979 obsorn 1984 daly et al 1994 sanchez moreno et al 2013 the focuses are the average amount or the accumulated amount of long term period e g annual and month rainfall in this study although a general exponential increasing tendency of rainfall with elevation was proposed the linear tendency of the average rainfall of 52 events is also evident fig 2 which indicated consistent with the findings of other related research e g vuglinski 1972 hibbert 1977 smith 1979 kumari et al 2017 hevesi et al 1992a 1992b goovaerts 2000 the analysis used measurements from 10 rain gauges in a small watershed which represented a dense gauge network and a reliable data source here we assume that the measured natural rainfall is the real rainfall without data correction although it is well known that rainfall amounts measured by means of ground gauges contain some negative biases the evaluation of such uncertainty is not the purpose of this work the findings of this study could provide a reference for rainfall estimation in neighboring regions with similar climatic and topographic conditions and help improve the understanding of debris flow formation conditions and forecasting however the feasibility of using a similar network in other debris flow regions is not guaranteed owing to potential regional differences 8 conclusions spatial variation of rainfall is a phenomenon that introduces large uncertainty in the forecasting of hydrological hazards e g water floods and debris flows this is particularly so for small mountainous watersheds with complex orographic conditions in this study 52 rainstorm events in a typical small mountainous watershed were used to analyze the relationships between event rainfall and both the elevation and the density of rain gauges the high correlation and consistent similarity in rainfall amounts between gauges at similar elevation suggested that elevation is the primary factor affecting rainfall variation in this region results showed that the mean event rainfall and elevation exhibited an exponential relationship moreover rainfall amount varied with elevation in each event thus an empirical rainfall elevation relation was proposed for rainfall estimation although the accuracy of this method was poorer than that of commonly used interpolation methods it is advantageous in that it requires only the rainfall data recorded at the watershed outlet in addition the rainfall interpolation uncertainties and effects of gauge distance were evaluated all interpolation results showed a similar error tendency and demonstrated that estimating rainfall distributions at high elevations is more difficult error analysis indicated that rain gauges should be placed carefully when the horizontal distance between gauges is 3 0 km selecting an inappropriate rain gauge for obtaining data caused significant uncertainty in simulations of water flood discharge and in identification of rainfall thresholds for debris flows using a gauge located at the mouth of the watershed or in the headwater region produced poorer performance in terms of flow simulation and empirical threshold identification for debris flows when compared with the estimation method proposed in this work this suggests that the representativeness of the rain gauge should be considered carefully and that clear understanding of the spatial variation of rainfall could help in estimation of the rainfall conditions required

4807,rainfall in mountainous watershed presents high spatial variability due to elevation effects and this introduces uncertainty in forecasting hydrological hazards such as water floods and debris flows this study investigated the spatial variation of rainfall in a small watershed with a network of 10 rain gauges a rainfall elevation relationship was established based on data from 52 rainstorm events which provides a method for rainfall estimation within the watershed result indicated that lower errors of interpolation occur when the rainfall amount is high and that it is more difficult to estimate rainfall in high elevation regions rain gauges become less representative when the distance between gauges is 3 0 km the spatial variation of rainfall suggests that the gauge at the lowest elevation or a single gauge within the source region shows non negligible errors with regard to calculating water flood discharge and identifying rainfall thresholds for debris flows this study contributes to the understanding of event rainfall distribution and its impact on hydrological hazard forecasting in a small mountainous watershed keywords rainfall spatial variability rainfall estimation rain gauge network debris flow 1 introduction rainfall is the most common inducing factor of hydrological hazards e g water floods and debris flows in mountainous watersheds with areas of 50 km2 and large elevation differences wieczorek 1996 jakob et al 2012 hungr et al 2014 cui et al 2018 forecasting of such events is achievable through physical based simulation e g hydrological modeling and or empirical methods e g statistical rainfall thresholds both relying on rainfall as input however the rainfall data is highly uncertain due to measurement errors systematic errors of interpolations and intrinsic errors of rainfall randomness these errors propagate through the model and directly impact the accuracy of forecasting therefore a good knowledge of the uncertainty of rainfall data is essential for a correct forecasting of hydrological hazards obtaining accurate rainfall data in mountainous region represents a major challenge krajewski et al 2000 2003 radar and satellite remote sensing can provide nearly complete qualitative distributions of rainfall at high temporal and spatial resolutions and both have become viable techniques for supplementing rainfall information e g fabry et al 1994 bradley et al 2002 kirschbaum et al 2012 rossi et al 2012 marra et al 2014 2016 however the coverage in many mountainous regions is poor thus in most cases ground based rain gauge networks remain the only viable option for measurement of local rainfall habib et al 2001 unfortunately the density of a rain gauge network is often too low to provide sufficient data therefore estimations are often produced based on data recorded at neighboring gauges e g aleotti 2004 godt et al 2006 brunetti et al 2010 berti et al 2012 in such cases huge discrepancies can arise the implications of which were clearly illustrated by the catastrophic debris flows in zhouqu china on august 8 2010 which caused 1765 fatalities in the event a gauge 16 km from the headwaters recorded 96 mm of rainfall whereas the gauge at the outlet recorded only 3 mm hu et al 2010 cui et al 2013 such results exemplify the scale of the variation and uncertainty associated with rainfall in mountainous watersheds the spatial distribution of rainfall is complicated and influenced by many orographic parameters e g elevation slope aspect shadowing and curvature and climatic factors e g wind e g goovaerts 2000 lloyd 2005 tobin et al 2011 but it is hard to identify the major factors responsible for the high spatial variability of rainfall in small watershed dore et al 1982 for a better understanding and characterization the local key influencing parameters should be considered for instance spreen 1947 found that elevation alone explains 30 of the seasonal variance of rainfall while the combination of altitude slope exposure and orientation explained 88 basist et al 1994 found slope gradient orientation elevation and exposure as the best mean annual precipitation predictors for 10 mountains strong winds may also redistribute the precipitation facilitating largest amounts in the valleys ye et al 2004 yang et al 2005 among the parameters elevation can be considered as the most important because its influence remains constant while that form others varies with events hevesi et al 1992a 1992b goovaerts 2000 tobin et al 2011 in most cases on a given slope rainfall typically increases with elevation which is commonly called the orographic effect e g hutchinson 1968 vuglinski 1972 hibbert 1977 smith 1979 kumari et al 2017 and generally local rainfall increases with elevation in linear form which has proved an acceptable approximation in many situations e g hibbert 1977 houghton 1979 obsorn 1984 buytaert et al 2006 however the characteristics of the relationship can vary appreciably from hillslope to hillslope this make it difficult to obtain a usable relationship unless rainfall stations are grouped into regions that control for such factors basist et al 1994 kumari et al 2017 although systematic uncertainties exist for measuring the rainfall amounts by gauges with regard to many factors they can be reduced significantly by long term and dense rainfall monitoring networks ye et al 2004 zhang et al 2004 xu et al 2013 ma et al 2015 kumari et al 2017 objectives of rain gauge network design include effective rainfall measurement and determination of the effects of rainfall uncertainty to other hydrological variables bras et al 1988 gauge distribution significantly influences rainfall estimation it has been suggested that only densely distributed gauges are adequate for forecasting of rainfall induced floods and debris flows haberlandt 2007 wagner et al 2012 interpolation based on geostatistical theory which relies on a robust anisotropic variogram to define the spatial rainfall structure is useful for rainfall estimation e g goovaerts 1997 2000 2013 price et al 2000 lloyd 2005 hancock and hutchinson 2006 tobin et al 2011 wagner et al 2012 ly et al 2011 krivoruchko 2012 krivoruchko and gribov 2019 unfortunately the validation approach depends on the number and distribution of gauges which are generally inadequate in data sparse watersheds hattermann et al 2005 therefore both the design of an effective monitoring network and choice of an interpolation method require insight into the variability and uncertainty of rainfall goovaerts 2000 buytaert et al 2006 several studies have proposed techniques to address the rainfall estimation uncertainty and its effects on hydrological hazard prediction jakob et al 2012 nikolopoulos et al 2014 2015 most related studies have been conducted on long term i e monthly daily rainfall over large regions rather than on short term rainfall events in small watersheds the distinction is important because rainfall is more heterogeneous and pronounced over short timescales and the degree of uncertainty is influenced primarily by the density of gauges nikolopoulos et al 2014 in general despite the complxity of mechanisms for spatial variation of rainfall orographic variables are undoubtedly the tangible agencies among which the elevation is the most conspicuous lloyd 2005 tobin et al 2011 therefore in this study we analyzed the relationship between rainfall and elevation in a small mountainous watershed with large elevation difference and proposed a rainfall estimation method in addition we assessed the estimation errors associated with elevation rainfall amount and gauge density using rainfall interpolation methods finally the uncertainty of using different rainfall input data for forecasting floods and debris flows was evaluated to determine the effect of the representativeness of rain gauges 2 study area water floods and debris flows occur frequently and are widely distributed throughout the basin of the xiaojiang river a tributary of the jinsha river in southwest china fig 1 this semiarid mountainous area has high tectonic activity abundant fragmented rocks and large elevation differences it is known for its poor ecological conditions and environmental disasters such as landslides debris flows soil erosion and land debrisization in addition to the geological and topographic conditions that are favorable for debris flow development the mountains stimulate the occurrence of hydrological hazards by providing abundant rainfall and runoff for soil movement in headwater regions forecasting of the hazards is difficult because of the spatial variation of rainfall the jiangjia gully is located within the xiaojiang river it has an area of 48 6 km2 and it extends from its drainage divide at an elevation of 3269 m to its outlet at 1042 m it has been frequently impacted by tectonic activities e g earthquakes and has deeply cut sloping terrain over a large elevation range this valley is known for frequent debris flow occurrences and long term rainfall observations cui et al 2005 guo et al 2013 2016 many studies have examined the mechanisms and triggering conditions of debris flows e g li et al 2003 2004 2008 cui et al 2005 2007 we selected it for this case study because of its dense rain gauge distribution fig 1 the valley can be divided into three climatic regimes 1 a subtropical dry and hot valley climate extending from the outlet up to 1600 m where the mean annual precipitation map is 600 700 mm mean annual temperature mat is 20 c and mean annual evaporation mae is 3700 mm 2 a subtropical semiarid climate between 1600 and 2200 m where map is 700 850 mm mat is 13 c and mae is 1700 mm 3 a humid climate above 2200 m where map is 850 1200 mm mat is 7 c and mae is 1350 mm the variations in precipitation temperature and evaporation affect both vegetation distribution and rock weathering and thus contribute in varying degrees to the occurrence of debris flows cui et al 2015 guo et al 2020 to date debris flows are mainly formed in the menqian gully which is the northern branch fig 1 ten rain gauges r1 r10 have been installed in the watershed fig 1 based on monitoring data 2006 2017 the rainy season may september accounts for approximately 85 of map for example at gauges r1 and r9 rainfall during the rainy season accounts for 83 0 and 89 7 of the total annual rainfall respectively the maximum daily rainfall amounts recorded at r1 and r9 are 53 5 and 63 1 mm respectively accounting for 9 4 and 10 0 of the total annual rainfall torrential rainstorms in summer are the main factor contributing to the frequent occurrence of debris flows 3 data source and methods 3 1 data source the length of the data records of the 10 rain gauges extends for more than a decade the lowest placed gauge r1 is at the elevation of 1351 m in the downstream section fig 1 whereas the others are all in the headwater regions at various elevations as listed in table 1 each rain gauge measures real time rainfall using a 0 1 mm tipping bucket and the data are transmitted via the general packet radio service rainfall events are separated with 6 h dry hiatuses restrepo posada and eagleson 1982 the rainfall amount of the event rainfall was therefore cumulated quantitatively from the beginning to the end of the rainfall to identify the spatial characteristics of event rainfall within the watershed we assessed the rainfall data recorded during 2006 2017 and selected 52 events in which the rainfall amount exceeded 10 0 mm at all gauges 3 2 methods 1 statistical methods two pairs of rain gauges were employed r9 2831 m and r10 2892 m and r4 2316 m and r5 2334 m to analyze the correlation and differences of rainfall data recorded at two gauges at similar elevation the pearson correlation coefficient kendall and stuart 1963 a common statistical method was used to reflect the level of similarity between the 52 rainfall events the kolmogorov smirnov k s normality test gauthier and hawley 2007 a special goodness of fit hypothesis test was used to determine whether two datasets differed significantly the k s test has the advantage of making no assumption about the distribution of the data i e it is nonparametric and distribution free 2 rainfall interpolation to investigate the uncertainty of gauge selection we used three interpolation methods that included deterministic and probabilistic methods inverse distance weighting idw empirical bayesian kriging ebk and spline overall the interpolated value of rainfall at a location is given by the weighted summation of known rainfall estimates i e rain gauge data such geostatistical theories and methods are used widely used for rainfall interpolation lebel et al 1987 cressie 1991 goovaerts 1997 2000 webster and oliver 2007 bargaoui and chebbi 2009 krivoruchko 2012 krivoruchko and gribov 2019 3 rain gauge network configurations we numerically generated rain gauge networks to investigate the effect of gauge densities and locations on interpolation results rain gauge networks were generated using tools in arcgis esri 2011 the geometric center of the watershed was set as the center of a square grid having side lengths of l rain gauges were set at each grid intersection with no consideration of topographic constraints on installation essentially the real rainfall values from real gauges corresponding to the locations of the simulated gauge locations were used to mimic sampling of the rainfall field from a gauge network of the same density the distance between two neighboring gauges were defined as l in this case the number of rain gauges i e intersections corresponded to sampling densities of l set to 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 3 5 and 4 km respectively the gauge density as a key factor in analyzing rainfall estimation uncertainty was characterized by the distance between simulated gauges typically the selection of mimic gauge locations relied on field experience especially in low density cases however we found that rainfall interpolation results were similar for several configurations 4 water flood and debris flow forecasting a combination of the scs cn loss method for runoff yield and the kinematic wave method for slope and channel routing calculation was applied to evaluate the uncertainty of flood and debris flow forecasting scs 1985 mishra and singh 2003 lumbroso and gaume 2012 capra et al 2018 guo et al 2020 the key parameters in the methods are the cn value and the slope and channel roughness coefficients n 1 and n 2 respectively the parameters can be identified via lookup tables scs 1985 in this work the cn value for the watershed was set to 75 and coefficients n 1 and n 2 were set to 0 3 and 0 08 respectively these values were held constant for each rainfall event and rainfall input scenario the intensity duration i d relationship for rainfall threshold is used for debris flow forecasting here the duration d is defined as the period from the beginning of the rainfall event to onset of debris flow and rainfall intensity i is considered as the mean intensity during period d e g caine 1980 guzzetti et al 2007 2008 badoux et al 2012 berti et al 2012 4 elevation influence on rainfall within the study area elevation as mentioned above is generally considered the most important topographic variable hevesi et al 1992a 1992b goovaerts 2000 tobin et al 2011 in the study area although most of the gauges are located in headwater regions the local landform is open flat ground therefore as the effects of the other factors are difficult to quantify the effect of elevation was primarily investigated 4 1 rainfall variation with elevation the mean rainfall amount for each event was determined by averaging the values from all gauges the values of each specific gauge were also averaged for all events these data showed that r1 had the lowest mean rainfall 18 4 mm while r7 had the highest mean rainfall 31 9 mm examination of these results also showed that rainfall varied markedly with elevation in almost all cases and for both mean and maximum values rainfall increased with elevation fig 2 the elevation of each gauge was normalized by dividing its elevation by that of r1 1351 m to avoid the exponent parameter becoming too small then the relationship between mean event rainfall values and normalized elevation appears as 1 r m 8 9 e 0 44 h r 2 0 7902 where rm is the mean event rainfall amount mm and h is the normalized elevation it was also found that the value of each rainfall was related to elevation and that 39 of the 52 events 75 present exponential relationships with r 2 0 5 fig 3 based on 10 events this suggests that eq 2 could be used to approximate the spatial variation of rainfall in most cases 2 r a e bh where r is the rainfall amount mm and h is the normalized elevation and coefficient a range 4 50 35 83 and exponent b range 0 255 0 857 define the rainfall variance 4 2 differences between gauges at similar elevations we assessed the correlation between the rainfall measured at similar elevations using data from two pairs of gauges r4 2316 m and r5 2334 m and r9 2831 m and r10 2892 m the horizontal distance between the gauge pairs was 4 1 r4 r5 and 1 8 km r9 r10 the expectation e and standard deviation σ of the rainfalls are listed in table 2 the pearson correlation coefficient p was used to evaluate the similarity of the rainfall for each pair at a significance level of 0 01 p was 0 857 and 0 789 respectively for r4 r5 and r9 r10 indicating high similarity event rainfall for each pair is presented on 1 1 scatterplots in fig 4 a and 4b the average deviation was 18 8 and 7 5 respectively indicating a certain degree of variance the results of the k s normality test which was used to analyze the difference between the two data series indicated no significant difference the high correlation and non significant difference between the mean rainfall amounts for the two gauge sets where each component shared the same elevation with its pair indicate that evident effect of the elevation to the rainfall variation 4 3 rainfall estimation based on elevation the rainfall value at a specific location can be calculated by weighted summation of rainfall records however such interpolation relies on a dense network of rain gauges which is typically unavailable in mountainous regions if strong correlation exists between rainfall and topographic variables then the variables could be used for rainfall estimation lloyd 2005 tobin et al 2011 recorded data indicat that the coefficient a is linearly related to the minimum rainfall i e r 1 as represented by record at r1 and exponent b reflects the increase in rainfall with elevation fig 5 3 a mr 1 n 4 b clna d where m n c and d are constant coefficients in this study the values of the coefficients were set as c 1 53 d 0 32 m 0 69 and n 1 04 combining eqs 2 3 and 4 the relationship between rainfall amount and gauge elevation can be expressed as 5 r e ch m r 1 n ch 1 r 1 d h 0 69 r 1 1 04 r 1 0 32 h e 1 53 h where r is the rainfall at a specified location in the watershed mm r 1 is the rainfall collected at rain gauge r1 mm and h is the elevation relative to r1 using eq 5 the rainfall value at each point within the watershed was calculated based on the r1 value for each rainfall event the errors associated with this method are shown in fig 6 in fig 6 the error of the ebk method is used as the x axis and it can be seen that the error of both the idw and the spline methods is close to that of the ebk method the average errors of the idw ebk and spline methods are 2 0 1 1 and 1 5 at r4 respectively and 8 5 7 5 and 8 6 at r6 respectively in most cases 22 of 26 events at r4 and 37 of 45 events at r6 the value calculated using eq 5 was an overestimation compared with the recorded rainfall amount the errors of 7 9 and 17 8 at r4 and r6 respectively are much larger than those of traditional interpolation methods this is expected and acceptable because this estimation depends on a single gauge i e the lowest gauge which is generally located at the watershed outlet rather than on a dense rain gauge network approximately the higher the rainfall value at r1 the lower the absolute error values at both r4 and r6 fig 7 if an error of 40 were acceptable for rainfall estimations at both r4 and r6 then the rainfall recorded at r1 should be 15 0 and 17 5 mm respectively given that r6 has a longer record than r4 a 17 5 mm rainfall threshold is adopted as the condition on r1 for eq 5 it ensures that the higher the rainfall amount the stronger the relationship between rainfall and elevation and thus the better the estimations 5 uncertainties of rainfall interpolation and effects of gauge distance density and location of ground based rain gauges are crucial factors that require careful consideration as they significantly affect the accuracy of rainfall induced hazard parameter calculations duncan et al 1993 the distance between gauges which reflects the representative range of each gauge requires careful evaluation bradley et al 2002 villarini et al 2008 2014 5 1 rain gauge network configurations we numerically generated rain gauge networks to investigate the effect of gauge density and location on the interpolation results the distance l between two gauges was set separately as 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 and 4 0 km which represent different gauge densities and numbers as shown in fig 8 rainfall values were assigned to each gauge based on the rainfall distribution within the watershed therefore for each rainfall event we used eq 5 to calculate the rainfall amount at each simulated gauge and at the watershed center point cc subsequently rainfall was interpolated over the entire watershed using the idw ebk and spline methods interpolation results for each real gauge were compared with background values calculated using eq 5 which provided reference values for the analysis 5 2 uncertainty of rainfall interpolation progressively denser rain gauge networks are belived to produce increasingly accurate rainfall interpolation results in this case the interpolation errors were presented with a gauge separation distance of 0 5 km i e the densest configuration the results for four gauges r1 cc r4 and r10 at elevation of 1351 1838 2316 and 2892 m respectively are shown in fig 9 based on which the following observations can be made 1 the absolute error of any of the three methods was no higher than 6 suggesting high accuracy as if the data used for the interpolation were abundant 2 the error property positive or negative for each interpolation method was the same for each gauge in general the mean error was negative indicating that rainfall was underestimated by all interpolation methods and in all rain gauge density scenarios except at r1 this also indicates that on average rainfall was overestimated by eq 5 3 lower errors of interpolation occurred when rainfall amounts were high this pattern was consistent for all interpolation methods although the error rate varied among the different methods the relationship between estimation error and gauge elevation was investigated under each gauge configuration as the idw ebk and spline methods showed similar tendency with elevation only the results obtained using idw are discussed here all errors were arithmetically averaged by the absolute values of the real errors and they are shown by the black line in fig 10 error values were small at low elevations and the mean error increased with elevation over the elevation range 1300 1900 m r1 r2 and cc errors were 1 4 10 2 with average of 4 9 6 3 over the elevation range 2000 2400 m r3 r5 errors were 2 7 10 8 with average of 6 1 9 2 errors increased to 3 7 19 4 average 10 4 15 6 over elevation range 2600 2900 m at the headwater region of the watershed r6 r10 these results imply that it is more difficult to estimate rainfall in high elevation regions 5 3 effective distance for rain gauges rain gauge density might cause significant bias in estimation of rainfall thresholds for debris flows nikolopoulos et al 2014 although the interpolation errors were different for all three studied methods their tendencies were similar as such the results obtained using the idw method are used to illustrate the effect of gauge density on interpolation error inclusion of more rain gauges within a network might be expected to produce more accurate interpolation results nikolopoulos et al 2014 however this was not the case in this study instead the interpolation errors reflected the variation of gauge configuration it can be seen that the error lines associated with each rainfall event are parallel fig 11 taking r1 and r2 as examples the maximum and minimum errors for each rainfall event for all 10 rain gauges are shown in fig 12 in most cases the errors changed smoothly over gauge distances of 0 5 2 5 km but changed abruptly for distances of 2 5 3 0 km this is apparent in the error data for the average watershed rainfall shown in fig 13 although the errors decreased as the grid length increased over the 0 5 2 5 km range the error variations are very small 1 to 5 in contrast the errors increased abruptly at the 3 0 km grid length leading to less reliable results these findings suggest that rain gauge placement should be considered carefully when the horizontal distance between gauges in a network is 3 0 km 6 effect of uncertainties of gauge selection on hydrological hazard forecasting the quality of rainfall data significantly affects the accuracy of hydrological modeling and hazard forecasting but dense gauge network is impractical in most mountainous regions at best in most circumstances the arrangement consists of one gauge at the outlet or inside the watershed if there is an established local village this deficiency presents a serious challenge because data from one gauge might not be sufficiently representative of the watershed especially in regions with high spatial variation in the distribution of rainfall thus the following section discusses the uncertainties caused by the selection of different gauges from the perspectives of water flood discharge simulation and the determination of rainfall thresholds for debris flow forecasting 6 1 influence of gauge selection on hydrological simulation in the study region water floods are doubly problematic because in addition to causing their own catastrophic damage they are also responsible for triggering debris flows we selected eight rainfall events to investigate the influence of rain gauge selection on peak discharge and total water quantity measurements by setting up different inputs for hydrological simulations these eight events represented a range of varying rainfall amounts and durations four rainfall input scenarios were designed that consisted of interpolation based on the following i all 10 rain gauges ii one of the rain gauges in the high elevation headwater region r9 iii the lowest station in the jiangjia gully main channel r1 and iv rainfall calculated using eq 5 among them scenario i is regarded as the most accurate input thus results from the other scenarios were compared with this scenario a combination of the scs cn loss method for runoff yield and the kinematic wave method for slope and channel routing calculation was applied the cn value for the watershed was set to 75 and this was held constant for each rainfall event and rainfall input scenario the simulation results are shown in figs 14 and 15 results for scenario iii using r1 at the lowest elevation to represent rainfall conditions throughout the entire watershed show that the water flood was seriously underestimated in all cases with non referential results in contrast the results for scenario ii using r9 in the headwater region show that the water flood was overestimated in most cases 7 in 8 cases this not only demonstrates that rainfall increases with elevation but also highlights the uncertainties caused by inappropriate rain gauge selection however when using the estimation of eq 5 as the rainfall input scenario iv the errors were much smaller the peak discharge simulation errors were in the range of 14 0 23 5 while the errors of the total water flood amount are in the range of 11 8 16 4 these results exhibit acceptable accuracy especially considering the difficulty of obtaining rainfall data in mountainous areas 6 2 effect of uncertainties of gauge selection on rainfall thresholds for debris flows the i d relationship is a common approach for identification of rainfall thresholds in debris flow forecasting e g caine 1980 guzzetti et al 2007 2008 the determination of rainfall thresholds is often performed based on long term historical rainfall data to estimate the magnitude of the errors in threshold identification caused by the rainfall estimation we used the 52 rainfall events 19 of which triggered debris flows the rainfall was selected from the following 1 the most representative gauge which was determined based on detailed analysis of the rainfall and the monitoring of the debris flow processes as debris flow initiation in the source regions was not monitored when a debris flow appeared at the monitoring section the rainfall process was investigated based on gauges located in the source regions in particular consideration was given to both the time lag between debris flow appearance and peak rainfall and the differences in the rainfall process between the gauges guo et al 2020 2 r1 located at the mouth of the watershed 3 r7 at elevation in the source areas about 5 km from the catchment center fig 1 and 4 the rainfall estimated using eq 5 this examination considers both the influence of elevation and gauge distance in essence the rainfall thresholds were compared with the actual i d threshold to evaluate the effectiveness of using rainfall data from different sources the threshold was identified as i 11 23 d 0 710 by selecting the most representative gauge the false alarm and false negative rates defined as percentages of the total numbers were 34 and 0 respectively and the results obtained for the other three scenarios were compared with these results it has been suggested that debris flows in this watershed are most likely triggered during rainfall events with duration of 16 8 h fig 16 therefore considering the traditional duration used in forecasting by the china meteorological department rainfall durations of 1 12 and 24 h were assumed and the 1 h 12 h and 24 h rainfall amounts required to trigger debris flows were estimated the results are shown in fig 17 when using r1 as the rainfall information source the threshold was identified as i 8 28 d 0 751 with false alarm and false negative rates of 47 and 0 respectively and the required 1 12 and 24 h rainfall amounts were evidently underestimated when using the rainfall from r7 the threshold was i 15 81 d 0 748 the false alarm and false negative rates were 24 and 32 respectively and the error of the 1 h rainfall amount was overestimated by as much as 40 8 however for the rainfall calculated using eq 5 the rainfall threshold was identified as i 12 98 d 0 707 which is closer to the real threshold and the false alarm and false negative rates were 30 and 11 respectively in addition the error evaluation results were substantially lower than for the other two scenarios fig 17 the results indicate that the rain gauge should be selected carefully when identifying the rainfall conditions in the source region responsible for initiation of debris flows the rain gauge at the watershed outlet which is commonly used in mountainous regions generally underestimates the rainfall condition in addition representativeness should also be considered when using an alternative gauge within the watershed but with a distance of 3 km from the debris flow source region in contrast the better performance achieved using eq 5 indicates that the spatial variation of rainfall cannot be neglected and that the relationship between rainfall and elevation could be used for estimating rainfall within a watershed 7 discussion as rainfall is a crucial factor for hydrological hazards many advanced approaches e g radar and satellite remote sensing have been developed in recent years for rainfall estimation radar quantitative precipitation estimation is an active and vibrant field with numerous accomplishments resulting in practical applications e g germann et al 2006 yoshikawa et al 2012 chen et al 2017 shimamura et al 2016 chandrasekar et al 2018 it is expected to improve our knowledge of rainfall processes by providing greater dynamic range more detailed information on microphysics and better accuracies in rainfall estimation this information will not only give us insight into microphysical processes but also provide detailed properties of the rainfall chandrasekar et al 2008 with the local bias correction of the ground gauge data it has been used for hydrological hazards forecasting recently peleg et al 2013 mei et al 2014 espinosa et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 willie et al 2017 shi et al 2018 yet even with the success more complete coverage is needed both spatially and temporally especially for a small mountainous catchment and an event rainfall scale in regions such as the study area gauge measurements remain the most effective means for data collection some recent studies have proposed that ground based measurements of rainfall are to some extent not sufficiently reliable for interpolation purposes however this largely reflects the insufficient quantity of gauges e g frei and schar 1998 goovaerts 2000 lloyd 2005 ly et al 2011 tobin et al 2011 marra et al 2014 2016 thakur et al 2020 in the previous research it has been found that rainfall increases with elevation which commonly called the orographic enhancement typically approximate a linear form in most cases is evident hibbert 1977 houghton 1979 obsorn 1984 daly et al 1994 sanchez moreno et al 2013 the focuses are the average amount or the accumulated amount of long term period e g annual and month rainfall in this study although a general exponential increasing tendency of rainfall with elevation was proposed the linear tendency of the average rainfall of 52 events is also evident fig 2 which indicated consistent with the findings of other related research e g vuglinski 1972 hibbert 1977 smith 1979 kumari et al 2017 hevesi et al 1992a 1992b goovaerts 2000 the analysis used measurements from 10 rain gauges in a small watershed which represented a dense gauge network and a reliable data source here we assume that the measured natural rainfall is the real rainfall without data correction although it is well known that rainfall amounts measured by means of ground gauges contain some negative biases the evaluation of such uncertainty is not the purpose of this work the findings of this study could provide a reference for rainfall estimation in neighboring regions with similar climatic and topographic conditions and help improve the understanding of debris flow formation conditions and forecasting however the feasibility of using a similar network in other debris flow regions is not guaranteed owing to potential regional differences 8 conclusions spatial variation of rainfall is a phenomenon that introduces large uncertainty in the forecasting of hydrological hazards e g water floods and debris flows this is particularly so for small mountainous watersheds with complex orographic conditions in this study 52 rainstorm events in a typical small mountainous watershed were used to analyze the relationships between event rainfall and both the elevation and the density of rain gauges the high correlation and consistent similarity in rainfall amounts between gauges at similar elevation suggested that elevation is the primary factor affecting rainfall variation in this region results showed that the mean event rainfall and elevation exhibited an exponential relationship moreover rainfall amount varied with elevation in each event thus an empirical rainfall elevation relation was proposed for rainfall estimation although the accuracy of this method was poorer than that of commonly used interpolation methods it is advantageous in that it requires only the rainfall data recorded at the watershed outlet in addition the rainfall interpolation uncertainties and effects of gauge distance were evaluated all interpolation results showed a similar error tendency and demonstrated that estimating rainfall distributions at high elevations is more difficult error analysis indicated that rain gauges should be placed carefully when the horizontal distance between gauges is 3 0 km selecting an inappropriate rain gauge for obtaining data caused significant uncertainty in simulations of water flood discharge and in identification of rainfall thresholds for debris flows using a gauge located at the mouth of the watershed or in the headwater region produced poorer performance in terms of flow simulation and empirical threshold identification for debris flows when compared with the estimation method proposed in this work this suggests that the representativeness of the rain gauge should be considered carefully and that clear understanding of the spatial variation of rainfall could help in estimation of the rainfall conditions required

4808,reliable and stable hydrological prediction plays a vitally crucial role in the scientific operation of water resources system as a famous artificial intelligence method for hydrological forecasting extreme learning machine elm has the virtues of fast training efficiency and strong generalization performance but is easily trapped into local optima because the preset computation parameters often remain unchanged in the learning process in order to overcome this shortcoming a practical evolutionary artificial intelligence model is developed for multiple scales nonstationary hydrological time series prediction in the proposed method an emerging evolutionary method called cooperation search algorithm csa is used to search for the optimal input hidden weights and hidden biases of the elm model for the first time the proposed method is used to forecast the runoff time series of three real world hydrological stations in china the experimental results show that the csa approach can effectively determine satisfying network parameters of the elm model while our method can produce better results than the traditional elm method in terms of all the performance evaluation indexes taking 1 step ahead runoff forecasting at station b as an example our method betters the elm method with 15 76 and 42 35 improvements in both root mean squared error and mean absolute percentage error at the testing phase thus a novel multiscale nonstationary hydrological prediction tool is developed to support the decision making of water resource system keywords hydrological forecasting extreme learning machine cooperation search algorithm artificial intelligence machine learning evolutionary algorithm 1 introduction in modern water resource system one of the most significant tasks is to accurately evaluate the available water quantity of the target basins in multiple time scales like daily weekly ten day and monthly ma et al 2013 madani and lund 2012 xu et al 2018 zheng et al 2017 hence multiple scales hydrological time series prediction plays an important role in improving the utilization efficiencies of the limited water resources like flood control power generation and environmental protection lei et al 2018a liu et al 2015 yin et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 2018 with the rapid economic development the demand for the water involved prediction information keeps growing in recent years chang et al 2018 chen et al 2012 niu et al 2021a peacuterez lespier et al 2019 zhisong et al 2019 to satisfy the actual demand hydrological prediction has become a research hotspot receiving more and more attention from scholars all over the world feng et al 2020a gohari et al 2013 hui et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 over the past decades a plenty of forecasting methods have been successfully proposed for modeling hydrological process the existing methods can be roughly divided into two groups knowledge based methods xu et al 2015 zeshui and shen 2019 zhao et al 2017 and data based methods gao et al 2020 huo et al 2020 xie et al 2019 in general the first group uses some well designed equations to imitate the complicated underlying rainfall runoff behaviors in nature bai et al 2016 leach et al 2018 schepen et al 2018 this kind of method can help understand the physical mechanism and interactive relationships of various involved factors like evaporation infiltration runoff and confluence in nonlinear hydrologic process feng and niu 2021 yang et al 2017a 2016 in practice comprehensive information can effectively improve the forecasting accuracy of complex models lei et al 2014 wang et al 2021 wen et al 2018a xiao et al 2021 although numerous operational hydrologic models are run with real time data around the world it is still difficult for many places to obtain necessary information on time due to various problems like machine fault immature development condition mismatching between rainfall station and stream gauging station then the runoff time series becomes the most common data available for operators and thereby the knowledge based methods often fail to yield satisfying forecasting performances lei et al 2018b niu and feng 2021 tan et al 2018 under this background the data based methods represented by support vector machine and gaussian process regression become increasingly popular alternatives to alleviate the defects of the theory based methods tan et al 2020 yuan et al 2017 with simple model structure and strong generalization ability the data based methods can extract the hidden rules with some kind of regularity from a large amount of data samples tan et al 2015 tian et al 2018 wang et al 2020a wen et al 2018b motivated by this point this paper aims at developing an effective data based method for hydrological time series prediction as a famous data driven models artificial neural network ann using gradient based learning technique have been widely employed to address various engineering problems in water resource and other complex system wang et al 2020b however the gradient based artificial neural network often faces some defects like over fitting long training time and local minimum cao et al 2020 gupta et al 1997 møller 1993 s et al 2021 to overcome this problem an emerging method known as extreme learning machine elm is proposed in recent years adnan et al 2019 li et al 2020a lima et al 2016 compared to the gradient based method elm has the merits of fast learning efficiency strong generalization ability and stopping criterion avoidance promoting its wide applications in many research fields like parameter identification wind prediction and speech recognition li et al 2019a taormina et al 2016 wen et al 2019 nevertheless it is found that the standard elm model still suffers from local convergence since the randomly determined parameters remain unchanged in the learning process and thereby makes negative influences on model compactness abdullah et al 2015 in other words the standard elm method may produce poor performances in many cases hence it is necessary to find more effective strategies to enhance the elm performance in hydrological time series forecasting recently many evolutionary algorithms ea inspired by physical phenomenon are developed to solve the global optimization problems which can provide new possibilities to train the neural network based models li et al 2020b s et al 2020 yang et al 2015 zong et al 2013 for instance genetic algorithm ga is used to optimize the ann connectivity weights in ref whitley et al 1990 evolutionary algorithm for optimizing ann connection weights architectures learning rules and input features are fully discussed in ref yao 1999 differential evolution de is compared with gradient based method in training the feed forward neural network and the results show that the de performance is equal to or better than the gradient based method but the executed time is sharply improved ilonen et al 2003 back propagation based method bp and particle swarm optimization pso are used to train the ann models in nonlinear functions approximation and it is proved that pso has faster learning rate than bp gudise and venayagamoorthy 2003 three methods de the levenberg marquardt method and bp are used to tune the ann model and the experiments indicate that the de based ann provides better results than the other two methods slowik and bialko 2008 a couple of metaheuristic eas are used to train the ann model and the results indicate that eas is superior to bp in regulation performances but less computationally efficient dai et al 2011 ga is chosen to find the weights of a feed forward ann and the results show that compared with the bp based methods eas yields similar performances in the training phase but smaller errors in the testing phase niu et al 2021b sulistiyo et al 2013 after comparing the suitability of different kinds of eas on training ann an enhanced ann using shuffled complex evolutionary global optimization is successfully proposed yang et al 2017b considering the existing successful applications a novel cooperation search algorithm csa is introduced to optimize the elm parameters for the first time in csa each individual solution for the target problem is seen as a staff whose performance is evaluated by the objective values a set of staffs iteratively search for the optimal solution via three operators the team communication operator for locating promising areas the reflective learning operator for enhancing local exploration and the internal competition operator for conserving outstanding solutions to show the feasibility of the csa method several famous benchmark functions are used for testing the simulations demonstrate that the csa method outperforms the control methods in both solution quality and convergence rate next this paper develops a novel new hydrological prediction method where the csa method is used to determine the computation parameters of the elm model the proposed method is applied to forecast the runoff data of three real world hydrological stations in china the experiments show that compared to the basic elm method our method can produce better forecasting results in different cases to be summarized the novelty of the study for both computer science and hydrology fields lies in two aspects 1 for the first time the csa method is used to determine the computation parameters and improve the network compactness of the elm model 2 a novel evolutionary artificial intelligence model is presented for hydrological time series prediction providing an alternative tool for the similar regression problems in practice the rest of this paper is organized as below the information of the csa method is described in section 2 the technical details of the proposed method are given in section 3 the simulations and discussions are given in section 4 while the conclusions are given in the end 2 cooperation search algorithm csa in general teamwork with task allocation and individual cooperation plays an important role in the scientific development of human society inspired by this case a novel evolutionary method cooperation search algorithm csa is presented to resolve the complex constrained optimization problems feng et al 2020b in csa the optimization process of the target problem is treated as a team assigned to accomplish the project each solution is seen as a staff while a set of staffs form an entrepreneur team the personal best known position of each solution is seen as a member of the supervisory board that are in charge of delivering information and team management while several best known solutions found by far become the members of the directors board that discuss and decide the team s development directions in the future the chairman on duty possessing the largest impact on the final decision is randomly selected from the directors board so as to increase the possibility of find better schemes as showed in fig 1 all the members can work hard to gain the chances of promoting the positions and raising the voice in the team while the leader staffs may lose dominant positions or even become employees at the ground level once no attempt is made to achieve progress for a long time by the good information communication and intensified competition mechanism all the staffs can make certain contributions to promoting the stable and healthy development of the entire team without loss of generality supposing that i staffs are involved in the j variable minimization optimization problem and then the csa method will take advantage of three carefully designed operators to update all the staffs information specially the team communication and reflective learning operators are used to generate trail staffs while the internal competition operator is used to select elite staffs for the next cycle then the brief procedures of the csa method are given as 1 team building phase the working conditions of all the staffs are randomly assigned in the feasible state space by the following equation 1 x i j k ϕ x j x j i 1 i j 1 j k 1 where x i j k is the jth value of the ith staff at the kth cycle ϕ x x yields a random number uniformly distributed in the range of x x 2 team communication operator firstly the members of both supervisor and directors board are chosen from staffs with superior performances while each staff enhances the professional skill by gaining favorable information from supervisory board the directors board and their ensemble average which can be described as below 2 u i j k 1 x i j k a i j k b i j k c i j k i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k 3 a i j k log 1 ϕ 0 1 gbes t ind j k x i j k 4 b i j k α ϕ 0 1 1 m m 1 m gbes t m j k x i j k 5 c i j k β ϕ 0 1 1 i i 1 i pbes t i j k x i j k where u i j k 1 is the jth value of the ith group staff at the k 1th cycle pbes t i j k is the jth value of the ith personal best known staff at the kth cycle gbes t ind j k is the jth value of the indth global best known staff from the beginning to the kth cycle ind is the index randomly selected from the set of 1 2 m m is the number of the global best known staffs α and β are two learning coefficients 3 reflective learning operator each staff can acquire new knowledge by summing historical experience in a disparate way which is described as follows 6 v i j k 1 r i j k 1 if u i j k 1 c j p i j k 1 if u i j k 1 c j i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k 7 r i j k 1 ϕ x j x j u i j k 1 c j if u i j k 1 c j ϕ 0 1 x j x j ϕ x j x j x j u i j k 1 otherwise 8 p i j

internal competition operator the entrepreneur team enhances the market competitiveness by selecting elite individuals and discarding individuals with poor performances which can be expressed as follows 10 x i j k 1 u i j k 1 if f u i k 1 f v i k 1 v i j k 1 if f u i k 1 f v i k 1 i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k where f x is the fitness value of the staff x 3 proposed hydrological prediction method 3 1 extreme learning machine elm elm is an emerging training technique developed to train the single layer feedforward neural network fu et al 2019 huang and chen 2008 for the standard elm network showed in fig 2 there are often one input layer with n neurons one hidden layer with l neurons and one output layer with m neurons generally the linear function is chosen as the activation function in both input layer and output layer while the sigmoid function is used in the hidden neurons wang et al 2019a yaseen et al 2018 the standard elm model starts with the random determination of input weights and hidden biases and then the hidden weights can be obtained by the moore penrose generalized inverse method instead of the traditional iterative adjustment strategy to produce the optimal solution of a linear system wu et al 2019 yadav et al 2016 compared to the gradient based method elm has the merits of strong generalization capability fast learning speed and parameter tuning avoidance making it become increasingly popular in many engineering problems feng et al 2019 yaseen et al 2019 for a given training dataset with n samples the input vectors are mapped into a l dimensional feature space via some nonlinear transformation and then the simulated values of the elm model can be expressed as 11 t i l 1 l β l g w l x i b l i 1 2 n where n is the number of training samples t i is the output vectors of the elm model associated with the input vector x i β l is the weight vectors linking the lth hidden neuron and the output layer w l is the weight vectors linking the lth hidden neuron and the input layer b l and g represent the bias and activation function of the ith hidden neuron in elm it is believed that the classical single layer artificial neural network can approach all the samples with zero deviation which can be mathematically expressed as below 12 i 1 n t i t i i 1 n t i l 1 l β l g w l x i b l 0 where t i denotes the target output vector associated with the input vector x i then the above equation can be reconstructed in the following compact way 13 h β t where 14 h g w 1 x 1 b 1 g w l x 1 b l g w 1 x n b 1 g w l x n b l n l 15 β β 1 1 β 1 m β l 1 β l m l m 16 t t 1 1 t 1 m t n 1 t n m n m where β is the weight matrix between hidden layer and output layer h is the output matrix of the hidden layer with respect to n samples t is the matrix of the target outputs with respect to n samples given that the input weights and hidden biases are fixed the model can be seen as a special linear system where h and t are equivalent to the matrixes of the known independent and dependent variables while β is regarded as the coefficient matrix to be optimized in this way the least squared solution for the above linear system can be directly obtained by 17 β h t where h is the moore penrose generalized inverse matrix of h 3 2 evolutionary artificial intelligence model although the elm method can make obvious improvements on the learning efficiency while maintaining satisfactory generalization capability the local convergence problem still exists in practice naz et al 2019 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2019b in other words the basic elm method may yield unsatisfying results in hydrological prediction in order to effectively enhance the elm performance this paper develops a novel evolutionary artificial intelligence model using cooperation search algorithm and extreme learning machine in this method the csa method is used to search for the optimal parameter combinations of the elm model and then the optimized neural network is driven for multiple scales hydrological time series prediction by combining the advantages of elm and csa the proposed approach can produce a better neural network with higher compactness than the traditional elm method next the detailed procedures of the presented approach are summarized as below step 1 preparatory work define the computational parameters of the presented method like the number of iterations staffs and elite solutions in csa the number of hidden neurons and the transfer function in elm here the famous sigmoid function is set as the activation function of hidden layer then the hydrological time series is normalized to the range of 0 1 before being divided into the training and testing sets which can be expressed as below 18 a i a i a i min a i max a i min where a i min and a i max denote the minimum and maximum of the ith feature data respectively a i and a i are the normalized and original values of the ith feature data respectively step 2 model optimization the csa method is driven to optimize the elm parameters and the detailed procedures are composed of the following steps step 2 1 set the counter k 1 then the initial swarm is randomly generated in the feasible space then the ith staff in the kth cycle x i k denotes a possible parameter combination for the elm model which can be expressed as below 19 x i k w 1 i k t w l i k t w l i k t b 1 i k b l i k b l i k where w l i k t is the input weights linking the lth hidden neuron and the input layer in x i k b l i k is the biases of the lth hidden neuron in x i k step 2 2 calculate the fitness value of all the staffs at the current cycle by the following equations 20 f x i k 1 n n 1 n t n l 1 l β l g w l i k x n b l i k 21 β i k h i k t 22 h i k g w 1 i k x 1 b 1 i k g w l i k x 1 b l i k g w 1 i k x n b 1 i k g w l i k x n b l i k n l where h i k is the hidden layer output matrix in x i k h i k is the moore penrose generalized inverse of h i k step 2 3 update the best known position of each staff and m global best known positions of the swarm then use the team communication operator to produce the group solutions for enhancing the global exploration step 2 4 use the reflective learning operator to yield the reflective solutions for enhancing the local exploitation step 2 5 calculate the fitness values of both group and reflective staffs and then use the internal competition operator to select better staffs for the next cycle step 2 6 set k k 1 if the maximal iteration is not met go to step 2 3 otherwise the global best known solution represents the optimal input weights and hidden biases and then the moore penrose generalized inverse method is used to determine the relevant hidden weights step 3 operational predication by this time the optimized elm model is driven to predict the outputs of the new input vectors to be mentioned the input vectors should be normalized into the range of 0 1 before starting the simulation process while the output values produced by the elm model should be renormalized to the original variation range 4 case studies 4 1 study area and dataset the runoff data of three hydrological stations located on the yangtze river is chosen to test the forecasting ability of the proposed method fig 3 draws the daily runoff data of three hydrological stations for three hydrological stations the first about 70 data is used for model training and validation while the left for testing as mentioned above the normalized process is used to avoid the possible numerical problem where the small numeric data is dominated by larger data 4 2 evaluation indicators to test the forecasting ability of the present method four famous indicators are introduced for comparison including root mean squared error rmse mean absolute percentage error mape coefficient correlation r and nash sutcliffe efficiency ce rmse is able to yield a satisfying measure to testify the performance of the forecasting model in tracking high flows mape is an unbiased index to test the relative error of the forecasting results which is insensitive to the error of high magnitude data r and ce can reflect the linear relationship and overall deviation between the predicted and observed data respectively in general a good forecasting model produces large values of ce and r as well as small values of rmse and mape next four employed statistical indexes are defined as below 23 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 24 mape 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 100 25 r i 1 n y i y avg y i y avg i 1 n y i y avg 2 y i y avg 2 26 ce 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y avg 2 where y i and y i are the ith observed and forecasted value y avg and y avg are the average of the observed and forecasted values n is the number of data considered for comparison 4 3 simulation of the proposed method in hydrological station a 4 3 1 performance of the proposed method in daily runoff 4 3 1 1 model structure traditionally the model s outputs are usually affected by input variables and model structure to achieve satisfying performance the trial and error method is used to find the ideal parameter combinations different input variables for the hydrological series at various forecasting periods are designed the developed forecasting model can be expressed by q t τ model q t q t 1 q t d while the number of hidden neurons varies from the set of 2d 1 2d 2d 1 for each case where d and τ are the number of input variables and forecasting period respectively obviously the model selection involves a great deal of numerical calculations in general large values of agents and iterations used in eas effectively enlarge the possibility of finding better parameters in order to achieve a good tradeoff between execution efficiency and forecasting accuracy the number of staffs and iterations in the proposed method are set as 20 and 100 for each model besides the simulation results are obtained on a personal computer with 1 6 ghz processor and 8 gb ram 4 3 1 2 result comparison table 1 gives the statistical indexes of 1 step ahead daily runoff forecasting results by the elm method with various model structures at station a the results show that the performances of the elm model are simultaneously influenced by the number of hidden neurons and input variables proving the modeling difficulty of nonlinear streamflow prediction for model c1 the best mape index during the training phase is provided by the 2d 1 structure while the best rmse r and ce indexes at the testing phase is achieved by the 2d 1 structure hence the suitable elm model for daily runoff forecasting should be carefully selected based on the actual situation of the specific engineering problem based on overall consideration the elm model with 7 13 1 structure obtained in 16th run is used to predict 1 step ahead daily runoff due to the satisfying statistical indexes at both training and testing phases using the similar execution steps the best inputs and hidden nodes of the proposed method can be determined fig 4 draws the r and ce of 1 step ahead daily runoff forecasting results by two method at station a it can be clearly seen that the elm result is always inferior to our method for each scheme with identical input variables and hidden neurons while the proposed method yields similar forecasting results regardless of inputs variation proving the robustness of the csa method in improving the elm performance after comparing the simulated results of two models obvious differences exist in the performance improvements of various schemes due to the randomness of the employed methods to sum up the csa method proves to be an effective tool in improving the elm performance by taking the similar steps multi step ahead daily runoff forecasting results of two methods are obtained and then the detailed statistical indexes are listed in table 2 it can be clearly seen that in different scenarios the elm method is obviously inferior to the proposed method in 1 step ahead daily runoff prediction our method betters elm with about 11 35 and 58 36 improvements of rmse and mape in the training phase and 0 77 and 1 89 improvements of r an ce in the testing phase in the 5 step head daily forecasting the r an ce values are improved by 3 57 and 18 79 in the training phase as well as 5 22 and 23 79 in the testing phase on the other hand the performances of two methods are sharply reduced with the increase of forecasting period for instance as the forecasting period increase from 1 to 5 the r values of the proposed method in the testing phase are reduced from 0 9129 to 0 6644 better than that of elm from 0 9059 to 0 6314 hence the proposed method yields better forecasting results than the conventional elm model in all the statistical indexes providing an effective tool for the complex operational forecasting task fig 5 shows multi step ahead forecasting results of two methods for daily runoff at the testing phase while the corresponding relative errors of two methods are drawn in fig 6 it shows that for various forecast periods the elm method is not good as the proposed method since its tested lines are far from the ideal line proving the strong generalization ability of the proposed method besides as the forecast period raises from 1 to 5 two methods achieve comparatively good results in tracking the overall tendency of the daily runoff but the forecasting performances are sharply reduced because the r values are reduced gradually hence it can be concluded that the proposed method using the csa method to optimize model parameters can generate satisfying forecasting results than the standard elm model 4 3 2 performance of the proposed method in weekly average runoff to verify its performance the proposed method is used to forecast the weekly runoff at station a based on the trial and error method multi step ahead weekly runoff forecasting results by two methods are obtained and then statistical indexes are listed in table 3 it can be clearly seen that the proposed method can provide better results than the standard elm method in both training and testing phases whereas the performances of two methods are reduced as the forecast period raises from 1 to 5 for instance in the 1 step ahead runoff forecasting the values of r and ce are improved by about 2 17 and 4 36 at the training phase while the rmse and mape values are improved by about 4 67 and 0 53 at the testing phase besides the r values of the proposed method at the testing phase are reduced from 0 7590 of 1 step to 0 5580 of 5 step while the elm method decreases from 0 7318 to 0 5273 thus the proposed method proves to be an effective tool for multi step ahead runoff forecasting under the changing environments fig 7 shows multi step ahead forecasting results for weekly average runoff at station a during the testing phase it can be seen that as adopted to predicted the variation tendency of the weekly runoff the proposed method has a stronger ability than the basic elm method due to the smaller biases between the observed and simulated runoffs besides as the forecasting period increases the performances of two methods in high flows are deceased making an obvious reduction in the r value thus the feasibility of the csa method in enhancing the network compactness of the elm model is proved again 4 3 3 performance of the proposed method in ten day average runoff the proposed method is used to forecast the ten day average runoff of the hydrological station a table 4 lists statistical indexes of multi step ahead ten day average runoff forecasting results by two methods at station a it can be found that as the forecast period increases gradually all the statistical indexes of two methods becomes poorer while the proposed method still outperforms the control model for instance when the forecast period increases from 1 to 5 the ce values of the elm method during the testing phase are reduced from 0 5355 to 0 2205 not as good as the proposed method from 0 5659 to 0 3034 the proposed method can effectively provide accurate streamflow forecasting information for operators in both water resources and power system fig 8 shows multi step ahead forecasting results for ten day average runoff at station a during the testing phase it is observed that in the same forecasting period the performance of the elm method is inferior to the proposed method demonstrating the importance of the csa method in optimizing the elm parameters besides the performances of two developed methods gradually become worse as the forecasting period increases hence the forecasting ability of the developed method outperforms its original version 4 4 simulation of the proposed method in hydrological station b for further testing its feasibility the proposed method ann and elm are driven to forecast the daily runoff at station b table 5 gives the statistical indexes of two methods for multi step ahead daily runoff forecasting by three methods based on the trial and error strategy it serves to show that the proposed method outperforms the standard elm and ann methods during both training and testing phases taking the 1 step ahed forecasting as an example the proposed method betters the standard elm method with about 15 76 and 42 35 improvements in rmse and mape at the testing phase thus the proposed method can be driven to predict multi step ahead runoff values at station b the multi step ahead forecasting results for daily runoff at station b during the testing phase are given in fig 9 it serves to show that at the same forecasting period the performance of the elm method is always worse than the developed method proving the practicability of the csa method in optimizing the elm model as the forecasting period increases the results of two methods gradually becomes worse while the proposed method is always better than elm hence the proposed method proves to be an effective tool to forecast the daily runoff at station b fig 10 shows peak flows of multi step ahead forecasting results for daily runoff at station b during the testing phase it can be found that the proposed method has better ability to track peak flows for 1 step ahed runoff prediction the elm method makes about 20 12 underestimation for all the peak flows on average worse than 11 24 of the proposed method as the forecasting period increases from 2 to 5 the average forecasting errors are increased but the proposed method is better than the elm method thus the proposed method can effectively track the high flows of daily runoff at station b 4 5 simulation of the proposed method in hydrological station c in this section the proposed method and elm are driven to forecast the daily runoff at station c the statistical indexes of multi step ahead daily runoff forecasting results in different cases for various dataset are listed in table 6 the entire dataset is spilt into 3 parts low flow runoff are smaller than the average normal flow runoff are larger than the average and total flow all the data it can be clearly seen that for various dataset the proposed method is always better than the standard elm method in most cases hence the proposed method can track the dynamic change of various sub datasets chosen from the runoff time series at station c fig 11 illustrates the multi step ahead forecasting results for daily runoff at station c at the testing phase it can be clearly seen that at various forecasting period cases two approaches can effectively simulate the dynamic process of the observed runoff at station c while the proposed method producing larger r values is better than the standard elm method hence the proposed method can achieve satisfying forecasting results in daily runoff prediction at station c 4 6 discussions from the simulations it can be found that the proposed method outperforms the standard elm method in different cases the standard elm model uses the randomly placed input weights and hidden biases to analytically determine the hidden weights which means that all the parameters remain unchanged even though the training process is timesaving the local convergence cannot be avoided and thereby the elm method will produce unsatisfying results with a high probability on the other hand the superior performance of the proposed method is attributed to the dynamic integration of evolutionary algorithm and artificial intelligence using the population based search strategy the csa method randomly creates multiple solutions in the problem space and then uses three well designed operators to iteratively search for the optimal parameter combinations which can effectively enlarge the search space and improve the solution quality in this way the network compactness of the elm model can be guaranteed as a result the proposed method can produce preferable results than the elm method in forecasting the runoff time series of three hydrological stations in china to be mentioned the statistical indicators of both elm and the proposed method at station a are not good enough as that of station b and station c while the performances of two considered forecasting model become worse with the increase of the forecasting period the reasons are that the longer the forecasting period the more the uncertain factors the more difficult the precise modeling the experiments also demonstrate that the performance of the forecasting model is affected by various factors at the same time like input variables model structure and data features owing to the random search strategy the proposed method still faces some defects in practical applications like result oscillation and local convergence in other words the forecasting model may yield different results when the inputs or hidden nodes make slight modifications or random seed generators are used to update the staff s information thus in the future it is of great importance to develop some robust and effective techniques for identifying the potential runoff characteristics carefully determining reasonable input combination and computation parameters meanwhile in the field of hydrology it is commonly accepted to apply hydrologic modeling to estimate and forecast runoff by using more comprehensive information like precipitation and evaporation and physical knowledge of watershed properties like soil moisture infiltration and impervious area of a region lei et al 2018a xu et al 2015 yang et al 2018 in theory such comprehensive information may be more trustable than a pure statistical learning model li et al 2019b liu et al 2018 si et al 2019 along with the rapid development of sensing technology real time monitoring and data acquisition techniques many operational hydrologic models are run with real time available data all the world and many successful applications have also proved the feasibility of information integration in improving the forecasting results chen et al 2020 hossein kazemi et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 however due to the limited time and energy these comprehensive information are not given full consideration in the modeling process thus it is also necessary to testify the feasibility of our method in hydrological prediction tasks considering multi source information at other places 5 conclusion in this study an evolutionary artificial intelligence model is developed for multiple time scale nonstationary hydrological time series prediction where the cooperation search algorithm csa is chosen for the first time as the optimizer for determining the optimal input hidden weights and hidden biases of the conventional extreme learning machine elm model the superior global exploitation and local exploration of the csa method can improve computational parameters of the standard elm method the proposed model is verified by comparative experiments on the runoff time series of three hydrological stations in china the simulations show that the proposed method produces better forecasting results than elm under different cases therefore an effective artificial intelligence tool is provided for multiscale hydrological prediction

4808,reliable and stable hydrological prediction plays a vitally crucial role in the scientific operation of water resources system as a famous artificial intelligence method for hydrological forecasting extreme learning machine elm has the virtues of fast training efficiency and strong generalization performance but is easily trapped into local optima because the preset computation parameters often remain unchanged in the learning process in order to overcome this shortcoming a practical evolutionary artificial intelligence model is developed for multiple scales nonstationary hydrological time series prediction in the proposed method an emerging evolutionary method called cooperation search algorithm csa is used to search for the optimal input hidden weights and hidden biases of the elm model for the first time the proposed method is used to forecast the runoff time series of three real world hydrological stations in china the experimental results show that the csa approach can effectively determine satisfying network parameters of the elm model while our method can produce better results than the traditional elm method in terms of all the performance evaluation indexes taking 1 step ahead runoff forecasting at station b as an example our method betters the elm method with 15 76 and 42 35 improvements in both root mean squared error and mean absolute percentage error at the testing phase thus a novel multiscale nonstationary hydrological prediction tool is developed to support the decision making of water resource system keywords hydrological forecasting extreme learning machine cooperation search algorithm artificial intelligence machine learning evolutionary algorithm 1 introduction in modern water resource system one of the most significant tasks is to accurately evaluate the available water quantity of the target basins in multiple time scales like daily weekly ten day and monthly ma et al 2013 madani and lund 2012 xu et al 2018 zheng et al 2017 hence multiple scales hydrological time series prediction plays an important role in improving the utilization efficiencies of the limited water resources like flood control power generation and environmental protection lei et al 2018a liu et al 2015 yin et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 2018 with the rapid economic development the demand for the water involved prediction information keeps growing in recent years chang et al 2018 chen et al 2012 niu et al 2021a peacuterez lespier et al 2019 zhisong et al 2019 to satisfy the actual demand hydrological prediction has become a research hotspot receiving more and more attention from scholars all over the world feng et al 2020a gohari et al 2013 hui et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 over the past decades a plenty of forecasting methods have been successfully proposed for modeling hydrological process the existing methods can be roughly divided into two groups knowledge based methods xu et al 2015 zeshui and shen 2019 zhao et al 2017 and data based methods gao et al 2020 huo et al 2020 xie et al 2019 in general the first group uses some well designed equations to imitate the complicated underlying rainfall runoff behaviors in nature bai et al 2016 leach et al 2018 schepen et al 2018 this kind of method can help understand the physical mechanism and interactive relationships of various involved factors like evaporation infiltration runoff and confluence in nonlinear hydrologic process feng and niu 2021 yang et al 2017a 2016 in practice comprehensive information can effectively improve the forecasting accuracy of complex models lei et al 2014 wang et al 2021 wen et al 2018a xiao et al 2021 although numerous operational hydrologic models are run with real time data around the world it is still difficult for many places to obtain necessary information on time due to various problems like machine fault immature development condition mismatching between rainfall station and stream gauging station then the runoff time series becomes the most common data available for operators and thereby the knowledge based methods often fail to yield satisfying forecasting performances lei et al 2018b niu and feng 2021 tan et al 2018 under this background the data based methods represented by support vector machine and gaussian process regression become increasingly popular alternatives to alleviate the defects of the theory based methods tan et al 2020 yuan et al 2017 with simple model structure and strong generalization ability the data based methods can extract the hidden rules with some kind of regularity from a large amount of data samples tan et al 2015 tian et al 2018 wang et al 2020a wen et al 2018b motivated by this point this paper aims at developing an effective data based method for hydrological time series prediction as a famous data driven models artificial neural network ann using gradient based learning technique have been widely employed to address various engineering problems in water resource and other complex system wang et al 2020b however the gradient based artificial neural network often faces some defects like over fitting long training time and local minimum cao et al 2020 gupta et al 1997 møller 1993 s et al 2021 to overcome this problem an emerging method known as extreme learning machine elm is proposed in recent years adnan et al 2019 li et al 2020a lima et al 2016 compared to the gradient based method elm has the merits of fast learning efficiency strong generalization ability and stopping criterion avoidance promoting its wide applications in many research fields like parameter identification wind prediction and speech recognition li et al 2019a taormina et al 2016 wen et al 2019 nevertheless it is found that the standard elm model still suffers from local convergence since the randomly determined parameters remain unchanged in the learning process and thereby makes negative influences on model compactness abdullah et al 2015 in other words the standard elm method may produce poor performances in many cases hence it is necessary to find more effective strategies to enhance the elm performance in hydrological time series forecasting recently many evolutionary algorithms ea inspired by physical phenomenon are developed to solve the global optimization problems which can provide new possibilities to train the neural network based models li et al 2020b s et al 2020 yang et al 2015 zong et al 2013 for instance genetic algorithm ga is used to optimize the ann connectivity weights in ref whitley et al 1990 evolutionary algorithm for optimizing ann connection weights architectures learning rules and input features are fully discussed in ref yao 1999 differential evolution de is compared with gradient based method in training the feed forward neural network and the results show that the de performance is equal to or better than the gradient based method but the executed time is sharply improved ilonen et al 2003 back propagation based method bp and particle swarm optimization pso are used to train the ann models in nonlinear functions approximation and it is proved that pso has faster learning rate than bp gudise and venayagamoorthy 2003 three methods de the levenberg marquardt method and bp are used to tune the ann model and the experiments indicate that the de based ann provides better results than the other two methods slowik and bialko 2008 a couple of metaheuristic eas are used to train the ann model and the results indicate that eas is superior to bp in regulation performances but less computationally efficient dai et al 2011 ga is chosen to find the weights of a feed forward ann and the results show that compared with the bp based methods eas yields similar performances in the training phase but smaller errors in the testing phase niu et al 2021b sulistiyo et al 2013 after comparing the suitability of different kinds of eas on training ann an enhanced ann using shuffled complex evolutionary global optimization is successfully proposed yang et al 2017b considering the existing successful applications a novel cooperation search algorithm csa is introduced to optimize the elm parameters for the first time in csa each individual solution for the target problem is seen as a staff whose performance is evaluated by the objective values a set of staffs iteratively search for the optimal solution via three operators the team communication operator for locating promising areas the reflective learning operator for enhancing local exploration and the internal competition operator for conserving outstanding solutions to show the feasibility of the csa method several famous benchmark functions are used for testing the simulations demonstrate that the csa method outperforms the control methods in both solution quality and convergence rate next this paper develops a novel new hydrological prediction method where the csa method is used to determine the computation parameters of the elm model the proposed method is applied to forecast the runoff data of three real world hydrological stations in china the experiments show that compared to the basic elm method our method can produce better forecasting results in different cases to be summarized the novelty of the study for both computer science and hydrology fields lies in two aspects 1 for the first time the csa method is used to determine the computation parameters and improve the network compactness of the elm model 2 a novel evolutionary artificial intelligence model is presented for hydrological time series prediction providing an alternative tool for the similar regression problems in practice the rest of this paper is organized as below the information of the csa method is described in section 2 the technical details of the proposed method are given in section 3 the simulations and discussions are given in section 4 while the conclusions are given in the end 2 cooperation search algorithm csa in general teamwork with task allocation and individual cooperation plays an important role in the scientific development of human society inspired by this case a novel evolutionary method cooperation search algorithm csa is presented to resolve the complex constrained optimization problems feng et al 2020b in csa the optimization process of the target problem is treated as a team assigned to accomplish the project each solution is seen as a staff while a set of staffs form an entrepreneur team the personal best known position of each solution is seen as a member of the supervisory board that are in charge of delivering information and team management while several best known solutions found by far become the members of the directors board that discuss and decide the team s development directions in the future the chairman on duty possessing the largest impact on the final decision is randomly selected from the directors board so as to increase the possibility of find better schemes as showed in fig 1 all the members can work hard to gain the chances of promoting the positions and raising the voice in the team while the leader staffs may lose dominant positions or even become employees at the ground level once no attempt is made to achieve progress for a long time by the good information communication and intensified competition mechanism all the staffs can make certain contributions to promoting the stable and healthy development of the entire team without loss of generality supposing that i staffs are involved in the j variable minimization optimization problem and then the csa method will take advantage of three carefully designed operators to update all the staffs information specially the team communication and reflective learning operators are used to generate trail staffs while the internal competition operator is used to select elite staffs for the next cycle then the brief procedures of the csa method are given as 1 team building phase the working conditions of all the staffs are randomly assigned in the feasible state space by the following equation 1 x i j k ϕ x j x j i 1 i j 1 j k 1 where x i j k is the jth value of the ith staff at the kth cycle ϕ x x yields a random number uniformly distributed in the range of x x 2 team communication operator firstly the members of both supervisor and directors board are chosen from staffs with superior performances while each staff enhances the professional skill by gaining favorable information from supervisory board the directors board and their ensemble average which can be described as below 2 u i j k 1 x i j k a i j k b i j k c i j k i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k 3 a i j k log 1 ϕ 0 1 gbes t ind j k x i j k 4 b i j k α ϕ 0 1 1 m m 1 m gbes t m j k x i j k 5 c i j k β ϕ 0 1 1 i i 1 i pbes t i j k x i j k where u i j k 1 is the jth value of the ith group staff at the k 1th cycle pbes t i j k is the jth value of the ith personal best known staff at the kth cycle gbes t ind j k is the jth value of the indth global best known staff from the beginning to the kth cycle ind is the index randomly selected from the set of 1 2 m m is the number of the global best known staffs α and β are two learning coefficients 3 reflective learning operator each staff can acquire new knowledge by summing historical experience in a disparate way which is described as follows 6 v i j k 1 r i j k 1 if u i j k 1 c j p i j k 1 if u i j k 1 c j i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k 7 r i j k 1 ϕ x j x j u i j k 1 c j if u i j k 1 c j ϕ 0 1 x j x j ϕ x j x j x j u i j k 1 otherwise 8 p i j

internal competition operator the entrepreneur team enhances the market competitiveness by selecting elite individuals and discarding individuals with poor performances which can be expressed as follows 10 x i j k 1 u i j k 1 if f u i k 1 f v i k 1 v i j k 1 if f u i k 1 f v i k 1 i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k where f x is the fitness value of the staff x 3 proposed hydrological prediction method 3 1 extreme learning machine elm elm is an emerging training technique developed to train the single layer feedforward neural network fu et al 2019 huang and chen 2008 for the standard elm network showed in fig 2 there are often one input layer with n neurons one hidden layer with l neurons and one output layer with m neurons generally the linear function is chosen as the activation function in both input layer and output layer while the sigmoid function is used in the hidden neurons wang et al 2019a yaseen et al 2018 the standard elm model starts with the random determination of input weights and hidden biases and then the hidden weights can be obtained by the moore penrose generalized inverse method instead of the traditional iterative adjustment strategy to produce the optimal solution of a linear system wu et al 2019 yadav et al 2016 compared to the gradient based method elm has the merits of strong generalization capability fast learning speed and parameter tuning avoidance making it become increasingly popular in many engineering problems feng et al 2019 yaseen et al 2019 for a given training dataset with n samples the input vectors are mapped into a l dimensional feature space via some nonlinear transformation and then the simulated values of the elm model can be expressed as 11 t i l 1 l β l g w l x i b l i 1 2 n where n is the number of training samples t i is the output vectors of the elm model associated with the input vector x i β l is the weight vectors linking the lth hidden neuron and the output layer w l is the weight vectors linking the lth hidden neuron and the input layer b l and g represent the bias and activation function of the ith hidden neuron in elm it is believed that the classical single layer artificial neural network can approach all the samples with zero deviation which can be mathematically expressed as below 12 i 1 n t i t i i 1 n t i l 1 l β l g w l x i b l 0 where t i denotes the target output vector associated with the input vector x i then the above equation can be reconstructed in the following compact way 13 h β t where 14 h g w 1 x 1 b 1 g w l x 1 b l g w 1 x n b 1 g w l x n b l n l 15 β β 1 1 β 1 m β l 1 β l m l m 16 t t 1 1 t 1 m t n 1 t n m n m where β is the weight matrix between hidden layer and output layer h is the output matrix of the hidden layer with respect to n samples t is the matrix of the target outputs with respect to n samples given that the input weights and hidden biases are fixed the model can be seen as a special linear system where h and t are equivalent to the matrixes of the known independent and dependent variables while β is regarded as the coefficient matrix to be optimized in this way the least squared solution for the above linear system can be directly obtained by 17 β h t where h is the moore penrose generalized inverse matrix of h 3 2 evolutionary artificial intelligence model although the elm method can make obvious improvements on the learning efficiency while maintaining satisfactory generalization capability the local convergence problem still exists in practice naz et al 2019 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2019b in other words the basic elm method may yield unsatisfying results in hydrological prediction in order to effectively enhance the elm performance this paper develops a novel evolutionary artificial intelligence model using cooperation search algorithm and extreme learning machine in this method the csa method is used to search for the optimal parameter combinations of the elm model and then the optimized neural network is driven for multiple scales hydrological time series prediction by combining the advantages of elm and csa the proposed approach can produce a better neural network with higher compactness than the traditional elm method next the detailed procedures of the presented approach are summarized as below step 1 preparatory work define the computational parameters of the presented method like the number of iterations staffs and elite solutions in csa the number of hidden neurons and the transfer function in elm here the famous sigmoid function is set as the activation function of hidden layer then the hydrological time series is normalized to the range of 0 1 before being divided into the training and testing sets which can be expressed as below 18 a i a i a i min a i max a i min where a i min and a i max denote the minimum and maximum of the ith feature data respectively a i and a i are the normalized and original values of the ith feature data respectively step 2 model optimization the csa method is driven to optimize the elm parameters and the detailed procedures are composed of the following steps step 2 1 set the counter k 1 then the initial swarm is randomly generated in the feasible space then the ith staff in the kth cycle x i k denotes a possible parameter combination for the elm model which can be expressed as below 19 x i k w 1 i k t w l i k t w l i k t b 1 i k b l i k b l i k where w l i k t is the input weights linking the lth hidden neuron and the input layer in x i k b l i k is the biases of the lth hidden neuron in x i k step 2 2 calculate the fitness value of all the staffs at the current cycle by the following equations 20 f x i k 1 n n 1 n t n l 1 l β l g w l i k x n b l i k 21 β i k h i k t 22 h i k g w 1 i k x 1 b 1 i k g w l i k x 1 b l i k g w 1 i k x n b 1 i k g w l i k x n b l i k n l where h i k is the hidden layer output matrix in x i k h i k is the moore penrose generalized inverse of h i k step 2 3 update the best known position of each staff and m global best known positions of the swarm then use the team communication operator to produce the group solutions for enhancing the global exploration step 2 4 use the reflective learning operator to yield the reflective solutions for enhancing the local exploitation step 2 5 calculate the fitness values of both group and reflective staffs and then use the internal competition operator to select better staffs for the next cycle step 2 6 set k k 1 if the maximal iteration is not met go to step 2 3 otherwise the global best known solution represents the optimal input weights and hidden biases and then the moore penrose generalized inverse method is used to determine the relevant hidden weights step 3 operational predication by this time the optimized elm model is driven to predict the outputs of the new input vectors to be mentioned the input vectors should be normalized into the range of 0 1 before starting the simulation process while the output values produced by the elm model should be renormalized to the original variation range 4 case studies 4 1 study area and dataset the runoff data of three hydrological stations located on the yangtze river is chosen to test the forecasting ability of the proposed method fig 3 draws the daily runoff data of three hydrological stations for three hydrological stations the first about 70 data is used for model training and validation while the left for testing as mentioned above the normalized process is used to avoid the possible numerical problem where the small numeric data is dominated by larger data 4 2 evaluation indicators to test the forecasting ability of the present method four famous indicators are introduced for comparison including root mean squared error rmse mean absolute percentage error mape coefficient correlation r and nash sutcliffe efficiency ce rmse is able to yield a satisfying measure to testify the performance of the forecasting model in tracking high flows mape is an unbiased index to test the relative error of the forecasting results which is insensitive to the error of high magnitude data r and ce can reflect the linear relationship and overall deviation between the predicted and observed data respectively in general a good forecasting model produces large values of ce and r as well as small values of rmse and mape next four employed statistical indexes are defined as below 23 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 24 mape 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 100 25 r i 1 n y i y avg y i y avg i 1 n y i y avg 2 y i y avg 2 26 ce 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y avg 2 where y i and y i are the ith observed and forecasted value y avg and y avg are the average of the observed and forecasted values n is the number of data considered for comparison 4 3 simulation of the proposed method in hydrological station a 4 3 1 performance of the proposed method in daily runoff 4 3 1 1 model structure traditionally the model s outputs are usually affected by input variables and model structure to achieve satisfying performance the trial and error method is used to find the ideal parameter combinations different input variables for the hydrological series at various forecasting periods are designed the developed forecasting model can be expressed by q t τ model q t q t 1 q t d while the number of hidden neurons varies from the set of 2d 1 2d 2d 1 for each case where d and τ are the number of input variables and forecasting period respectively obviously the model selection involves a great deal of numerical calculations in general large values of agents and iterations used in eas effectively enlarge the possibility of finding better parameters in order to achieve a good tradeoff between execution efficiency and forecasting accuracy the number of staffs and iterations in the proposed method are set as 20 and 100 for each model besides the simulation results are obtained on a personal computer with 1 6 ghz processor and 8 gb ram 4 3 1 2 result comparison table 1 gives the statistical indexes of 1 step ahead daily runoff forecasting results by the elm method with various model structures at station a the results show that the performances of the elm model are simultaneously influenced by the number of hidden neurons and input variables proving the modeling difficulty of nonlinear streamflow prediction for model c1 the best mape index during the training phase is provided by the 2d 1 structure while the best rmse r and ce indexes at the testing phase is achieved by the 2d 1 structure hence the suitable elm model for daily runoff forecasting should be carefully selected based on the actual situation of the specific engineering problem based on overall consideration the elm model with 7 13 1 structure obtained in 16th run is used to predict 1 step ahead daily runoff due to the satisfying statistical indexes at both training and testing phases using the similar execution steps the best inputs and hidden nodes of the proposed method can be determined fig 4 draws the r and ce of 1 step ahead daily runoff forecasting results by two method at station a it can be clearly seen that the elm result is always inferior to our method for each scheme with identical input variables and hidden neurons while the proposed method yields similar forecasting results regardless of inputs variation proving the robustness of the csa method in improving the elm performance after comparing the simulated results of two models obvious differences exist in the performance improvements of various schemes due to the randomness of the employed methods to sum up the csa method proves to be an effective tool in improving the elm performance by taking the similar steps multi step ahead daily runoff forecasting results of two methods are obtained and then the detailed statistical indexes are listed in table 2 it can be clearly seen that in different scenarios the elm method is obviously inferior to the proposed method in 1 step ahead daily runoff prediction our method betters elm with about 11 35 and 58 36 improvements of rmse and mape in the training phase and 0 77 and 1 89 improvements of r an ce in the testing phase in the 5 step head daily forecasting the r an ce values are improved by 3 57 and 18 79 in the training phase as well as 5 22 and 23 79 in the testing phase on the other hand the performances of two methods are sharply reduced with the increase of forecasting period for instance as the forecasting period increase from 1 to 5 the r values of the proposed method in the testing phase are reduced from 0 9129 to 0 6644 better than that of elm from 0 9059 to 0 6314 hence the proposed method yields better forecasting results than the conventional elm model in all the statistical indexes providing an effective tool for the complex operational forecasting task fig 5 shows multi step ahead forecasting results of two methods for daily runoff at the testing phase while the corresponding relative errors of two methods are drawn in fig 6 it shows that for various forecast periods the elm method is not good as the proposed method since its tested lines are far from the ideal line proving the strong generalization ability of the proposed method besides as the forecast period raises from 1 to 5 two methods achieve comparatively good results in tracking the overall tendency of the daily runoff but the forecasting performances are sharply reduced because the r values are reduced gradually hence it can be concluded that the proposed method using the csa method to optimize model parameters can generate satisfying forecasting results than the standard elm model 4 3 2 performance of the proposed method in weekly average runoff to verify its performance the proposed method is used to forecast the weekly runoff at station a based on the trial and error method multi step ahead weekly runoff forecasting results by two methods are obtained and then statistical indexes are listed in table 3 it can be clearly seen that the proposed method can provide better results than the standard elm method in both training and testing phases whereas the performances of two methods are reduced as the forecast period raises from 1 to 5 for instance in the 1 step ahead runoff forecasting the values of r and ce are improved by about 2 17 and 4 36 at the training phase while the rmse and mape values are improved by about 4 67 and 0 53 at the testing phase besides the r values of the proposed method at the testing phase are reduced from 0 7590 of 1 step to 0 5580 of 5 step while the elm method decreases from 0 7318 to 0 5273 thus the proposed method proves to be an effective tool for multi step ahead runoff forecasting under the changing environments fig 7 shows multi step ahead forecasting results for weekly average runoff at station a during the testing phase it can be seen that as adopted to predicted the variation tendency of the weekly runoff the proposed method has a stronger ability than the basic elm method due to the smaller biases between the observed and simulated runoffs besides as the forecasting period increases the performances of two methods in high flows are deceased making an obvious reduction in the r value thus the feasibility of the csa method in enhancing the network compactness of the elm model is proved again 4 3 3 performance of the proposed method in ten day average runoff the proposed method is used to forecast the ten day average runoff of the hydrological station a table 4 lists statistical indexes of multi step ahead ten day average runoff forecasting results by two methods at station a it can be found that as the forecast period increases gradually all the statistical indexes of two methods becomes poorer while the proposed method still outperforms the control model for instance when the forecast period increases from 1 to 5 the ce values of the elm method during the testing phase are reduced from 0 5355 to 0 2205 not as good as the proposed method from 0 5659 to 0 3034 the proposed method can effectively provide accurate streamflow forecasting information for operators in both water resources and power system fig 8 shows multi step ahead forecasting results for ten day average runoff at station a during the testing phase it is observed that in the same forecasting period the performance of the elm method is inferior to the proposed method demonstrating the importance of the csa method in optimizing the elm parameters besides the performances of two developed methods gradually become worse as the forecasting period increases hence the forecasting ability of the developed method outperforms its original version 4 4 simulation of the proposed method in hydrological station b for further testing its feasibility the proposed method ann and elm are driven to forecast the daily runoff at station b table 5 gives the statistical indexes of two methods for multi step ahead daily runoff forecasting by three methods based on the trial and error strategy it serves to show that the proposed method outperforms the standard elm and ann methods during both training and testing phases taking the 1 step ahed forecasting as an example the proposed method betters the standard elm method with about 15 76 and 42 35 improvements in rmse and mape at the testing phase thus the proposed method can be driven to predict multi step ahead runoff values at station b the multi step ahead forecasting results for daily runoff at station b during the testing phase are given in fig 9 it serves to show that at the same forecasting period the performance of the elm method is always worse than the developed method proving the practicability of the csa method in optimizing the elm model as the forecasting period increases the results of two methods gradually becomes worse while the proposed method is always better than elm hence the proposed method proves to be an effective tool to forecast the daily runoff at station b fig 10 shows peak flows of multi step ahead forecasting results for daily runoff at station b during the testing phase it can be found that the proposed method has better ability to track peak flows for 1 step ahed runoff prediction the elm method makes about 20 12 underestimation for all the peak flows on average worse than 11 24 of the proposed method as the forecasting period increases from 2 to 5 the average forecasting errors are increased but the proposed method is better than the elm method thus the proposed method can effectively track the high flows of daily runoff at station b 4 5 simulation of the proposed method in hydrological station c in this section the proposed method and elm are driven to forecast the daily runoff at station c the statistical indexes of multi step ahead daily runoff forecasting results in different cases for various dataset are listed in table 6 the entire dataset is spilt into 3 parts low flow runoff are smaller than the average normal flow runoff are larger than the average and total flow all the data it can be clearly seen that for various dataset the proposed method is always better than the standard elm method in most cases hence the proposed method can track the dynamic change of various sub datasets chosen from the runoff time series at station c fig 11 illustrates the multi step ahead forecasting results for daily runoff at station c at the testing phase it can be clearly seen that at various forecasting period cases two approaches can effectively simulate the dynamic process of the observed runoff at station c while the proposed method producing larger r values is better than the standard elm method hence the proposed method can achieve satisfying forecasting results in daily runoff prediction at station c 4 6 discussions from the simulations it can be found that the proposed method outperforms the standard elm method in different cases the standard elm model uses the randomly placed input weights and hidden biases to analytically determine the hidden weights which means that all the parameters remain unchanged even though the training process is timesaving the local convergence cannot be avoided and thereby the elm method will produce unsatisfying results with a high probability on the other hand the superior performance of the proposed method is attributed to the dynamic integration of evolutionary algorithm and artificial intelligence using the population based search strategy the csa method randomly creates multiple solutions in the problem space and then uses three well designed operators to iteratively search for the optimal parameter combinations which can effectively enlarge the search space and improve the solution quality in this way the network compactness of the elm model can be guaranteed as a result the proposed method can produce preferable results than the elm method in forecasting the runoff time series of three hydrological stations in china to be mentioned the statistical indicators of both elm and the proposed method at station a are not good enough as that of station b and station c while the performances of two considered forecasting model become worse with the increase of the forecasting period the reasons are that the longer the forecasting period the more the uncertain factors the more difficult the precise modeling the experiments also demonstrate that the performance of the forecasting model is affected by various factors at the same time like input variables model structure and data features owing to the random search strategy the proposed method still faces some defects in practical applications like result oscillation and local convergence in other words the forecasting model may yield different results when the inputs or hidden nodes make slight modifications or random seed generators are used to update the staff s information thus in the future it is of great importance to develop some robust and effective techniques for identifying the potential runoff characteristics carefully determining reasonable input combination and computation parameters meanwhile in the field of hydrology it is commonly accepted to apply hydrologic modeling to estimate and forecast runoff by using more comprehensive information like precipitation and evaporation and physical knowledge of watershed properties like soil moisture infiltration and impervious area of a region lei et al 2018a xu et al 2015 yang et al 2018 in theory such comprehensive information may be more trustable than a pure statistical learning model li et al 2019b liu et al 2018 si et al 2019 along with the rapid development of sensing technology real time monitoring and data acquisition techniques many operational hydrologic models are run with real time available data all the world and many successful applications have also proved the feasibility of information integration in improving the forecasting results chen et al 2020 hossein kazemi et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 however due to the limited time and energy these comprehensive information are not given full consideration in the modeling process thus it is also necessary to testify the feasibility of our method in hydrological prediction tasks considering multi source information at other places 5 conclusion in this study an evolutionary artificial intelligence model is developed for multiple time scale nonstationary hydrological time series prediction where the cooperation search algorithm csa is chosen for the first time as the optimizer for determining the optimal input hidden weights and hidden biases of the conventional extreme learning machine elm model the superior global exploitation and local exploration of the csa method can improve computational parameters of the standard elm method the proposed model is verified by comparative experiments on the runoff time series of three hydrological stations in china the simulations show that the proposed method produces better forecasting results than elm under different cases therefore an effective artificial intelligence tool is provided for multiscale hydrological prediction

4809,this study introduced a clustered polynomial chaos expansion cpce model to reveal random propagation and dynamic sensitivity of uncertainty parameters in hydrologic prediction in the cpce model the random characteristics of the streamflow simulations resulting from parameter uncertainties are characterized through the polynomial chaos expansion pce model based on the probabilistic collocation method at the same time a multivariate discrete non functional relationship between pce coefficients and hydrological model inputs is established based on stepwise cluster analysis therefore compared with traditional pce method the developed cpce model cannot only reflect uncertainty propagation in stochastic hydrological simulation but also have the capability of random forecasting moreover the dynamic sensitivities of model parameters are investigated through the multilevel factorial analyses the developed approach was applied for streamflow forecasting for the ruihe watershed china results showed that with effective quantification for the random characteristics of hydrological processes the cpce model can directly predict runoff series and generate the associated probability distributions at different time periods the dynamic sensitivity analysis indicates that the maximum soil moisture capacity within the catchment plays a key role in the accuracy of the low flow forecasting while the degree of spatial variability in soil moisture capacities has a remarkable impact on the accuracy of the high flow forecasting in the studied watershed keywords stochastic projection polynomial chaos expansion stepwise cluster analysis dynamic sensitivity multilevel factorial analysis 1 introduction the hydrologic system is random in nature in other words its behaviors change with the time consistent with the law of probability as well as the sequential relationship between the occurrences of the system chow and kareliotis 1970 conventional hydrological models e g distributed model conceptual hydrological model do not closely represent the natural stochastic processes which may produce results that cannot match the behaviors of the hydrologic system accurately vinogradov et al 2011 that is the random features of the system can hardly be well reflected in the traditional modelling process lindenschmidt and rokaya 2019 such an overlook of the system randomness would further lead to unreliable hydrological predictions limiting the applicability of hydrological models to many real world water resources issues khaiter and erechtchoukova 2019 lu et al 2019 thus great efforts are desired to reveal these stochastic features and analyze their impacts on resulting predictions in the hydrologic system papalexiou et al 2011 wang et al 2020a previously there were many studies in developing mathematical models for revealing the stochastic features of hydrological processes for instance chow and kareliotis 1970 treated the watershed as the stochastic system and represented the system components including precipitation evapotranspiration storage and runoff through time series models in terms of research progress in mathematical modeling research singh and woolhiser 2002 reported a comprehensive review and provided a short synopsis of used models given the inherent complexity of watershed system recent studies have utilized more advanced stochastic methods such as bayesian analysis kavetski et al 2006 and data assimilation fan et al 2017a for uncertainty quantification of hydrological predictions in particular to alleviate the computational burden encountered in stochastic simulation the surrogate modeling techniques have gained much attention in hydrological modeling and water resource management razavi et al 2012 rui et al 2013 a surrogate model can be considered as a simple surrogate of a complex model which describes the relationship between model parameters and model outputs e g streamflow chowdhury 2019 wang et al 2014 some widely used surrogate model methods entail polynomial chaos expansion pce hu et al 2019 wang et al 2015 artificial neural networks ann yan and minsker 2006 gaussian processes regression gpr marrel et al 2008 support vector machine svm zhang et al 2009 and sparse polynomial chaos spc wang et al 2020b razavi et al 2012 reported a comprehensive review for research progress in surrogate models in the water resources field it has shown that a surrogate modeling when applied correctly is able to perform as well as the original model recently surrogate modeling based uncertainty quantification methods have been proposed in hydrological simulations for example fan et al 2015a investigated the applicability of second and third order pce in quantifying uncertainties of the conceptual hydrologic predictions fan et al 2015b combined the capabilities of the ensemble kalman filter and the probabilistic collocation method to quantify the uncertainty of hydrologic models meng and li 2018 assessed the model uncertainties quantitatively through running pce surrogate model rather than solving governing equations or performing the simulator repetitively many studies reported that the surrogate model based optimization is an efficient way to reduce the computational burden of parameter optimization of a hydrological model gong et al 2016 gou et al 2020 wang et al 2020b however the surrogate models may not represent the studied system accurately when strong nonlinearity irregularity presents in the modeling responses meng and li 2018 moreover these methods have been applied mostly to uncertainty quantification of the modeling processes and the application of stochastic approaches in hydrological predictions has barely begun the applications of stochastic approaches in forecasting processes need more research ghaith and li 2020 xiang et al 2019 besides the coefficients of pce surrogate models are mainly quantified based on observed model responses i e streamflow in previous research works which prevent the pce model from offering hydrological predictions therefore as an extension of previous studies the objective of this study is to develop a clustered polynomial chaos expansion cpce model for revealing the stochastic features in hydrologic predictions the objective entails i characterization of the random features in hydrological process through the pce model based on the probabilistic collocation method ii establishment of relationship between the pce model parameters and the input variables based on stepwise cluster analyses sca iii demonstration of the predictability of the cpce model for the ruihe watershed china and iv investigation of the dynamic sensitivity of model parameters on probabilistic predictions through multilevel factorial analyses 2 development the clustered polynomial chaos expansion cpce model fig 1 presents the specific framework of clustered polynomial chaos expansion cpce model in detail stochastic hydrological analysis is carried out based on the pce and the probabilistic collocation method according to the probability characteristics of the model parameter θ the distribution of parameter θ is firstly transformed into a standard normal distribution by the gaussian anormophosis method and a pce model based on hermite polynomial is established through the probabilistic collocation method a series of regression models are established to obtain the coefficients of pce then a stepwise cluster analysis is adopted to characterize the discrete relationship between the meteorological data e g precipitation temperature wind speed and evapotranspiration and pce coefficients finally based on the established cluster tree and the pce model the probabilistic daily flow can be obtained in the forecasting period the alogical inference graph is presented in fig 1 b to illustrate the procedures for determining pce coefficients in the forecasting period the model output y e g streamflow of the hydrological model e g hymod is determined by forcing data e g precipitation potential evapotranspiration parameter vector θ e g maximum soil moisture capacity and state vector β e g soil moisture storage which can be conceptualized as 1 y f x β θ since the state variable is continuously updated in daily iteration process its specific value depends on the previous climatic e g precipitation tempretural potential evapotranspiration and hydrological inputs chen et al 2011 ghaith et al 2020 wang et al 2018 zhong et al 2016 therefore the state variable can be assumed as a function of the previous forcing data e g multi day cumulative precipitation 2 β t g x t 1 x t 2 x t 3 x t 4 θ where t is the time the pce surrogate model describes the relationship between hydrological model parameter and streamflow i e model output which can be conceptualized as 3 y h a θ where a are coefficients of pce combining eqs 1 2 and 3 when the model parameters are the same the pce coefficients can be expressed as a function of the previous climate 4 f x t 1 x t 2 x t 3 x t 4 θ h a t θ 2 1 polynomial chaos expression pce generally the output of a hydrological model is expressed by a nonlinear function of stochastic inputs i e presents as a set of random variables to express the evolution of uncertainty in dynamical system with random inputs wiener 1938 introduced the theory and application of polynomial chaos pc comprehensively for gaussian random variables the modeling stochastic process can be decomposed by hermite polynomials fan et al 2015a and the general polynomial chaos expansion pce can be expressed as follows 5 y a 0 i 1 1 n a i 1 γ 1 x i 1 i 1 1 n i 2 i 1 a i 1 i 2 γ 2 x i 1 x i 2 i 1 1 n i 2 i 1 i 3 1 i 2 a i 1 i 2 i 3 γ 3 x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 where y is the output of a model γ p x i 1 x i 2 x i p is the p th order polynomial in terms of the multi dimensional random variables and a 0 a i 1 a i 1 i 2 a i 1 i 2 i 3 are the unknown coefficients to be determined take the standard normal variable as an example the hermite polynomial can be expressed as 6 γ p x i 1 x i 2 x i m 1 p e 1 2 x t x m x i 1 x i 2 x i m e 1 2 x t x where x i 1 x i 2 x i p x is the vector form present the standard normal random variables consequently eq 6 is often written in a simple formulation as 7 y a 0 i 1 a i γ i x where ai i 0 1 are the unknown coefficients to be determined the truncated pce model is generally applied based on the dimension of the random variables and the highest order of the hermite polynomials if the p th order hermite polynomials is involved the truncated pce for m dimensional random variables can be expressed as fan et al 2016a 8 y a 0 i 1 n 1 a i γ i x where n m p m p table s2 gives some explicit values of n for given dimensions i e m and degrees i e p of pce for example the second order hermite polynomials with two random variables are 1 ζ 1 ζ 2 ζ 1 2 1 ζ 2 2 1 ζ 1 ζ 2 then according to eq 8 the expansion of truncated pce for a second order two random variables model is presented as follows 9 y a 0 a 1 ζ 1 a 2 ζ 2 a 3 ζ 1 2 1 a 4 ζ 2 2 1 a 5 ζ 1 ζ 2 to determine the unknown coefficients contained in the pce model the probabilistic collocation method pcm was used in previous studies fan et al 2015a the pcm is executed through approaching a model output with a pce in terms of random inputs in other words the basic idea of pcm is to let the pce responses equal to the model simulations at selected collocation points collocation points can be specified by the algorithm proposed by webster et al 1996 in this research in this algorithm the collocation points are selected from combinations of the roots for the higher order hermite polynomial huang et al 2007 moreover the regression based collocation method is employed to obtain the unknown coefficients in pce huang et al 2007 more detail of pcm are supplied in fan et al 2015a 2 2 estimation of pce coefficients through stepwise cluster analysis the pce model can be adopted to replace the original hydrological model for uncertainty quantification and propagation nevertheless it can hardly do the prediction work since no streamflow observations are available to estimate the coefficients of pce in the forecasting period to address this challenge the stepwise cluster analysis sca will be introduced into pce leading to a clustered polynomial chaos expansion cpce model in detail nonlinear relationships between hydrological model inputs e g precipitation potential evapotranspiration and pce coefficients are established through sca in the historical period where streamflow observations are available then the pce coefficients in the forecasting period can be estimated with meteorological data and the trained sca model finally the pce surrogate model can be adopted to generate the probabilistic streamflow predictions more details for this procedure is provided in the supporting materials sca is a multivariate analysis tool which can simulate variations of single or multiple dependent variables ys with a group of independent variables xs huang 1992 according to the theory of multivariate analysis of variance manova the sample sets of independent dependent variables i e xs ys pairs are divided into groups through a series of cutting and merging operations li et al 2015 wang et al 2013 according to huang 1992 the cutting and merging procedures are conducted through the f test based wilks likelihood ratio criterion wilks 1963 for example assume a cluster a m n contains m samples of n dimensional predictors the cluster a m n can be cut into two sub clusters a α n 1 and a β n 2 where α β m based on wilks likelihood ratio criterion the value of wilks statistic λ can be calculated as follows 10 λ w w b where w is the within groups sums of squares and cross products matrices b is the between group sums of squares and cross products 11 w i 1 p a α n 1 a α n 1 t a α n 1 a α n 1 i 1 q a β n 2 a β n 2 t a β n 2 a β n 2 12 b α β α β a α n 1 a β n 2 t a α n 1 a β n 2 a α n 1 and a β n 1 are the sample means of sub clusters a α n 1 and a β n 2 respectively 13 a α n 1 1 α i 1 p a α n 1 14 a β n 2 1 β i 1 p a β n 2 w and w b indicate the determinants of matrices the smaller the λ value is the larger the difference between the sub clusters of a α n 1 and a β n 2 the cutting point is optimal if and only if the value of λ is minimum huang 1992 wilks 1963 on the contrary sub clusters a α n 1 and a β n 2 cannot be cut if the λ value is very large which may be merged into a new cluster by rao s f approximation rao et al 1973 we have r statistic as following 15 r 1 λ 1 s λ 1 s zs p k 1 2 1 p k 1 where k is the number of groups and p is the number of predictors z and s can be calculated as following 16 z m 1 p k 2 17 s p 2 k 1 2 4 p 2 k 1 2 5 here k 2 two sub clusters a α n 1 and a β n 2 and the r statistic will be an exact f variate 18 f p m p 1 1 λ λ m p 1 p therefore the process of cutting and merging clusters is conducted through a number of f tests martin and maes 1979 rao et al 1973 var 1998 in other words the f test is used to identify whether sub clusters a α n 1 and a β n 2 are significantly different cluster a p n can be cut into two sub clusters a α n 1 and a β n 2 if f p m p 1 is larger than f p c u t t i n g the p cutting is the significance level of cutting process on the other hand the f test could also be used to identify whether any two sub clusters are similar between each other for two clusters a α n i and a β n j with samples of α and β if f p α β p 1 is smaller than f p m e r g i n g the two clusters can be merged into a new cluster the p merging is the significance level of merging process as shown in fig 2 the main procedures to estimate the pce coefficients through sca are as follows 1 select forcing data of the hydrological model i e xs and pce coefficients ys prepare a training matrix and set the significant level p default 0 05 2 rank sample sets of xs ys pairs according to the value of x j the j th variable 3 cut the matrix as two groups from row t randomly 4 estimate the wilks statistic λ value of the two groups 5 repeat steps 2 4 for all j and t to find the minimum λ 6 cut operation is performed if f p α β p 1 is larger than f p m e r g i n g 7 cut loops until all hypotheses of further cut are rejected 8 estimate wilks statistic λ value of ys difference of any two child clusters 9 merge the two clusters into one if f p α β p 1 is smaller than f p m e r g i n g 10 repeat steps 8 9 for all clusters 11 merging loops until all hypotheses of further merge are rejected 12 repeat cut merge to the end when hypotheses of further cut or merge are rejected 13 generate the cluster tree of the training samples 14 the pce coefficients are predicted according to the generated cluster tree when new forcing data are available here a simple example has been provided to show the structural of sca model in the supporting material more detailed description of the sca method can be accessible from relevant studies by cheng et al 2016 fan et al 2016b huang 1992 huang et al 2006 2 3 multilevel factorial analysis multilevel factorial analysis mfa is one of powerful tools to quantify the effects of several independent variables as well as their interactions on a dependent variable duan et al 2020 in order to use the same terminology to present mfa approach a generalized three variable model is defined as ψ f a b c a b c represent the independent variables e g inputs parameters or model structure and ψ represents the response e g the model performances assume there are a b c elements or levels for variables a b and c respectively according to the analysis of variance anova theory the total sum of the squares sst

the developed cpce model is applied to address the stochastic hydrological predictions for the ruihe river which is one of the major tributaries of jinghe river ruihe river is located in the middle of the loess plateau in china as shown in fig 3 the catchment area of the ruihe river is 1670 km2 with a mainstream length of 119 km and the elevation varying from 1200 to 2645 m the annual mean temperature is 8 8 and the annual mean precipitation is 562 mm with approximate 60 70 of precipitation occurs between june and september the ruihe river plays a vital role in reducing soil erosion alleviating water loss and protecting the ecosystem of the middle reach of the jinghe river hydrological modeling in this watershed would benefit the description of hydrological processes and water resources management in this study the climatic and hydrological data of the ruihe river watershed were collected from different sources the areal daily precipitation p data were interpolated from site precipitation measurements distributed over the catchment and the areal potential daily evapotranspiration e were interpolated from the national meteorological stations the streamflow observations of the ruihe river from 1981 to 1987 were obtained from yuanjiaan hydrometric station as shown in fig 3 b the time series of streamflow precipitation and potential evapotranspiration of ruihe river basin are presented in fig 3 c it can be found that the climatic and hydrological data remained stable during the study period here it is assumed that the relationship between climate conditions and streamflow has not changed significantly in this short term seven years thus the historically normal years from 1981 to 1984 will be used as the calibration period in this study the input topography map was collected to derive the flow direction and hydrographic network dem 1 250 000 is obtained from data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn 3 2 hymod in this study rainfall runoff simulation is undertaken by using a simple conceptual model hymod which is proposed by moore 1985 based on the probability distribution of soil moisture water storage dynamics are built to represent the mass balance principles among inflow from rainfall losses to evaporation drainage to groundwater and production of direct runoff in brief assume that a catchment consists of infinite points and each of them can be defined by a soil moisture capacity soil moisture capacities vary within the catchment as a result of variability in soil texture and depth therefore to describe the soil moisture variability of the whole catchment a cumulative distribution function can be presented as follows 25 f c 1 1 c c max b exp 0 c c max where c is soil moisture capacity cmax is the maximum storage capacity and the exponent bexp is the degree of spatial variability of storage capacity over the basin a schematic representation of hymod is shown in fig 4 where alpha is introduced to represent how much of the subsurface runoff is routed over the fast rq and slow rs pathways the descriptions of the five parameters and their prior fluctuating ranges are shown in table1 the five parameters of hymod including cmax bexp alpha rs and rq can be obtained through a model calibration process in this study the prior range of the five parameters are obtained from previous literatures fan et al 2017a 2017b 2015b these prior distributions are assumed spread over a wide range to represent vague prior knowledge input data including daily precipitation p mm d and daily potential evapotranspiration e mm d are used to drive hymod for the sake of brevity we recommend to access the studies moore 1985 2007 for a comprehensive

between the cdf of forecasts and observations fan et al 2017a hersbach 2000 murphy and winkler 1987 28 crps f sim x f obs x 2 d x where f sim and f obs are cdfs for predicted streamflow and observed streamflow respectively a small crps value indicates a better model performance with the value of zero suggesting a perfect accuracy for model prediction 4 influence of the parameter distribution on surrogate system to evaluate the uncertainty of hymod predictions the second order pce q a 0 a 1 c ma x a 2 b ex p a 3 c max 2 1 a 4 b exp 2 1 a 5 c ma x b ex p is built with the historical data and then applied to quantify the uncertainty of the hymod predictions as presented in table s3 nine collocation points are obtained to establish the linear regression equations and generate the values of the six unknown coefficients in the second order pce fan et al 2015a in the prediction period 50 values of cmax and bexp are randomly generated through the standard gaussian distribution which are transformed from cmax and bexp thus total 2 500 pce simulation values would be generated for each time point with the generated cmax and bexp as well as pce coefficients the mean and variance values of cpce model would be obtained with the 2500 realizations to evaluate pce s reliability for uncertainty quantification the monte carlo mc simulation is applied as the benchmark results similarly 50 values of cmax and bexp are randomly generated from their distribution randomly and total 2500 combinations of parameter values are applied to run hymod simulations for mc analysis and again the mean and varianance values of mc model would be obtained in this study the prior distributions for the parameters i e cmax and bexp of hymod are assumed to uniformly spread over predefined ranges to represent vague prior knowledge as presented in table 1 posterior distributions of cmax and bexp are obtained by metropolis hastings mh algorithm through the calibration of hymod over the period of 1981 1984 after the calibration process the parameters posterior distributions are obtained as shown in fig 5 the detail of mh and the calibration process are provided in the supporting material to analyze the influence of the parameter distributions on the surrogate system pce surrogate model is established based on the prior and posterior distributions of the parameters in hymod respectively the comparison for the mean and variance values of daily streamflow obtained through the 2 order pce and mc simulation methods are presented in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 a and b with the parameter prior distribution the mean streamflow obtained by pce surrogate model are highly identical with the mc simulation results by linearly fitting the mean values of mc simulation and pce simulation the coefficient of determination r 2 0 999 in fig 6 c and d the variances of the streamflow obtained through mc and pce simulations are compared with the corresponding coefficient of determination r 2 0 995 these indicate that the pce results would fit well with the mc simulation results in both means and variances however as can be seen from fig s2 neither the mc simulation nor the pce model would fit well with the observed streamflows as they are established based on the parameter prior distributions due to the wide prior distributions of parameters mc simulations cannot reflect the true relationship between rainfall and runoff and the simulation results cannot match the actual runoff observations not surprisingly the pce simulation where the collocation points are selected in the parameter prior spaces also cannot match the actual runoff observations in comparison as shown in fig 7 the pce surrogate model based on the posterior distributions of parameters cannot only better match the mc simulations in both means and variances but also fit well with the runoff observations i e nse 0 84 in other words the pce surrogate model can generally replace the hydrologic model i e hymod with posterior parameter distributions to reflect the temporal variations for the streamflow combining the prior distribution and actual observations the posterior distributions of parameters are obtained based on mh algorithm the pce surrogate model with the collocation points selected from parameter posterior distribution spaces can well match the observed runoff these indicate that the mean values obtained through pce surrogate model are highly identical with the mc simulation results no matter whether they are established based on the parameters prior or posterior distributions in other words the pce surrogate model can generally replace the hydrologic model i e hymod however only the pce surrogate model and mc simulation based on parameters posterior distributions can reflect the temporal variations for streamflow accurately therefore the mh method would be employed to approximate the posterior probabilities of model parameters and improve the forecasting accuracy based on the observed measurements 5 projection of cpce model for the historical period the unknown coefficients in pce can be assessed through regression based pcm method with model input e g precipitation and evapotranspiration and output e g streamflow fan et al 2015a however for the forecasting period these coefficients are unavailable due to the lack of observed streamflow ghaith and li 2020 therefore before exploring pce s capability to forecast streamflow stochastically the potential predictors of pce coefficients need to be identified as shown in fig 1 b since the state variable i e x loss is continuously updated its specific value depends on the previous climatic and hydrological relationship xie et al 2019 hence it can be assumed that the state variable is a function of the previous forcing data for convenience the pce coefficients are firstly correlated with various climatic variables including multi day cumulative precipitation denoted as p sump3 sump5 sump7 sump10 sump15 sump20 sump30 sump60 and sump90 and multi day cumulative potential evapotranspiration denoted as e sume3 sume5 sume7 sume10 sume15 sume20 sume30 sume60 and sume90 as presented in fig 8 there are significant correlations among the pce coefficients and climate variables for example except for a5 all pce coefficients have strong correlations with climate variables especially the cumulative precipitation the biggest correlation 0 853 exists between a2 and sump5 i e the cumulative 5 day rainfall therefore a reasonable guess is that the coefficents of the pce prediction model can be obtained based on climate factors the pce coefficients and climate data during 1981 1984 are used to traing sca model and the obtained sca tree is shown in fig s3 then the pce coefficients and climate data in 1984 are used to test the obtained sca model as shown in fig 9 most of the pce coefficients e g a0 a2 a4 predicted by the sca model can fit their theoretical values as mentioned in section 3 2 a second order two random variables pce is built for hymod as q a 0 a 1 c ma x a 2 b ex p a 3 c max 2 1 a 4 b exp 2 1 a 5 c ma x b ex p here c ma x and b ex p are standard gaussian variables which are transformed from the distributions of cmax and bexp the variability in pce coefficients implies the different main and or interactive effects of these parameters on model outputs i e streamflow for instance the high predictability of a2 nse 0 80 indicates that the model performance is more sensitive to bexp as shown in fig 12 at the same time it is difficult to predict a5 accurately nse 0 14 which means that the interaction between cmax and bexp has little effect on the model results this also corresponds to the result of fig 12 which shows that the interactive effects of cmax and bexp in cpce model are lower than 0 004 however the relationship between pce coefficients and climate variables is unknown and has been rarely studied and not quantified in previous studies ghaith and li 2020 this study attempts to construct and quantify this relationship through the sca approach for the first time the advantage of sca is that it can quantify nonlinear non functional relationships huang 1992 as shown in fig s3 the unknown relationships between pce coefficients and climatic conditions can be revealed through the loop of cutting and merging which is described through a clustering tree with this trained tree sca model is expected to predict the unknown coefficients in pce for the forecasting period with obtained climatic conditions the accuracy of pce coefficient predictions by sca reflects the strength of these relationships using sca to analyze the relationship between pce coefficients and climate variables is one of the advantages of cpce method the mean and variance values of streamflow obtained by mc and cpce during the validation period are presented in fig 10 it is found that the predicted streamflows obtained by cpce can fit very well with the results from mc when compared with observed streamflows mc and cpce performed well for low streamflow while produced underestimations for the peak streamflows this may be due to the peak clipping phenomenon of sca method for the validation period nse values of mc and cpce are 0 79 and 0 57 fig 11 presents the ensembles of the forecasted streamflow obtatined by mc and cpce during the validation period the distributions show that the probability distributions generated by cpce are very similar with those obtained by mc for the validation period crps values of mc and cpce are 1 9 and 2 9 respectively similar to deterministic predictions cpce is likely to provide probabilistic forecasts reliably for low streamflow while generate underestimations for the peak streamflows to make it clear the histograms of streamflow obtained by mc and cpce on several selected days are presented in fig s4 the different performances of the cpce reflect the inconsistency in the process of uncertainty transmission in cpce model the pce coefficients are obtained through the sca tree where the predicted value is the average of the samples in each leaf node for low runoff or normal runoff with a large number of samples the samples of each leaf node are concentrated and the average value can reflect the predicted value well however for flood peak with small sample size the average value of leaf node may underestimate the predicted value and the uncertainty of prediction is amplified this resaerch is the first attempt to establish the relationship between pce coefficients and climatic conditions through sca model and the traditional sca method is chosen here in the following research the authors will consider using modified sca fan et al 2016b to improve the prediction ability of cpce further one major issue of the proposed cpce model is its computation demand since training a sca tree would require aconsiderablecomputer time for repeating cut merge as presented in table 2 if the above cpce procedures i e include training and prediction are applied for hymod the computation demand would be about 481 22 and 1 54 s for training and prediction and these would be 65 88 and 65 35 s for mc the results show that cpce needs more computation time than mc for this simple five parameter hymod in cpce model sca training does not need to be repeated and random predictions can be quickly obtained once the sca model is built the main calculation requirements of cpce for prediction are not affected by the complexity of the hydrological model while mc needs to run the hydrological model repeatedly and its calculation time increases rapidly as the complexity of the model increases thus the acceptable computational requirements and reliable performances make cpce be an appealing hydrological tool in revealing interactive rainfall runoff relationships ghaith and li 2020 compared with traditional pce method the developed cpce model cannot only reflect uncertainty propagation in stochastic hydrological simulation but also have the capability of random forecasting it has reported that the performance of sca is sensitive to the clustering significance i e p value which determines the threshold value for cutting and merging operations qin et al 2008 sun et al 2018 therefore to explore the sensitivity of cpce on clustering significance i e p value three clustering significance values i e p 0 01 0 05 and 0 10 are examined it is found that the generated pce coefficients are insensitive with p values fig s5 the cpce has the best prediction skill when p value equals to 0 05 fig s5 6 dynamic sensitivity since the cpce variables i e cmax and bexp have different contributions to the variability of the model outputs a multilevel factorial analysis is introduced to quantify their main and interactive effects on uncertainty propagation fan et al 2020 as an illustration the functional approximation of a stochastic system with two dimension second order hermite polynomials can be presented as q a 0 a 1 c ma x a 2 b ex p a 3 c max 2 1 a 4 b exp 2 1 a 5 c ma x b ex p here c ma x and b ex p are standard gaussian variables which are transformed from cmax and bexp thus a 52 factorial experiment can be conducted to explore the sensitivities of ζ 1 cmax and ζ 2 bexp in cpce model for each day fig 12 shows the dynamic sensitivities of the parameters in the cpce model on the streamflow among the 2553 daily streamflows 70 2 of them have a main effect of cmax higher than 0 8 in comparison only 7 6 of daily streamflows have a main effect of bexp higher than 0 5 as shown in fig 12 cmax mainly has high main effects for low flows and bexp would have high main effects for high flows in hymod cmax indicates the maximum soil moisture capacity within the catchment and bexp presents the degree of spatial variability in soil moisture capacities the conceptual hydrological model hymod adopts the saturation excess runoff generation mechanism moore 1985 saturation excess overland flow is generated when the soil becomes saturated to the extent that additional precipitation cannot infiltrate runoff production at a point in the catchment is controlled by the maximum soil moisture capacity and precipitation li and ishidaira 2012 which is more likely to occur during small precipitation period thus it can be concluded that the maximum soil moisture capacity within the catchment has the strongest main effect which plays a key role in the forecasting streamflow especially for low flows any change in the value of cmax would cause a considerable variation in the accuracy of the low flow forecasting while for the high streamflow the spatial variability in soil moisture capacities has a remarkable impact on the accuracy of hydrological forecasting this can be explained by that saturation excess flow generation mechanism may has the limited contribution to the total runoff during intensive storm events it has been reported that the extreme rainfall event is the dominant trigger of annual maximum runoff events in the yellow river basin ran et al 2020 extreme rainfall generally lasts for a short time under this condition the spatial variability of river basins may have certain influence on the time and magnitude of runoff generation 7 conclusions based on the uncertainty evolution and sensitivity analysis of the hydrological process this study introduced a clustered polynomial chaos expansion cpce model for stochastic hydrological prediction with effectively reflecting the stochastic characteristics of hydrological processes cpce model can directly predict future runoff sequences and generate probability distributions of all runoff values the cpce model characterizes the random characteristics of state variables in the hydrological model through a polynomial chaotic expansion pce model based on the probabilistic collocation method at the same time the multivariate discrete non functional relationship between pce coefficients and hydrological model inputs i e precipitation and potential evapotranspiration is established based on stepwise cluster analysis the cpce model integrates the pce and sca approaches to generate the probabilistic predictions for streamflow finally the dynamic parameters sensitivities for streamflow forecasting are assessed with the help of multilevel factorial analyses the main conclusions are as follows 1 the pce surrogate model based on the posterior distributions of parameters can generally replace the hydrologic model i e hymod to reflect the temporal variations for the streamflow 2 the pce coefficients can be estimated through sca model through revealing the complicated multivariate nonlinear relation between the forcing data of hydrological model and the coefficients of the pce model 3 the proposed cpce model is likely to provide reliable probabilistic predictions which is an appealing modelling tool in revealing interactive rainfall runoff relationships 4 dynamic sensitivity analysis indicates that the maximum soil moisture capacity within the catchment plays a key role in the accuracy of the low flow forecasting while the degree of spatial variability in soil moisture capacities has a remarkable impact on the accuracy of the high flow forecasting the different performances of the cpce model also reflect the inconsistency in the process of uncertainty transmission the main innovation of this research is the development of a clustered polynomial chaos expansion cpce model which overcomes the shortcoming of the traditional pce models in doing prediction work the main finding is that the maximum soil moisture capacity within catchment plays a key role in the accuracy of the low flow forecasting while the degree of spatial variability in soil moisture capacities has a remarkable impact on the accuracy of the high flow forecasting the results conclude that the clustered polynomial chaos expansion cpce model can provide accurate predictions with less computational burden moreover some extensions improvements or applications are still needed to be conducted in future studies for instance the relationship between precipitation and runoff are assumed to be consistent during a short term seven years in this study thus the trained sca model is not constantly updated here however the hydrological model also needs to consider the non stationarity of streamflow for the long term prediction thus in the following research the authors will consider updating the sca model constantly during the forecasting period the combination of dynamic sca with pce model is expected to update the relationship between pce coefficient and climate conditions in real time so as to maintain good prediction accuracy of cpce model for long term streamflow secondly a high dimensional high order expansion model is not involved in this study the total number of pce terms increases rapidly with the dimensionality and the degree of the pce for instance there are 56 pce terms and coefficients for one five dimension three order pce surrogate model it is difficult to accurately predict 56 expansion coefficients at the same time which may lead to inaccurate predictions one potential solution is to remove the unimportant pce items based on sensitivity analysis as reported by wang et al 2015 therefore in the following work we will also consider the combination of stepwise cluster analyses and reduced pce models to solve the projection problem of a high dimensional high order expansion model declaration of competing interest the

4809,this study introduced a clustered polynomial chaos expansion cpce model to reveal random propagation and dynamic sensitivity of uncertainty parameters in hydrologic prediction in the cpce model the random characteristics of the streamflow simulations resulting from parameter uncertainties are characterized through the polynomial chaos expansion pce model based on the probabilistic collocation method at the same time a multivariate discrete non functional relationship between pce coefficients and hydrological model inputs is established based on stepwise cluster analysis therefore compared with traditional pce method the developed cpce model cannot only reflect uncertainty propagation in stochastic hydrological simulation but also have the capability of random forecasting moreover the dynamic sensitivities of model parameters are investigated through the multilevel factorial analyses the developed approach was applied for streamflow forecasting for the ruihe watershed china results showed that with effective quantification for the random characteristics of hydrological processes the cpce model can directly predict runoff series and generate the associated probability distributions at different time periods the dynamic sensitivity analysis indicates that the maximum soil moisture capacity within the catchment plays a key role in the accuracy of the low flow forecasting while the degree of spatial variability in soil moisture capacities has a remarkable impact on the accuracy of the high flow forecasting in the studied watershed keywords stochastic projection polynomial chaos expansion stepwise cluster analysis dynamic sensitivity multilevel factorial analysis 1 introduction the hydrologic system is random in nature in other words its behaviors change with the time consistent with the law of probability as well as the sequential relationship between the occurrences of the system chow and kareliotis 1970 conventional hydrological models e g distributed model conceptual hydrological model do not closely represent the natural stochastic processes which may produce results that cannot match the behaviors of the hydrologic system accurately vinogradov et al 2011 that is the random features of the system can hardly be well reflected in the traditional modelling process lindenschmidt and rokaya 2019 such an overlook of the system randomness would further lead to unreliable hydrological predictions limiting the applicability of hydrological models to many real world water resources issues khaiter and erechtchoukova 2019 lu et al 2019 thus great efforts are desired to reveal these stochastic features and analyze their impacts on resulting predictions in the hydrologic system papalexiou et al 2011 wang et al 2020a previously there were many studies in developing mathematical models for revealing the stochastic features of hydrological processes for instance chow and kareliotis 1970 treated the watershed as the stochastic system and represented the system components including precipitation evapotranspiration storage and runoff through time series models in terms of research progress in mathematical modeling research singh and woolhiser 2002 reported a comprehensive review and provided a short synopsis of used models given the inherent complexity of watershed system recent studies have utilized more advanced stochastic methods such as bayesian analysis kavetski et al 2006 and data assimilation fan et al 2017a for uncertainty quantification of hydrological predictions in particular to alleviate the computational burden encountered in stochastic simulation the surrogate modeling techniques have gained much attention in hydrological modeling and water resource management razavi et al 2012 rui et al 2013 a surrogate model can be considered as a simple surrogate of a complex model which describes the relationship between model parameters and model outputs e g streamflow chowdhury 2019 wang et al 2014 some widely used surrogate model methods entail polynomial chaos expansion pce hu et al 2019 wang et al 2015 artificial neural networks ann yan and minsker 2006 gaussian processes regression gpr marrel et al 2008 support vector machine svm zhang et al 2009 and sparse polynomial chaos spc wang et al 2020b razavi et al 2012 reported a comprehensive review for research progress in surrogate models in the water resources field it has shown that a surrogate modeling when applied correctly is able to perform as well as the original model recently surrogate modeling based uncertainty quantification methods have been proposed in hydrological simulations for example fan et al 2015a investigated the applicability of second and third order pce in quantifying uncertainties of the conceptual hydrologic predictions fan et al 2015b combined the capabilities of the ensemble kalman filter and the probabilistic collocation method to quantify the uncertainty of hydrologic models meng and li 2018 assessed the model uncertainties quantitatively through running pce surrogate model rather than solving governing equations or performing the simulator repetitively many studies reported that the surrogate model based optimization is an efficient way to reduce the computational burden of parameter optimization of a hydrological model gong et al 2016 gou et al 2020 wang et al 2020b however the surrogate models may not represent the studied system accurately when strong nonlinearity irregularity presents in the modeling responses meng and li 2018 moreover these methods have been applied mostly to uncertainty quantification of the modeling processes and the application of stochastic approaches in hydrological predictions has barely begun the applications of stochastic approaches in forecasting processes need more research ghaith and li 2020 xiang et al 2019 besides the coefficients of pce surrogate models are mainly quantified based on observed model responses i e streamflow in previous research works which prevent the pce model from offering hydrological predictions therefore as an extension of previous studies the objective of this study is to develop a clustered polynomial chaos expansion cpce model for revealing the stochastic features in hydrologic predictions the objective entails i characterization of the random features in hydrological process through the pce model based on the probabilistic collocation method ii establishment of relationship between the pce model parameters and the input variables based on stepwise cluster analyses sca iii demonstration of the predictability of the cpce model for the ruihe watershed china and iv investigation of the dynamic sensitivity of model parameters on probabilistic predictions through multilevel factorial analyses 2 development the clustered polynomial chaos expansion cpce model fig 1 presents the specific framework of clustered polynomial chaos expansion cpce model in detail stochastic hydrological analysis is carried out based on the pce and the probabilistic collocation method according to the probability characteristics of the model parameter θ the distribution of parameter θ is firstly transformed into a standard normal distribution by the gaussian anormophosis method and a pce model based on hermite polynomial is established through the probabilistic collocation method a series of regression models are established to obtain the coefficients of pce then a stepwise cluster analysis is adopted to characterize the discrete relationship between the meteorological data e g precipitation temperature wind speed and evapotranspiration and pce coefficients finally based on the established cluster tree and the pce model the probabilistic daily flow can be obtained in the forecasting period the alogical inference graph is presented in fig 1 b to illustrate the procedures for determining pce coefficients in the forecasting period the model output y e g streamflow of the hydrological model e g hymod is determined by forcing data e g precipitation potential evapotranspiration parameter vector θ e g maximum soil moisture capacity and

previous climatic e g precipitation tempretural potential evapotranspiration and hydrological inputs chen et al 2011 ghaith et al 2020 wang et al 2018 zhong et al 2016 therefore the state variable can

between hydrological model parameter and streamflow i e model output which can be conceptualized as 3 y h a θ where a are coefficients of pce combining eqs 1 2 and 3 when the model parameters are the same the pce coefficients can be expressed as a function of the previous climate 4 f x t 1 x t 2 x t 3 x t 4 θ h a t θ 2 1 polynomial chaos expression pce generally the output of a hydrological model is expressed by a nonlinear function of stochastic inputs i e presents as a set of random variables to express the evolution of uncertainty in dynamical system with random inputs wiener 1938 introduced the theory and application of polynomial chaos pc comprehensively for gaussian random variables the modeling stochastic process can be decomposed by hermite polynomials fan et al 2015a and the general polynomial chaos expansion pce can be expressed as follows 5 y a 0 i 1 1 n a i 1 γ 1 x i 1 i 1 1 n i 2 i 1 a i 1 i 2 γ 2 x i 1 x i 2 i 1 1 n i 2 i 1 i 3 1 i 2 a i 1 i 2 i 3 γ 3 x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 where y is the output of a model γ p x i 1 x i 2 x i p is the p th order polynomial in terms of the multi dimensional random variables and a 0 a i 1 a i 1 i 2 a i 1 i 2 i 3 are the unknown coefficients to be determined take the standard normal variable as an example the hermite polynomial can be expressed as 6 γ p x i 1 x i 2 x i m 1 p e 1 2 x t x m x i 1 x i 2 x i m e 1 2 x t x where x i 1 x i 2 x i p x is the vector form present the standard normal random variables consequently eq 6 is often written in a simple formulation as 7 y a 0 i 1 a i γ i x where ai i 0 1 are the unknown coefficients to be determined the truncated pce model is generally applied based on the dimension of the random variables and the highest order of the hermite polynomials if the p th order hermite polynomials is involved the truncated pce for m dimensional random variables can be expressed as fan et al 2016a 8 y a 0 i 1 n 1 a i γ i x where n m p m p table s2 gives some explicit values of n for given dimensions i e m and degrees i e p of pce for example the second order hermite polynomials with two random variables are 1 ζ 1 ζ 2 ζ 1 2 1 ζ 2 2 1 ζ 1 ζ 2 then according to eq 8 the expansion of truncated pce for a second order two random variables model is presented as follows 9 y a 0 a 1 ζ 1 a 2 ζ 2 a 3 ζ 1 2 1 a 4 ζ 2 2 1 a 5 ζ 1 ζ 2 to determine the unknown coefficients contained in the pce model the probabilistic collocation method pcm was used in previous studies fan et al 2015a the pcm is executed through approaching a model output with a pce in terms of random inputs in other words the basic idea of pcm is to let the pce responses equal to the model simulations at selected collocation points collocation points can be specified by the algorithm proposed by webster et al 1996 in this research in this algorithm the collocation points are selected from combinations of the roots for the higher order hermite polynomial huang et al 2007 moreover the regression based collocation method is employed to obtain the unknown coefficients in pce huang et al 2007 more detail of pcm are supplied in fan et al 2015a 2 2 estimation of pce coefficients through stepwise cluster analysis the pce model can be adopted to replace the original hydrological model for uncertainty quantification and propagation nevertheless it can hardly do the prediction work since no streamflow observations are available to estimate the coefficients of pce in the forecasting period to address this challenge the stepwise cluster analysis sca will be introduced into pce leading to a clustered polynomial chaos expansion cpce model in detail nonlinear relationships between hydrological model inputs e g precipitation potential evapotranspiration and pce coefficients are established through sca in the historical period where streamflow observations are available then the pce coefficients in the forecasting period can be estimated with meteorological data and the trained sca model finally the pce surrogate model can be adopted to generate the probabilistic streamflow predictions more details for this procedure is provided in the supporting materials sca is a multivariate analysis tool which can simulate variations of single or multiple dependent variables ys with a group of independent variables xs huang 1992 according to the theory of multivariate analysis of variance manova the sample sets of independent dependent variables i e xs ys pairs are divided into groups through a series of cutting and merging operations li et al 2015 wang et al 2013 according to huang 1992 the cutting and merging procedures are conducted through the f test based wilks likelihood ratio criterion wilks 1963 for example assume a cluster a m n contains m samples of n dimensional predictors the cluster a m n can be cut into two sub clusters a α n 1 and a β n 2 where α β m based on wilks likelihood ratio criterion the value of wilks statistic λ can be calculated as follows 10 λ w w b where w is the within groups sums of squares and cross products matrices b is the between group sums of squares and cross products 11 w i 1 p a α n 1 a α n 1 t a α n 1 a α n 1 i 1 q a β n 2 a β n 2 t a β n 2 a β n 2 12 b α β α β a α n 1 a β n 2 t a α n 1 a β n 2 a α n 1 and a β n 1 are the sample means of sub clusters a α n 1 and a β n 2 respectively 13 a α n 1 1 α i 1 p a α n 1 14 a β n 2 1 β i 1 p a β n 2 w and w b indicate the determinants of matrices the smaller the λ value is the larger the difference between the sub clusters of a α n 1 and a β n 2 the cutting point is optimal if and only if the value of λ is minimum huang 1992 wilks 1963 on the contrary sub clusters a α n 1 and a β n 2 cannot be cut if the λ value is very large which may be merged into a new cluster by rao s f approximation rao et al 1973 we have r statistic as following 15 r 1 λ 1 s λ 1 s zs p k 1 2 1 p k 1 where k is the number of groups and p is the number of predictors z and s can be calculated as following 16 z m 1 p k 2 17 s p 2 k 1 2 4 p 2 k 1 2 5 here k 2 two sub clusters a α n 1 and a β n 2 and the r statistic will be an exact f variate 18 f p m p 1 1 λ λ m p 1 p therefore the process of cutting and merging clusters is conducted through a number of f tests martin and maes 1979 rao et al 1973 var 1998 in other words the f test is used to identify whether sub clusters a α n 1 and a β n 2 are significantly different cluster a p n can be cut into two sub clusters a α n 1 and a β n 2 if f p m p 1 is larger than f p c u t t i n g the p cutting is the significance level of cutting process on the other hand the f test could also be used to identify whether any two sub clusters are similar between each other for two clusters a α n i and a β n j with samples of α and β if f p α β p 1 is smaller than f p m e r g i n g the two clusters can be merged into a new cluster the p merging is the significance level of merging process as shown in fig 2 the main procedures to estimate the pce coefficients through sca are as follows 1 select forcing data of the hydrological model i e xs and pce coefficients ys prepare a training matrix and set the significant level p default 0 05 2 rank sample sets of xs ys pairs according to the value of x j the j th variable 3 cut the matrix as two groups from row t randomly 4 estimate the wilks statistic λ value of the two groups 5 repeat steps 2 4 for all j and t to find the minimum λ 6 cut operation is performed if f p α β p 1 is larger than f p m e r g i n g 7 cut loops until all hypotheses of further cut are rejected 8 estimate wilks statistic λ value of ys difference of any two child clusters 9 merge the two clusters into one if f p α β p 1 is smaller than f p m e r g i n g 10 repeat steps 8 9 for all clusters 11 merging loops until all hypotheses of further merge are rejected 12 repeat cut merge to the end when hypotheses of further cut or merge are rejected 13 generate the cluster tree of the training samples 14 the pce coefficients are

analysis mfa is one of powerful tools to quantify the effects of several independent variables as well as their interactions on a dependent variable duan et al 2020 in order to use the same terminology to present mfa approach a generalized three variable model is defined as ψ f a b c a b c represent the independent variables e g inputs parameters or model structure and ψ represents the response e g the model performances assume there are a b c elements or levels for variables a b and c respectively according to the analysis of variance anova theory the total sum of the squares sst can be divided into the sum of squares due to individual variable and their interactions as follows saltelli et al 2010 2008 19 sst s s a s s b s s c s s ab s s ac s s bc s s abc where s s a s s b s s

the developed cpce model is applied to address the stochastic hydrological predictions for the ruihe river which is one of the major tributaries of jinghe river ruihe river is located in the middle of the loess plateau in china as shown in fig 3 the catchment area of the ruihe river is 1670 km2 with a mainstream length of 119 km and the elevation varying from 1200 to 2645 m the annual mean temperature is 8 8 and the annual mean precipitation is 562 mm with approximate 60 70 of precipitation occurs between june and september the ruihe river plays a vital role in reducing soil erosion alleviating water loss and protecting the ecosystem of the middle reach of the jinghe river hydrological modeling in this watershed would benefit the description of hydrological processes and water resources management in this study the climatic and hydrological data of the ruihe river watershed were collected from different sources the areal daily precipitation p data were interpolated from site precipitation measurements distributed over the catchment and the areal potential daily evapotranspiration e were interpolated from the national meteorological stations the streamflow observations of the ruihe river from 1981 to 1987 were obtained from yuanjiaan hydrometric station as shown in fig 3 b the time series of streamflow precipitation and potential evapotranspiration of ruihe river basin are presented in fig 3 c it can be found that the climatic and hydrological data remained stable during the study period here it is assumed that the relationship between climate conditions and streamflow has not changed significantly in this short term seven years thus the historically normal years from 1981 to 1984 will be used as the calibration period in this study the input topography map was collected to derive the flow direction and hydrographic network dem 1 250 000 is obtained from data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn 3 2 hymod in this study rainfall runoff simulation is undertaken by using a simple conceptual model hymod which is proposed by moore 1985 based on the probability distribution of soil moisture water storage dynamics are built to represent the mass balance principles among inflow from rainfall losses to evaporation drainage to groundwater and production of direct runoff in brief assume that a catchment consists of infinite points and each of them can be defined by a soil moisture capacity soil moisture capacities vary within the catchment as a result of variability in soil texture and depth therefore to describe the soil moisture variability of the whole catchment a cumulative distribution function can be presented as follows 25 f c 1 1 c c max b exp 0 c c max where c is soil moisture capacity cmax is the maximum storage capacity and the exponent bexp is the degree of spatial variability of storage capacity over the basin a schematic representation of hymod is shown in fig 4 where alpha is introduced to represent how much of the subsurface runoff is routed over the fast rq and slow rs pathways the descriptions of the five parameters and their prior fluctuating ranges are shown in table1 the five parameters of hymod including cmax bexp alpha rs and rq can be obtained through a model calibration process in this study the prior range of the five parameters are obtained from previous literatures fan et al 2017a 2017b 2015b these prior distributions are assumed spread over a wide range to represent vague prior knowledge input data including daily precipitation p mm d and daily potential evapotranspiration e mm d are used to drive hymod for the sake of brevity we recommend to access the studies moore 1985 2007 for a comprehensive description of this model for hymod a second order two random variables pce will be built as 26 q a 0 a 1 c ma x a 2 b ex p a 3 c max 2 1 a 4 b exp 2 1 a 5 c ma x b ex p here q presents the streamflow c ma x and b ex p are standard gaussian variables which are transformed from cmax and bexp in this study nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is used to evaluate the deterministic prediction of the hydrological modeling 27 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 where n is the total number of observations or predictions q obs i is the observed stream q sim i is the estimated streamflow q obs is the mean of all observations the probabilistic prediction is evaluated by continuous ranked probability score crps which is defined as the integrated squared difference between the cdf of forecasts and observations fan et al 2017a hersbach 2000 murphy and winkler 1987 28 crps f sim x f obs x 2 d x where f sim and f obs are cdfs for predicted streamflow and observed streamflow respectively a small crps value indicates a better model performance with the value of zero suggesting a perfect accuracy for model prediction 4 influence of the parameter distribution on surrogate system to evaluate the uncertainty of hymod predictions the second order pce q a 0 a 1 c ma x a 2 b ex p a 3 c max 2 1 a 4 b exp 2 1 a 5 c ma x b ex p is built with the historical data and then applied to quantify the uncertainty of the hymod predictions as presented in table s3 nine collocation points are obtained to establish the linear regression equations and generate the values of the six unknown coefficients in the second order pce fan et al 2015a in the prediction period 50 values of cmax and bexp are randomly generated through the standard gaussian distribution which are transformed from cmax and bexp thus total 2 500 pce simulation values would be generated for each time point with the generated cmax and bexp as well as pce coefficients the mean and variance values of cpce model would be obtained with the 2500 realizations to evaluate pce s reliability for uncertainty quantification the monte carlo mc simulation is applied as the benchmark results similarly 50 values of cmax and bexp are randomly generated from their distribution randomly and total 2500 combinations of parameter values are applied to run hymod simulations for mc analysis and again the mean and varianance values of mc model would be obtained in this study the prior distributions for the parameters i e cmax and bexp of hymod are assumed to uniformly spread over predefined ranges to represent vague prior knowledge as presented in table 1 posterior distributions of cmax and bexp are obtained by metropolis hastings mh algorithm through the calibration of hymod over the period of 1981 1984 after the calibration process the parameters posterior distributions are obtained as shown in fig 5 the detail of mh and the calibration process are provided in the supporting material to analyze the influence of the parameter distributions on the surrogate system pce surrogate model is established based on the prior and posterior distributions of the parameters in hymod respectively the comparison for the mean and variance values of daily streamflow obtained through the 2 order pce and mc simulation methods are presented in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 a and b with the parameter prior distribution the mean streamflow obtained by pce surrogate model are highly identical with the mc simulation results by linearly fitting the mean values of mc simulation and pce simulation the coefficient of determination r 2 0 999 in fig 6 c and d the variances of the streamflow obtained through mc and pce simulations are compared with the corresponding coefficient of determination r 2 0 995 these indicate that the pce results would fit well with the mc simulation results in both means and variances however as can be seen from fig s2 neither the mc simulation nor the pce model would fit well with the observed streamflows as they are established based on the parameter prior distributions due to the wide prior distributions of parameters mc simulations cannot reflect the true relationship between rainfall and runoff and the simulation results cannot match the actual runoff observations not surprisingly the pce simulation where the collocation points are selected in the parameter prior spaces also cannot match the actual runoff observations in comparison as shown in fig 7 the pce surrogate model based on the posterior distributions of parameters cannot only better match the mc simulations in both means and variances but also fit well with the runoff observations i e nse 0 84 in other words the pce surrogate model can generally replace the hydrologic model i e hymod with posterior parameter distributions to reflect the temporal variations for the streamflow combining the prior distribution and actual observations the posterior distributions of parameters are obtained based on mh algorithm the pce surrogate model with the collocation points selected from parameter posterior distribution spaces can well match the observed runoff these indicate that the mean values obtained through pce surrogate model are highly identical with the mc simulation results no matter whether they are established based on the parameters prior or posterior distributions in other words the pce surrogate model can generally replace the hydrologic model i e hymod however only the pce surrogate model and mc simulation based on parameters posterior distributions can reflect the temporal variations for streamflow accurately therefore the mh method would be employed to approximate the posterior probabilities of model parameters and improve the forecasting accuracy based on the observed measurements 5 projection of cpce model for the historical period the unknown coefficients in pce can be assessed through regression based pcm method with model input e g precipitation and evapotranspiration and output e g streamflow fan et al 2015a however for the forecasting period these coefficients are unavailable due to the lack of observed streamflow ghaith and li 2020 therefore before exploring pce s capability to forecast streamflow stochastically the potential predictors of pce coefficients need to be identified as shown in fig 1 b since the state variable i e x loss is continuously updated its specific value depends on the previous climatic and hydrological relationship xie et al 2019 hence it can be assumed that the state variable is a function of the previous forcing data for convenience the pce coefficients are firstly correlated with various climatic variables including multi day cumulative precipitation denoted as p sump3 sump5 sump7 sump10 sump15 sump20 sump30 sump60 and sump90 and multi day cumulative potential evapotranspiration denoted as e sume3 sume5 sume7 sume10 sume15 sume20 sume30 sume60 and sume90 as presented in fig 8 there are significant correlations among the pce coefficients and climate variables for example except for a5 all pce coefficients have strong correlations with climate variables especially the cumulative precipitation the biggest correlation 0 853 exists between a2 and sump5 i e the cumulative 5 day rainfall therefore a reasonable guess is that the coefficents of the pce prediction model can be obtained based on climate factors the pce coefficients and climate data during 1981 1984 are used to traing sca model and the obtained sca tree is shown in fig s3 then the pce coefficients and climate data in 1984 are used to test the obtained sca model as shown in fig 9 most of the pce coefficients e g a0 a2 a4 predicted by the sca model can fit their theoretical values as mentioned in section 3 2 a second order two random variables pce is built for hymod as q a 0 a 1 c ma x a 2 b ex p a 3 c max 2 1 a 4 b exp 2 1 a 5 c ma x b ex p here c ma x and b ex p are standard gaussian variables which are transformed from the distributions of cmax and bexp the variability in pce coefficients implies the different main and or interactive effects of these parameters on model outputs i e streamflow for instance the high predictability of a2 nse 0 80 indicates that the model performance is more sensitive to bexp as shown in fig 12 at the same time it is difficult to predict a5 accurately nse 0 14 which means that the interaction between cmax and bexp has little effect on the model results this also corresponds to the result of fig 12 which shows that the interactive effects of cmax and bexp in cpce model are lower than 0 004 however the relationship between pce coefficients and climate variables is unknown and has been rarely studied and not quantified in previous studies ghaith and li 2020 this study attempts to construct and quantify this relationship through the sca approach for the first time the advantage of sca is that it can quantify nonlinear non functional relationships huang 1992 as shown in fig s3 the unknown relationships between pce coefficients and climatic conditions can be revealed through the loop of cutting and merging which is described through a clustering tree with this trained tree sca model is expected to predict the unknown coefficients in pce for the forecasting period with obtained climatic conditions the accuracy of pce coefficient predictions by sca reflects the strength of these relationships using sca to analyze the relationship between pce coefficients and climate variables is one of the advantages of cpce method the mean and variance values of streamflow obtained by mc and cpce during the validation period are presented in fig 10 it is found that the predicted streamflows obtained by cpce can fit very well with the results from mc when compared with observed streamflows mc and cpce performed well for low streamflow while produced underestimations for the peak streamflows this may be due to the peak clipping phenomenon of sca method for the validation period nse values of mc and cpce are 0 79 and 0 57 fig 11 presents the ensembles of the forecasted streamflow obtatined by mc and cpce during the validation period the distributions show that the probability distributions generated by cpce are very similar with those obtained by mc for the validation period crps values of mc and cpce are 1 9 and 2 9 respectively similar to deterministic predictions cpce is likely to provide probabilistic forecasts reliably for low streamflow while generate underestimations for the peak streamflows to make it clear the histograms of streamflow obtained by mc and cpce on several selected days are presented in fig s4 the different performances of the cpce reflect the inconsistency in the process of uncertainty transmission in cpce model the pce coefficients are obtained through the sca tree where the predicted value is the average of the samples in each leaf node for low runoff or normal runoff with a large number of samples the samples of each leaf node are concentrated and the average value can reflect the predicted value well however for flood peak with small sample size the average value of leaf node may underestimate the predicted value and the uncertainty of prediction is amplified this resaerch is the first attempt to establish the relationship between pce coefficients and climatic conditions through sca model and the traditional sca method is chosen here in the following research the authors will consider using modified sca fan et al 2016b to improve the prediction ability of cpce further one major issue of the proposed cpce model is its computation demand since training a sca tree would require aconsiderablecomputer time for repeating cut merge as presented in table 2 if the above cpce procedures i e include training and prediction are applied for hymod the computation demand would be about 481 22 and 1 54 s for training and prediction and these would be 65 88 and 65 35 s for mc the results show that cpce needs more computation time than mc for this simple five parameter hymod in cpce model sca training does not need to be repeated and random predictions can be quickly obtained once the sca model is built the main calculation requirements of cpce for prediction are not affected by the complexity of the hydrological model while mc needs to run the hydrological model repeatedly and its calculation time increases rapidly as the complexity of the model increases thus the acceptable computational requirements and reliable performances make cpce be an appealing hydrological tool in revealing interactive rainfall runoff relationships ghaith and li 2020 compared with traditional pce method the developed cpce model cannot only reflect uncertainty propagation in stochastic hydrological simulation but also have the capability of random forecasting it has reported that the performance of sca is sensitive to the clustering significance i e p value which determines the threshold value for cutting and merging operations qin et al 2008 sun et al 2018 therefore to explore the sensitivity of cpce on clustering significance i e p value three clustering significance values i e p 0 01 0 05 and 0 10 are examined it is found that the generated pce coefficients are insensitive with p values fig s5 the cpce has the best prediction skill when p value equals to 0 05 fig s5 6 dynamic sensitivity since the cpce variables i e cmax and bexp have different contributions to the variability of the model outputs a multilevel factorial analysis is introduced to quantify their main and interactive effects on uncertainty propagation fan et al 2020 as an illustration the functional approximation of a stochastic system with two dimension second order hermite polynomials can be presented as q a 0 a 1 c ma x a 2 b ex p a 3 c max 2 1 a 4 b exp 2 1 a 5 c ma x b ex p here c ma x and b ex p are standard gaussian variables which are transformed from cmax and bexp thus a 52 factorial experiment can be conducted to explore the sensitivities of ζ 1 cmax and ζ 2 bexp in cpce model for each day fig 12 shows the dynamic sensitivities of the parameters in the cpce model on the streamflow among the 2553 daily streamflows 70 2 of them have a main effect of cmax higher than 0 8 in comparison only 7 6 of daily streamflows have a main effect of bexp higher than 0 5 as shown in fig 12 cmax mainly has high main effects for low flows and bexp would have high main effects for high flows in hymod cmax indicates the maximum soil moisture capacity within the catchment and bexp presents the degree of spatial variability in soil moisture capacities the conceptual hydrological model hymod adopts the saturation excess runoff generation mechanism moore 1985 saturation excess overland flow is generated when the soil becomes saturated to the extent that additional precipitation cannot infiltrate runoff production at a point in the catchment is controlled by the maximum soil moisture capacity and precipitation li and ishidaira 2012 which is more likely to occur during small precipitation period thus it can be concluded that the maximum soil moisture capacity within the catchment has the strongest main effect which plays a key role in the forecasting streamflow especially for low flows any change in the value of cmax would cause a considerable variation in the accuracy of the low flow forecasting while for the high streamflow the spatial variability in soil moisture capacities has a remarkable impact on the accuracy of hydrological forecasting this can be explained by that saturation excess flow generation mechanism may has the limited contribution to the total runoff during intensive storm events it has been reported that the extreme rainfall event is the dominant trigger of annual maximum runoff events in the yellow river basin ran et al 2020 extreme rainfall generally lasts for a short time under this condition the spatial variability of river basins may have certain influence on the time and magnitude of runoff generation 7 conclusions based on the uncertainty evolution and sensitivity analysis of the hydrological process this study introduced a clustered polynomial chaos expansion cpce model for stochastic hydrological prediction with effectively reflecting the stochastic characteristics of hydrological processes cpce model can directly predict future runoff sequences and generate probability distributions of all runoff values the cpce model characterizes the random characteristics of state variables in the hydrological model through a polynomial chaotic expansion pce model based on the probabilistic collocation method at the same time the multivariate discrete non functional relationship between pce coefficients and hydrological model inputs i e precipitation and potential evapotranspiration is established based on stepwise cluster analysis the cpce model integrates the pce and sca approaches to generate the probabilistic predictions for streamflow finally the dynamic parameters sensitivities for streamflow forecasting are assessed with the help of multilevel factorial analyses the main conclusions are as follows 1 the pce surrogate model based on the posterior distributions of parameters can generally replace the hydrologic model i e hymod to reflect the temporal variations for the streamflow 2 the pce coefficients can be estimated through sca model through revealing the complicated multivariate nonlinear relation between the forcing data of hydrological model and the coefficients of the pce model 3 the proposed cpce model is likely to provide reliable probabilistic predictions which is an appealing modelling tool in revealing interactive rainfall runoff relationships 4 dynamic sensitivity analysis indicates that the maximum soil moisture capacity within the catchment plays a key role in the accuracy of the low flow forecasting while the degree of spatial variability in soil moisture capacities has a remarkable impact on the accuracy of the high flow forecasting the different performances of the cpce model also reflect the inconsistency in the process of uncertainty transmission the main innovation of this research is the development of a clustered polynomial chaos expansion cpce model which overcomes the shortcoming of the traditional pce models in doing prediction work the main finding is that the maximum soil moisture capacity within catchment plays a key role in the accuracy of the low flow forecasting while the degree of spatial variability in soil moisture capacities has a remarkable impact on the accuracy of the high flow forecasting the results conclude that the clustered polynomial chaos expansion cpce model can provide accurate predictions with less computational burden moreover some extensions improvements or applications are still needed to be conducted in future studies for instance the relationship between precipitation and runoff are assumed to be consistent during a short term seven years in this study thus the trained sca model is not constantly updated here however the hydrological model also needs to consider the non stationarity of streamflow for the long term prediction thus in the following research the authors will consider updating the sca model constantly during the forecasting period the combination of dynamic sca with pce model is expected to update the relationship between pce coefficient and climate conditions in real time so as to maintain good prediction accuracy of cpce model for long term streamflow secondly a high dimensional high order expansion model is not involved in this study the total number of pce terms increases rapidly with the dimensionality and the degree of the pce for instance there are 56 pce terms and coefficients for one five dimension three order pce surrogate model it is difficult to accurately predict 56 expansion coefficients at the same time which may lead to inaccurate predictions one potential solution is to remove the unimportant pce items based on sensitivity analysis as reported by wang et al 2015 therefore in the following work we will also consider the combination of stepwise cluster analyses and reduced pce models to solve the projection problem of a high dimensional high order expansion model declaration of competing interest the
