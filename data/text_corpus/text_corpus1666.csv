8330,study region poland carpathians gorce mountains jamne and jaszcze catchments study focus the hydrological response to and geomorphic impacts of a 18 july 2018 flood involving two small catchments each covering less than 12 km2 that were not hydrologically controlled were examined a peak flood discharge was simulated with two hydrological models scs cn and scs uh hydrological modelling was performed in order to complement the post flooding investigations and to verify the hydrological data via cross check comparison geodetic measurements of the channels and als and tls data were used to analyse the geomorphological changes in addition the flood magnitude recorded for the studied streams was compared with the other local flash floods in the carpathians using the unit k flood index a non dimensional measure new hydrological insights for the region the maximum unit flow 4 1 4 8 m3 s 1 km 2 placed this flood event among the 10 largest flash floods in the polish carpathians based on the k index the peak discharge simulated with the scs cn and scs uh hydrological models was similar to the data obtained during the post flooding investigation indicating that this method can be used for catchments in the polish carpathians that are not managed hydrologically the high unit stream powers estimated for the analysed channel cross sections 750 w m 2 were associated with narrow channels and steep slopes the most significant geomorphological changes were observed in unmanaged channel reaches moreover the channel transformations in the jamne catchment were greater than those in the jaszcze catchment in a more forested area this analysis can be useful in the evaluation of flood risk management processes associated with flash floods in small unmanaged catchments keywords

stoffel et al 2016 and can be highly damaging to property infrastructure and life forms e g marchi et al 2010 stoffel et al 2016 in mountain catchments flash floods are usually the consequence of short high intensity episodes of rainfall of mainly convective origin and that are often orographically enhanced gaume et al 2009 borga et al 2014 mitková et al 2018 bryndal et al 2020 in inland continental europe catchments affected by flash floods are usually smaller than 40 km2 in area bryndal et al 2017 hence these floods often have geomorphological effects on a local scale and have a powerful impact on the development of local morphology gorczyca 2007 these floods may also produce significant changes in the pre flood landforms that persist over several years and could not have been accomplished by less intense floods of longer duration hicks et al 2005 the hydrological parameters and geomorphological impacts of flash floods result from meteorologically derived triggering factors e g rainfall duration and intensity catchments physiographic properties e g dimensions shape geology relief conditions land use and land cover lulc road network density and pre event catchment conditions e g soil moisture conditions all of which determine the threshold values for the formation of runoffs and affect the types and intensities of morphological processes malarz 2005 ogden and dawdy 2003 marchi et al 2010 parajka et al 2010 gaál et al 2012 borga et al 2014 grecu et al 2017 the geomorphological conditions along a channel are usually evaluated with the stream power bagnold 1966 1973 petit et al 2005 kale and hire 2007 radecki pawlik 2013 bizzi and lerner 2015 according to knighton 1999 and das 2019 stream power is crucial in many fluvial processes most studies focus on determining the stream power during extreme floods e g costa and o connor 1995 kale 2007 righini et al 2017 studies in mountain areas have shown that the intensity of morphological processes during extreme floods is several times greater than during periods of average conditions and usually results in significant geomorphological changes in river channels wyżga 2008 marchi et al 2010 armaş et al 2012 gorczyca et al 2013 wiejaczka and kijowska strugała 2015 hajdukiewicz et al 2016 kidová et al 2016 bryndal et al 2017 2020 kijowska strugała et al 2017 kijowska strugała 2019 these changes have a direct impact on the hydrological conditions present in a river channel gil 1998 ziętara 2002 długosz and gębica 2008 cebulak et al 2009 bryndal et al 2010a b gorczyca et al 2013 kijowska strugała et al 2016 and indirectly affect many aspects related to planning and flood risk management processes in the catchment e g rinaldi et al 2009 radecki pawlik 2013 laszek et al 2014 bryndal et al 2017 as flash floods develop on spatial and temporal scales that conventional measurement networks designed to measure rain and river discharges are not able to sample effectively these events are particularly difficult to observe borga et al 2014 this difficulty is very apparent in the flysch carpathians where flash floods most often occur in catchments of up to 15 km2 in area therefore each analysis of a flood event combined with an explanation of the natural and man made factors attributing to the flood is crucial to understanding these phenomena this understanding in turn is crucial for planning and establishing management processes at the catchment scale an extraordinary rainstorm occurred in the western part of the gorce mountains western carpathians poland fig 1 a on 18 july 2018 the rainfall generated flash floods in several tributaries of the ochotnica and kamienica river systems fig 1a this event created an opportunity to assess the impact of the extreme rainfall and flash floods in terms of geomorphological channel changes in two small each covering 12 km2 catchments jamne and jaszcze where geomorphological monitoring has been conducted since 2013 the main aim of this study was to examine whether an integrated approach allows assessments of the impacts of extreme events on the geomorphological changes in mountain catchment to be made the specific objectives were to i describe the meteorological setting of the heavy rainfall and the hydrological responses of the unmanaged catchments and ii evaluate how extreme hydro meteorological events affect geomorphological changes in stream channels associated with different land uses and cover in this study it was assumed that an integrated post event analysis using a variety of different methods would allow the reconstruction of the culmination and course of a flash flood a process that is crucial in flood risk management especially considering the ongoing climate changes taking place 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the gorce mountains in the flysch part of the polish western carpathians fig 1 this mountain range has an area of about 550 km2 is of medium height and is dissected deeply detailed studies were carried out in the jamne 49 30 50 n 20 14 54 e and jaszcze 49 30 36 n 20 14 34 e catchments which are located in the ochotnica dolna commune the jamne and jaszcze catchments covering 8 95 km2 and 11 39 km2 respectively are underlain by flysch rocks of the magura nappe that consist of alternating sandstone and shale layers high ridges 1000 1250 m a s l and deep v shaped valleys dissecting up to 300 600 m are the main relief forms steep slopes with inclinations 15 cover more than 70 of the jamne and jaszcze catchments fig 1b sandy loam podzols with a high proportion of rock fragments developed on the sandstone bedrock and luvisols with large contents of silt formed on shale outcrops niemirowski 1974 the lower and middle parts of the jamne and jaszcze catchments are located in a temperate cool zone between 650 and 1100 m a s l while the upper parts occupy a cool zone 2 4 c hess 1965 mean annual precipitation reaches 841 1972 2018 mm and the highest mean monthly values are typically recorded in july 122 mm ochotnica górna station at 610 m a s l fig 2 c the jamne and jaszcze catchments have environmental features that are representative of the mid mountain part of the polish carpathians the jamne valley is wider has gentler slopes a greater proportion of areas with southern aspects and a larger contribution of deep and less rocky soils in comparison to the jaszcze valley the jamne catchment has climatic and soil conditions that are more favourable for agricultural development thus it is more deforested and has a higher proportion of agricultural land than the jaszcze catchment in 2015 forests covered 61 5 of the jamne catchment and 80 3 of the jaszcze catchment as a consequence of socio economic changes that occurred after 1989 there was a notable decline in cultivated land bucała hrabia 2018 the area covered by cultivated land decreased from over 90 in 1977 to less than 1 in the jamne catchment and 0 5 in jaszcze catchment in 2015 fig 1c 2 2 meteorological setting of the july 2018 flood the meteorological setting of the july 2018 flood was described using a synoptic map developed by the institute of meteorology and water management polish research institute imigw pib fig 2a the precipitation was reconstructed based on the hourly rainfall totals mm h 1 measured by telemetry type rainfall gauges situated in the vicinity of the catchments ochotnica górna 49 30 37 n 20 14 41 e studzionki 49 29 43 n 20 12 43 e and turbacz 49 32 41 n 20 07 05 e fig 2b the rainfall stations are managed by the imgw pib 2 3 hydrological analyses the jamne and jaszcze catchments are not hydrologically controlled the nearest water gauge station tylmanowa 49 31 02 n 20 23 13 e which was destroyed during the flood had been located c a 12 km downstream in a straight line close to the mouth of the ochotnica river a 108 km2 which drains into to the dunajec river fig 1a the peak discharges of the july 2018 flood into the jamne and jaszcze catchments were estimated after the flood event in order to minimize uncertainties related to flood peak assessments field study data were utilized and the verification process was performed in accordance with flash flood and post flood field investigation guidance gaume and borga 2008 lumbroso and gaume 2012 a field study was conducted in early august after the flood event the highest floodwater stages were marked at cross sections c3m in the jamne stream and c4m in the jaszcze stream fig 3 a geodetic measurements were performed two weeks later and included the cross sections and the slopes impacted by the highest flood water stage the flow velocity was calculated using manning s equation lambor 1971 1 v 1 n r 2 3 s 1 2 where v represents the flow velocity m s 1 r is the hydraulic radius m s is the slope of the highest flood water stage dimensionless and n represents manning s roughness coefficient it was estimated based on the field observations and tables chow 1959 for channel beds and riparian vegetation mainly flow velocity was verified via a cross check comparison with the flow velocities reported by marchi et al 2010 and lumbroso and gaume 2012 for flash floods in europe the flood peak qf m3 s 1 was calculated as a product of the cross section area m2 and flow velocity m s 1 the field studies were supported with a hydrological modelling approach designed to complement hydrological investigations in ungauged catchments gaume and borga 2008 based on previous flash flood studies in the polish carpathians bryndal et al 2017 two hydrological models namely soil conservation service curve number scs cn and soil conservation service unit hydrograph scs uh were used mistra and singh 2003 hydrologic modeling system 2015 these two models in spite of their limitations and uncertainties as discussed in the literature e g feldman 2000 and mistra and singh 2003 have yielded the best results in terms of flood peak reconstruction bryndal et al 2010a b c the hourly rainfall data from the ochotnica górna studzionki and turbacz telemetry type rainfall stations located close to the catchments see fig 1 was averaged and then used to provide the input data for the scs cn model the small sizes of the catchments each less than 12 km2 in area justified the assumption of uniform rainfall distribution the cn curve was calculated according to the soil s antecedent moisture conditions amc and evaluated on the basis of a five day period mistra and singh 2003 in this case amc level ii and a coefficient of initial loss of 0 15 were assumed the lag time tlag required for the scs uh model was calculated according to the following equation national engineering handbook 2010 2 t l a g l 3 28 10 3 0 8 1000 c n 9 0 7 1900 i where l is the length of the longest drainage path km i represents the average catchment slope and cn is the cn parameter the quality of the hydrological data obtained as a result of hydrological modelling and post flood field investigation was verified via a cross check comparison the hydrologically simulated flood peak qfs m3 s 1 was compared to the flood peak qf m3 s 1 calculated after the flood event and the percent differences were calculated for the c3m and c4m cross sections the input data required that the hydrological models be obtained from a geodatabase consisting of a raster type digital elevation model 1 1 m developed from als lidar data land use and land cover maps at a scale of 1 50 000 and a soil map at a scale of 1 25 000 the parameters required for the hydrological models catchment size relief conditions the cn parameter variables for eq 1 percentage of unpaved areas were calculated using arc gis 9 3 software whereas the hydrological modelling was performed using hec hms software hydrologic modeling system 2015 to compare and explain geomorphological channel changes in the monitored cross sections flood wave parameters were reconstructed for the c1 c2 c4 jamne catchment and c1 c3 jaszcze catchment cross sections using the hydrological modelling approach the flood peak cross sections were compared to p probable floods in order to evaluate the magnitude of the flood the p probable floods were calculated using the so called rainfall formula a regional type of equation used in poland for catchments of up to 50 km2 biernat et al 1991 the flood magnitudes recorded in the jamne and jaszcze streams were compared to other local flash floods that had taken place in the carpathians the comparison was made using the unit flood peak m3 s 1 km 2 and k flood index a non dimensional measure that allows for the comparison of flood magnitudes between catchments in different areas the k flood index developed by françou and rodier 1969 is calculated as follows 3 k 10 1 l o g q m a x 6 l o g a 8 where qmax represents the flood peak m3 s 1 and a is the catchment area km2 the higher the k index value the more severe the flood event 2 4 mapping of geomorphological changes fieldwork was carried out during two visits to the study catchments that took place a week after the flood and in early august the field work involved geomorphological mapping of the effects of the rainfall event using a topographic map at a scale of 1 10 000 for the entire lengths of the analysed channels additionally field work in the jamne and jaszcze catchments aimed at recognizing changes in the location of the channel beds on the basis of geodetic measurements of the channels in selected cross sections in the upper middle and lower parts of the streams three cross sections in each channel in the jamne cross sections c1 c2 and c4 were located 4 0 1 8 and 0 2 km upstream from the stream mouth to the ochotnica river respectively fig 3a table 1 in the jaszcze cross sections c1 c2 and c3 were located 6 8 4 7 and 0 7 km from the stream mouth to the ochotnica river respectively fig 3a table 1 in both streams the cross sections were representative of different parts of the catchments fig 3a geomorphological changes in particular changes in the channel beds were characterized with respect to the cross sections the impact of the floodwater on the stream channel was expressed quantitatively via the stream power ω w m 1 and unit stream power ω w m 2 indexes the first parameter which represents the rate of energy expenditure per unit channel length was computed as 4 ω γ s qf where γ is the specific weight of water 9810 n m 3 s is the energy slope of a channel dimensionless and qf is the peak flood discharge m3 s 1 the second parameter which represents the rate of energy expenditure per unit channel area was computed as 5 ω γ s qf w 1 where w represents the channel width at the peak flood stage m additionally a part of the right bank of the jamne stream where erosional changes were the most pronounced 49 32 25 n 20 13 53 e 65 m long was surveyed via terrestrial laser scanning tls tls measurements were obtained with a long range impulse scanner riegl vz 4000 at a spatial data acquisition speed of about 222 000 points per second the accuracy of the scanner measurements is 15 mm and their precision is 10 mm to determine the impact of the flood on the scale of the bank erosion data from the tls were compared with als data airborne laser scanning from the national protection against extreme hazards isok project of 2013 the 2013 als survey was carried out using a riegl lms q680i scanner with a density of 4 6 points per m2 and a pulse repetition frequency of 300 khz the data were processed using riscan pro software including the multi station adjustment msa module which generates planes from point clouds and then aligns them based on similarities and their spatial distribution the vegetation was filtered out and the processed data were converted into las 1 2 format to identify qualitative and spatial changes between 2013 and 2018 further analyses were carried out using arcgis 10 1 software s dem of difference dod tool 3 results 3 1 meteorological conditions during the july 2018 flood the intense precipitation in july 2018 was induced by cyclonic situations with a marked air advection from the north sector n and ne fig 2a a low pressure area over north beralus and russia which reached central europe from the adriatic sea produced downpours in the western carpathians at the same time a high pressure area above western europe was growing leading to an inflow of humid air from the ne which piled up in the successive ranges of the carpathians as a result of the forced ascent of this air a thick layer of rain clouds formed from which rain fell continuously for several days initially on 17 july the highest rainfall in the polish western carpathians was recorded in the silesian beskid mountains szczyrk 71 mm wisła malinka 65 mm and in the tatra mountains dolina pięciu stawów 111 mm morskie oko 67 mm hala gąsienicowa 56 mm the highest rainfall amounts in the polish carpathians were recorded on 18 july with the maximum daily total of 208 mm recorded at the hala gąsienicowa station at the ochotnica górna station the nearest station to the jamne and jaszcze streams the rainfall amounted to 103 1 mm fig 2b it was the highest total precipitation recorded by this station since 1970 niemirowski 1974 the highest hourly total of 26 2 mm was recorded at this station on 18 july between 16 and 17 h utc the three hour total for the period during which the rainfall intensity was the highest 15 18 utc reached 62 5 mm 3 2 hydrological response the largest flash flooding was observed in the catchments that drain the southern slopes of the jaworzyna kamienicka and gorc ridges fig 1a the jamne and jaszcze catchments cover the area affected by the heavy rainfall the peak discharge and the unit peak discharge calculated after the flood event for the two cross sections located in the lower parts of these catchments amounted to 42 6 m3 s 1 4 8 m3 s 1 km 2 in the jamne stream c3m and 46 5 m3 s 1 4 1 m3 s 1 km 2 in the jaszcze stream c4m the peak discharges in both streams exceeded jaszcze or were close to jamne 0 1 probable flood table 1 the flow velocities calculated with manning s equation ranged between 3 3 and 4 6 m s 1 hydrological modelling was performed in order to complement the post flooding investigations and to verify the hydrological data via a cross check comparison the input data required for the hydrological models and the results of the modelling are presented in table 2 the peak discharge simulated with the scs cn and scs uh hydrological models qfs is similar to the data obtained during the post flooding investigation qf the differences amounted to 2 0 c4m cross section in jaszcze and 3 3 c3m cross section in jamne respectively see table 2 it is notable that the time to peak simulated by the hydrological models 20 p m l t is comparable to those provided by eyewitness reports since the hydrologically simulated qfs and measured peak discharges qf are comparable the differences are all lower than 3 3 the hydrological data can be considered to be of fair quality meaning that the models can be used to reconstruct flood waves in the cross sections located in the upper c1 and middle c2 parts of the catchments fig 2 table 1 according to the hydrological models the peak discharge in the headwater part of the jamne catchment c1 amounted to 28 4 m3 s 1 and was a little higher than the 0 1 probable flood discharge 27 6 m3 s 1 in the middle part c2 the peak flow was 32 9 m3 s 1 and was a little lower than the 0 2 probable flood discharge 36 5 m3 s 1 in the jaszcze catchment the peak flow of the headwater part c1 was 16 1 m3 s 1 and was a little lower than the 1 probable flood discharge 17 2 m3 s 1 in the middle part of this stream c2 the peak flow amounted to 34 2 m3 s 1 and was comparable to the 0 5 probable flood discharge 37 9 m3 s 1 the unit peak discharge ranged from 4 6 to 4 8 m3 s 1 km 2 in the jamne catchment and from 4 1 4 5 m3 s 1 km 2 in the jaszcze catchment table 1 destruction of the water gauge at tylmanowa during the analysed floods made it impossible to specify the peak flow at the lowermost reach of the ochotnica river 3 3 geomorphological effects of extreme rainfall in the jamne and jaszcze catchments based on geomorphological mapping the largest geomorphological channel transformations took place in the jamne catchment as bank erosion dominated the entire length of the stream old bank undercuts were refreshed and new ones up to 3 5 m high developed as a result of lateral erosion the channel were widened 2 3 m on average a comparison of the als derived dem from 2013 and the tls measurements performed after the flood revealed that the banks retreated by up to 12 m fig 4 the area covered by these eroded banks and the volume of material removed from these banks were calculated as 248 m2 and 312 5 m3 respectively the heights of these bank undercuts ranged from 0 82 m to 1 73 m 1 26 m average in additionally due to the erosion of the banks the local road was destroyed in five places in one place the section of road that was destroyed was about 75 m long additionally floodwaters eroded furrows 0 5 m deep 1 2 m wide and about 20 m long in the damaged road the maximum lateral erosion of the left bank in the jamne channel reached 15 m and destroyed the local road along a total length of about 30 m fig 5 in the jaszcze channel lateral erosion occurred in only a few places resulting in bank retreats of up to 3 m as a result of bank erosion three concrete structures were washed away and ca 30 m of the local road was destroyed in the jamne channel boulders up to 150 cm in diameter eroded from channel banks were transported and deposited on the channel bed in both the jamne and jaszcze channels new gravel bars were deposited and the old ones were cut up and transformed the flood also caused considerable deepening of the jamne channel with its depth increasing by about 1 5 m moreover in the jamne stream floodwaters cut new channels of 30 40 m in length and troughs about 1 8 m deep exposing bedrock 3 4 changes in the channel beds indicated by geodetic measurements in monitored cross sections geomorphic changes in the study cross sections of the jamne c1 c2 c4 and jaszcze c1 c3 streams between 2013 or 2014 and 2018 are presented in figs 5 7 additionally table 3 presents the extent of the erosional and depositional changes in the cross sections between 2014 and 2018 cross section c1 in the jamne stream is located in the forested upper part of the catchment its bed is cut into bedrock and follows a straight course along almost its entire length there is a gravel bar on the left bank for this cross section the peak discharge resulting from the july 2018 flood calculated using the slope area method qf was 28 4 m3 s 1 and unit stream power at the flood peak was 2769 wm 2 the highest among the studied cross sections for both streams table 4 fig 3a about 20 m downstream of cross section c1 the right channel bank is eroded intensely during every flood see the results of the tls measurements in cross section c2 the channel banks are not forested and the stream runs a straight course in the middle part of the valley there is a gravel bar on the left side the peak discharge of the flood was 14 higher here than in cross section c1 table 4 and the unit stream power was 72 lower than in c1 upstream of the studied cross section the stream course meanders slightly the third cross section c4 is located in the lower part of the valley where the stream is cut into bedrock with numerous bedrock steps and exposures the peak flood discharge at c4 was 42 6 m3s 1 and the unit stream power was 1538 wm 2 in the jaszcze stream cross section c1 was located in a deep and forested part of the valley the stream runs a straight course and there is gravel bar on the right side the peak flood discharge at c1 was 16 1 m3 s 1 and attained a comparable steam power value 2703 wm 2 to that of cross section c1 of the jamne stream table 4 fig 3a there are bedrock steps above cross section c1 the second cross section c2 is located in the middle part of the valley the stream flows in a straight channel and both banks are covered by shrubs and small trees the stream bed is covered with gravel material at c2 the peak flood discharge was 47 higher than it was at c1 the third cross section c3 is located in the lower part of the valley where the stream runs a straight course its bed is covered with gravel and its banks are not forested there is a gravel bar on the left side close to a bedrock step at cross section c3 the peak flood discharge was 45 0 m3 s 1 and the unit stream power was 767 wm 2 below this cross section about 250 m further along there are concrete banks on both channel sides leading up to a stream estuary above the studied cross section the stream meanders and is deeply incised into the bedrock and there are numerous bedrock steps more dynamic changes occurred in the jamne stream as the result of the flood and the erosion and deposition of material were greater than in the jaszcze stream except for the upper part of the stream table 3 in the upper and middle cross sections c1 c2 of the jamne stream the deposition of material exceeded erosion 1 9 m2 in the lower course the channel was almost exclusively modelled by erosion 4 30 m2 table 3 the maximum incision in the jamne stream was 131 cm in cross section c4 where the channel bed also widened by 2 m fig 6 in the jaszcze stream erosion prevailed in the upper c1 and lower c3 cross sections and was greatest at c1 4 71 m2 which confirms the high unit stream power calculated for this cross section table 4 in the middle course of the jaszcze stream c2 deposition was the predominant process 0 74 m2 the maximum deepening of the jaszcze channel reached 124 cm in the upper cross section c1 fig 7 4 discussion rainfall recorded in july 2018 in southern poland with daily totals exceeding 100 mm led to channel transformations of the jamne and jaszcze streams and was caused by a north east cyclonic situation nec this type of circulation is one of three types apart from nc northern cyclonic situation and bc resulting from low pressure different directions of air flow and a frontal system along the axis through bc of situations responsible for triggering the most extreme precipitation conditions in the polish carpathians niedźwiedź 2003a niedźwiedź and łupikasza 2016 in addition niedźwiedź and łupikasza 2016 showed an increase in the frequency of this type of air circulation and the crucial role of orography in the formation of intense precipitation in the carpathians in addition in central europe these typical cyclonic circulation types with air advection from the north sector have been responsible for extreme precipitation induced floods niedźwiedź 2003b james et al 2004 fieldwork revealed a large scale transformation in the unmanaged jamne and jaszcze valleys studies conducted by ballesteros cánovas et al 2016 in the tatra mountains and mitková et al 2018 in slovakia showed the importance of analysis and the reconstruction of events in unmanaged catchments a direct cause of the changes in the jaszcze and jamne valleys was the extreme rainfall in july 2018 that caused the flash flood the highest intensity of the rainfall which was more than 0 4 mm min 1 was recorded between 16 and 18 h utc on 18 july with a total of 62 5 mm recorded during that time period the maximum daily total precipitation at the ochotnica górna station during this event was 103 1 mm 18 july higher daily rainfall totals at this station were only recorded during the flood of july 1970 when maximum daily precipitation amounted to 154 9 mm niemirowski 1974 even during the catastrophic flood of 1997 in the vistula basin total daily precipitation in the study area was only 70 mm similar daily precipitation values were noted in 2008 76 3 mm and 2014 82 0 mm bucała 2009 bucała et al 2016 the flow velocities at the flood peak varied in the jamne and jaszcze streams were between 3 3 and 4 6 m s 1 these values are comparable to the flow velocities reported for other flash floods in europe e g marchi et al 2010 lumbroso and gaume 2012 the maximum discharges of these two streams calculated using the slope area method reached 42 6 and 46 5 m3 s 1 respectively it is worth noting that these peak flood discharges constitute c a 50 of the maximum flow 79 8 m3 s 1 recorded during the years 1971 2011 at the tylmanowa station on the ochotnica river located ca 12 km downstream in a straight line which characterizes this catchment area of 108 km2 kijowska strugała and bucała hrabia 2019 this comparison reflects the scale of the flood event recorded on 18 july 2018 the extraordinary occurrence of this flood can also be seen in a comparison with other flash floods reported in the carpathians table 5 includes the greatest flash flood events in the polish and slovakian carpathians that occurred in catchments that are comparable to the jamne and jaszcze catchments in terms of area 3 12 km2 only the romanian part of carpathians represented by three events the literature lacks data for catchments in the range of 3 12 km2 bryndal et al 2017 taking into account the k index the flood on 18 july 2018 is ranked 12th among all flash flood events reported in the carpathians but it ranks 4th in floods in the polish part of the carpathians the unit flood peak 4 1 4 8 m3 s 1 km 2 situates the flood in 20th place on the list of carpathian floods table 5 these values are reflected in the geomorphological transformation of the stream channel in mountain catchments flash floods are usually the consequence of short high intensity rainfalls borga et al 2014 for example in slovakia over the past decade catastrophic flash floods occurred at the malá svinka gidra parná and varínka streams all with catchments areas of 30 40 km2 svoboda and peka rova 1998 mitková et al 2018 in these events the average rainfall was 80 100 mm over 2 h and the unit peak flooding ranged from 1 5 m3 s 1 km 2 to 6 8 m3 s 1 km 2 svoboda and peka rova 1998 and mitková et al 2018 explained that the primary causes of these flash floods were the high precipitation totals and the initial soil moisture conditions in the catchments in addition gaál et al 2012 showed that in the flysch catchments there is a tendency towards a flashy reaction to precipitation mainly due to flow paths that are near the surface with little infiltration as well as shallow soils which enhances faster flood response and increases soil erosion the debate on the impact of the magnitude of the flood on geomorphic changes in the catchments is still valid essentially large floods can have the greatest impact on geomorphic transformations baker 1977 pickup 1991 meanwhile floods with very steep rising limbs and of very short duration low total energy expenditure can have a small geomorphic impacts costa and o connor 1995 magilligan et al 1998 the role of other factors is often comparable to or even more important than that of the magnitude of the flood in the geomorphic changes in the jamne and jaszcze catchments phillips 2002 thus the same discharge value may interact with the channel in a different way in another time or place the spatial extent of the rainstorm with high its discharge and unit stream power during the flash flood in jamne and jaszcze catchment in july 2018 caused geomorphic changes in the stream channels according to miller 1990 and nanson and croke 1992 flash floods typically have a high unit stream power of more than 300 w m 2 depending on hydrologic and topographic factors the high unit stream power values obtained for this study s cross sections above 750 w m 2 were associated with the small widths and steep slopes of the channels the highest unit stream power of 2769 w m 2 was found for cross section c1 of the jamne stream which has a catchment area of 3 2 km2 the investigation of the selected cross sections showed that the unit stream power decreased non linearly with increasing catchment area fig 8 this is consistent with the outcomes of research conducted in central and southern europe by marchi et al 2016 in this region the maximum unit stream power values were recorded during flash floods in areas 10 km2 the analysed flash flood caused geomorphic changes in all analysed cross sections alluvial and semi alluvial however high unit stream power does not imply large changes in channel morphology this finding is in line with the results obtained by marchi et al 2016 the unit stream power values for the analysed cross sections of the two streams were similar but more dynamic and geomorphological changes were recorded in the jamne stream where both erosion and the deposition of material exceeded those components for the jaszcze stream with the exception of the upper part of the jaszcze cross section c1 with the greatest erosion 4 71 m2 geodetic measurements of the channel taken at the selected cross sections in may 2013 along with t repeated measurements taken in april 2014 showed that the common morphological change taking place in the channels of both streams was the deepening in their forested upper parts and in their lower parts bucała et al 2016 accompanied by a slight accumulation of material especially in the jaszcze stream in the middle parts of the streams the changes were not so clear especially in the jamne stream where erosion and accumulation occurred in equal measure whereas in the jaszcze stream accumulation was dominant bucała et al 2016 on 15 may 2014 a flood occurred which was caused by continuous rainfall and a daily total of 82 0 mm by comparing the cross sections made before and after the flood in 2014 a deepening in the lower part of the streams was found along with a slight accumulation of material bucała et al 2016 geomorphological effects of the flood were consistent with this tendency however the erosion was about 760 greater in the jamne stream and about 185 greater in the jaszcze stream in july 2018 additionally the impact of the july 2018 flood included land use and land cover changes which played important roles in the transformation of the studied channels especially the jamne stream more deforested in the lower sections of the jamne and jaszcze streams a common feature of the floods of 2013 2014 and 2018 was erosion and incision it is interesting that the highest erosion 4 3 m2 in the jamne channel was recorded in cross section c4 which has a semi alluvial channel the left bank retreated by 2 m considerable erosion in this part was associate with a high maximum discharge of 42 6 m3 s 1 and a unit stream power of 1538 w m 2 in the jamne catchment which was more deforested a greater transformation in the stream channel in relation to the jaszcze catchment was also observed during the floods in 1970 and 1997 niemirowski 1974 bucała 2009 moreover observations made in jamne and jaszcze catchments indicate that despite a rapid abandonment of cultivated land and cart tracks after 1989 the past land use structure still has a noticeable impact on contemporary concentrations of suspended sediment in the stream this impact was clearly visible during two floods that occurred in both catchments on 7 july 2013 local downpour of 21 2 mm in 4 h and 15 may 2014 continuous rainfall of 82 mm in 24 h the jamne stream which had a higher contribution of cultivated land in the past compared to the jaszcze stream had a 130 higher concentration of suspended sediment and a higher proportion of fine particles eroded from cultivated land in the past bucała hrabia 2018 5 conclusions the flash flood that occurred on 18 july 2018 in the two small catchments jamne and jaszcze in the gorce mountains polish carpathians was the largest since 1970 the flood was caused by a daily total of 103 1 mm of rain it was the highest daily precipitation recorded at the ochotnica górna station since 1970 a maximum peak flow was recorded a few hours after the maximum rainfall indicating a rapid runoff response the analysis showed that the results obtained from the hydrological models scs cn and scs uh are compatible with those obtained on the basis of geodetic measurements of selected channel cross sections 3 differences and thus can be used to reconstruct flood peaks in mountain streams without hydrological stations taking the k index into account the flood of 18 july 2018 is among the 10 largest events reported in the carpathians the geomorphic impact of the flash flood was significant in these channel systems especially the jamne stream bank erosion and channel incision were common in both streams the high values of discharge above 16 m3 s 1 and unit stream power above 750 w m 2 were associated with high rainfall and catchment parameters narrow channels and steep slopes at the same time other studies have shown that high unit stream power does not necessarily imply large changes in channel morphology as such changes may be related to other factors a significant role of land use and land cover on geomorphic changes has been demonstrated in the jamne catchment the observed dimensions of erosion and deposition in the lower part of the catchment were 70 and 54 higher than in the more forested jaszcze catchment during the event coarse bed material 150 cm was transported this study which was carried out on small mountain catchments indicated the important role of flash floods in the transformation of mountain channel systems the research provided evidence that the intensities of hydrological processes during extreme events have a powerful impact on the transformation of local morphology these significant geomorphological changes of the stream channel happen more quickly than in lowland rivers due to rainfall amounts steep channel

8330,study region poland carpathians gorce mountains jamne and jaszcze catchments study focus the hydrological response to and geomorphic impacts of a 18 july 2018 flood involving two small catchments each covering less than 12 km2 that were not hydrologically controlled were examined a peak flood discharge was simulated with two hydrological models scs cn and scs uh hydrological modelling was performed in order to complement the post flooding investigations and to verify the hydrological data via cross check comparison geodetic measurements of the channels and als and tls data were used to analyse the geomorphological changes in addition the flood magnitude recorded for the studied streams was compared with the other local flash floods in the carpathians using the unit k flood index a non dimensional measure new hydrological insights for the region the maximum unit flow 4 1 4 8 m3 s 1 km 2 placed this flood event among the 10 largest flash floods in the polish carpathians based on the k index the peak discharge simulated with the scs cn and scs uh hydrological models was similar to the data obtained during the post flooding investigation indicating that this method can be used for catchments in the polish carpathians that are not managed hydrologically the high unit stream powers estimated for the analysed channel cross sections 750 w m 2 were associated with narrow channels and steep slopes the most significant geomorphological changes were observed in unmanaged channel reaches moreover the channel transformations in the jamne catchment were greater than those in the jaszcze catchment in a more forested area this analysis can be useful in the evaluation of flood risk management processes associated with flash floods in small unmanaged catchments keywords

stoffel et al 2016 and can be highly damaging to property infrastructure and life forms e g marchi et al 2010 stoffel et al 2016 in mountain catchments flash floods are usually the consequence of short high intensity episodes of rainfall of mainly convective origin and that are often orographically enhanced gaume et al 2009 borga et al 2014 mitková et al 2018 bryndal et al 2020 in inland continental europe catchments affected by flash floods are usually smaller than 40 km2 in area bryndal et al 2017 hence these floods often have geomorphological effects on a local scale and have a powerful impact on the development of local morphology gorczyca 2007 these floods may also produce significant changes in the pre flood landforms that persist over several years and could not have been accomplished by less intense floods of longer duration hicks et al 2005 the hydrological parameters and geomorphological impacts of flash floods result from meteorologically derived triggering

flash floods develop on spatial and temporal scales that conventional measurement networks designed to measure rain and river discharges are not able to sample effectively these events are particularly difficult to observe borga et al 2014 this difficulty is very apparent in the flysch carpathians where flash floods most often occur in catchments of up to 15 km2 in area therefore each analysis of a flood event combined with an explanation of the natural and man made factors attributing to the flood is crucial to understanding these phenomena this understanding in turn is crucial for planning and establishing management processes at the catchment scale an extraordinary rainstorm occurred in the western part of the gorce mountains western carpathians poland fig 1 a on 18 july 2018 the rainfall generated flash floods in several tributaries of the ochotnica and kamienica river systems fig 1a this event created an opportunity to assess the impact of the extreme rainfall and flash floods in terms of geomorphological channel changes in two small each covering 12 km2 catchments jamne and jaszcze where geomorphological monitoring has been conducted since 2013 the main aim of this study was to examine whether an integrated approach allows assessments of the impacts of extreme events on the geomorphological changes in mountain catchment to be made the specific objectives were to i describe the meteorological setting of the heavy rainfall and the hydrological responses of the unmanaged catchments and ii evaluate how extreme hydro meteorological events affect geomorphological changes in stream channels associated with different land uses and cover in this study it was assumed that an integrated post event analysis using a variety of different methods would allow the reconstruction of the culmination and course of a flash flood a process that is crucial in flood risk management especially considering the ongoing climate changes taking place 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the gorce mountains in the flysch part of the polish western carpathians fig 1 this mountain range has an area of about 550 km2 is of medium height and is dissected deeply detailed studies were carried out in the jamne 49 30 50 n 20 14 54 e and jaszcze 49 30 36 n 20 14 34 e catchments which are located in the ochotnica dolna commune the jamne and jaszcze catchments covering 8 95 km2 and 11 39 km2 respectively are underlain by flysch rocks of the magura nappe that consist of alternating sandstone and shale layers high ridges 1000 1250 m a s l and deep v shaped valleys dissecting up to 300 600 m are the main relief forms steep slopes with inclinations 15 cover more than 70 of the jamne and jaszcze catchments fig 1b sandy loam podzols with a high proportion of rock fragments developed on the sandstone bedrock and luvisols with large contents of silt formed on shale outcrops niemirowski 1974 the lower and middle parts of the jamne and jaszcze catchments are located in a temperate cool zone between 650 and 1100 m a s l while the upper parts occupy a cool zone 2 4 c hess 1965 mean annual precipitation reaches 841 1972 2018 mm and the highest mean monthly values are typically recorded in july 122 mm ochotnica górna station at 610 m a s l fig 2 c the jamne and jaszcze catchments have environmental features that are representative of the mid mountain part of the polish carpathians the jamne valley is wider has gentler slopes a greater proportion of areas with southern aspects and a larger contribution of deep and less rocky soils in comparison to the jaszcze valley the jamne catchment has climatic and soil conditions that are more favourable for agricultural development thus it is more deforested and has a higher proportion of agricultural land than the jaszcze catchment in 2015 forests covered 61 5 of the jamne catchment and 80 3 of the jaszcze catchment as a consequence of socio economic changes that occurred after 1989 there was a notable decline in cultivated land bucała hrabia 2018 the area covered by cultivated land decreased from over 90 in 1977 to less than 1 in the jamne catchment and 0 5 in jaszcze catchment in 2015 fig 1c 2 2 meteorological setting of the july 2018 flood the meteorological setting of the july 2018 flood was described using a synoptic map developed by the institute of meteorology and water management polish research institute imigw pib fig 2a the precipitation was reconstructed based on the hourly rainfall totals mm h 1 measured by telemetry type rainfall gauges

had been located c a 12 km downstream in a straight line close to the mouth of the ochotnica river a 108 km2 which drains into to the dunajec river fig 1a the peak discharges of the july 2018 flood into the jamne and jaszcze catchments were estimated after the flood event in order to minimize uncertainties related to flood peak assessments field study data were utilized and the verification process was performed in accordance with flash flood and post flood field investigation guidance gaume and borga 2008 lumbroso and gaume 2012 a field study was conducted in early august after the flood event the highest floodwater stages were marked at cross sections c3m in the jamne stream and c4m in the jaszcze stream fig 3 a geodetic measurements were performed two weeks later and included the cross sections and the slopes impacted by the highest flood water stage the flow velocity was calculated using manning s equation lambor 1971 1 v 1 n r 2 3 s 1 2 where v represents the flow velocity m s 1 r is the hydraulic radius m s is the slope of the highest flood water stage dimensionless and n represents manning s roughness coefficient it was estimated based on the field observations and tables chow 1959 for channel beds and riparian vegetation mainly flow velocity was verified via a cross check comparison with the flow velocities reported by marchi et al 2010 and lumbroso and gaume 2012 for flash floods in europe the flood peak qf m3 s 1 was calculated as a product of the cross section area m2 and flow velocity m s 1 the field studies were supported with a hydrological modelling approach designed to complement hydrological investigations in ungauged catchments gaume and borga 2008 based on previous flash flood studies in the polish carpathians bryndal et al 2017 two hydrological models namely soil conservation service curve number scs cn and soil conservation service unit hydrograph scs uh were used mistra and singh 2003 hydrologic modeling system 2015 these two models in spite of their limitations and uncertainties as discussed in the literature e g feldman 2000 and mistra and singh 2003 have yielded the best results in terms of flood peak reconstruction bryndal et al 2010a b c the hourly rainfall data from the ochotnica górna studzionki and turbacz telemetry type rainfall stations located close to the catchments see fig 1 was averaged and then used to provide the input data for the scs cn model the small sizes of the catchments each less than 12 km2 in area justified the assumption of uniform rainfall distribution the cn curve was calculated according to the soil s antecedent moisture conditions amc and evaluated on the basis of a five day period mistra and singh 2003 in this case amc level ii and a coefficient of initial loss of 0 15 were assumed the lag time tlag required for the scs uh model was calculated according to the following equation national engineering handbook 2010 2 t l a g l 3 28 10 3 0 8 1000 c n 9 0 7 1900 i where l is the length of the longest drainage path km i represents the average catchment slope and cn is the cn parameter the quality of the hydrological data obtained as a result of hydrological modelling and post flood field investigation was verified via a cross check comparison the hydrologically simulated flood peak qfs m3 s 1 was compared to the flood peak qf m3 s 1 calculated after the flood event and the percent differences were calculated for the c3m and c4m cross sections the input data required that the hydrological models be obtained from a geodatabase consisting of a raster type digital elevation model 1 1 m developed from als lidar data land use and land cover maps at a scale of 1 50 000 and a soil map at a scale of 1 25 000 the parameters required for the hydrological models catchment size relief conditions the cn parameter variables for eq 1 percentage of unpaved areas were calculated using arc gis 9 3 software whereas the hydrological modelling was performed using hec hms software hydrologic modeling system 2015 to compare and explain geomorphological channel changes in the monitored cross sections flood wave parameters were reconstructed for the c1 c2 c4 jamne catchment and c1 c3 jaszcze catchment cross sections using the hydrological modelling approach the flood peak cross sections were compared to p probable floods in order to evaluate the magnitude of the flood the p probable floods were calculated using the so called rainfall formula a regional type of equation used in poland for catchments of up to 50 km2 biernat et al 1991 the flood magnitudes recorded in the jamne and jaszcze streams were compared to other local flash floods that had taken place in the carpathians the comparison was made using the unit flood peak m3 s 1 km 2 and k flood index a non dimensional measure that allows for the comparison of flood magnitudes between catchments in different areas the k flood index developed by françou and rodier 1969 is calculated as follows 3 k 10 1 l o g q m a x 6 l o g a 8 where qmax represents the flood peak m3 s 1 and a is the catchment area km2 the higher the k index value the more severe the flood event 2 4 mapping of geomorphological changes fieldwork was carried out during two visits to the study catchments that took place a week after the flood and in early august the field work involved geomorphological mapping of the effects of the rainfall event using a topographic map at a scale of 1 10 000 for the entire lengths of the analysed channels additionally field work in the jamne and jaszcze catchments aimed at recognizing changes in the location of the channel beds on the basis of geodetic measurements of the channels in selected cross sections in the upper middle and lower parts of the streams three cross sections in each channel in the jamne cross sections c1 c2 and c4 were located 4 0 1 8 and 0 2 km upstream from the stream mouth to the ochotnica river respectively fig 3a table 1 in the jaszcze cross sections c1 c2 and c3 were located 6 8 4 7 and 0 7 km from the stream mouth to the ochotnica river respectively fig 3a table 1 in both streams the cross sections were representative of different parts of the catchments fig 3a geomorphological changes in particular changes in the channel beds were characterized with respect to the cross sections the impact of the floodwater on the stream channel was expressed quantitatively via the stream power ω w m 1 and unit stream power ω w m 2 indexes the first parameter which represents the rate of energy expenditure per unit channel length was computed as 4 ω γ s qf where γ is the specific weight of water 9810 n m 3 s is the energy slope of a channel dimensionless and qf is the peak flood discharge m3 s 1 the second parameter which represents the rate of energy expenditure per unit channel area was computed as 5 ω γ s qf w 1 where w represents the channel width at the peak flood stage m additionally a part of the right bank of the jamne stream where erosional changes were the most pronounced 49 32 25 n 20 13 53 e 65 m long was surveyed via terrestrial laser scanning tls tls measurements were obtained with a long range impulse scanner riegl vz 4000 at a spatial data acquisition speed of about 222 000 points per second the accuracy of the scanner measurements is 15 mm and their precision is 10 mm to determine the impact of the flood on the scale of the bank erosion data from the tls were compared with als data airborne laser scanning from the national protection against extreme hazards isok project of 2013 the 2013 als survey was carried out using a riegl lms q680i scanner with a density of 4 6 points per m2 and a pulse repetition frequency of 300 khz the data were processed using riscan pro software including the multi station adjustment msa module which generates planes from point clouds and then aligns them based on similarities and their spatial distribution the vegetation was filtered out and the processed data were converted into las 1 2 format to identify qualitative and spatial changes between 2013 and 2018 further analyses were carried out using arcgis 10 1 software s dem of difference dod tool 3 results 3 1 meteorological conditions during the july 2018 flood the intense precipitation in july 2018 was induced by cyclonic situations with a marked air advection from the north sector n and ne fig 2a a low pressure area over north beralus and russia which reached central europe from the adriatic sea produced downpours in the western carpathians at the same time a high pressure area above western europe was growing leading to an inflow of humid air from the ne which piled up in the successive ranges of the carpathians as a result of the forced ascent of this air a thick layer of rain clouds formed from which rain fell continuously for several days initially on 17 july the highest rainfall in the polish western carpathians was recorded in the silesian beskid mountains szczyrk 71 mm wisła malinka 65 mm and in the tatra mountains dolina pięciu stawów 111 mm morskie oko 67 mm hala gąsienicowa 56 mm the highest rainfall amounts in the polish carpathians were recorded on 18 july with the maximum daily total of 208 mm recorded at the hala gąsienicowa station at the ochotnica górna station the nearest station to the jamne and jaszcze streams the rainfall amounted to 103 1 mm fig 2b it was the highest total precipitation recorded by this station since 1970 niemirowski 1974 the highest hourly total of 26 2 mm was recorded at this station on 18 july between 16 and 17 h utc the three hour total for the period during which the rainfall intensity was the highest 15 18 utc reached 62 5 mm 3 2 hydrological response the largest flash flooding was observed in the catchments that drain the southern slopes of the jaworzyna kamienicka and gorc ridges fig 1a the jamne and jaszcze catchments cover the area affected by the heavy rainfall the peak discharge and the unit peak discharge calculated after the flood event for the two cross sections located in the lower parts of these catchments amounted to 42 6 m3 s 1 4 8 m3 s 1 km 2 in the jamne stream c3m and 46 5 m3 s 1 4 1 m3 s 1 km 2 in the jaszcze stream c4m the peak discharges in both streams exceeded jaszcze or were close to jamne 0 1 probable flood table 1 the flow velocities calculated with manning s equation ranged between 3 3 and 4 6 m s 1 hydrological modelling was performed in order to complement the post flooding investigations and to verify the hydrological data via a cross check comparison the input data required for the hydrological models and the results of the modelling are presented in table 2 the peak discharge simulated with the scs cn and scs uh hydrological models qfs is similar to the data obtained during the post flooding investigation qf the differences amounted to 2 0 c4m cross section in jaszcze and 3 3 c3m cross section in jamne respectively see table 2 it is notable that the time to peak simulated by the hydrological models 20 p m l t is comparable to those provided by eyewitness reports since the hydrologically simulated qfs and measured peak discharges qf are comparable the differences are all lower than 3 3 the hydrological data can be considered to be of fair quality meaning that the models can be used to reconstruct flood waves in the cross sections located in the upper c1 and middle c2 parts of the catchments fig 2 table 1 according to the hydrological models the peak discharge in the headwater part of the jamne catchment c1 amounted to 28 4 m3 s 1 and was a little higher than the 0 1 probable flood discharge 27 6 m3 s 1 in the middle part c2 the peak flow was 32 9 m3 s 1 and was a little lower than the 0 2 probable flood discharge 36 5 m3 s 1 in the jaszcze catchment the peak flow of the headwater part c1 was 16 1 m3 s 1 and was a little lower than the 1 probable flood discharge 17 2 m3 s 1 in the middle part of this stream c2 the peak flow amounted to 34 2 m3 s 1 and was comparable to the 0 5 probable flood discharge 37 9 m3 s 1 the unit peak discharge ranged from 4 6 to 4 8 m3 s 1 km 2 in the jamne catchment and from 4 1 4 5 m3 s 1 km 2 in the jaszcze catchment table 1 destruction of the water gauge at tylmanowa during the analysed floods made it impossible to specify the peak flow at the lowermost reach of the ochotnica river 3 3 geomorphological effects of extreme rainfall in the jamne and jaszcze catchments based on geomorphological mapping the largest geomorphological channel transformations took place in the jamne catchment as bank erosion dominated the entire length of the stream old bank undercuts were refreshed and new ones up to 3 5 m high developed as a result of lateral erosion the channel were widened 2 3 m on average a comparison of the als derived dem from 2013 and the tls measurements performed after the flood revealed that the banks retreated by up to 12 m fig 4 the area covered by these eroded banks and the volume of material removed from these banks were calculated as 248 m2 and 312 5 m3 respectively the heights of these bank undercuts ranged from 0 82 m to 1 73 m 1 26 m average in additionally due to the erosion of the banks the local road was destroyed in five places in one place the section of road that was destroyed was about 75 m long additionally floodwaters eroded furrows 0 5 m deep 1 2 m wide and about 20 m long in the damaged road the maximum lateral erosion of the left bank in the jamne channel reached 15 m and destroyed the local road along a total length of about 30 m fig 5 in the jaszcze channel lateral erosion occurred in only a few places resulting in bank retreats of up to 3 m as a result of bank erosion three concrete structures were washed away and ca 30 m of the local road was destroyed in the jamne channel boulders up to 150 cm in diameter eroded from channel banks were transported and deposited on the channel bed in both the jamne and jaszcze channels new gravel bars were deposited and the old ones were cut up and transformed the flood also caused considerable deepening of the jamne channel with its depth increasing by about 1 5 m moreover in the jamne stream floodwaters cut new channels of 30 40 m in length and troughs about 1 8 m deep exposing bedrock 3 4 changes in the channel beds indicated by geodetic measurements in monitored cross sections geomorphic changes in the study cross sections of the jamne c1 c2 c4 and jaszcze c1 c3 streams between 2013 or 2014 and 2018 are presented in figs 5 7 additionally table 3 presents the extent of the erosional and depositional changes in the cross sections between 2014 and 2018 cross section c1 in the jamne stream is located in the forested upper part of the catchment its bed is cut into bedrock and follows a straight course along almost its entire length there is a gravel bar on the left bank for this cross section the peak discharge resulting from the july 2018 flood calculated using the slope area method qf was 28 4 m3 s 1 and unit stream power at the flood peak was 2769 wm 2 the highest among the studied cross sections for both streams table 4 fig 3a about 20 m downstream of cross section c1 the right channel bank is eroded intensely during every flood see the results of the tls measurements in cross section c2 the channel banks are not forested and the stream runs a straight course in the middle part of the valley there is a gravel bar on the left side the peak discharge of the flood was 14 higher here than in cross section c1 table 4 and the unit stream power was 72 lower than in c1 upstream of the studied cross section the stream course meanders slightly the third cross section c4 is located in the lower part of the valley where the stream is cut into bedrock with numerous bedrock steps and exposures the peak flood discharge at c4 was 42 6 m3s 1 and the unit stream power was 1538 wm 2 in the jaszcze stream cross section c1 was located in a deep and forested part of the valley the stream runs a straight course and there is gravel bar on the right side the peak flood discharge at c1 was 16 1 m3 s 1 and attained a comparable steam power value 2703 wm 2 to that of cross section c1 of the jamne stream table 4 fig 3a there are bedrock steps above cross section c1 the second cross section c2 is located in the middle part of the valley the stream flows in a straight channel and both banks are covered by shrubs and small trees the stream bed is covered with gravel material at c2 the peak flood discharge was 47 higher than it was at c1 the third cross section c3 is located in the lower part of the valley where the stream runs a straight course its bed is covered with gravel and its banks are not forested there is a gravel bar on the left side close to a bedrock step at cross section c3 the peak flood discharge was 45 0 m3 s 1 and the unit stream power was 767 wm 2 below this cross section about 250 m further along there are concrete banks on both channel sides leading up to a stream estuary above the studied cross section the stream meanders and is deeply incised into the bedrock and there are numerous bedrock steps more dynamic changes occurred in the jamne stream as the result of the flood and the erosion and deposition of material were greater than in the jaszcze stream except for the upper part of the stream table 3 in the upper and middle cross sections c1 c2 of the jamne stream the deposition of material exceeded erosion 1 9 m2 in the lower course the channel was almost exclusively modelled by erosion 4 30 m2 table 3 the maximum incision in the jamne stream was 131 cm in cross section c4 where the channel bed also widened by 2 m fig 6 in the jaszcze stream erosion prevailed in the upper c1 and lower c3 cross sections and was greatest at c1 4 71 m2 which confirms the high unit stream power calculated for this cross section table 4 in the middle course of the jaszcze stream c2 deposition was the predominant process 0 74 m2 the maximum deepening of the jaszcze channel reached 124 cm in the upper cross section c1 fig 7 4 discussion rainfall recorded in july 2018 in southern poland with daily totals exceeding 100 mm led to channel transformations of the jamne and jaszcze streams and was caused by a north east cyclonic situation nec this type of circulation is one of three types apart from nc northern cyclonic situation and bc resulting from low pressure different directions of air flow and a frontal system along the axis through bc of situations responsible for triggering the most extreme precipitation conditions in the polish carpathians niedźwiedź 2003a niedźwiedź and łupikasza 2016 in addition niedźwiedź and łupikasza 2016 showed an increase in the frequency of this type of air circulation and the crucial role of orography in the formation of intense precipitation in the carpathians in addition in central europe these typical cyclonic circulation types with air advection from the north sector have been responsible for extreme precipitation induced floods niedźwiedź 2003b james et al 2004 fieldwork revealed a large scale transformation in the unmanaged jamne and jaszcze valleys studies conducted by ballesteros cánovas et al 2016 in the tatra mountains and mitková et al 2018 in slovakia showed the importance of analysis and the reconstruction of events in unmanaged catchments a direct cause of the changes in the jaszcze and jamne valleys was the extreme rainfall in july 2018 that caused the flash flood the highest intensity of the rainfall which was more than 0 4 mm min 1 was recorded between 16 and 18 h utc on 18 july with a total of 62 5 mm recorded during that time period the maximum daily total precipitation at the ochotnica górna station during this event was 103 1 mm 18 july higher daily rainfall totals at this station were only recorded during the flood of july 1970 when maximum daily precipitation amounted to 154 9 mm niemirowski 1974 even during the catastrophic flood of 1997 in the vistula basin total daily precipitation in the study area was only 70 mm similar daily precipitation values were noted in 2008 76 3 mm and 2014 82 0 mm bucała 2009 bucała et al 2016 the flow velocities at the flood peak varied in the jamne and jaszcze streams were between 3 3 and 4 6 m s 1 these values are comparable to the flow velocities reported for other flash floods in europe e g marchi et al 2010 lumbroso and gaume 2012 the maximum discharges of these two streams calculated using the slope area method reached 42 6 and 46 5 m3 s 1 respectively it is worth noting that these peak flood discharges constitute c a 50 of the maximum flow 79 8 m3 s 1 recorded during the years 1971 2011 at the tylmanowa station on the ochotnica river located ca 12 km downstream in a straight line which characterizes this catchment area of 108 km2 kijowska strugała and bucała hrabia 2019 this comparison reflects the scale of the flood event recorded on 18 july 2018 the extraordinary occurrence of this flood can also be seen in a comparison with other flash floods reported in the carpathians table 5 includes the greatest flash flood events in the polish and slovakian carpathians that occurred in catchments that are comparable to the jamne and jaszcze catchments in terms of area 3 12 km2 only the romanian part of carpathians represented by three events the literature lacks data for catchments in the range of 3 12 km2 bryndal et al 2017 taking into account the k index the flood on 18 july 2018 is ranked 12th among all flash flood events reported in the carpathians but it ranks 4th in floods in the polish part of the carpathians the unit flood peak 4 1 4 8 m3 s 1 km 2 situates the flood in 20th place on the list of carpathian floods table 5 these values are reflected in the geomorphological transformation of the stream channel in mountain catchments flash floods are usually the consequence of short high intensity rainfalls borga et al 2014 for example in slovakia over the past decade catastrophic flash floods occurred at the malá svinka gidra parná and varínka streams all with catchments areas of 30 40 km2 svoboda and peka rova 1998 mitková et al 2018 in these events the average rainfall was 80 100 mm over 2 h and the unit peak flooding ranged from 1 5 m3 s 1 km 2 to 6 8 m3 s 1 km 2 svoboda and peka rova 1998 and mitková et al 2018 explained that the primary causes of these flash floods were the high precipitation totals and the initial soil moisture conditions in the catchments in addition gaál et al 2012 showed that in the flysch catchments there is a tendency towards a flashy reaction to precipitation mainly due to flow paths that are near the surface with little infiltration as well as shallow soils which enhances faster flood response and increases soil erosion the debate on the impact of the magnitude of the flood on geomorphic changes in the catchments is still valid essentially large floods can have the greatest impact on geomorphic transformations baker 1977 pickup 1991 meanwhile floods with very steep rising limbs and of very short duration low total energy expenditure can have a small geomorphic impacts costa and o connor 1995 magilligan et al 1998 the role of other factors is often comparable to or even more important than that of the magnitude of the flood in the geomorphic changes in the jamne and jaszcze catchments phillips 2002 thus the same discharge value may interact with the channel in a different way in another time or place the spatial extent of the rainstorm with high its discharge and unit stream power during the flash flood in jamne and jaszcze catchment in july 2018 caused geomorphic changes in the stream channels according to miller 1990 and nanson and croke 1992 flash floods typically have a high unit stream power of more than 300 w m 2 depending on hydrologic and topographic factors the high unit stream power values obtained for this study s cross sections above 750 w m 2 were associated with the small widths and steep slopes of the channels the highest unit stream power of 2769 w m 2 was found for cross section c1 of the jamne stream which has a catchment area of 3 2 km2 the investigation of the selected cross sections showed that the unit stream power decreased non linearly with increasing catchment area fig 8 this is consistent with the outcomes of research conducted in central and southern europe by marchi et al 2016 in this region the maximum unit stream power values were recorded during flash floods in areas 10 km2 the analysed flash flood caused geomorphic changes in all analysed cross sections alluvial and semi alluvial however high unit stream power does not imply large changes in channel morphology this finding is in line with the results obtained by marchi et al 2016 the unit stream power values for the analysed cross sections of the two streams were similar but more dynamic and geomorphological changes were recorded in the jamne stream where both erosion and the deposition of material exceeded those components for the jaszcze stream with the exception of the upper part of the jaszcze cross section c1 with the greatest erosion 4 71 m2 geodetic measurements of the channel taken at the selected cross sections in may 2013 along with t repeated measurements taken in april 2014 showed that the common morphological change taking place in the channels of both streams was the deepening in their forested upper parts and in their lower parts bucała et al 2016 accompanied by a slight accumulation of material especially in the jaszcze stream in the middle parts of the streams the changes were not so clear especially in the jamne stream where erosion and accumulation occurred in equal measure whereas in the jaszcze stream accumulation was dominant bucała et al 2016 on 15 may 2014 a flood occurred which was caused by continuous rainfall and a daily total of 82 0 mm by comparing the cross sections made before and after the flood in 2014 a deepening in the lower part of the streams was found along with a slight accumulation of material bucała et al 2016 geomorphological effects of the flood were consistent with this tendency however the erosion was about 760 greater in the jamne stream and about 185 greater in the jaszcze stream in july 2018 additionally the impact of the july 2018 flood included land use and land cover changes which played important roles in the transformation of the studied channels especially the jamne stream more deforested in the lower sections of the jamne and jaszcze streams a common feature of the floods of 2013 2014 and 2018 was erosion and incision it is interesting that the highest erosion 4 3 m2 in the jamne channel was recorded in cross section c4 which has a semi alluvial channel the left bank retreated by 2 m considerable erosion in this part was associate with a high maximum discharge of 42 6 m3 s 1 and a unit stream power of 1538 w m 2 in the jamne catchment which was more deforested a greater transformation in the stream channel in relation to the jaszcze catchment was also observed during the floods in 1970 and 1997 niemirowski 1974 bucała 2009 moreover observations made in jamne and jaszcze catchments indicate that despite a rapid abandonment of cultivated land and cart tracks after 1989 the past land use structure still has a noticeable impact on contemporary concentrations of suspended sediment in the stream this impact was clearly visible during two floods that occurred in both catchments on 7 july 2013 local downpour of 21 2 mm in 4 h and 15 may 2014 continuous rainfall of 82 mm in 24 h the jamne stream which had a higher contribution of cultivated land in the past compared to the jaszcze stream had a 130 higher concentration of suspended sediment and a higher proportion of fine particles eroded from cultivated land in the past bucała hrabia 2018 5 conclusions the flash flood that occurred on 18 july 2018 in the two small catchments jamne and jaszcze in the gorce mountains polish carpathians was the largest since 1970 the flood was caused by a daily total of 103 1 mm of rain it was the highest daily precipitation recorded at the ochotnica górna station since 1970 a maximum peak flow was recorded a few hours after the maximum rainfall indicating a rapid runoff response the analysis showed that the results obtained from the hydrological models scs cn and scs uh are compatible with those obtained on the basis of geodetic measurements of selected channel cross sections 3 differences and thus can be used to reconstruct flood peaks in mountain streams without hydrological stations taking the k index into account the flood of 18 july 2018 is among the 10 largest events reported in the carpathians the geomorphic impact of the flash flood was significant in these channel systems especially the jamne stream bank erosion and channel incision were common in both streams the high values of discharge above 16 m3 s 1 and unit stream power above 750 w m 2 were associated with high rainfall and catchment parameters narrow channels and steep slopes at the same time other studies have shown that high unit stream power does not necessarily imply large changes in channel morphology as such changes may be related to other factors a significant role of land use and land cover on geomorphic changes has been demonstrated in the jamne catchment the observed dimensions of erosion and deposition in the lower part of the catchment were 70 and 54 higher than in the more forested jaszcze catchment during the event coarse bed material 150 cm was transported this study which was carried out on small mountain catchments indicated the important role of flash floods in the transformation of mountain channel systems the research provided evidence that the intensities of hydrological processes during extreme events have a powerful impact on the transformation of local morphology these significant geomorphological changes of the stream channel happen more quickly than in lowland rivers due to rainfall amounts steep channel

8331,study region ghana is located in west africa by the coast with the majority of the annual rainfall coming from the west african monsoon study focus thanks to a new dense long term dataset the spatial structure of rainfall for the different phases of the monsoon has been investigated previous studies have only considered a general decorrelation range whereas in this study a novel approach of estimating the decorrelation rate depending on the intensity of the rainfall event has been implemented the anisotropic pattern at the subweekly and local scale was also modelled new hydrological insights for the region the spatial correlation structure of rainfall varies greatly with the intensity of the rainfall event and the phase of the monsoon with a much shorter range for low intensity rainfall compared to other intensities at the very local scale 10 km there is a much larger variation over the year at the lower intensities compared to the heavier indicating a larger variation in the structure of the convective systems generating low amount rainfall compared to heavy rainfall systems the westward propagation of convective systems can be seen even at short aggregation periods and local scale keywords ghana decorrelation range rainfall climatology anisotropy 1 introduction rainfall over west africa has received a lot of interest the past decades due to the limited possibility of irrigation for the many farmers depending on rain fed crops in ghana 50 of the population depend on rain fed crops srid ministry of food and agriculture 2017 and a large part of the country s energy come from hydropower from the lake volta nyarko kumi 2017 which makes the hydrological cycle of great importance because of the sparse rain gauge network over most parts of africa washington et al 2004 some research has been done on describing the rainfall distribution over time for a specific station and then extrapolating this knowledge to the surrounding region e g nicholson et al 2000 one problem with this approach is the highly variable weather over west africa which makes it difficult to extrapolate knowledge outside a very small region leading to large uncertainties the majority of the west african rainfall comes from the west african monsoon which is controlled by the movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz an area where the south east and north east trade winds meet and a belt of convective clouds is present due to this convergence and the high amount of energy from the sun the movement of the itcz results in high variability in rainfall over the year and the convective nature of the rainfall is one of the reasons for the high variability in both time and space on a daily scale there has also been a lot of research done using satellite rainfall estimates calibrated against the sparse network of ground stations or using reanalysis products which in general performs worse at finer scales in the tropics when compared to gauge measurements diro et al 2009 maidment et al 2017 and references therein to get a more realistic description of the spatial rainfall distribution and to generate spatially accurate satellite rainfall estimates several papers have modelled the spatial covariance over either all of africa or a specific country or region this has been done using satellite data e g funk et al 2015 smith et al 2005 and rain gauge data moron et al 2007 ricciardulli and sardeshmukh 2002 greatrex et al 2014 both of these types of dataset have their individual issues when collected over africa satellite products may not represent fine scale variability accurately maidment et al 2017 but rain gauge data on the other hand is usually very sparse which again leads to issues when modelling the small scale behaviour greatrex et al 2014 moron et al 2007 a general problem is the lack of long time series making it difficult to describe the full interannual variability greatrex et al 2014 ricciardulli and sardeshmukh 2002 used 3 years of cloud observation data transformed into a deep convection activity index with a resolution of 0 35 0 7 covering the entire tropics to model the correlation distance they only focused on modelling the decorrelation distance for deep convection clouds for all active months hence not making a distinction between the different phases of the monsoon cycle with this method they were not able to capture rainfall events related to any processes other than deep convection young et al 2014 both a method of estimating the distance until the correlation was less than 1 e and a method to estimate the distance at which the conditional probability of rainfall given that it rains at the grid point approaches the overall probability of rainfall was used in south west africa the decorrelation distance was estimated to 150 180 km with the second method resulted in the larger distances compared to the first method funk et al 2015 instead used 0 05 resolution 5 day cumulative cold cloud duration ccd data to estimate the decorrelation distance for each month separately their method instead involves to estimate the average correlation at 1 5 around the grid point and then calculate the decorrelation slope by assuming the correlation to be 1 at distance 0 from this slope the distance at which the correlation should be 0 was estimated this method results in decorrelation distances of 500 800 km over south west africa the longer range in previous studies is likely to be due to the use of 5 day rather than daily values one limitation of using ccd instead of gauge measurements is that decorrelation in ccd is not equivalent to the decorrelation range in rainfall in contrast to the other two papers moron et al 2007 calculated the decorrelation distance between measured rainfall at stations instead of satellite grid points this was calculated for five different tropical regions to assess the generality of the results on amount and occurrence data separately by estimating the pearson s correlation for amount data and phi correlation for occurrence one major limitation in this paper is the small number of stations for each region 9 11 13 28 81 which results in very wide distance bins 100 km and only a few station pairs in each bin another method for estimating the correlation distance is to derive a variogram a variogram describes the variance structure between locations depending on the distance between them in both greatrex et al 2014 and teo and grimes 2007 climatology variograms are calculated on rain gauge data to estimate the range of rainfall over ethiopia and gambia both of these papers split the analysis for occurrence and positive rainfall amounts similar to moron et al 2007 this is because the dependence structure in occurrence and amount are showed to not necessarily be equal and furthermore total rainfall amount over some period is not entirely dependent on the frequency of rainfall event teo and grimes 2007 face the same limitation as moron et al 2007 with only 20 stations however distributed on a small area resulting in a relatively dense network the range for occurrence and positive rainfall amounts are 50 km and 150 km hence substantially shorter than the once estimated by funk et al 2015 but similar to ricciardulli and sardeshmukh 2002 greatrex et al 2014 has a much larger dataset of 276 stations but is limited to only 5 years of data and the stations are very unevenly distributed over the country with a complex topography many of the variograms in the paper do not have a clearly defined range and thus a clear correlation distance is difficult to determine the difference in correlation distance can partly be explained by the use of different methods and data types but some stems from the use of different countries since the decorrelation range varies greatly across africa funk et al 2015 two common assumptions are that the rainfall distribution will be equal for all rainfall events and the distribution is equal in all directions but in the recent paper of maranan et al 2018 it was showed that even though the vast majority of the annual amount of rainfall comes from mesoscale convective systems mcss moderate and strong convection has the highest frequency of events many rainfall processes are moreover anisotropic especially at the daily scale there has been some work done on anisotropy in africa but this has either just been done on very small areas gyasi agyei and pegram 2014 ali et al 2003 or using covariates to remove the spatial variability laux et al 2009 the results in this paper will help to close the knowledge gap between the statistics on a station level and on the large scale behaviour 400 km by describing the covariance behaviour on daily rainfall at the scales of 10 150 km this analysis is made possible by a completely new and unique dataset from the ghana met agency comprising 590 stations with daily rainfall measurements ghana is chosen as our study region due to this unique dataset in combination with its varying rainfall behaviour both in time and space due to the itcz we will be using the method of conditional probabilities from ricciardulli and sardeshmukh 2002 because of the easily interpretable results and the possibility to establish a rainfall reference probability the results will also provide a better understanding of the spatial behaviour of different intensities of rainfall events over west africa by modelling their dependence structures separately the final contribution is an anisotropic description of rainfall showing the impact of large scale drivers on the local scale the remainder of the paper is organised as follows an introduction of the study area the dataset and the methods used to model the co occurrence will be presented in section 2 results on the rainfall climatology and the spatial distribution will be given in section 3 and the paper will end with a discussion in section 4 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area ghana is located in the guinea coast with boarders to burkina faso côte d ivoire and togo fig 1 it has five distinct geographical areas low plains in the south the volta basin in the centre with the artificial lake lake volta the akwapim togo ranges to the east of the volta basin with many heights and folded strata the ashanti uplands to the west and high plains in the north boateng et al 2018 the temperature peaks around february march and is at its lowest around august the rainfall is mainly associated with the west african monsoon which is controlled by the movement of the itcz the country is under the influence of the tropical maritime air mass from march to october during which the rainy season occurs south of 8 n there are two rainy seasons with a short dryer period in august north of 8 n only one long rainy season occur see fig 6 from november to february march the country is affected by the prevailing southward winds called the harmattan which brings dry and dusty air from the sahara and gives rise to the dry season the majority of the rainfall is generated by convective clouds with a higher contributing proportion in the north the coast experiences aside from convective rainfall warm rain processes and advective rainfall from the atlantic ocean 2 2 the dataset the daily rainfall dataset used in this report is provided by the gmet ghana meteorological agency and consists of daily rainfall amounts recorded at 590 stations covering all of ghana with a much higher density of stations in the southern half of the country extensive quality control was performed by the manuscript authors along with a team of experts from the gmet the dataset was assessed for errors in station locations location shifts over time over coastal data erroneous data the relationship with neighbouring stations and erroneous statistics and outliers any data flagged in this process was then checked against the original written records and other sources such as google earth imagery for locations in the case of data that was clearly erroneous the station or a subset was removed the original dataset consisted of 598 stations and 17 008 530 individual station day data points the quality control process led to a reduction of 1 55 of available data with the controlled analysis using 590 stations and 16 744 082 individual data points the dataset spans from 1940 until the end of 2017 with all the time series containing some missing values but several of them only have few missing values in the period 1950 2017 fig 2 shows the number of stations for each month with less than 10 missing values which we will refer to as valid stations fig 4 shows the number of valid stations i e stations with less than 10 missing values for each proportion of valid months in the dataset there is a significant increase in the number of valid stations from 1950 fig 2 and then a steep decrease during the 80s similar to the station pattern found in the datasets used in nicholson et al 2018 fig 3 shows the distribution of the median number of daily reporting stations during the year with the most available stations 1976 and in 2017 the station density has decreased coherently across the whole country however the very sparse network in the north even during 1976 results in extremely few current stations due to the large increase in the number of valid stations in the 50s our statistical analysis can be improved by only including data in the period 1950 2017 which still leaves us longer records than most other studies and includes data both before and after the sahelian drought in the 70s and early 80s brooks 2004 2 3 rainfall climatology because of the missing values some adjustment must be made to the annual and monthly amount totals to compensate for the missing data points instead of using data fill methods such as replacing missing values with the mean median or most frequent measurement the measured annual or monthly amounts are adjusted with a parameter proportional to the number of missing values in that time period this scaling method is favoured over the fill method since we are not attempting to fill in the gaps but rather to compensate for the expected lower amount total due to lower number of recorded days for the monthly totals each rainy day measurement is multiplied by ξ m 1 where ξ m is the proportion of missing observations within that month similarly for the annual totals the total amount is multiplied by ξ y 1 where ξ y is the proportion of missing observations within that year only individual years with less than 20 missing values are used for these maps this to not risk including years where the recorded days do not accurately represent the full year the coefficient of variation is defined as cv s x x where s x is the standard deviation of daily rainfall 1 mm and x is the average rainfall over rainy days this is calculated both for daily values and monthly aggregated values for each station with at least 23 years of data only using the months outside of the dry season for the estimation of the daily cv values from all years are used excluding missing values and amounts lower than 1 mm for the monthly cv estimation only months with 3 missing values are used 2 4 spatial variability in the occurrence of rainfall of varying intensity the analysis is done separately for each month to remove some of the variability due to the different phases of the monsoon and only using every 5th day to work with independent events see fig s1 in the supplementary materials for autocorrelation plots this is done because we are interested in modelling the spatial dependence and not the dependence in time to reduce the noise from large differences in absolute amounts between nearby stations correlograms are estimated from occurrences within amount intervals instead of covariograms on the measured amounts the amount intervals hereafter denoted intensity classes are defined as s 1 1 10 mm s 2 10 30 mm s 3 30 50 mm and s 4 50 mm representing low moderate heavy and very heavy rainfall in order to study how the rainfall dependence changes with intensity of the convective system we calculate the proportion of rain rain occurrences hereafter denoted co occurrence both within an intensity class and between an intensity class and stations in higher or lower intensity classes that is we will estimate the co occurrence probability between only stations that are within the same intensity class and in the setting with the origin station in one intensity class and surrounding stations in the same or higher lower intensity classes due to only using every 5th day we end up with 408 independent time steps 68 years 6 days per month except february for each month only stations south of 8 n with less than 50 missing values in the period 1950 2017 has been used which gives us 232 locations for our analysis the reason for only using stations south of 8 n is two fold firstly by excluding the northern region with a single rainy season all the stations will be in the same rainfall regime rainy or non rainy secondly the dataset is much more dense in the southern region which provides us with more robust estimations 50 missing values is chosen as a trade off between using stations with just a few years long record which might skew the results and discarding information since our method involves taking the average over a very large number of estimates of co occurrences we determined that stations with up to 50 of missing values will not negatively impact the results to model the spatial dependence structure of co occurring rainfall events within an intensity class the second method with conditional probabilities in ricciardulli and sardeshmukh 2002 was used the full algorithms are found in appendix a and a summary of it is presented below algorithm 1 for each unique day transform all amounts that are within our chosen intensity class to a 1 and all other amounts to 0 choose one of the stations assigned a 1 to be the origin station and calculate the distance from this station to all other stations within each 10 km distance bin calculate the proportion of stations assigned a 1 calculate the proportion for all stations assigned a 1 in step 1 and repeat for each unique day by calculating the average in each distance bin we can get a climatological average on the probability of observing rainfall of the same intensity as the origin station for a given distance to model the dependence structure of co occurring rainfall events between an intensity class and either lower or higher intensity classes the above method is used with a few changes transform all amounts that are within our chosen intensity class to a 1 all stations with a measured amount in all lower higher intensity classes with a 2 and all other stations to 0 then calculate the proportion of 1 s and 2 s instead of just 1 s the rest of the algorithm is identical just as for measurements within an intensity class taking the average in each distance bin we can get a climatological average on the probability of observing rainfall of the same intensity or lower higher as the origin station for a given distance to compare our co occurrence probabilities with the climatology background state a 2 step sampling method is used a summary of the algorithm for calculating the background state within intensities is given below algorithm 2 for each unique day calculate the proportion of rainy stations transform all amounts that are within our chosen intensity class to a 1 and all other amounts to 0 choose one of the stations that are assigned a 1 to be the origin station and calculate the distance from this station to all other stations randomly assign rain or no rain to all other station so the proportion equals the measured proportion and for each rainy station randomly assign a measured rainfall amount from that station in that unique month assign a 1 to all stations in the chosen intensity class and calculate the proportion of 1 s in each 10 km distance bin repeat for all stations initially assigned a 1 and for each unique day for the calculation between intensity classes apply the same modification as described for algorithm 1 a schematic overview of the two algorithms can be found in figs b 15 b 17 in appendix b 2 5 anisotropy in spatial rainfall variability to estimate the variation in rainfall variability semivariograms were derived on 2 3 and 5 day rainy aggregated amounts using all intensities to study how the small scale rainfall variability structure is influenced by large scale drivers in our setting let z s i represent the k day aggregated rainfall amount at station s i assuming that the mean and variance of z s are finite the semivariogram is defined as the half mean squared difference γ s i s j 1 2 e z s i e s i z s j e s j 2 i j 1 2 n here we are going to assume that the underlying process z s s 0 generating the k day aggregated rainfall amount is intrinsically stationary and isotropic this simply means that the mean is constant i e e z s μ and the semivariogram only depend on the distance between 2 locations and not the direction hence 1 γ h 1 2 e z s h z h 2 a natural method to estimate the semivariogram is by the method of moments semivariogram which essentially stems from replacing theoretical expectations with the analogous sample averages the corresponding sample semivariogram to eq 1 notably the matheron s classical estimator matheron and blondel 1962 is defined as 2 γ ˆ h δ 1 2 n h δ i j n h δ z i z j 2 where z i is the observed k day aggregated rainfall amount at station s i n h δ is the set of pairs within the spatial lag h δ and n h δ is the number of pairs in that distance range the general shape of semivariograms can characterise and explain the dependence structure in terms of its three main indicators nugget range and sill the nugget is the variance at the close to 0 distance representing the variability at distances of a couple of metres and measurement error the nugget is expected to be small in rainfall data because of very high correlation at small distances the sill is the value that the semivariogram converges to as the distance increases dependence decreases and the range is the distance at which two stations are independent and the sill is reached or 95 of it if only approached asymptotically cressie and wikle 2011 the maximum distance is set to 160 km since we are interested in modelling the small scale behaviour and due to the small area over which this is estimated the estimated semivariance values will be used to calculate the covariogram defined as 3 c h σ 2 γ h where σ 2 is the 0 distance variance because the variance is linear in the number of aggregated days c h is divided by σ 2 to enable us to compare the results from the different aggregation periods by using the covariogram instead of semivariogram we can again compare our estimated values against the theoretical convergence value 0 which is reached when there is no dependence left for quantities with spatial dependence varying with direction an anisotropic model must be applied instead of the isotropic model described in eq 2 isotropic models i e models only depending on distance and not direction can be turned into anisotropic models by replacing the distance parameter h with a distance vector h which then will be associated with both a length and a direction the bin h δ now represents both a distance range and an angular tolerance e g all stations in a 45 segment if we have a dense station network and want to get more detailed information about the spatial distribution one can estimate a covariogram map a covariogram map is a lattice where each square represents a distance and an angle and is symmetric because of the square term in eq 2 to construct a covariogram map select one of the stations and place a square lattice over the region with your chosen station in the centre calculate the difference in k day aggregated amount between your selected station and all other stations calculated the average within each square of the lattice and apply eq 3 repeat this for all stations and all k day periods after taking the average from all the individual maps the resulting map describes the mean behaviour in all directions as we move away from a station hence displaying directions with a stronger correlation a minimum threshold of 1000 pairs for each square is used to make the estimation more robust 3 results 3 1 climatology of rainfall in ghana to describe the climatology of the rainfall in each agro ecological zone shown in fig 5 and defined by gmet owusu and waylen 2009 the four stations marked with red dots are used annual total amount time series box and whisker plots over the monthly total amounts maps of key rainfall estimates and maps of coefficient of variation cv for each month not in the dry season are used to demonstrate this a day is defined as rainy if the measured amount is 1 mm as used by expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi and in several other papers e g moron et al 2007 sillmann et al 2013 30 mm is chosen as the threshold for heavy rainfall because this equals the 10 20 heaviest amounts on rainy days for most of the country combining the information in figs 6 and 7 one can clearly see the reason for the partition with the dry coast region the forest region with a high proportion of rainy days the transition region with much fewer rainy days but still a bimodal rainy season and the north with only one rainy season in some papers the south western coastal region is classified as a separate region which fig 6c confirms with the much higher proportion of days with heavy rainfall in that area one can notice a diagonal band of higher proportion of rainy days from the sw coast up to lake volta with a significantly drier region along the coast this was noted already in acheampong 1982 and was explained by the complex atmospheric interaction in that region we can also see the decreasing trend in rainfall as we move northward in fig 6a matching the movement of the itcz and a decreasing presence of advective rainfall in fig 7 we can clearly see the different rainfall modes with an unimodal rainy season in the north zone and a bimodal in the rest of the country the difference between the bimodal regions is clearly visible with both the major and the minor rainy season being of equal intensity in the forest region whereas the transition region has a slightly more intense minor season and the coast has a much more intense major rainy season compared to the minor the reason for the very intense major season compared to the minor in the coast region is the movement of the itcz which brings a lot of moist air from the ocean as it propagates northward contributing to many days with heavy rainfall a common feature for all regions is the large interannual variation in monthly and annual total amount for all months during the rainy season the range of the whiskers are around 300 mm and the mean rainfall is between 100 250 mm june in accra which is at the peak of the rainy season has the largest range which is 450 mm with a mean of 175 mm there is also a common pattern of a slow increase in mean rainfall up until the peak of the rainy seasons and then a quick decrease as the itcz retracts studying the total annual rainfall in fig 8 one can again see a very large interannual variation for all locations with the biggest spread in the forest and transition regions both of which have two intense rainy seasons despite tamale only experiencing one rainy season the mean annual rainfall is higher than accra due to the longer rainy season accra has the lowest mean annual rainfall of the four stations of around 750 mm year both kintampo and effiduase have mean annual rainfall of around 1400 mm year however effiduase has a varying pattern so the amount fluctuates over the studied time period accra has an interannual range of about 1000 mm tamale 800 mm and kintampo and effiduase of nearly 1500 mm in contrast to owusu and waylen 2009 but similar to lacombe et al 2012 and torgbor et al 2018 it does not appear like the sahelian drought in the 70s and 80s had a big impact on the average annual amount in any of the regions but there is a strong decrease in the variability at tamale and kintampo during this period there is a distinct pattern of lower cv over monthly aggregated values fig 10 than daily values fig 9 meaning that the fluctuations around the long term rainfall mean is much larger than the fluctuations around the monthly mean this is expected due to the convective nature of the rainfall resulting in short intense storms we can also see a more coherent pattern over space in the monthly compared to the daily values the monthly cv values are however still large with a mean value of 1 or higher for nearly all months meaning that the variation around the long term mean is of the same magnitude or larger than the mean this is similar to the results in arvind et al 2017 which looked at monthly values in a region of india but a lot higher than ayanlade et al 2018 which studied a region in nigeria the most northern part of ghana is under the influence of the harmattan in march and november as seen in fig 7 hence the monthly average rainfall is very low which inflates the cv value for the daily values we can see a larger spread during the monsoon phase may october with the exception of june which has one of the smallest spreads this is because the higher mean in june lowers the cv estimate even if the absolute variation is the same as may and july there are no obvious spatial patterns outside the main monsoon season but from june september there is a clear pattern of highest values along the coast which decreases as we move north the monthly values exhibit a different pattern outside the main monsoon in the north october april there is a bimodal pattern with high cv values in the north and along the coast and lower values inland may and june is very non coherent but still with high values along the coast line during the peak of the north rainy season july september there is a clear gradient with high values in the south and low values in the north there is also a west east gradient in the southern part for all months except july october with lower values in the west where we have higher annual rainfall and more rainy days 3 2 spatial distribution of rainfall events in the papers mentioned in the introduction all rainfall events were assumed to have the same spatial variability this must not necessarily be true since we might expect a moderately intense rainfall event to have a larger extent than a low intensity rainfall or an intense shower storm in order to study this the method of conditional probability curves will be applied to the intensity classes described in section 2 4 by comparing our measured results with a random sampling baseline we can separate out the increased probability of rainfall at a station because of rainfall at nearby stations and the overall probability of rainfall due to the time of the year this will both give information about the very local behaviour and the spatial extent for the different intensities in the first section we will model the variability placing the highest intensity class in the origin and in the second section we will model the variability within each intensity class 3 2 1 extent of rainfall events by modelling both the conditional probability of observing rainfall amounts that are higher fig 11 or lower fig s2 in the supplementary material than the origin station we can get information about both the extent of a large rainfall event and the probabilities of observing higher rainfall amounts close to low rainfall by subtracting the reference rainfall probabilities from our measured co occurrence probabilities we can study how the anomalies changes over the season the results shown in fig 11 suggests that low rainfall events are localised whilst heavy rainfall events have a larger spatial structure in fig 11 a and c we can see that the 5 km line very closely follows the baseline showing the small scale behaviour depending on the season this would indicate that low rainfall events are very local resulting in the co occurrence probability depending on the overall probability of rain the peak in august in a is most likely due to the significant difference in the rain intensity distribution in accra for all months except july and august the histogram over rainfall amounts not included are very similar for the three southerly stations used in section 3 1 however in july and august there is much higher probability of low intensity rainfall in accra and since there is a high station density along the coast the results from that region has a higher weighting compared to further north this strong connection with rainfall distribution and co occurrence probability confirms the idea of local low intensity events if we instead consider fig 11 e and g the 5 km line is nearly constant over the year hence the small scale behaviour of heavy events are independent of the overall rainfall probability this suggests that heavier rain events have a larger spatial structure that dominates the area wide behaviour from the anomalies right column fig 11 we can see that the co occurrence probabilities follows the baseline from about 50 km for moderately intense rainfall and from around 100 km for heavy and very heavy rainfall this further confirms that heavier rainfalls have a larger spatial structure the seasonal behaviour in the baseline comes from the changes in probability of rainfall presented in table 1 which impacts the large scale co occurrence probability because of a higher proportion of dry stations from table 2 we can see the number of time steps where the intensity is observed and the total number of observations for each intensity the ratio of these two gives us the average number of stations observing a certain intensity e g 30 50 mm given that at least one station observes that same intensity for very heavy rainfall this ratio varies between 1 2 in the dry season up to 1 6 in june the average is 1 4 during the rainy season except august when this drops to 1 3 this indicates that during the dry season it is more common with just one heavy storm occurring whereas in the rainy season there are on average 4 stations affected by very heavy storms on the same day this can explain the peak in june in the baseline probability and the relatively constant behaviour during the rest of the rainy season except august similarly the peak in october for moderate intense rainfall fig 11 c can be explained by an increase in this ratio from september to october meaning that there is a much higher probability of moderate intense rainfall in other locations in october given that it rains compared to september from the right column of fig 11 we can see that the decorrelation distance increases as we increase the rainfall intensity strengthening our claim no formal statistical test has been applied to test the difference between the anomalies and 0 but by eye we can see that for low intensity rainfall already at 50 km the anomaly is only around 0 05 for moderately intense rainfall the same value is not reached until 100 km away heavy rainfall exhibits a very similar range as moderate rainfall except a slightly larger peak in august very heavy rainfall has not fully converged and therefore reached its decorrelation range even at a distance of 150 km demonstrating a large scale impact on the rainfall probability 3 2 2 spatial variability of rainfall occurrence to better understand the spatial variability of rainfall occurrence for various intensities and thereby the differences in spatial extent of areas with the same rainfall intensity conditional probabilities for the separate intensity classes were calculated the same method as the previous section is used to again enable us to compare the measured probabilities with the climatology fig 12 confirms the pattern in fig 11 with the co occurrence probability for heavy and very heavy rainfall not varying much with the season even at long distances whereas low and moderate rainfall has a strong seasonal pattern from small to large scales the seasonal pattern in the baseline for low and moderate rainfall again highlight the different overall probability during the monsoon season at all distances there is a peak in the probability in august for low brown intensity but a trough for all other intensities this is most likely explained by the higher frequency of small rainfall events compared to other intensities in the short dry season which increases the probability of co occurring low intensity events and decreases the other intensities the climatology co occurring probability of low and moderate blue intense rainfall is however close to identical during the build up phase march may for moderately intense rainfall there is an increasing overall probability until june decreasing during july and august and then increasing again for heavy green and very heavy orange rainfall the climatology probability is relatively constant over time low intensity rainfall has nearly converged to the climatology at 100 km whereas moderately intense rainfall has converged at 150 km hence persistent moderately intense rainfall has a larger extent than persistently low intense rainfall neither heavy nor very heavy rainfall has converged indicating that rainfall events that persistently releases more than 30 mm of rain has a spatial dependence even at 150 km away 3 2 3 spatial shape of rainfall events to study if the large scale drivers such as the east african jet also can be seen on the small scale we estimated covariogram maps using 2 3 and 5 day aggregated june data since the aim here is to look at the potential anisotropic pattern generated by all rainfall we are now including all days without splitting it into intensity classes we know from fig 6 a that there is a strong rainfall gradient in the nw se direction in annual amount but we want to see if there might be a different spatial variability pattern when looking at accumulation over only a few days because of the significantly larger mean and variance in the south west corner fig 13 the following analysis will be done on the indicated region in fig 13 b to work with the assumption of equal mean and variance over the entire region this difference in mean and variance did not affect our previous results since we worked with intensity occurrence instead of amounts covariogram maps were also estimated over the coast region but are excluded due to their very noisy pattern the patterns in the covariogram maps in fig 14 have a lot of similarities for all aggregation periods but some small differences as well one can clearly see a higher correlation distance in the e w direction compared to the n s direction in all aggregation periods there is however no clear difference in the ne sw and nw se direction hence even on a 2 day scale we can see the pattern of dominantly westward propagating convection systems the correlation drops off very rapidly with a correlation of around 0 5 just 20 km away and as we increase the aggregation period the correlation gets coherently increased in all directions the area with a correlation of 0 25 is however extended much further in the e w direction compared to n s demonstrating an increased anisotropic pattern for longer aggregation periods even at 160 km there is some correlation which is due to the climatology similar to the previous results the higher correlation in e w is not due to the fact that the region is wider than long which was checked by doing the same calculation over a square region 4 discussion and conclusion estimating and predicting rainfall over west africa will probably remain a difficult task for some years ahead due to the sparse and degrading rain gauge network in this paper we have provided some insights on the spatial behaviour of daily rainfall within ghana in contrast to previous studies we have not assumed that all rainfall events have the same spatial structure but instead studied the rainfall events split into four different intensity classes to understand differences in the co occurrence structure at small scales over the season we have showed that the conditional probability of observing rainfall of the same intensity varies seasonally for low and moderately intense rainfall but not for heavy and very heavy this might partly be explained by changes in the proportion of rainfall events in each intensity class over the season however the same pattern is observed when treating all lower intensities as occurrences this shows that heavy rainfall events have a stronger influence at the local scale and therefore is not affected by the overall probability of rainfall whereas low and moderate rainfall are much more localised the anomalies structure on the other hand is very similar for all intensities except low demonstrating a different structure in drizzle events compared to other rainfall events our results show a decorrelation distance similar to the one obtained by ricciardulli and sardeshmukh 2002 and positive amount in teo and grimes 2007 but about three times further than their occurrence range this difference probably results from several factors such as the scale difference of gridded data and station data how dense the dataset is and the method used but a non negligible part most likely also comes from the use of different regions because of the complex atmospheric systems over central africa the rainfall structure varies greatly as shown in funk et al 2015 this makes it difficult to directly compare large scale estimates such as correlation ranges with previous studies the small scale estimates on the other hand which mostly depend on the rainfall system and not the current rainfall state could be more comparable assuming the convective systems are similar across the tropics it would however be difficult to compare with european studies since the rainfall there mostly comes from advective systems for the spatial shape of rainfall events even at the small scale it is possible to see the influence of large scale drivers such as the african easterly jet as we increase the accumulation period the covariance range is increased in the e w direction which is the direction of stronger covariance the pattern of stronger correlation at longer accumulation periods was also noted by bacchi and kottegoda 1995 which can be explained by the decreased dependence of the individual rainfall events which are local scale events and more on the large scale drivers which usually affect a hole region the results in this paper demonstrate the issues with describing all rainfall events with the same correlation structure but that we can assume isotropy for short accumulation periods we hope that this method will be applied in other regions since it is easy to adapt by changing the intensity classes to suitable country levels and the results from different studies can be directly compared it would be especially interesting to see how this compares to other tropical regions where we might expect to see the same type of rainfall systems but with a different occurrence distribution compared to our study region author contributions jennifer israelsson methodology formal analysis writing

8331,study region ghana is located in west africa by the coast with the majority of the annual rainfall coming from the west african monsoon study focus thanks to a new dense long term dataset the spatial structure of rainfall for the different phases of the monsoon has been investigated previous studies have only considered a general decorrelation range whereas in this study a novel approach of estimating the decorrelation rate depending on the intensity of the rainfall event has been implemented the anisotropic pattern at the subweekly and local scale was also modelled new hydrological insights for the region the spatial correlation structure of rainfall varies greatly with the intensity of the rainfall event and the phase of the monsoon with a much shorter range for low intensity rainfall compared to other intensities at the very local scale 10 km there is a much larger variation over the year at the lower intensities compared to the heavier indicating a larger variation in the structure of the convective systems generating low amount rainfall compared to heavy rainfall systems the westward propagation of convective systems can be seen even at short aggregation periods and local scale keywords ghana decorrelation range rainfall climatology anisotropy 1 introduction rainfall over west africa has received a lot of interest the past decades due to the limited possibility of irrigation for the many farmers depending on rain fed crops in ghana 50 of the population depend on rain fed crops srid ministry of food and agriculture 2017 and a large part of the country s energy come from hydropower from the lake volta nyarko kumi 2017 which makes the hydrological cycle of great importance because of the sparse rain gauge network over most parts of africa washington et al 2004 some research has been done on describing the rainfall distribution over time for a specific station and then extrapolating this knowledge to the surrounding region e g nicholson et al 2000 one problem with this approach is the highly variable weather over west africa which makes it difficult to extrapolate knowledge outside a very small region leading to large uncertainties the majority of the west african rainfall comes from the west african monsoon which is controlled by the movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz an area where the south east and north east trade winds meet and a belt of convective clouds is present due to this convergence and the high amount of energy from the sun the movement of the itcz results in high variability in rainfall over the year and the convective nature of the rainfall is one of the reasons for the high variability in both time and space on a daily scale there has also been a lot of research done using satellite rainfall estimates calibrated against the sparse network of ground stations or using reanalysis products which in general performs worse at finer scales in the tropics when compared to gauge measurements diro et al 2009 maidment et al 2017 and references therein to get a more realistic description of the spatial rainfall distribution and to generate spatially accurate satellite rainfall estimates several papers have modelled the spatial covariance over either all of africa or a specific country or region this has been done using satellite data e g funk et al 2015 smith et al 2005 and rain gauge data moron et al 2007 ricciardulli and sardeshmukh 2002 greatrex et al 2014 both of these types of dataset have their individual issues when collected over africa satellite products may not represent fine scale variability accurately maidment et al 2017 but rain gauge data on the other hand is usually very sparse which again leads to issues when modelling the small scale behaviour greatrex et al 2014 moron et al 2007 a general problem is the lack of long time series making it difficult to describe the full interannual variability greatrex et al 2014 ricciardulli and sardeshmukh 2002 used 3 years of cloud observation data transformed into a deep convection activity index with a resolution of 0 35 0 7 covering the entire tropics to model the correlation distance they only focused on modelling the decorrelation distance for deep convection clouds for all active months hence not making a distinction between the different phases of the monsoon cycle with this method they were not able to capture rainfall events related to any processes other than deep convection young et al 2014 both a method of estimating the distance until the correlation was less than 1 e and a method to estimate the distance at which the conditional probability of rainfall given that it rains at the grid point approaches the overall probability of rainfall was used in south west africa the decorrelation distance was estimated to 150 180 km with the second method resulted in the larger distances compared to the first method funk et al 2015 instead used 0 05 resolution 5 day cumulative cold cloud duration ccd data to estimate the decorrelation distance for each month separately their method instead involves to estimate the average correlation at 1 5 around the grid point and then calculate the decorrelation slope by assuming the correlation to be 1 at distance 0 from this slope the distance at which the correlation should be 0 was estimated this method results in decorrelation distances of 500 800 km over south west africa the longer range in previous studies is likely to be due to the use of 5 day rather than daily values one limitation of using ccd instead of gauge measurements is that decorrelation in ccd is not equivalent to the decorrelation range in rainfall in contrast to the other two papers moron et al 2007 calculated the decorrelation distance between measured rainfall at stations instead of satellite grid points this was calculated for five different tropical regions to assess the generality of the results on amount and occurrence data separately by estimating the pearson s correlation for amount data and phi correlation for occurrence one major limitation in this paper is the small number of stations for each region 9 11 13 28 81 which results in very wide distance bins 100 km and only a few station pairs in each bin another method for estimating the correlation distance is to derive a variogram a variogram describes the variance structure between locations depending on the distance between them in both greatrex et al 2014 and teo and grimes 2007 climatology variograms are calculated on rain gauge data to estimate the range of rainfall over ethiopia and gambia both of these papers split the analysis for occurrence and positive rainfall amounts similar to moron et al 2007 this is because the dependence structure in occurrence and amount are showed to not necessarily be equal and furthermore total rainfall amount over some period is not entirely dependent on the frequency of rainfall event teo and grimes 2007 face the same limitation as moron et al 2007 with only 20 stations however distributed on a small area resulting in a relatively dense network the range for occurrence and positive rainfall amounts are 50 km and 150 km hence substantially shorter than the once estimated by funk et al 2015 but similar to ricciardulli and sardeshmukh 2002 greatrex et al 2014 has a much larger dataset of 276 stations but is limited to only 5 years of data and the stations are very unevenly distributed over the country with a complex topography many of the variograms in the paper do not have a clearly defined range and thus a clear correlation distance is difficult to determine the difference in correlation distance can partly be explained by the use of different methods and data types but some stems from the use of different countries since the decorrelation range varies greatly across africa funk et al 2015 two common assumptions are that the rainfall distribution will be equal for all rainfall events and the distribution is equal in all directions but in the recent paper of maranan et al 2018 it was showed that even though the vast majority of the annual amount of rainfall comes from mesoscale convective systems mcss moderate and strong convection has the highest frequency of events many rainfall processes are moreover anisotropic especially at the daily scale there has been some work done on anisotropy in africa but this has either just been done on very small areas gyasi agyei and pegram 2014 ali et al 2003 or using covariates to remove the spatial variability laux et al 2009 the results in this paper will help to close the knowledge gap between the statistics on a station level and on the large scale behaviour 400 km by describing the covariance behaviour on daily rainfall at the scales of 10 150 km this analysis is made possible by a completely new and unique dataset from the ghana met agency comprising 590 stations with daily rainfall measurements ghana is chosen as our study region due to this unique dataset in combination with its varying rainfall behaviour both in time and space due to the itcz we will be using the method of conditional probabilities from ricciardulli and sardeshmukh 2002 because of the easily interpretable results and the possibility to establish a rainfall reference probability the results will also provide a better understanding of the spatial behaviour of different intensities of rainfall events over west africa by modelling their dependence structures separately the final contribution is an anisotropic description of rainfall showing the impact of large scale drivers on the local scale the remainder of the paper is organised as follows an introduction of the study area the dataset and the methods used to model the co occurrence will be presented in section 2 results on the rainfall climatology and the spatial distribution will be given in section 3 and the paper will end with a discussion in section 4 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area ghana is located in the guinea coast with boarders to burkina faso côte d ivoire and togo fig 1 it has five distinct geographical areas low plains in the south the volta basin in the centre with the artificial lake lake volta the akwapim togo ranges to the east of the volta basin with many heights and folded strata the ashanti uplands to the west and high plains in the north boateng et al 2018 the temperature peaks around february march and is at its lowest around august the rainfall is mainly associated with the west african monsoon which is controlled by the movement of the itcz the country is under the influence of the tropical maritime air mass from march to october during which the rainy season occurs south of 8 n there are two rainy seasons with a short dryer period in august north of 8 n only one long rainy season occur see fig 6 from november to february march the country is affected by the prevailing southward winds called the harmattan which brings dry and dusty air from the sahara and gives rise to the dry season the majority of the rainfall is generated by convective clouds with a higher contributing proportion in the north the coast experiences aside from convective rainfall warm rain processes and advective rainfall from the atlantic ocean 2 2 the dataset the daily rainfall dataset used in this report is provided by the gmet ghana meteorological agency and consists of daily rainfall amounts recorded at 590 stations covering all of ghana with a much higher density of stations in the southern half of the country extensive quality control was performed by the manuscript authors along with a team of experts from the gmet the dataset was assessed for errors in station locations location shifts over time over coastal data erroneous data the relationship with neighbouring stations and erroneous statistics and outliers any data flagged in this process was then checked against the original written records and other sources such as google earth imagery for locations in the case of data that was clearly erroneous the station or a subset was removed the original dataset consisted of 598 stations and 17 008 530 individual station day data points the quality control process led to a reduction of 1 55 of available data with the controlled analysis using 590 stations and 16 744 082 individual data points the dataset spans from 1940 until the end of 2017 with all the time series containing some missing values but several of them only have few missing values in the period 1950 2017 fig 2 shows the number of stations for each month with less than 10 missing values which we will refer to as valid stations fig 4 shows the number of valid stations i e stations with less than 10 missing values for each proportion of valid months in the dataset there is a significant increase in the number of valid stations from 1950 fig 2 and then a steep decrease during the 80s similar to the station pattern found in the datasets used in nicholson et al 2018 fig 3 shows the distribution of the median number of daily reporting stations during the year with the most available stations 1976 and in 2017 the station density has decreased coherently across the whole country however the very sparse network in the north even during 1976 results in extremely few current stations due to the large increase in the number of valid stations in the 50s our statistical analysis can be improved by only including data in the period 1950 2017 which still leaves us longer records than most other studies and includes data both before and after the sahelian drought in the 70s and early 80s brooks 2004 2 3 rainfall climatology because of the missing values some adjustment must be made to the annual and monthly amount totals to compensate for the missing data points instead of using data fill methods such as replacing missing values with the mean median or most frequent measurement the measured annual or monthly amounts are adjusted with a parameter proportional to the number of missing values in that time period this scaling method is favoured over the fill method since we are not attempting to fill in the gaps but rather to compensate for the expected lower amount total due to lower number of recorded days for the monthly totals each rainy day measurement is multiplied by ξ m 1 where ξ m is the proportion of missing observations within that month similarly for the annual totals the total amount is multiplied by ξ y 1 where ξ y is the proportion of missing observations within that year only individual years with less than 20 missing values are used for these maps this to not risk including years where the recorded days do not accurately represent the full year the coefficient of variation is defined as cv s x x where s x is the standard deviation of daily rainfall 1 mm and x is the average rainfall over rainy days this is calculated both for daily values and monthly aggregated values for each station with at least 23 years of data only using the months outside of the dry season for the estimation of the daily cv values from all years are used excluding missing values and amounts lower than 1 mm for the monthly cv estimation only months with 3 missing values are used 2 4 spatial variability in the occurrence of rainfall of varying intensity the analysis is done separately for each month to remove some of the variability due to the different phases of the monsoon and only using every 5th day to work with independent events see fig s1 in the supplementary materials for autocorrelation plots this is done because we are interested in modelling the spatial dependence and not the dependence in time to reduce the noise from large differences in absolute amounts between nearby stations correlograms are estimated from occurrences within amount intervals instead of covariograms on the measured amounts the amount intervals hereafter denoted intensity classes are defined as s 1 1 10 mm s 2 10 30 mm s 3 30 50 mm and s 4 50 mm representing low moderate heavy and very heavy rainfall in order to study how the rainfall dependence changes with intensity of the convective system we calculate the proportion of rain rain occurrences hereafter denoted co occurrence both within an intensity class and between an intensity class and stations in higher or lower intensity classes that is we will estimate the co occurrence probability between only stations that are within the same intensity class and in the setting with the origin station in one intensity class and surrounding stations in the same or higher lower intensity classes due to only using every 5th day we end up with 408 independent time steps 68 years 6 days per month except february for each month only stations south of 8 n with less than 50 missing values in the period 1950 2017 has been used which gives us 232 locations for our analysis the reason for only using stations south of 8 n is two fold firstly by excluding the northern region with a single rainy season all the stations will be in the same rainfall regime rainy or non rainy secondly the dataset is much more dense in the southern region which provides us with more robust estimations 50 missing values is chosen as a trade off between using stations with just a few years long record which might skew the results and discarding information since our method involves taking the average over a very large number of estimates of co occurrences we determined that stations with up to 50 of missing values will not negatively impact the results to model the spatial dependence structure of co occurring rainfall events within an intensity class the second method with conditional probabilities in ricciardulli and sardeshmukh 2002 was used the full algorithms are found in appendix a and a summary of it is presented below algorithm 1 for each unique day transform all amounts that are within our chosen intensity class to a 1 and all other amounts to 0 choose one of the stations assigned a 1 to be the origin station and calculate the distance from this station to all other stations within each 10 km distance bin calculate the proportion of stations assigned a 1 calculate the proportion for all stations assigned a 1 in step 1 and repeat for each unique day by calculating the average in each distance bin we can get a climatological average on the probability of observing rainfall of the same intensity as the origin station for a given distance to model the dependence structure of co occurring rainfall events between an intensity class and either lower or higher intensity classes the above method is used with a few changes transform all amounts that are within our chosen intensity class to a 1 all stations with a measured amount in all lower higher intensity classes with a 2 and all other stations to 0 then calculate the proportion of 1 s and 2 s instead of just 1 s the rest of the algorithm is identical just as for measurements within an intensity class taking the average in each distance bin we can get a climatological average on the probability of observing rainfall of the same intensity or lower higher as the origin station for a given distance to compare our co occurrence probabilities with the climatology background state a 2 step sampling method is used a summary of the algorithm for calculating the background state within intensities is given below algorithm 2 for each unique day calculate the proportion of rainy stations transform all amounts that are within our chosen intensity class to a 1 and all other amounts to 0 choose one of the stations that are assigned a 1 to be the origin station and calculate the distance from this station to all other stations randomly assign rain or no rain to all other station so the proportion equals the measured proportion and for each rainy station randomly assign a measured rainfall amount from that station in that unique month assign a 1 to all stations in the chosen intensity class and calculate the proportion of 1 s in each 10 km distance bin repeat for all stations initially assigned a 1 and for each unique day for the calculation between intensity classes apply the same modification as described for algorithm 1 a schematic overview of the two algorithms can be found in figs b 15 b 17 in appendix b 2 5 anisotropy in spatial rainfall variability to estimate the variation in rainfall variability semivariograms were derived on 2 3 and 5 day rainy aggregated amounts using all intensities to study how the small scale rainfall variability structure is influenced by large scale drivers in our setting let z s i represent the k day aggregated rainfall amount at station s i assuming that the mean and variance of z s are finite the semivariogram is defined as the half mean squared difference γ s i s j 1 2 e z s i e s i z s j e s j 2 i j 1 2 n here we are going to assume that the underlying process z s s 0 generating the k day aggregated rainfall amount is intrinsically stationary and isotropic this simply means that the mean is constant i e e z s μ and the semivariogram only depend on the distance between 2 locations and not the direction hence 1 γ h 1 2 e z s h z h 2 a natural method to estimate the semivariogram is by the method of moments semivariogram which essentially stems from replacing theoretical expectations with the analogous sample averages the corresponding sample semivariogram to eq 1 notably the matheron s classical estimator matheron and blondel 1962 is defined as 2 γ ˆ h δ 1 2 n h δ i j n h δ z i z j 2 where z i is the observed k day aggregated rainfall amount at station s i n h δ is the set of pairs within the spatial lag h δ and n h δ is the number of pairs in that distance range the general shape of semivariograms can characterise and explain the dependence structure in terms of its three main indicators nugget range and sill the nugget is the variance at the close to 0 distance representing the variability at distances of a couple of metres and measurement error the nugget is expected to be small in rainfall data because of very high correlation at small distances the sill is the value that the semivariogram converges to as the distance increases dependence decreases and the range is the distance at which two stations are independent and the sill is reached or 95 of it if only approached asymptotically cressie and wikle 2011 the maximum distance is set to 160 km since we are interested in modelling the small scale behaviour and due to the small area over which this is estimated the estimated semivariance values will be used to calculate the covariogram defined as 3 c h σ 2 γ h where σ 2 is the 0 distance variance because the variance is linear in the number of aggregated days c h is divided by σ 2 to enable us to compare the results from the different aggregation periods by using the covariogram instead of semivariogram we can again compare our estimated values against the theoretical convergence value 0 which is reached when there is no dependence left for quantities with spatial dependence varying with direction an anisotropic model must be applied instead of the isotropic model described in eq 2 isotropic models i e models only depending on distance and not direction can be turned into anisotropic models by replacing the distance parameter h with a distance vector h which then will be associated with both a length and a direction the bin h δ now represents both a distance range and an angular tolerance e g all stations in a 45 segment if we have a dense station network and want to get more detailed information about the spatial distribution one can estimate a covariogram map a covariogram map is a lattice where each square represents a distance and an angle and is symmetric because of the square term in eq 2 to construct a covariogram map select one of the stations and place a square lattice over the region with your chosen station in the centre calculate the difference in k day aggregated amount between your selected station and all other stations calculated the average within each square of the lattice and apply eq 3 repeat this for all stations and all k day periods after taking the average from all the individual maps the resulting map describes the mean behaviour in all directions as we move away from a station hence displaying directions with a stronger correlation a minimum threshold of 1000 pairs for each square is used to make the estimation more robust 3 results 3 1 climatology of rainfall in ghana to describe the climatology of the rainfall in each agro ecological zone shown in fig 5 and defined by gmet owusu and waylen 2009 the four stations marked with red dots are used annual total amount time series box and whisker plots over the monthly total amounts maps of key rainfall estimates and maps of coefficient of variation cv for each month not in the dry season are used to demonstrate this a day is defined as rainy if the measured amount is 1 mm as used by expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi and in several other papers e g moron et al 2007 sillmann et al 2013 30 mm is chosen as the threshold for heavy rainfall because this equals the 10 20 heaviest amounts on rainy days for most of the country combining the information in figs 6 and 7 one can clearly see the reason for the partition with the dry coast region the forest region with a high proportion of rainy days the transition region with much fewer rainy days but still a bimodal rainy season and the north with only one rainy season in some papers the south western coastal region is classified as a separate region which fig 6c confirms with the much higher proportion of days with heavy rainfall in that area one can notice a diagonal band of higher proportion of rainy days from the sw coast up to lake volta with a significantly drier region along the coast this was noted already in acheampong 1982 and was explained by the complex atmospheric interaction in that region we can also see the decreasing trend in rainfall as we move northward in fig 6a matching the movement of the itcz and a decreasing presence of advective rainfall in fig 7 we can clearly see the different rainfall modes with an unimodal rainy season in the north zone and a bimodal in the rest of the country the difference between the bimodal regions is clearly visible with both the major and the minor rainy season being of equal intensity in the forest region whereas the transition region has a slightly more intense minor season and the coast has a much more intense major rainy season compared to the minor the reason for the very intense major season compared to the minor in the coast region is the movement of the itcz which brings a lot of moist air from the ocean as it propagates northward contributing to many days with heavy rainfall a common feature for all regions is the large interannual variation in monthly and annual total amount for all months during the rainy season the range of the whiskers are around 300 mm and the mean rainfall is between 100 250 mm june in accra which is at the peak of the rainy season has the largest range which is 450 mm with a mean of 175 mm there is also a common pattern of a slow increase in mean rainfall up until the peak of the rainy seasons and then a quick decrease as the itcz retracts studying the total annual rainfall in fig 8 one can again see a very large interannual variation for all locations with the biggest spread in the forest and transition regions both of which have two intense rainy seasons despite tamale only experiencing one rainy season the mean annual rainfall is higher than accra due to the longer rainy season accra has the lowest mean annual rainfall of the four stations of around 750 mm year both kintampo and effiduase have mean annual rainfall of around 1400 mm year however effiduase has a varying pattern so the amount fluctuates over the studied time period accra has an interannual range of about 1000 mm tamale 800 mm and kintampo and effiduase of nearly 1500 mm in contrast to owusu and waylen 2009 but similar to lacombe et al 2012 and torgbor et al 2018 it does not appear like the sahelian drought in the 70s and 80s had a big impact on the average annual amount in any of the regions but there is a strong decrease in the variability at tamale and kintampo during this period there is a distinct pattern of lower cv over monthly aggregated values fig 10 than daily values fig 9 meaning that the fluctuations around the long term rainfall mean is much larger than the fluctuations around the monthly mean this is expected due to the convective nature of the rainfall resulting in short intense storms we can also see a more coherent pattern over space in the monthly compared to the daily values the monthly cv values are however still large with a mean value of 1 or higher for nearly all months meaning that the variation around the long term mean is of the same magnitude or larger than the mean this is similar to the results in arvind et al 2017 which looked at monthly values in a region of india but a lot higher than ayanlade et al 2018 which studied a region in nigeria the most northern part of ghana is under the influence of the harmattan in march and november as seen in fig 7 hence the monthly average rainfall is very low which inflates the cv value for the daily values we can see a larger spread during the monsoon phase may october with the exception of june which has one of the smallest spreads this is because the higher mean in june lowers the cv estimate even if the absolute variation is the same as may and july there are no obvious spatial patterns outside the main monsoon season but from june september there is a clear pattern of highest values along the coast which decreases as we move north the monthly values exhibit a different pattern outside the main monsoon in the north october april there is a bimodal pattern with high cv values in the north and along the coast and lower values inland may and june is very non coherent but still with high values along the coast line during the peak of the north rainy season july september there is a clear gradient with high values in the south and low values in the north there is also a west east gradient in the southern part for all months except july october with lower values in the west where we have higher annual rainfall and more rainy days 3 2 spatial distribution of rainfall events in the papers mentioned in the introduction all rainfall events were assumed to have the same spatial variability this must not necessarily be true since we might expect a moderately intense rainfall event to have a larger extent than a low intensity rainfall or an intense shower storm in order to study this the method of conditional probability curves will be applied to the intensity classes described in section 2 4 by comparing our measured results with a random sampling baseline we can separate out the increased probability of rainfall at a station because of rainfall at nearby stations and the overall probability of rainfall due to the time of the year this will both give information about the very local behaviour and the spatial extent for the different intensities in the first section we will model the variability placing the highest intensity class in the origin and in the second section we will model the variability within each intensity class 3 2 1 extent of rainfall events by modelling both the conditional probability of observing rainfall amounts that are higher fig 11 or lower fig s2 in the supplementary material than the origin station we can get information about both the extent of a large rainfall event and the probabilities of observing higher rainfall amounts close to low rainfall by subtracting the reference rainfall probabilities from our measured co occurrence probabilities we can study how the anomalies changes over the season the results shown in fig 11 suggests that low rainfall events are localised whilst heavy rainfall events have a larger spatial structure in fig 11 a and c we can see that the 5 km line very closely follows the baseline showing the small scale behaviour depending on the season this would indicate that low rainfall events are very local resulting in the co occurrence probability depending on the overall probability of rain the peak in august in a is most likely due to the significant difference in the rain intensity distribution in accra for all months except july and august the histogram over rainfall amounts not included are very similar for the three southerly stations used in section 3 1 however in july and august there is much higher probability of low intensity rainfall in accra and since there is a high station density along the coast the results from that region has a higher weighting compared to further north this strong connection with rainfall distribution and co occurrence probability confirms the idea of local low intensity events if we instead consider fig 11 e and g the 5 km line is nearly constant over the year hence the small scale behaviour of heavy events are independent of the overall rainfall probability this suggests that heavier rain events have a larger spatial structure that dominates the area wide behaviour from the anomalies right column fig 11 we can see that the co occurrence probabilities follows the baseline from about 50 km for moderately intense rainfall and from around 100 km for heavy and very heavy rainfall this further confirms that heavier rainfalls have a larger spatial structure the seasonal behaviour in the baseline comes from the changes in probability of rainfall presented in table 1 which impacts the large scale co occurrence probability because of a higher proportion of dry stations from table 2 we can see the number of time steps where the intensity is observed and the total number of observations for each intensity the ratio of these two gives us the average number of stations observing a certain intensity e g 30 50 mm given that at least one station observes that same intensity for very heavy rainfall this ratio varies between 1 2 in the dry season up to 1 6 in june the average is 1 4 during the rainy season except august when this drops to 1 3 this indicates that during the dry season it is more common with just one heavy storm occurring whereas in the rainy season there are on average 4 stations affected by very heavy storms on the same day this can explain the peak in june in the baseline probability and the relatively constant behaviour during the rest of the rainy season except august similarly the peak in october for moderate intense rainfall fig 11 c can be explained by an increase in this ratio from september to october meaning that there is a much higher probability of moderate intense rainfall in other locations in october given that it rains compared to september from the right column of fig 11 we can see that the decorrelation distance increases as we increase the rainfall intensity strengthening our claim no formal statistical test has been applied to test the difference between the anomalies and 0 but by eye we can see that for low intensity rainfall already at 50 km the anomaly is only around 0 05 for moderately intense rainfall the same value is not reached until 100 km away heavy rainfall exhibits a very similar range as moderate rainfall except a slightly larger peak in august very heavy rainfall has not fully converged and therefore reached its decorrelation range even at a distance of 150 km demonstrating a large scale impact on the rainfall probability 3 2 2 spatial variability of rainfall occurrence to better understand the spatial variability of rainfall occurrence for various intensities and thereby the differences in spatial extent of areas with the same rainfall intensity conditional probabilities for the separate intensity classes were calculated the same method as the previous section is used to again enable us to compare the measured probabilities with the climatology fig 12 confirms the pattern in fig 11 with the co occurrence probability for heavy and very heavy rainfall not varying much with the season even at long distances whereas low and moderate rainfall has a strong seasonal pattern from small to large scales the seasonal pattern in the baseline for low and moderate rainfall again highlight the different overall probability during the monsoon season at all distances there is a peak in the probability in august for low brown intensity but a trough for all other intensities this is most likely explained by the higher frequency of small rainfall events compared to other intensities in the short dry season which increases the probability of co occurring low intensity events and decreases the other intensities the climatology co occurring probability of low and moderate blue intense rainfall is however close to identical during the build up phase march may for moderately intense rainfall there is an increasing overall probability until june decreasing during july and august and then increasing again for heavy green and very heavy orange rainfall the climatology probability is relatively constant over time low intensity rainfall has nearly converged to the climatology at 100 km whereas moderately intense rainfall has converged at 150 km hence persistent moderately intense rainfall has a larger extent than persistently low intense rainfall neither heavy nor very heavy rainfall has converged indicating that rainfall events that persistently releases more than 30 mm of rain has a spatial dependence even at 150 km away 3 2 3 spatial shape of rainfall events to study if the large scale drivers such as the east african jet also can be seen on the small scale we estimated covariogram maps using 2 3 and 5 day aggregated june data since the aim here is to look at the potential anisotropic pattern generated by all rainfall we are now including all days without splitting it into intensity classes we know from fig 6 a that there is a strong rainfall gradient in the nw se direction in annual amount but we want to see if there might be a different spatial variability pattern when looking at accumulation over only a few days because of the significantly larger mean and variance in the south west corner fig 13 the following analysis will be done on the indicated region in fig 13 b to work with the assumption of equal mean and variance over the entire region this difference in mean and variance did not affect our previous results since we worked with intensity occurrence instead of amounts covariogram maps were also estimated over the coast region but are excluded due to their very noisy pattern the patterns in the covariogram maps in fig 14 have a lot of similarities for all aggregation periods but some small differences as well one can clearly see a higher correlation distance in the e w direction compared to the n s direction in all aggregation periods there is however no clear difference in the ne sw and nw se direction hence even on a 2 day scale we can see the pattern of dominantly westward propagating convection systems the correlation drops off very rapidly with a correlation of around 0 5 just 20 km away and as we increase the aggregation period the correlation gets coherently increased in all directions the area with a correlation of 0 25 is however extended much further in the e w direction compared to n s demonstrating an increased anisotropic pattern for longer aggregation periods even at 160 km there is some correlation which is due to the climatology similar to the previous results the higher correlation in e w is not due to the fact that the region is wider than long which was checked by doing the same calculation over a square region 4 discussion and conclusion estimating and predicting rainfall over west africa will probably remain a difficult task for some years ahead due to the sparse and degrading rain gauge network in this paper we have provided some insights on the spatial behaviour of daily rainfall within ghana in contrast to previous studies we have not assumed that all rainfall events have the same spatial structure but instead studied the rainfall events split into four different intensity classes to understand differences in the co occurrence structure at small scales over the season we have showed that the conditional probability of observing rainfall of the same intensity varies seasonally for low and moderately intense rainfall but not for heavy and very heavy this might partly be explained by changes in the proportion of rainfall events in each intensity class over the season however the same pattern is observed when treating all lower intensities as occurrences this shows that heavy rainfall events have a stronger influence at the local scale and therefore is not affected by the overall probability of rainfall whereas low and moderate rainfall are much more localised the anomalies structure on the other hand is very similar for all intensities except low demonstrating a different structure in drizzle events compared to other rainfall events our results show a decorrelation distance similar to the one obtained by ricciardulli and sardeshmukh 2002 and positive amount in teo and grimes 2007 but about three times further than their occurrence range this difference probably results from several factors such as the scale difference of gridded data and station data how dense the dataset is and the method used but a non negligible part most likely also comes from the use of different regions because of the complex atmospheric systems over central africa the rainfall structure varies greatly as shown in funk et al 2015 this makes it difficult to directly compare large scale estimates such as correlation ranges with previous studies the small scale estimates on the other hand which mostly depend on the rainfall system and not the current rainfall state could be more comparable assuming the convective systems are similar across the tropics it would however be difficult to compare with european studies since the rainfall there mostly comes from advective systems for the spatial shape of rainfall events even at the small scale it is possible to see the influence of large scale drivers such as the african easterly jet as we increase the accumulation period the covariance range is increased in the e w direction which is the direction of stronger covariance the pattern of stronger correlation at longer accumulation periods was also noted by bacchi and kottegoda 1995 which can be explained by the decreased dependence of the individual rainfall events which are local scale events and more on the large scale drivers which usually affect a hole region the results in this paper demonstrate the issues with describing all rainfall events with the same correlation structure but that we can assume isotropy for short accumulation periods we hope that this method will be applied in other regions since it is easy to adapt by changing the intensity classes to suitable country levels and the results from different studies can be directly compared it would be especially interesting to see how this compares to other tropical regions where we might expect to see the same type of rainfall systems but with a different occurrence distribution compared to our study region author contributions jennifer israelsson methodology formal analysis writing

8332,study region 84 catchments across the walloon region of belgium study focus this study aims at analysing trends in high flows by examining annual maxima am peaks over threshold pots and the number of peaks per year frequency trends were identified using statistical tests regression analysis mann kendall and pettitt tests new hydrological insights for the region almost 12 of the sites show a trend in the magnitude of am and frequency and 6 show a trend in the magnitude of pots globally more negative trends have been detected but the proportion of positive trends is higher in the scheldt catchment than in the meuse catchment the results of nonstationary analysis indicate important changes in the magnitude of the 100 year flood up to 18 increase 11 decrease in 10 years and the frequency of peak flows up to 42 increase 31 decrease these changes could therefore impact future flood risk management in wallonia however the time series are short 30 50 years and some uncertainty remains understanding the mechanisms responsible for the trends is essential to obtain better estimates of future flood flows a first analysis of potential drivers reveals that changes in precipitation match the trends in high flows and lower snowfall quantities and higher evapotranspiration rate caused by the increase in temperature could have contributed to the decrease in high flows in some regions keywords flow annual maxima peaks over threshold trend detection nonstationary flood frequency analysis climate change wallonia 1 introduction over the past two decades many researchers have studied the changes in hydrological data worldwide robson et al 1998 in the uk vogel et al 2011 and archfield et al 2016 in the usa giuntoli et al 2012 in france mangini et al 2018 and blöschl et al 2019 in europe to cite just a few in 2008 milly et al wrote an article entitled stationarity is dead explaining that it should no longer be a default assumption in water management indeed the means and extremes of hydroclimatic variables such as precipitation evapotranspiration and river flow are changing altered mainly by anthropogenic changes of earth s climate nevertheless non stationarity is not taken into account in most water management studies such as the design of flood storage areas and flood maps despite this general statement from milly et al studies looking at high flows usually show more contrasted results in the usa for example more than 60 of the 345 stream gauges analysed using mean daily streamflow did not show any statistically significant trends in either the peak magnitude frequency duration or the volume of frequent flood events over the period 1940 2013 archfield et al 2016 in europe mangini et al 2018 found statistically significant trends in the magnitude of the annual maximum flood peak and the frequency of the peaks for the period 1965 2005 for only 17 and 21 of the sites studied 629 gauging stations recording mean daily discharge respectively and almost half of those trends were negative notwithstanding the fact that global warming will lead to an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events in many regions is quite certain ipcc 2014 there still exists some uncertainty regarding the predictions of extreme river flows mainly because of the complexity of all the different processes involved indeed river flows are influenced by many climatic and non climatic factors which interact with each other for instance the increase in temperature leads to an increase in rainfall quantity due to the higher water holding capacity of the air according to the clausius clapeyron relation on the other hand it also leads to a decrease in snowfall quantities and an increase in the evapotranspiration rates alfieri et al 2015 therefore depending on which flood generating processes dominate in the catchment responses in high flows will be different thober et al 2018 besides global warming there has also been a global change in land use including deforestation changes in agricultural practices and urbanisation this also has an impact on high flows as the type of land use plays an important role in the flood generation processes for example influencing runoff and infiltration since results of flood change detection and prediction vary from a region to another mainly due to the range of climate and land use changes we think studies at local scales are necessary our study focuses on wallonia southeast belgium and articulates into three parts the first part aims at detecting trends in the magnitude and frequency of high flows then an analysis of the trends is carried out using nonstationary frequency analysis and in the last part potential drivers of changes in high flows are discussed 2 methodology 2 1 data the study region wallonia is located in the southeast of belgium and covers an area of 16 844 km2 the altitude increases gradually from the northwest to the southeast and ranges from 50 m to 694 m both temperature and rainfall follow the gradient in the topography the mean temperature varies between 7 5 c and 11 c while the total annual precipitation varies between 700 mm and 1400 mm spw dgo3 demna dee 2017 on the walloon territory there is an extensive water level monitoring network almost 300 stations spread over the whole area this network however is quite recent the first station equipped with monitoring instruments taking hourly measurements was installed in 1967 for our analysis the stations located on non navigable watercourses and providing flow data for at least 30 years up to 2017 were selected i e 84 stations amongst the stations selected 66 are located in the meuse catchment covering 70 of the area of wallonia 17 in the scheldt catchment representing 20 of wallonia and the last one is in the moselle catchment which is part of the rhine river basin district fig 1 the size of the station catchments ranges from 1 4 km2 to2900 km2 the median being 143 km2 to characterise high flows annual maxima am and peaks over threshold pots were extracted from the hourly flow data the number of pots per year was also used to analyse the frequency of high flows the water year october september was used to avoid separating the high flow season into two different years unfortunately data is not continuous and a non negligible quantity of data is missing for 60 stations on average 2 5 years of data are missing but it varies between a few days and 6 years to minimise the impact of this missing data the hydrograph of such stations was visually compared to the hydrograph of a station in the same catchment or in a neighbouring catchment with a similar hydrological regime the annual maximum of a year with missing data was discarded only when the annual maximum of the comparative station occurred in the period of missing data similarly the number of pots per year was adjusted taking into account the number of missing peaks in the record in case of uncertainty a conservative approach was preferred and the data for that year was deleted from the data set 2 2 pot extraction the main advantage of the pots is that all peaks above a threshold are included not only the maximum but also the subsequent highest peaks every year which are sometimes higher than the annual maximum of other years this method is therefore very interesting for short time series as it increases the number of observations analysed it also allows studying the frequency of high flows using the number of pots per year however the extraction of pots is quite complex the first step is to select a threshold it must be low enough in order to select enough peaks but high enough so that the peaks are independent from each other setting the threshold to a fixed quantile for all the time series is frequently used as it is a simple and quick rule but it is inappropriate from a theoretical point of view scarrott and macdonald 2012 in this study those arbitrary rules were avoided and a more robust method that takes into account the data characteristics of each station was preferred the chosen method is the one described by lang et al 1999 and coles 2001 it is based on the adjustment of the generalised pareto gp distribution to the exceedances over the threshold for successive values of the threshold the threshold must be sufficiently high to meet the assumptions of the gp law but low enough to obtain unbiased estimations of the distribution parameters this is ensured by selecting the threshold based on the analysis of three graphs the mean residual life plot the parameter stability plot and the dispersion index plot on the mean residual life plot the lowest threshold from which the mean exceedance above threshold follows a linear trend is selected the parameter stability plot allows checking if the shape and scale parameters of the gp distribution are constant for all threshold values above the selected threshold the dispersion index is the ratio between the variance and the mean of a data set according to the extreme value theory the number of exceedances in a defined time period usually one year follows a poisson distribution for which the dispersion index equals 1 the dispersion index value for the selected threshold must therefore be close to 1 once the threshold has been chosen we must ensure that the selected peaks are independent again different approaches exist in the literature usually based on a minimum number of days between peaks depending on the catchment area sometimes combined with a condition on the flows between two peaks cunnane 1979 interagency advisory committee on water data 1982 lang et al 1999 li et al 2016 mangini et al 2018 svensson et al 2005 willems 2009 in this study the declustering method described by coles 2001 has been used it consists in grouping consecutive values exceeding the threshold and keeping the maximum value for each cluster the clusters being separated from each other by a certain number r of values below the threshold the other values of the clusters are set to the threshold in order not to lose information regarding the frequency of peaks notably for the flood frequency analysis however choosing the value of the parameter r is complex it must be high enough to ensure the independence of the peaks but not too high to avoid losing valuable data it is a compromise between bias and variance for which general guidelines do not exist the approach taken here was to do a first declustering with r equal to 5 days assess the dependence of the peaks on the hydrograph and repeat those two steps with increasing values of r until peaks are independent the extremal index was also taken into account it measures the dependence of extremes and is equal to 1 for independent data series coles 2001 finally the minimum number of pots per year was set to 2 following the studies and advice of cunnane 1973 and taesombut et yevjevich 1978 in order to preserve the added value of the pot approach comparing to am and in many cases ensure a poisson distributed number of pots per year 2 3 trend detection once the series of am and pots had been extracted from the hourly flow data an exploratory analysis was carried out this analysis consists of examining the data on graphs in order to identify potential problems or trends in the data these trends were first quantified using a simple linear regression of the am and pots as a function of time the slope characterising the magnitude of the trend however caution must be taken regarding those results as linear regression is sensitive to outliers and give better results when residues follow a normal distribution svensson et al 2005 this exploratory analysis also included tests to verify the assumptions linked to the statistical tests such as normality lack of autocorrelation and homogeneity kundzewicz and robson 2004 trends were then detected with more confidence using other statistical tests the mann kendall test is often used for trend detection as it does not require the normality of the data and is therefore suitable for hydrological extremes šraj et al 2016 however the results are sensitive to the autocorrelation of the data which can lead to an over or underestimation of the statistical significance of the test the autocorrelation of the data was therefore tested beforehand and a modified mann kendall test was used when the data was autocorrelated giuntoli et al 2012 this modified test adjusts the variance used in the mann kendall test taking into account the effective sample size hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 indeed the data redundancy decreases the effective data set size and thus artificially increases the variance serinaldi and kilsby 2016 in addition the sen s slope was calculated it is the non parametric equivalent to the slope of the linear regression and therefore a good indicator of the magnitude of the trend mangini et al 2018 it is actually the median of the slopes of the lines crossing all pairs of points it is not sensitive to outliers and thus more robust sen 1968 the pettitt test was also used to detect changing points in the data series as it is sensitive to the presence of a monotonous trend in the data rybski and neumann 2011 the test was also done on the residues of the linear regression i e data from which the linear trend was to a certain extent removed to assess the trend in the number of pots per year over time a poisson regression was carried out the statistical significance of the trend was calculated using the chi2 test on the regression slope testing if it is significantly different from 0 this method is seen as the most suitable for count series in the absence of overdispersion mangini et al 2018 the level of statistical significance was set to 5 for all statistical tests 2 4 nonstationary frequency analysis stationarity is one of the requirements for standard frequency analysis the statistical properties of the studied variables their probability distribution in particular must not change with time identically distributed variables if the variables are not stationary then nonstationary frequency analysis should be used coles 2001 this analysis consists in making the parameters of the probability distribution vary with time many authors have studied changes in high flows using this technique šraj et al 2016 on two rivers in slovenia delgado et al 2010 on the river mekong in china and vogel et al 2011 on a number of watercourses in the usa amongst many others we used the generalised extreme value gev distribution for the annual maxima and the point process pp approach for the pots the pp approach is also called poisson gp as the generalised pareto gp distribution is fitted to the threshold excesses and the poisson distribution is fitted to their occurrence its main advantage comparing to the classic gp distribution is the independence of its parameters from the threshold which makes the nonstationary frequency analysis easier to carry out gilleland and katz 2016 scarrott and macdonald 2012 both distributions have a location parameter a scale parameter and a shape parameter the poisson gp has an additional rate parameter which is the mean number of occurrences number of pots per year in this study four models were tested for each time series showing a statistically significant trend 1 the parameters are constant stationary model 2 the location parameter is a linear function of the hydrological year y μ y μ 0 μ 1 y 3 the location and scale parameters are both linear functions of the hydrological year y μ y μ 0 μ 1 y and σ y σ 0 σ 1 y 4 the location and scale parameters are both linear functions of the hydrological year y and the exponential is used for the scale parameter to ensure it has a positive value for any value of the year μ y μ 0 μ 1 y and σ y e x p σ 0 σ 1 y the shape parameter is usually kept constant as its estimation is much more complex coles 2001 the maximum likelihood method was used for the estimation of the parameters models were compared using the aic akaike information criterion and bic bayesian information criterion performance indices as well as the likelihood ratio test which allows testing whether adding a variable in the model is statistically significant or not gilleland and katz 2016 the model with the lowest aic and bic and for which the likelihood ratio test was statistically significant when compared to the stationary model was considered the best model the chosen nonstationary model was then used to compute specific return period floods in particular the 100 year return period flood for the year 2017 was compared to the stationary 100 year return period flood the flood magnification factor defined by vogel et al 2011 as the ratio between the flow value in 10 years 2027 and the actual flow value 2017 was also calculated however caution needs to be taken with such extrapolations as they assume the high flows will follow the same observed trend in the future gilleland and katz 2016 for the frequency of high flows the number of peaks in 2017 calculated using the poisson regression equation was compared to the mean number of peaks per year under stationary conditions the magnification factor was also computed 2 5 analysis of potential drivers flood generating processes depend on many factors that can undergo changes these changes can be continuous or sudden and can occur once or several times the potential drivers of trends in high flows are therefore numerous merz et al 2012 climatic changes changes in rainfall snowfall atmospheric circulation temperature evapotranspiration antecedent soil moisture etc land use changes urbanisation deforestation changes in types of crops or agricultural management practices drainage of wetlands and agricultural areas construction of flood storage areas etc river modifications straightening narrowing deepening by dredging for example construction of dams or changes in their operation etc some of these factors were analysed more closely in this study using the same method as for flows i e trends were detected using linear regression mann kendall and pettitt tests similarly to the nonstationary frequency analysis the analyses were only carried out on the catchments showing a statistically significant trend in the high flows we focused on climatic variables precipitation snow temperature and evapotranspiration data were obtained for each catchment from 1 january 1961 until 31 december 2017 using the epicgrid model sohier et al 2009 in this model snow data is actually derived from precipitation data when temperature falls below 0 c snowfall is therefore calculated in mm of precipitation it also allows the simulation of quantities of melted snow and snow left on the ground at the end of each day the latter being used in this study as an approximation of snowpack depth as for the resolution of the data the model works on a 1 km grid but the original data was on a 5 km grid obtained from kriging meteorological station data however this data was not available at an hourly rate annual indices were calculated from daily data in order to make the comparison with flow annual maxima these indices were computed for each catchment by hydrological year for the same period as the flow data as well as for the whole data set period since 1962 table 1 below shows the different annual indices used for each type of climatic data other factors such as urbanisation and the installation of sewerage networks were also analysed qualitatively using satellite images and information from utility companies all the statistical analyses in this study were done on r version 3 4 3 r core team 2017 using the following packages extremes version 2 0 8 gilleland and katz 2016 pot version 1 1 6 ribatet and dutang 2016 trend version 1 1 0 pohlert 2018 and fume version 1 0 santander meteorology group 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 trends table 2 shows the number of sites where a statistically significant trend was detected and the corresponding percentages over the total number of sites for the analysed variables almost 12 of the stations show a statistically significant trend in the magnitude of am and or the number of peaks per year frequency but only 6 show a trend in the magnitude of pots in total there are actually 16 different sites 19 which show a statistically significant trend in at least one of the three variables analysed as statistically significant trends were sometimes detected for different variables at the same site we can see there are more negative than positive trends we also observe that the stations showing a trend in the magnitude are not necessarily the same as the ones showing a trend in the frequency changes in the magnitude do not imply changes in the frequency or vice versa finally there are more statistically significant trends in the magnitude of am than in the magnitude of pots these three observations are shared with svensson et al 2005 who studied 21 stations worldwide with a record of daily mean flow for 44 100 years they explained the last observation by the fact that lower peaks below the pot threshold are selected for am and the slope of the trend is therefore steeper which matches our results despite the difference in the length of the time series analysed even though these numbers seem low they are similar to other european studies in the study by mangini et al 2018 on 629 stations recording mean daily flow in europe for the period 1965 2005 9 7 of the sites showed a positive trend in the magnitude of am and 7 6 showed a negative trend for the continental hydro climatic region which includes the east of belgium and france germany the north of italy switzerland austria and other eastern european countries they found 8 6 and 6 9 of positive and negative trends respectively these numbers are very close to our results for the negative trends 7 1 but more positive trends were detected by mangini et al 4 8 in our study they analysed trends in the magnitude of pots for several data sets in which the average number of pots per year differs as the average number of pots per year across all the stations in our study is 2 7 we examined their results for 3 pots per year and similar conclusions can be drawn 5 9 and 3 2 of the stations in the continental hydro climatic region show positive and negative trends respectively while these percentages in our study are 2 4 and 3 6 they also detected more trends in the frequency of pots 23 7 than in their magnitude 9 1 these percentages are respectively 11 9 and 6 in our study the european floodfreq report on flood frequency analysis in a changing environment includes the results of trend detection studies on extreme precipitation and or streamflow in 21 countries madsen et al 2013 they concluded that extreme precipitation is generally increasing but there are no clear indications of a general increase in extreme streamflow at the regional or national scale however increases in extreme streamflow were detected for smaller regions several studies also report a decrease in extreme flows in regions where snowmelt is the main flood generating process the more recent study of blöschl et al 2019 on 3738 european gauging stations found regional patterns in northwestern europe 69 of the stations showed an increasing flood trend when analysing annual maxima based on daily mean or instantaneous discharge for the period 1960 2010 only a few belgian stations were included in this study and statistically significant positive trends were found for stations on the lower meuse and its tributaries a station in germany near the eastern border of belgium showed a significant negative trend when mapping the results figs 2 a b and c we observe there is no general trend for the whole wallonia but local patterns are present which confirms the importance of studying changes in high flows at a local scale on these maps the stations have been colour coded according to the sign of the sen s slope and the statistical significance of the trend the level of significance being 5 we can see that for the annual maxima fig 2 a the trends in the scheldt catchment are mainly positive in the meuse catchment except for the lesse negative trends dominate and they are mainly located in the south semois chiers and moselle catchments and the east ourthe amblève and vesdre catchments the map for the magnitude of pots fig 2 b displays very similar patterns with a lower number of statistically significant trends as for the frequency fig 2 c a few stations in the meuse catchment which show a positive trend or no trend in the magnitude show a negative trend in the number of pots per year robson et al already explained in 1998 that the internal variation in the flood records usually linked to climate fluctuations makes trend detection very difficult statistical detection is possible only for very noticeable trends or for long data sets although they used 40 to 50 year periods they recommend redoing the analyses with more data to confirm the presence or absence of trends blöschl et al 2019 also stated that trends are influenced by the observation period and could therefore be different if a longer period was analysed this clearly shows the limitation of our data as the length of the records ranges from 30 to 50 years however milly et al 2015 argue that even if trends are not statistically significant and some uncertainty exists climate change effects are increasing in magnitude in such a way that they cannot be ignored in future water management and in particular in the design of structures that are supposed to last decades 3 2 nonstationary frequency analysis stationary and nonstationary models described in section 2 5 were fitted to the time series showing a statistically significant trend tables 3 and 4 give a summary of the results of this analysis in table 3 we can see that models 3 and 4 with both scale and location parameters being time dependent perform the best for most stations the difference between the stationary 100 year return period flood and the 2017 100 year return period flood calculated with the best nonstationary model ranges from 2 6 to 30 1 and the decadal magnification reduction factor ranges from 0 89 to 1 18 for the magnitude of am and pots this is lower than the magnification factors observed in the usa ranging from 0 45 to 3 vogel et al 2011 this could be explained by the differences in catchment characteristics between wallonia and the usa but also by the fact that vogel et al used an exponential relationship to describe the evolution of quantiles over time the difference between the observed mean number of pots per year and the number of pots per year in 2017 calculated using the poisson regression varies between 28 8 and 87 2 as for the decadal magnification reduction factor it ranges from 0 69 to 1 42 for some catchments although a trend was detected in the time series using the statistical tests the stationary model was outperforming the nonstationary models these catchments are therefore not included in table 3 the nonstationary model could potentially be improved by replacing time as a covariate by other explanatory variables that are more related to the physical processes such as precipitation and land use changes or by using other types of relationships to describe the evolution of high flows over time this highlights the need to better understand the trends in high flows origin and type before doing more complex and especially predictive analyses according to serinaldi et al 2018 non stationarity in the population cannot solely be inferred from trend detection tests carried out on observed data the causes of the detected inhomogeneities need to be understood in order to extrapolate conclusions beyond the period of records and justify the use of nonstationary models otherwise the models would give unrealistic predictions serinaldi and kilsby 2015 3 3 potential drivers first precipitation was analysed negative trends in at least one of the indices 1 2 3 and 7 day annual maxima were found for five catchments in the east of the region and positive trends were found on the river lesse and at two sites in the scheldt catchment these trends match the increase or decrease observed in high flows at those sites however when looking at the whole period for which the rainfall data is available 1962 2017 only one station in the scheldt catchment and one in the meuse catchment still show statistically significant positive trends and there are no negative trends this confirms that trends depend on the observation period blöschl et al 2019 one possible explanation could be that these negative trends are more recent and therefore weaker when taking into account more historical data they would get stronger in the future another hypothesis is that precipitation is linked to atmospheric circulations such as the north atlantic oscillation and therefore has a multidecadal oscillatory behaviour as suggested by willems 2013 looking at the results for each index we notice it is actually the 1 day annual maximum that increases while the maxima of cumulative precipitation decrease with only one station showing a statistically significant negative trend in the 7 day annual maxima blöschl et al 2019 also analysed trends in the 7 day annual maxima between 1960 and 2010 in europe but found increasing trends for all regions except southern europe this demonstrates again the importance of also studying those phenomena at a local scale however these increases in precipitation resulted in increasing high flows only in northwestern europe where winter storms cause winter floods the increase in high flows on the river lesse meuse catchment for which 95 of the am and 80 of the pots occur in the winter is hence most likely due to the increase in precipitation the statistically significant trend in the 1 day annual maxima being relevant for the hydrological characteristic of this catchment in smaller catchments it is the local short and high intensity convective storms that need to be taken into account rather than long synoptic storms this shows the importance of considering the hydrological processes to fully analyse the trends in high flows as for snowfall a study using a model reconstructing the hydroclimatic conditions favourable to winter floods in the ourthe catchment one of the main tributaries of the river meuse found a decreasing trend in the number of days favourable to floods for the period 1959 2010 this is mainly due to a decrease in the snow accumulation and a shortening of the snow season wyard et al 2017 our analyses confirm those results and show that this is actually not restricted to the ourthe catchment as negative trends in snowfall were actually observed at nearly all the 16 study sites for the period 1962 2017 54 on average over 50 years with a standard deviation of 12 calculated using the linear regression equations from the trend detection analysis snowfall as a function of time for the years 1967 and 2017 however from a hydrological point of view snowfall is mainly relevant for the meuse catchment this decrease in snowfall is most likely due to the general increase in temperature also found for all study sites 1 5 c on average for the mean temperature over 50 years with a standard deviation of 0 3 c calculated using the linear regression equations from the trend detection analysis annual mean and minimum winter december march temperatures show an increase of 1 8 c and 3 3 c respectively standard deviations of 0 2 c and 0 6 c on average over 50 years and were actually correlated to the snowfall another important factor in the generation of floods in northwestern europe is the antecedent soil moisture which is influenced by evapotranspiration kundzewicz 2012 a positive trend in the total annual evapotranspiration linked to the increase in temperature was observed at 11 of the sites for the period 1962 2017 the sites in the east for which a negative trend in the precipitation was detected did not show any trends in evapotranspiration an increase in evapotranspiration leads to lower soil moisture which in turn leads to lower flows decreasing trends in high flows were indeed observed at 6 of those sites for the other 5 sites other factors having opposite effects on soil moisture including the increase in precipitation must have influenced the evolution of high flows this shows the complexity of the hydrological processes and their interactions and thus the importance of analysing them in more detail and together to fully understand the causes of changes in high flows for the other factors less data is available however land use changes such as urbanisation are visible on satellite images fig 3 shows an example of an area in the rosières catchment near brussels where an increase in high flows was observed it can be seen that many agricultural fields were converted to built up areas between 1971 and 2017 according to the walloon government the surface of built up areas in wallonia in 2015 was 30 higher than in 1985 the highest increasing rate being in the 1990s 19 7 km2 year on average between 1990 and 2000 spw dgo3 demna dee 2017 one factor that is not often mentioned but could have an impact on the measured flow at a gauging station is the installation of the sewerage network since it changes the drainage of some catchments sewage and rainwater which used to be discharged directly into the river are now collected and transported to the sewage treatment works which is sometimes located downstream of the gauging station this is the case for saint rémy geest for instance and it could partly explain the decrease in high flows at that station in particular since 2004 when the sewage treatment works became operational this analysis gives some insights in the factors that could potentially be responsible for the trends in high flows but did not quantify the relationships between the evolution of each factor or their combinations and the evolution of high flows one way to do this would be through the use of physically based deterministic or stochastic models these allow simulating flow from climatic data and are parameterised according to catchment characteristics as regional patterns have been observed in the trends flood change attribution could also be performed by region as it has been done by viglione et al 2016 the framework proposed by these authors uses fingerprints of the drivers varying with catchment area which allows quantifying their relative contribution however this goes beyond the scope of the study and is left as a suggestion for further work 4 conclusions changes have been detected in the magnitude as well as in the frequency of high flows over the study period 30 50 years depending on the site 19 of the sites analysed in wallonia 16 out of 84 sites show either a positive or a negative trend some regional patterns have also been observed the positive trends are mainly located in the scheldt and lesse catchments while trends in the east and south of the region are mostly negative these opposite results for different regions confirm the need for local scale studies our study has also shown that the magnitude of high flows in wallonia could increase by up to 18 or decrease by up to 11 in 10 years depending on the catchment while their frequency could increase by up to 42 or decrease by up to 31 these figures give us a first idea of the impact the observed changes in high flows could have on their management in the future however a more detailed trend attribution analysis needs to be undertaken this analysis would increase our understanding of the changes in high flows and their relationships with the changes in the climate the catchment and or the river itself which is needed to calculate more precise estimates of the percentages of change indeed it is all the flood generating processes that can be impacted by various continuous or sudden changes which can occur once or several times changes in the climatic variables have been demonstrated in this study increase or decrease in the precipitation depending on the site but in the same direction as the changes in flows general increase in the temperature leading to a decrease in snowfall as well as an increase in the evapotranspiration in some parts of the region this already shows the complexity of flood attribution with climate factors having opposite effects precipitation and evapotranspiration both increasing at the same sites but the influence of land use and other catchment changes also need to be included however we also observed that trends can change depending on the length of the record period considered probably because of internal variations in the data or simply because those trends are more recent this also adds some uncertainty and complexity to the process the use of physically based deterministic or stochastic models is recommended for further work as it would help identify the main factors responsible for the trends these factors could then be added as covariates in the nonstationary models to improve their accuracy once the causes are well understood and modelled future scenarios of change can also be simulated in short despite the relatively short length of the flow series analysed in this study changes in high flows observed elsewhere in europe and in the world have also been seen in wallonia this study has also highlighted the complexity of determining the causes of those changes due to the numerous and interacting factors intervening in the flood generating process however as changes in high flows could have non negligible consequences on flood management design of flood protection infrastructures flood maps it is essential to further analyse the trends credit authorship contribution statement

8332,study region 84 catchments across the walloon region of belgium study focus this study aims at analysing trends in high flows by examining annual maxima am peaks over threshold pots and the number of peaks per year frequency trends were identified using statistical tests regression analysis mann kendall and pettitt tests new hydrological insights for the region almost 12 of the sites show a trend in the magnitude of am and frequency and 6 show a trend in the magnitude of pots globally more negative trends have been detected but the proportion of positive trends is higher in the scheldt catchment than in the meuse catchment the results of nonstationary analysis indicate important changes in the magnitude of the 100 year flood up to 18 increase 11 decrease in 10 years and the frequency of peak flows up to 42 increase 31 decrease these changes could therefore impact future flood risk management in wallonia however the time series are short 30 50 years and some uncertainty remains understanding the mechanisms responsible for the trends is essential to obtain better estimates of future flood flows a first analysis of potential drivers reveals that changes in precipitation match the trends in high flows and lower snowfall quantities and higher evapotranspiration rate caused by the increase in temperature could have contributed to the decrease in high flows in some regions keywords flow annual maxima peaks over threshold trend detection nonstationary flood frequency analysis climate change wallonia 1 introduction over the past two decades many researchers have studied the changes in hydrological data worldwide robson et al 1998 in the uk vogel et al 2011 and archfield et al 2016 in the usa giuntoli et al 2012 in france mangini et al 2018 and blöschl et al 2019 in europe to cite just a few in 2008 milly et al wrote an article entitled stationarity is dead explaining that it should no longer be a default assumption in water management indeed the means and extremes of hydroclimatic variables such as precipitation evapotranspiration and river flow are changing altered mainly by anthropogenic changes of earth s climate nevertheless non stationarity is not taken into account in most water management studies such as the design of flood storage areas and flood maps despite this general statement from milly et al studies looking at high flows usually show more contrasted results in the usa for example more than 60 of the 345 stream gauges analysed using mean daily streamflow did not show any statistically significant trends in either the peak magnitude frequency duration or the volume of frequent flood events over the period 1940 2013 archfield et al 2016 in europe mangini et al 2018 found statistically significant trends in the magnitude of the annual maximum flood peak and the frequency of the peaks for the period 1965 2005 for only 17 and 21 of the sites studied 629 gauging stations recording mean daily discharge respectively and almost half of those trends were negative notwithstanding the fact that global warming will lead to an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events in many regions is quite certain ipcc 2014 there still exists some uncertainty regarding the predictions of extreme river flows mainly because of the complexity of all the different processes involved indeed river flows are influenced by many climatic and non climatic factors which interact with each other for instance the increase in temperature leads to an increase in rainfall quantity due to the higher water holding capacity of the air according to the clausius clapeyron relation on the other hand it also leads to a decrease in snowfall quantities and an increase in the evapotranspiration rates alfieri et al 2015 therefore depending on which flood generating processes dominate in the catchment responses in high flows will be different thober et al 2018 besides global warming there has also been a global change in land use including deforestation changes in agricultural practices and urbanisation this also has an impact on high flows as the type of land use plays an important role in the flood generation processes for example influencing runoff and infiltration since results of flood change detection and prediction vary from a region to another mainly due to the range of climate and land use changes we think studies at local scales are necessary our study focuses on wallonia southeast belgium and articulates into three parts the first part aims at detecting trends in the magnitude and frequency of high flows then an analysis of the trends is carried out using nonstationary frequency analysis and in the last part potential drivers of changes in high flows are discussed 2 methodology 2 1 data the study region wallonia is located in the southeast of belgium and covers an area of 16 844 km2 the altitude increases gradually from the northwest to the southeast and ranges from 50 m to 694 m both temperature and rainfall follow the gradient in the topography the mean temperature varies between 7 5 c and 11 c while the total annual precipitation varies between 700 mm and 1400 mm spw dgo3 demna dee 2017 on the walloon territory there is an extensive water level monitoring network almost 300 stations spread over the whole area this network however is quite recent the first station equipped with monitoring instruments taking hourly measurements was installed in 1967 for our analysis the stations located on non navigable watercourses and providing flow data for at least 30 years up to 2017 were selected i e 84 stations amongst the stations selected 66 are located in the meuse catchment covering 70 of the area of wallonia 17 in the scheldt catchment representing 20 of wallonia and the last one is in the moselle catchment which is part of the rhine river basin district fig 1 the size of the station catchments ranges from 1 4 km2 to2900 km2 the median being 143 km2 to characterise high flows annual maxima am and peaks over threshold pots were extracted from the hourly flow data the number of pots per year was also used to analyse the frequency of high flows the water year october september was used to avoid separating the high flow season into two different years unfortunately data is not continuous and a non negligible quantity of data is missing for 60 stations on average 2 5 years of data are missing but it varies between a few days and 6 years to minimise the impact of this missing data the hydrograph of such stations was visually compared to the hydrograph of a station in the same catchment or in a neighbouring catchment with a similar hydrological regime the annual maximum of a year with missing data was discarded only when the annual maximum of the comparative station occurred in the period of missing data similarly the number of pots per year was adjusted taking into account the number of missing peaks in the record in case of uncertainty a conservative approach was preferred and the data for that year was deleted from the data set 2 2 pot extraction the main advantage of the pots is that all peaks above a threshold are included not only the maximum but also the subsequent highest peaks every year which are sometimes higher than the annual maximum of other years this method is therefore very interesting for short time series as it increases the number of observations analysed it also allows studying the frequency of high flows using the number of pots per year however the extraction of pots is quite complex the first step is to select a threshold it must be low enough in order to select enough peaks but high enough so that the peaks are independent from each other setting the threshold to a fixed quantile for all the time series is frequently used as it is a simple and quick rule but it is inappropriate from a theoretical point of view scarrott and macdonald 2012 in this study those arbitrary rules were avoided and a more robust method that takes into account the data characteristics of each station was preferred the chosen method is the one described by lang et al 1999 and coles 2001 it is based on the adjustment of the generalised pareto gp distribution to the exceedances over the threshold for successive values of the threshold the threshold must be sufficiently high to meet the assumptions of the gp law but low enough to obtain unbiased estimations of the distribution parameters this is ensured by selecting the threshold based on the analysis of three graphs the mean residual life plot the parameter stability plot and the dispersion index plot on the mean residual life plot the lowest threshold from which the mean exceedance above threshold follows a linear trend is selected the parameter stability plot allows checking if the shape and scale parameters of the gp distribution are constant for all threshold values above the selected threshold the dispersion index is the ratio between the variance and the mean of a data set according to the extreme value theory the number of exceedances in a defined time period usually one year follows a poisson distribution for which the dispersion index equals 1 the dispersion index value for the selected threshold must therefore be close to 1 once the threshold has been chosen we must ensure that the selected peaks are independent again different approaches exist in the literature usually based on a minimum number of days between peaks depending on the catchment area sometimes combined with a condition on the flows between two peaks cunnane 1979 interagency advisory committee on water data 1982 lang et al 1999 li et al 2016 mangini et al 2018 svensson et al 2005 willems 2009 in this study the declustering method described by coles 2001 has been used it consists in grouping consecutive values exceeding the threshold and keeping the maximum value for each cluster the clusters being separated from each other by a certain number r of values below the threshold the other values of the clusters are set to the threshold in order not to lose information regarding the frequency of peaks notably for the flood frequency analysis however choosing the value of the parameter r is complex it must be high enough to ensure the independence of the peaks but not too high to avoid losing valuable data it is a compromise between bias and variance for which general guidelines do not exist the approach taken here was to do a first declustering with r equal to 5 days assess the dependence of the peaks on the hydrograph and repeat those two steps with increasing values of r until peaks are independent the extremal index was also taken into account it measures the dependence of extremes and is equal to 1 for independent data series coles 2001 finally the minimum number of pots per year was set to 2 following the studies and advice of cunnane 1973 and taesombut et yevjevich 1978 in order to preserve the added value of the pot approach comparing to am and in many cases ensure a poisson distributed number of pots per year 2 3 trend detection once the series of am and pots had been extracted from the hourly flow data an exploratory analysis was carried out this analysis consists of examining the data on graphs in order to identify potential problems or trends in the data these trends were first quantified using a simple linear regression of the am and pots as a function of time the slope characterising the magnitude of the trend however caution must be taken regarding those results as linear regression is sensitive to outliers and give better results when residues follow a normal distribution svensson et al 2005 this exploratory analysis also included tests to verify the assumptions linked to the statistical tests such as normality lack of autocorrelation and homogeneity kundzewicz and robson 2004 trends were then detected with more confidence using other statistical tests the mann kendall test is often used for trend detection as it does not require the normality of the data and is therefore suitable for hydrological extremes šraj et al 2016 however the results are sensitive to the autocorrelation of the data which can lead to an over or underestimation of the statistical significance of the test the autocorrelation of the data was therefore tested beforehand and a modified mann kendall test was used when the data was autocorrelated giuntoli et al 2012 this modified test adjusts the variance used in the mann kendall test taking into account the effective sample size hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 indeed the data redundancy decreases the effective data set size and thus artificially increases the variance serinaldi and kilsby 2016 in addition the sen s slope was calculated it is the non parametric equivalent to the slope of the linear regression and therefore a good indicator of the magnitude of the trend mangini et al 2018 it is actually the median of the slopes of the lines crossing all pairs of points it is not sensitive to outliers and thus more robust sen 1968 the pettitt test was also used to detect changing points in the data series as it is sensitive to the presence of a monotonous trend in the data rybski and neumann 2011 the test was also done on the residues of the linear regression i e data from which the linear trend was to a certain extent removed to assess the trend in the number of pots per year over time a poisson regression was carried out the statistical significance of the trend was calculated using the chi2 test on the regression slope testing if it is significantly different from 0 this method is seen as the most suitable for count series in the absence of overdispersion mangini et al 2018 the level of statistical significance was set to 5 for all statistical tests 2 4 nonstationary frequency analysis stationarity is one of the requirements for standard frequency analysis the statistical properties of the studied variables their probability distribution in particular must not change with time identically distributed variables if the variables are not stationary then nonstationary frequency analysis should be used coles 2001 this analysis consists in making the parameters of the probability distribution vary with time many authors have studied changes in high flows using this technique šraj et al 2016 on two rivers in slovenia delgado et al 2010 on the river mekong in china and vogel et al 2011 on a number of watercourses in the usa amongst many others we used the generalised extreme value gev distribution for the annual maxima and the point process pp approach for the pots the pp approach is also called poisson gp as the generalised pareto gp distribution is fitted to the threshold excesses and the poisson distribution is fitted to their occurrence its main advantage comparing to the classic gp distribution is the independence of its parameters from the threshold which makes the nonstationary frequency analysis easier to carry out gilleland and katz 2016 scarrott and macdonald 2012 both distributions have a location parameter a scale parameter and a shape parameter the poisson gp has an additional rate parameter which is the mean number of occurrences number of pots per year in this study four models were tested for each time series showing a statistically significant trend 1 the parameters are constant stationary model 2 the location parameter is a linear function of the hydrological year y μ y μ 0 μ 1 y 3 the location and scale parameters are both linear functions of the hydrological year y μ y μ 0 μ 1 y and σ y σ 0 σ 1 y 4 the location and scale parameters are both linear functions of the hydrological year y and the exponential is used for the scale parameter to ensure it has a positive value for any value of the year μ y μ 0 μ 1 y and σ y e x p σ 0 σ 1 y the shape parameter is usually kept constant as its estimation is much more complex coles 2001 the maximum likelihood method was used for the estimation of the parameters models were compared using the aic akaike information criterion and bic bayesian information criterion performance indices as well as the likelihood ratio test which allows testing whether adding a variable in the model is statistically significant or not gilleland and katz 2016 the model with the lowest aic and bic and for which the likelihood ratio test was statistically significant when compared to the stationary model was considered the best model the chosen nonstationary model was then used to compute specific return period floods in particular the 100 year return period flood for the year 2017 was compared to the stationary 100 year return period flood the flood magnification factor defined by vogel et al 2011 as the ratio between the flow value in 10 years 2027 and the actual flow value 2017 was also calculated however caution needs to be taken with such extrapolations as they assume the high flows will follow the same observed trend in the future gilleland and katz 2016 for the frequency of high flows the number of peaks in 2017 calculated using the poisson regression equation was compared to the mean number of peaks per year under stationary conditions the magnification factor was also computed 2 5 analysis of potential drivers flood generating processes depend on many factors that can undergo changes these changes can be continuous or sudden and can occur once or several times the potential drivers of trends in high flows are therefore numerous merz et al 2012 climatic changes changes in rainfall snowfall atmospheric circulation temperature evapotranspiration antecedent soil moisture etc land use changes urbanisation deforestation changes in types of crops or agricultural management practices drainage of wetlands and agricultural areas construction of flood storage areas etc river modifications straightening narrowing deepening by dredging for example construction of dams or changes in their operation etc some of these factors were analysed more closely in this study using the same method as for flows i e trends were detected using linear regression mann kendall and pettitt tests similarly to the nonstationary frequency analysis the analyses were only carried out on the catchments showing a statistically significant trend in the high flows we focused on climatic variables precipitation snow temperature and evapotranspiration data were obtained for each catchment from 1 january 1961 until 31 december 2017 using the epicgrid model sohier et al 2009 in this model snow data is actually derived from precipitation data when temperature falls below 0 c snowfall is therefore calculated in mm of precipitation it also allows the simulation of quantities of melted snow and snow left on the ground at the end of each day the latter being used in this study as an approximation of snowpack depth as for the resolution of the data the model works on a 1 km grid but the original data was on a 5 km grid obtained from kriging meteorological station data however this data was not available at an hourly rate annual indices were calculated from daily data in order to make the comparison with flow annual maxima these indices were computed for each catchment by hydrological year for the same period as the flow data as well as for the whole data set period since 1962 table 1 below shows the different annual indices used for each type of climatic data other factors such as urbanisation and the installation of sewerage networks were also analysed qualitatively using satellite images and information from utility companies all the statistical analyses in this study were done on r version 3 4 3 r core team 2017 using the following packages extremes version 2 0 8 gilleland and katz 2016 pot version 1 1 6 ribatet and dutang 2016 trend version 1 1 0 pohlert 2018 and fume version 1 0 santander meteorology group 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 trends table 2 shows the number of sites where a statistically significant trend was detected and the corresponding percentages over the total number of sites for the analysed variables almost 12 of the stations show a statistically significant trend in the magnitude of am and or the number of peaks per year frequency but only 6 show a trend in the magnitude of pots in total there are actually 16 different sites 19 which show a statistically significant trend in at least one of the three variables analysed as statistically significant trends were sometimes detected for different variables at the same site we can see there are more negative than positive trends we also observe that the stations showing a trend in the magnitude are not necessarily the same as the ones showing a trend in the frequency changes in the magnitude do not imply changes in the frequency or vice versa finally there are more statistically significant trends in the magnitude of am than in the magnitude of pots these three observations are shared with svensson et al 2005 who studied 21 stations worldwide with a record of daily mean flow for 44 100 years they explained the last observation by the fact that lower peaks below the pot threshold are selected for am and the slope of the trend is therefore steeper which matches our results despite the difference in the length of the time series analysed even though these numbers seem low they are similar to other european studies in the study by mangini et al 2018 on 629 stations recording mean daily flow in europe for the period 1965 2005 9 7 of the sites showed a positive trend in the magnitude of am and 7 6 showed a negative trend for the continental hydro climatic region which includes the east of belgium and france germany the north of italy switzerland austria and other eastern european countries they found 8 6 and 6 9 of positive and negative trends respectively these numbers are very close to our results for the negative trends 7 1 but more positive trends were detected by mangini et al 4 8 in our study they analysed trends in the magnitude of pots for several data sets in which the average number of pots per year differs as the average number of pots per year across all the stations in our study is 2 7 we examined their results for 3 pots per year and similar conclusions can be drawn 5 9 and 3 2 of the stations in the continental hydro climatic region show positive and negative trends respectively while these percentages in our study are 2 4 and 3 6 they also detected more trends in the frequency of pots 23 7 than in their magnitude 9 1 these percentages are respectively 11 9 and 6 in our study the european floodfreq report on flood frequency analysis in a changing environment includes the results of trend detection studies on extreme precipitation and or streamflow in 21 countries madsen et al 2013 they concluded that extreme precipitation is generally increasing but there are no clear indications of a general increase in extreme streamflow at the regional or national scale however increases in extreme streamflow were detected for smaller regions several studies also report a decrease in extreme flows in regions where snowmelt is the main flood generating process the more recent study of blöschl et al 2019 on 3738 european gauging stations found regional patterns in northwestern europe 69 of the stations showed an increasing flood trend when analysing annual maxima based on daily mean or instantaneous discharge for the period 1960 2010 only a few belgian stations were included in this study and statistically significant positive trends were found for stations on the lower meuse and its tributaries a station in germany near the eastern border of belgium showed a significant negative trend when mapping the results figs 2 a b and c we observe there is no general trend for the whole wallonia but local patterns are present which confirms the importance of studying changes in high flows at a local scale on these maps the stations have been colour coded according to the sign of the sen s slope and the statistical significance of the trend the level of significance being 5 we can see that for the annual maxima fig 2 a the trends in the scheldt catchment are mainly positive in the meuse catchment except for the lesse negative trends dominate and they are mainly located in the south semois chiers and moselle catchments and the east ourthe amblève and vesdre catchments the map for the magnitude of pots fig 2 b displays very similar patterns with a lower number of statistically significant trends as for the frequency fig 2 c a few stations in the meuse catchment which show a positive trend or no trend in the magnitude show a negative trend in the number of pots per year robson et al already explained in 1998 that the internal variation in the flood records usually linked to climate fluctuations makes trend detection very difficult statistical detection is possible only for very noticeable trends or for long data sets although they used 40 to 50 year periods they recommend redoing the analyses with more data to confirm the presence or absence of trends blöschl et al 2019 also stated that trends are influenced by the observation period and could therefore be different if a longer period was analysed this clearly shows the limitation of our data as the length of the records ranges from 30 to 50 years however milly et al 2015 argue that even if trends are not statistically significant and some uncertainty exists climate change effects are increasing in magnitude in such a way that they cannot be ignored in future water management and in particular in the design of structures that are supposed to last decades 3 2 nonstationary frequency analysis stationary and nonstationary models described in section 2 5 were fitted to the time series showing a statistically significant trend tables 3 and 4 give a summary of the results of this analysis in table 3 we can see that models 3 and 4 with both scale and location parameters being time dependent perform the best for most stations the difference between the stationary 100 year return period flood and the 2017 100 year return period flood calculated with the best nonstationary model ranges from 2 6 to 30 1 and the decadal magnification reduction factor ranges from 0 89 to 1 18 for the magnitude of am and pots this is lower than the magnification factors observed in the usa ranging from 0 45 to 3 vogel et al 2011 this could be explained by the differences in catchment characteristics between wallonia and the usa but also by the fact that vogel et al used an exponential relationship to describe the evolution of quantiles over time the difference between the observed mean number of pots per year and the number of pots per year in 2017 calculated using the poisson regression varies between 28 8 and 87 2 as for the decadal magnification reduction factor it ranges from 0 69 to 1 42 for some catchments although a trend was detected in the time series using the statistical tests the stationary model was outperforming the nonstationary models these catchments are therefore not included in table 3 the nonstationary model could potentially be improved by replacing time as a covariate by other explanatory variables that are more related to the physical processes such as precipitation and land use changes or by using other types of relationships to describe the evolution of high flows over time this highlights the need to better understand the trends in high flows origin and type before doing more complex and especially predictive analyses according to serinaldi et al 2018 non stationarity in the population cannot solely be inferred from trend detection tests carried out on observed data the causes of the detected inhomogeneities need to be understood in order to extrapolate conclusions beyond the period of records and justify the use of nonstationary models otherwise the models would give unrealistic predictions serinaldi and kilsby 2015 3 3 potential drivers first precipitation was analysed negative trends in at least one of the indices 1 2 3 and 7 day annual maxima were found for five catchments in the east of the region and positive trends were found on the river lesse and at two sites in the scheldt catchment these trends match the increase or decrease observed in high flows at those sites however when looking at the whole period for which the rainfall data is available 1962 2017 only one station in the scheldt catchment and one in the meuse catchment still show statistically significant positive trends and there are no negative trends this confirms that trends depend on the observation period blöschl et al 2019 one possible explanation could be that these negative trends are more recent and therefore weaker when taking into account more historical data they would get stronger in the future another hypothesis is that precipitation is linked to atmospheric circulations such as the north atlantic oscillation and therefore has a multidecadal oscillatory behaviour as suggested by willems 2013 looking at the results for each index we notice it is actually the 1 day annual maximum that increases while the maxima of cumulative precipitation decrease with only one station showing a statistically significant negative trend in the 7 day annual maxima blöschl et al 2019 also analysed trends in the 7 day annual maxima between 1960 and 2010 in europe but found increasing trends for all regions except southern europe this demonstrates again the importance of also studying those phenomena at a local scale however these increases in precipitation resulted in increasing high flows only in northwestern europe where winter storms cause winter floods the increase in high flows on the river lesse meuse catchment for which 95 of the am and 80 of the pots occur in the winter is hence most likely due to the increase in precipitation the statistically significant trend in the 1 day annual maxima being relevant for the hydrological characteristic of this catchment in smaller catchments it is the local short and high intensity convective storms that need to be taken into account rather than long synoptic storms this shows the importance of considering the hydrological processes to fully analyse the trends in high flows as for snowfall a study using a model reconstructing the hydroclimatic conditions favourable to winter floods in the ourthe catchment one of the main tributaries of the river meuse found a decreasing trend in the number of days favourable to floods for the period 1959 2010 this is mainly due to a decrease in the snow accumulation and a shortening of the snow season wyard et al 2017 our analyses confirm those results and show that this is actually not restricted to the ourthe catchment as negative trends in snowfall were actually observed at nearly all the 16 study sites for the period 1962 2017 54 on average over 50 years with a standard deviation of 12 calculated using the linear regression equations from the trend detection analysis snowfall as a function of time for the years 1967 and 2017 however from a hydrological point of view snowfall is mainly relevant for the meuse catchment this decrease in snowfall is most likely due to the general increase in temperature also found for all study sites 1 5 c on average for the mean temperature over 50 years with a standard deviation of 0 3 c calculated using the linear regression equations from the trend detection analysis annual mean and minimum winter december march temperatures show an increase of 1 8 c and 3 3 c respectively standard deviations of 0 2 c and 0 6 c on average over 50 years and were actually correlated to the snowfall another important factor in the generation of floods in northwestern europe is the antecedent soil moisture which is influenced by evapotranspiration kundzewicz 2012 a positive trend in the total annual evapotranspiration linked to the increase in temperature was observed at 11 of the sites for the period 1962 2017 the sites in the east for which a negative trend in the precipitation was detected did not show any trends in evapotranspiration an increase in evapotranspiration leads to lower soil moisture which in turn leads to lower flows decreasing trends in high flows were indeed observed at 6 of those sites for the other 5 sites other factors having opposite effects on soil moisture including the increase in precipitation must have influenced the evolution of high flows this shows the complexity of the hydrological processes and their interactions and thus the importance of analysing them in more detail and together to fully understand the causes of changes in high flows for the other factors less data is available however land use changes such as urbanisation are visible on satellite images fig 3 shows an example of an area in the rosières catchment near brussels where an increase in high flows was observed it can be seen that many agricultural fields were converted to built up areas between 1971 and 2017 according to the walloon government the surface of built up areas in wallonia in 2015 was 30 higher than in 1985 the highest increasing rate being in the 1990s 19 7 km2 year on average between 1990 and 2000 spw dgo3 demna dee 2017 one factor that is not often mentioned but could have an impact on the measured flow at a gauging station is the installation of the sewerage network since it changes the drainage of some catchments sewage and rainwater which used to be discharged directly into the river are now collected and transported to the sewage treatment works which is sometimes located downstream of the gauging station this is the case for saint rémy geest for instance and it could partly explain the decrease in high flows at that station in particular since 2004 when the sewage treatment works became operational this analysis gives some insights in the factors that could potentially be responsible for the trends in high flows but did not quantify the relationships between the evolution of each factor or their combinations and the evolution of high flows one way to do this would be through the use of physically based deterministic or stochastic models these allow simulating flow from climatic data and are parameterised according to catchment characteristics as regional patterns have been observed in the trends flood change attribution could also be performed by region as it has been done by viglione et al 2016 the framework proposed by these authors uses fingerprints of the drivers varying with catchment area which allows quantifying their relative contribution however this goes beyond the scope of the study and is left as a suggestion for further work 4 conclusions changes have been detected in the magnitude as well as in the frequency of high flows over the study period 30 50 years depending on the site 19 of the sites analysed in wallonia 16 out of 84 sites show either a positive or a negative trend some regional patterns have also been observed the positive trends are mainly located in the scheldt and lesse catchments while trends in the east and south of the region are mostly negative these opposite results for different regions confirm the need for local scale studies our study has also shown that the magnitude of high flows in wallonia could increase by up to 18 or decrease by up to 11 in 10 years depending on the catchment while their frequency could increase by up to 42 or decrease by up to 31 these figures give us a first idea of the impact the observed changes in high flows could have on their management in the future however a more detailed trend attribution analysis needs to be undertaken this analysis would increase our understanding of the changes in high flows and their relationships with the changes in the climate the catchment and or the river itself which is needed to calculate more precise estimates of the percentages of change indeed it is all the flood generating processes that can be impacted by various continuous or sudden changes which can occur once or several times changes in the climatic variables have been demonstrated in this study increase or decrease in the precipitation depending on the site but in the same direction as the changes in flows general increase in the temperature leading to a decrease in snowfall as well as an increase in the evapotranspiration in some parts of the region this already shows the complexity of flood attribution with climate factors having opposite effects precipitation and evapotranspiration both increasing at the same sites but the influence of land use and other catchment changes also need to be included however we also observed that trends can change depending on the length of the record period considered probably because of internal variations in the data or simply because those trends are more recent this also adds some uncertainty and complexity to the process the use of physically based deterministic or stochastic models is recommended for further work as it would help identify the main factors responsible for the trends these factors could then be added as covariates in the nonstationary models to improve their accuracy once the causes are well understood and modelled future scenarios of change can also be simulated in short despite the relatively short length of the flow series analysed in this study changes in high flows observed elsewhere in europe and in the world have also been seen in wallonia this study has also highlighted the complexity of determining the causes of those changes due to the numerous and interacting factors intervening in the flood generating process however as changes in high flows could have non negligible consequences on flood management design of flood protection infrastructures flood maps it is essential to further analyse the trends credit authorship contribution statement

climate change on socio economic activities that use water resources keywords faleme basin gr4j model climate change 1 introduction climate change is unequivocal ipcc 2007 and the resulting consequences are likely to increase in the coming decades worldwide the impacts of climate change on various sectors agriculture water resources health etc and ecosystems are the subject of particular attention and raise the concern of a growing proportion of the international scientific community and policy makers moreover the modification of the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation the increase of average temperatures the decrease of river flows or the increase in the frequency of extreme hydro meteorological events have negative consequences among these impacts those on water resources raise many concerns about the future availability of this vital resource in the world in africa and in the sahel particularly studies have addressed the issue of climate change impacts with strong uncertainties and divergences in models projections ali and amani 2010 the results of abiodun et al 2017 have shown that the agricultural systems could be negatively impacted by the changes in wet and dry periods moreover risks of catastrophic flooding events and crop water stress are projected to become more frequent déqué et al 2017 furthermore mbaye et al 2019 used output of regional climate models rcms over senegal to reveal an increase in dry spells and a decrease in the number of wet days in northern senegal the decrease in mean precipitation is accompanied by a projected increase in the annual number of dry days mbaye et al 2015a over the senegal river basin at the bakel outlet mbaye et al 2015b found probable decreases of streamflow and soil moisture hence additional research efforts are needed for a better understanding and documentation to guide adaptation policies and decision making in a context of climate change thus in the effort to limit global warming the international community reached an agreement on climate change at the 21st conference of the parties cop 21 held in paris in 2015 this agreement calls for maintaining the overall increase in global mean temperature below 2 c ideally below 1 5 c compared to pre industrial temperatures the faleme catchment west africa is also concerned by the impacts of global warming however there are a lack of studies carried out to determine the likely climate change impacts that will characterize the water resources in this basin the water resources of this basin are now under high pressure due to increased agricultural and mining activities with the construction project of a hydroelectric dam the watercourse will be under more pressure because a large amount of water will be mobilized for the production of hydroelectricity these activities will likely have great impact on the availability of water resources and on the river regimes in addition the potential impacts of climate change on water resources may exacerbate hydroclimate conditions in this context it becomes relevant to investigate to what extent and how the international global warming targets will affect the hydrology of the faleme assessing the impacts of climate change on water resources is one of the major challenges of the 21st century velázquez et al 2015 in order to put in place effective planning strategies it is absolutely necessary to study the impacts of climate change on the watershed it is in this context that this work aims to study the impacts of climate change on the water resources of the faleme watershed under 1 5 c and 2 c global warming levels gwls thus this study attempts to provide answers to the following scientific questions what will be the potential changes in precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration of the basin under gwls and how will the basin s streamflow be impacted to answer these questions output of regional climate models rcms will be bias corrected before its use as forcing input into the hydrological model gr4j perrin et al 2003 bias correction of climate model output has the advantage of improving the representation of observed hydrological variables such as discharge or groundwater recharge by model simulations wörner et al 2019 this paper is organized as following section 1 is dedicated to the introduction material and methods are given in section 2 results and discussion are presented in section 3 and finally we present conclusions in section 4 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the faleme catchment is situated between latitudes 12 11 14 27 n and longitudes 11 12 12 15 0 in western africa fig 1 the faleme is one of the main tributaries on the left bank of the senegal river its watershed covers an area of 28 900 km2 and is shared between three countries senegal mali and guinea it rises at an altitude of 800 m in an area of lateritic plateaus at the foot of the fouta djalon mountains and extends for about 625 km until it meets the senegal river the faleme covers three geographical and climatic domains guinean soudanian and sahelian according to faye and sow 2014 we used two stations for discharge gourbassi and kidira gourbassi is localized in the soudanian domain and kidira in the sahelian domain the guinean domain characterizes the upstream climate as we have a south north rainfall gradient with maximum in southern basin and minimum in northern basin the guinean domain is the wetter zone highest rainfall average follow by the soudanian intermediate rainfall average between the other climate zones and the sahelian lowest rainfall average respectively then the discharge at gourbassi is influenced by climatic conditions in the guinean and the soudanian zones and the discharge measured at the main outlet of the basin kidira which is more downstream is under the influence of the all climate domains of the basin this justifies that kidira has the highest values of river discharge than those at gourbassi upper precambrian rocks and paleozoic sedimentary rocks are the main geological formations of the basin the stations used in this study are represented in fig 1 the vegetation of the basin ranges from semi arid savannah in the north to sub humid forest in the south the water resources of this river which used to be under very little stress are now under very strong pressure due to withdrawals for mining gold mining and increased agricultural activities with the construction project of the hydroelectric dam at gourbassi the river will come under further pressure as a large amount of water will be mobilized for hydroelectric production also a gold mining company called sabodola gold operations sgo located in sabodola city has an authorization to build three water retention basins of 15 million cubic meters per year furthermore there is a project to exploit the iron of the faleme which could also negatively impact water resources this means that a decrease in the availability of water resources in the basin could be extremely problematic the long term of rainfall index 1901 2013 cru climate research unit datasets have shown noticeably two different contrast a relatively wet period during the seven first decades and more water deficit in the second period with high interannual variability as for potential evapotranspiration it showed an upward trend the mean river discharge at kidira show an upward tendency from 1980 to 2010 with strong interannual variability not shown here 2 2 data 2 2 1 observed data meteorological data are among the input variables necessary for hydrological modeling an accurate and consistent estimate of these variables is essential to obtain adequate hydrological simulation results roy 2011 the daily observed climatic data rainfall temperature evapotranspiration used to run the hydrological model were provided by the national agency of civil aviation and meteorology anacim of senegal for senegalese stations and by the national meteorological directions of guinea and mali for guinean and malian stations daily observed flows at gourbassi and kidira were obtained from the national directions in charge water flow management of mali and senegal respectively these daily data cover the period 1984 2005 hydrological observations have been conducted in the kidira station since 1930 and gourbassi station since 1954 but there are lot of missing data in the time series we used only the period 1984 2005 that match the period of the other observational data e g rainfall temperature the availability of daily meteorological variables was the main issue as we did not use the whole period since then beginning that s why we only gave the studied period in the paper the average precipitation and air temperature were obtained here by calculating the mean of all available stations we divided the sum of rainfall from all stations by the number of stations 2 2 2 simulated climate data to evaluate the effects of climate change on water resources in the faleme watershed we used output of three rcms within the coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex giorgi et al 2009 this is a wcrp world climate research program framework to evaluate regional climate model performance through a set of experiments aiming at producing regional climate projections one of its goals is to evaluate and improve regional climate downscaling models and techniques in order to better understand relevant regional local climate phenomena their variability and changes through downscaling https cordex org the simulations have a half degree spatial resolution 0 44 x0 44 the climate change scenarios are based on the warming targets of the paris agreements 1 5 c and 2 c these warming levels are obtained with regards to pre industrial levels sylla et al 2018 the choice of the three regional models rcms is motivated by the fact that they are widely and successfully used in climate change impact studies in west africa camara et al 2013 diallo et al 2012 sylla et al 2018 mbaye et al 2019 the three rcms bccr wrf bjerknes centre for climate research weather research and forecasting dmi hirham danish meteorological institute regional atmospheric climate model rcm based on a subset of the hirlam high resolution limited area model and smhi rca swedish meteorological and hydrological institute rossby centre regional atmospheric climate model were driven by ncc noresm1 m norwegian climate centre norwegian earth system model 1 medium resolution during the historical period 1976 2005 the 1 5 c warming period 2029 2058 and the 2 0 c warming period 2064 2093 the comparison between climate model output and observed data has shown that the models reproduce well the annual cycle of temperature fig s1 evapotranspiration fig s2 and precipitation fig s3 however the magnitudes are sometimes underestimated overestimated then the bias corrected climate data give better representation of the basin s climate as it was shown by mbaye et al 2015a 2 3 methods 2 3 1 estimation of mean precipitation and reference evapotranspiration the average precipitation was obtained here by calculating the mean of all available stations we divided the sum of rainfall from all stations by the number of stations furthermore we use geographical coordinates longitude latitude to extract each station from the climate model simulations before calculating their average as for the reference evapotranspiration we used hargreaves and samani 1985 reference evapotranspiration according to fao56 it is given by 1 e t 0 0 0023 t m e a n 17 8 t m a x t m i n 0 5 r a where et0 mm day 1 is the reference evapotranspiration ra the extraterrestrial radiation mjm 2 day 1 as a function of latitude and day of the year tmax the daily maximum temperature c and tmin the daily minimum temperature c 2 3 2 bias correction bias correction is a statistical technique widely used to correct climate simulations in climate change impact studies piani et al 2010 hagemann et al 2011 hempel et al 2013 mbaye et al 2015a etc in this study we use the cdf t cumulative distribution function transform developed by michelangeli et al 2009 to bias correct regional climate simulations cdf t is a statistical method based on quantile mapping qm that adjusts climate model simulations compared to observations this method considers the cdf change between historical and future climate simulations let fgh and fsh define the cdfs of a variable from the rcm subscript g and from a given reference location subscript s over a historical calibration period subscript h the transformation t allowing to go from fgh to fsh is given by 2 t f g h x f s h x replacing x with f 1 gh u where u is any probability in 0 1 we have x f g p 1 u 3 t u f s h f g h 1 u which provides a definition of t assuming t is stationary in time the transformation can be applied to fgf the cdf of the variable over a future or validation period f to generate fsf the cdf at the reference location for the same period f as follows 4 t f g f x f s f x that is 5 f s f x t f g f x f s f x f s h f g h 1 f g f x once fsf has been determined from eq 4 a qq quantile quantile approach is carried out between fgf and fsf to generate local time series famien et al 2018 the cdf t method generates quantile values through a qq performed between fgf and fsf values are then generated according to fsf in chronological agreement with future climate simulations 2 3 3 hydrological modeling in order to assess the impact of climate change on the hydrology of the basin we use the rainfall runoff hydrological model gr4j perrin et al 2003 this model operates at basin scale with daily time step the gr4j modelling approach is mainly empirical michel et al 2006 and consists of searching data for the most efficient model structures with the objective of getting a general efficient and robust model this model has been used widely in hydrological studies tegegne et al 2017 faty et al 2018 velázquez zapata 2019 kunnath poovakka and eldho 2019 etc compared with other hydrological models it has provided satisfactory results perrin 2000 perrin et al 2003 vaze et al 2011 etc the meteorological input data of the model are rainfall depth p and potential evapotranspiration e the output of this model is river flow all water quantities input output internal variables are expressed daily in mm by dividing water volumes by catchment area when necessary the scheme of the model is given in fig 2 details on the functioning of the model at each time step are given in the supplementary materials as described in perrin et al 2003 the meaning of each model s variable and parameter is given as following e average potential evapotranspiration p average rainfall en net evapotranspiration capacity pn net rainfall es actual evaporation ps amount of net rainfall that goes directly to the production store pn ps amount of net rainfall that goes directly to the routing functions s water content in the production store perc percolation leakage pr total quantity of water to reach routing functions uh1 and uh2 unit hydrographs

production soil store mm x2 water exchange coefficient mm x3 capacity of the routing store mm x4 time parameter days for unit hydrographs 2 3 3 1 calibration and validation of the g4j the period 1984 2005 was divided into two periods for calibration and validation of the g4j we did two calibrations and two validations by changing each period first period last period and last period first period in order to get the best criteria in calibration and validation hence the model was finally calibrated under the period 1996 2005 and validated under the period 1985 1995 we took one year as warm up spin up period as done by zhang et al 2015 in order to avoid the influence of initial conditions in the water storages here we use automatic calibration that is based on changing by iteration the values of the parameters x1 x2 x3 and x4 in a regular interval until we get the optimal values of the performance criteria 2 3 3 2 model performance criteria in order to evaluate the performance of the gr4j model we use the following criteria nash sutcliffe efficiency 1970 which is commonly used to assess the goodness fit in hydrological models 6 n s e 1 j 1 n q o j q s j 2 j 1 n q o j q o 2 where q o j denotes the observed discharge at the day j q s j is the simulated one and q o is the averaged observed streamflow nse ranges from to 1 0 with high values indicating better agreement nse 1 indicates a perfect match of simulated and observed data nse 0 corresponds to the model predictions matching the mean of the measured data and nse 0shows that the measured mean is a better predictor than the model legates and mccabe 1999 table 1 gives the range of the performance values of nse according to bouizrou 2015 the two major outlets gourbassi and kidira of the basin were considered in the hydrological modeling 3 results and discussion 3 1 observed and simulated hydrographs during calibration and validation fig 3 presents the simulated red color and observed blue color daily hydrographs of the faleme watershed at gourbassi and kidira during the calibration period 1996 2005 the shape of the simulated hydrographs compared to that of the observed hydrographs is well reproduced in both stations however peak flows during the years 2001 and 2002 were underestimated at kidira and gourbassi low flows simulated and observed were found in years 2001 2002 and 2003 the peak flows at kidira up to 1500 m3 s are higher than those at gourbassi up to 1000 m3 s this is due to the fact that kidira is the main outlet which controls all the waters drained by the watershed as for validation fig 4 the signals of observed and simulated hydrographs are similar in other words there is a good correspondence between both datasets in the two sub watersheds gourbassi and kidira the simulated peak flows are well located in time but are often underestimated particularly in 1989 1990 and 1993 the underestimation of the flows simulated by the gr4j model is more marked in gourbassi than in kidira it should be noted that the values of the simulated flows during the calibration period are always greater than those of the simulated flows during the validation period this be can due to higher dynamics of the basin during the calibration period 1996 2005 which is dominated by wet years even though there are some dry years this period covers the end of severe drought periods before year 2000 and a relatively normal to wet conditions after year 2000 in the sahel it was also noted a higher interannual variability of precipitation and increased human activities that impact the basin s hydrology during this period as for the validation period 1985 1995 there are also wet and dry years even though the general trend is dry conditions this combined with lower basin s dynamics lead to relatively lower values of nse due to the normalized variance of the observed discharge data in the nse formula during the validation period krause et al 2005 furthermore during validation the simulation is better at gourbassi than at kidira this is probably due to the smaller size of the gourbassi sub basin which is more homogenous than the kidira sub basin the larger the basin the greater the complexity to handle adequately the hydrological processes other factors such as soil type vegetation topography that are not taken into account in the modeling scheme can justify mismatches the fact that the low flows were not successfully simulated by the gr4j is in line with the work of bodian et al 2016 the limited length of the time series of observed data which did not include all types of particular hydrometeorological events during both the calibration and validation periods may explain some mismatches between simulations and observations montecelos zamora et al 2018 the discrepancies between the calculated and observed runoff may be explained by the fact that the variation of some important factors such as soil type vegetation topography human activities etc that play a key role in the process of runoff are not taken into account by the model furthermore the change of direction of the aquifer river transfer during the year could be responsible of that then this complex behavior and the time invariance of model parameters may be the origin of the overestimation of streamflow during low flows season moreover low values of the capacity of the soil store production and the capacity of the routing store during the dry season may lead to a stronger response to the rainfall inputs and to a more rapid hydrological response zeng et al 2019 the limited number of rainfall stations and their spatial distribution over the basin affect also the simulations results the underestimation of peak flow can be explained also by the fact that the flood peaks are difficult to reproduce in magnitude due to their sudden appearance faye and sow 2014 3 2 model performance assessment table 2 summarizes model performance based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency during calibration and validation both values found during calibration are greater than or equal to 0 7 this shows the goodness of simulations however in the validation period values were 0 58 and 0 62 at kidira and gourbassi respectively these latter values are below 0 7 though still within the range of satisfactory values according to table 1 the highest nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was obtained during calibration in both stations the degradation of the nash criterion between calibration and validation is probably linked to the humidity and the inhomogeneity of two periods the distribution of atmospheric precipitation air temperature and years with extreme low and high precipitation over the basin affect considerably the average precipitation this basin is within the senegal river basin which is subject to a large south north precipitation gradient ranging from more than 1800 mm year 1 in the south to 200 mm year 1 in the north stisen et al 2008 the air temperature follows a zonal pattern with maximum values in the north and minimum values in the south mbaye et al 2015b the average precipitation over the basin and the downstream streamflow are considerably affected by the relative humid conditions in the south mbaye et al 2018a have shown that low rainfall intensity and low high rainfall events contribute to a drying of the basin during extreme wet years with increase of the frequency of heavy rainfall more water will be available for runoff generation the increase of extreme heavy rainfall events is known to cause flood because of large amount of water in short time in addition the global increase in warm nights and warm days could lead to an increase of water losses through evaporation that reduce soil water content mbaye et al 2018b years with extreme low precipitation combined with higher evapotranspiration rate would cause hydrological drought conditions with evidence of low water supplies mbaye et al 2019 the evaluation of the gr4j simulations during calibration and validation shows generally satisfactory results even though in some years the magnitudes of streamflow are not well captured this could be due to the shortcomings of the hydrological model to handle adequately some hydrological processes in addition the quality of the observed meteorological data and the fact that anthropogenic activity is not taken into account could affect the hydrological simulations once this evaluation process is performed during the historical period it is important to investigate the basin s hydroclimate in the future under climate change scenarios 3 3 potential changes of the basin hydroclimate 3 3 1 seasonal cycle of rainfall temperature and evapotranspiration these results are obtained by the average of all stations over the basin we compare the 1 5 c warming period 2029 2058 and the 2 0 c warming period 2064 2093 to the historical period 1976 2005 of the rcms data the seasonal cycle of rainfall fig 5 shows a decrease during the main rainy season under both warming levels the hirham model depicts the highest decrease however precipitation is likely to increase with smhi rca this difference in the climate change signal between climate models can be explained by the differences in physical parametrizations especially convection schemes as for temperature fig 6 and potential evapotranspiration fig 7 a general increase is projected in all models and scenarios the signal of temperature is similar to that of evapotranspiration this increase can be mainly attributed to increased greenhouse gases 3 3 2 evolution of river discharge the variation of river discharge from historical to future gwls is represented as boxplots in fig 8 streamflow is likely to decrease in both stations and scenarios with wrf and hirham but not with the rca regional climate model this decrease is due to the decrease of rainfall and the increase of potential evapotranspiration the analysis of the median values of the boxplots of the two drying models shows that during the historical period the median value obtained is much higher than the median values under the two warmings levels the median value obtained with 1 5 c warming is greater than that obtained with 2 c warming in contrast the smhi rca model projects an increase in streamflow under 1 5 c warming with a median value higher than that of the historical however this same model smhi rca predicts the same trend as the other two under 2 c warming this downward trend is more significant with the 2 c warming in gourbassi than in kidira these results indicate that the availability of surface water resources in the faleme watershed might decrease in the coming decades due to its higher decrease in precipitation the gourbassi sub basin seems to be the most vulnerable to climate change the flow changes are influenced by climate factors and other factors related to land use cover changes and anthropogenic activities and hydraulic infrastructures as we used a rainfall runoff model climate factors are the main drivers of the river flow changes the main climate factors are precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration then the decrease of precipitation combined with the increase of temperature and evapotranspiration lead to less water availability for runoff moreover high the evapotranspiration is less is soil moisture that facilitate runoff the increase of global warming enhances the water holding capacity of the atmosphere and therefore increases the loss of surface water and soil water through evapotranspiration process mbaye et al 2019 this impact the basin s flow 3 3 3 mean river discharge changes the projected flow changes by the hydrological model gr4j obtained by feeding the outputs of the regional climatic models fig 9 show a decrease in flows which can go beyond 40 all input data from rcms and their ensemble mean project a decrease in river flows over the entire basin which is more marked in gourbassi than in kidira except for results obtained with the smhi rca model which exhibits an increase up to 20 these results are in line with the monthly changes of river discharge figs 10 and 11 the drop in flow rate is more pronounced during the season of high flows july to october at both gauging stations during the dry season there is no substantial flow changes then the annual flow changes are almost the consequences of the seasonal changes during the rainy season this is the fact that precipitation is the dominant factor in rainfall runoff model the decrease of water flow is likely to be more significant under 2 0 c warming scenario the decline of streamflow could reach 200 m3s 1 by mid and end of 21st century a decrease in river discharge was also underlined by bodian et al 2018 over the gambia and the upper senegal basins the changes obtained under 2 0 c are more pronounced than the changes under 1 5 c this means that more warming will lead to greater water decline therefore limiting global warming under the ideal warming level target of the paris agreement 1 5 c will reduce considerably the consequences on water resources these results are similar to those of nangombe et al 2019 who stated that limiting global warming to 1 5 c instead of the previously suggested 2 c could indeed translate into substantial benefits of reducing the intensity and frequency of extreme heat events across africa the differences in the climate change impacts and signals are related to the driving gcm the rcm and the hydrological model arheimer and lindström 2015 the most considerable changes of the basin hydroclimate are those of temperature and potential evapotranspiration in addition to the effect of global warming other factors such as atmospheric humidity surface soil moisture the length of the vegetation period net radiation and the wind characteristics have substantial impacts on the changes of evapotranspiration olsson et al 2016 which in turn impact runoff 4 conclusions in this study we calibrate and validate the gr4j hydrological model with observational datasets and then assess the potential impact of global warming levels targets on the hydrology of the faleme catchment for the calibration and validation procedures the values of the statistical evaluation criteria were satisfactory and show the performance and robustness of the rainfall runoff model with regards to the simulated and observed hydrographs the hydrological regimes of the basin were fairly well reproduced by the hydrological model the simulated discharge at kidira is higher than the river flow at gourbassi however it has to be noted that in some years the hydrological model did not capture well the magnitude of streamflow in both stations as for future projections of the basin s hydroclimate all models predict a general rise in temperatures and potential evapotranspiration by mid and end of the 21st century under the two global warming levels considered here 1 5 c and 2 c two rcms dmi hirham and bccr wrf and the overall average of all three rcms show a substantial decrease of precipitation over the entire watershed while the smhi rca model projects a slight increase of rainfall the sharpest decline in water flow was observed at gourbassi under 2 c warming kidira station shows a similar trend with smaller amplitudes in the simulated flows with the input data of the smhi rca model we noted a general trend towards an increase in flows at the level of the kidira and gourbassi sub basins the results show that the water resources of the faleme watershed could be affected by climate change this is why it is important to develop strategies to adapt to climate change by taking into account the increase in temperature and evapotranspiration and the decrease in precipitation and streamflow to reduce the vulnerability of the riparian populations and resources in the basin to climate change it is recommended to share the climate information from research to stakeholders and decision makers set up techniques for collecting storing and conserving rainwater and promote water saving by raising public awareness optimizing irrigation by efficient management and techniques using less water e g drip irrigation promote integrated water resources management strengthen and intensify training on vulnerability assessments and adaptation measures in the water resources sector provide university and research institutions with technical and financial means to intensify research in the field of modeling of hydro meteorological processes and their impacts it should be noted that the results obtained at the end of this work have limitations and uncertainties related to the quality of observational data climate projections hydrological model etc from these results we plan to deepen this work with the use of other regional climate models and different methods for correcting climate output biases then the bias corrected climate simulations will be used as inputs of other hydrological models such as gr5j gr6j and swat to study the impact of climate change on water resources in addition it would be interesting also to study extreme hydro

8333,study region faleme river basin senegal mali and guinea study focus this study proposes an assessment of the impact of climate change on the hydrology of the faleme basin located in west africa the applied methodology consists in calibrating and validating the hydrological model gr4j before simulating the future evolution of flows in this catchment under of 1 5 and 2 c global warming observed rainfall potential evapotranspiration pet and river flows were used for calibration and validation of the gr4j model furthermore output of three regional climate models dmi hirham shim rca and bccr wrf were used as input to the gr4j hydrological model to simulate future flows new hydrological insights the results show good correspondence between the simulated flows and those observed during calibration and validation with nash sutcliffe efficiencies nse greater than 70 projections show a general increase in mean annual temperature and pet two models dmi hirham and bccr wrf project a decrease in mean annual rainfall while a third smhi rca projects a slight increase for future flows a downward trend in annual and monthly average flows is expected in the faleme basin with input from the dmi hirham bccr wrf models and the overall mean however the gr4j forced by the smhi rca model output projects increased flows thus we make recommendations to mitigate the likely impacts of climate change on socio economic activities that use water resources keywords faleme basin gr4j model climate change 1 introduction climate change is unequivocal ipcc 2007 and the resulting consequences are likely to increase in the coming decades worldwide the impacts of climate change on various sectors agriculture water resources health etc and ecosystems are the subject of particular attention and raise the concern of a growing proportion of the international scientific community and policy makers moreover the modification of the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation the increase of average temperatures the decrease of river flows or the increase in the frequency of extreme hydro meteorological events have negative consequences among these impacts those on water resources raise many concerns about the future availability of this vital resource in the world in africa and in the sahel particularly studies have addressed the issue of climate change impacts with strong uncertainties and divergences in models projections ali and amani 2010 the results of abiodun et al 2017 have shown that the agricultural systems could be negatively impacted by the changes in wet and dry periods moreover risks of catastrophic flooding events and crop water stress are projected to become more frequent déqué et al 2017 furthermore mbaye et al 2019 used output of regional climate models rcms over senegal to reveal an increase in dry spells and a decrease in the number of wet days in northern senegal the decrease in mean precipitation is accompanied by a projected increase in the annual number of dry days mbaye et al 2015a over the senegal river basin at the bakel outlet mbaye et al 2015b found probable decreases of streamflow and soil moisture hence additional research efforts are needed for a better understanding and documentation to guide adaptation policies and decision making in a context of climate change thus in the effort to limit global warming the international community reached an agreement on climate change at the 21st conference of the parties cop 21 held in paris in 2015 this agreement calls for maintaining the overall increase in global mean temperature below 2 c ideally below 1 5 c compared to pre industrial temperatures the faleme catchment west africa is also concerned by the impacts of global warming however there are a lack of studies carried out to determine the likely climate change impacts that will characterize the water resources in this basin the water resources of this basin are now under high pressure due to increased agricultural and mining activities with the construction project of a hydroelectric dam the watercourse will be under more pressure because a large amount of water will be mobilized for the production of hydroelectricity these activities will likely have great impact on the availability of water resources and on the river regimes in addition the potential impacts of climate change on water resources may exacerbate hydroclimate conditions in this context it becomes relevant to investigate to what extent and how the international global warming targets will affect the hydrology of the faleme assessing the impacts of climate change on water resources is one of the major challenges of the 21st century velázquez et al 2015 in order to put in place effective planning strategies it is absolutely necessary to study the impacts of climate change on the watershed it is in this context that this work aims to study the impacts of climate change on the water resources of the faleme watershed under 1 5 c and 2 c global warming levels gwls thus this study attempts to provide answers to the following scientific questions what will be the potential changes in precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration of the basin under gwls and how will the basin s streamflow be impacted to answer these questions output of regional climate models rcms will be bias corrected before its use as forcing input into the hydrological model gr4j perrin et al 2003 bias correction of climate model output has the advantage of improving the representation of observed hydrological variables such as discharge or groundwater recharge by model simulations wörner et al 2019 this paper is organized as following section 1 is dedicated to the introduction material and methods are given in section 2 results and discussion are presented in section 3 and finally we present conclusions in section 4 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the faleme catchment is situated between latitudes 12 11 14 27 n and longitudes 11 12 12 15 0 in western africa fig 1 the faleme is one of the main tributaries on the left bank of the senegal river its watershed covers an area of 28 900 km2 and is shared between three countries senegal mali and guinea it rises at an altitude of 800 m in an area of lateritic plateaus at the foot of the fouta djalon mountains and extends for about 625 km until it meets the senegal river the faleme covers three geographical and climatic domains guinean soudanian and sahelian according to faye and sow 2014 we used two stations for discharge gourbassi and kidira gourbassi is localized in the soudanian domain and kidira in the sahelian domain the guinean domain characterizes the upstream climate as we have a south north rainfall gradient with maximum in southern basin and minimum in northern basin the guinean domain is the wetter zone highest rainfall average follow by the soudanian intermediate rainfall average between the other climate zones and the sahelian lowest rainfall average respectively then the discharge at gourbassi is influenced by climatic conditions in the guinean and the soudanian zones and the discharge measured at the main outlet of the basin kidira which is more downstream is under the influence of the all climate domains of the basin this justifies that kidira has the highest values of river discharge than those at gourbassi upper precambrian rocks and paleozoic sedimentary rocks are the main geological formations of the basin the stations used in this study are represented in fig 1 the vegetation of the basin ranges from semi arid savannah in the north to sub humid forest in the south the water resources of this river which used to be under very little stress are now under very strong pressure due to withdrawals for mining gold mining and increased agricultural activities with the construction project of the hydroelectric dam at gourbassi the river will come under further pressure as a large amount of water will be mobilized for hydroelectric production also a gold mining company called sabodola gold operations sgo located in sabodola city has an authorization to build three water retention basins of 15 million cubic meters per year furthermore there is a project to exploit the iron of the faleme which could also negatively impact water resources this means that a decrease in the availability of water resources in the basin could be extremely problematic the long term of rainfall index 1901 2013 cru climate research unit datasets have shown noticeably two different contrast a relatively wet period during the seven first decades and more water deficit in the second period with high interannual variability as for potential evapotranspiration it showed an upward trend the mean river discharge at kidira show an upward tendency from 1980 to 2010 with strong interannual variability not shown here 2 2 data 2 2 1 observed data meteorological data are among the input variables necessary for hydrological modeling an accurate and consistent estimate of these variables is essential to obtain adequate hydrological simulation results roy 2011 the daily observed climatic data rainfall temperature evapotranspiration used to run the hydrological model were provided by the national agency of civil aviation and meteorology anacim of senegal for senegalese stations and by the national meteorological directions of guinea and mali for guinean and malian stations daily observed flows at gourbassi and kidira were obtained from the national directions in charge water flow management of mali and senegal respectively these daily data cover the period 1984 2005 hydrological observations have been conducted in the kidira station since 1930 and gourbassi station since 1954 but there are lot of missing data in the time series we used only the period 1984 2005 that match the period of the other observational data e g rainfall temperature the availability of daily meteorological variables was the main issue as we did not use the whole period since then beginning that s why we only gave the studied period in the paper the average precipitation and air temperature were obtained here by calculating the mean of all available stations we divided the sum of rainfall from all stations by the number of stations 2 2 2 simulated climate data to evaluate the effects of climate change on water resources in the faleme watershed we used output of three rcms within the coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex giorgi et al 2009 this is a wcrp world climate research program framework to evaluate regional climate model performance through a set of experiments aiming at producing regional climate projections one of its goals is to evaluate and improve regional climate downscaling models and techniques in order to better understand relevant regional local climate phenomena their variability and changes through downscaling https cordex org the simulations have a half degree spatial resolution 0 44 x0 44 the climate change scenarios are based on the warming targets of the paris agreements 1 5 c and 2 c these warming levels are obtained with regards to pre industrial levels sylla et al 2018 the choice of the three regional models rcms is motivated by the fact that they are widely and successfully used in climate change impact studies in west africa camara et al 2013 diallo et al 2012 sylla et al 2018 mbaye et al 2019 the three rcms bccr wrf bjerknes centre for climate research weather research and forecasting dmi hirham danish meteorological institute regional atmospheric climate model rcm based on a subset of the hirlam high resolution limited area model and smhi rca swedish meteorological and hydrological institute rossby centre regional atmospheric climate model were driven by ncc noresm1 m norwegian climate centre norwegian earth system model 1 medium resolution during the historical period 1976 2005 the 1 5 c warming period 2029 2058 and the 2 0 c warming period 2064 2093 the comparison between climate model output and observed data has shown that the models reproduce well the annual cycle of temperature fig s1 evapotranspiration fig s2 and precipitation fig s3 however the magnitudes are sometimes underestimated overestimated then the bias corrected climate data give better representation of the basin s climate as it was shown by mbaye et al 2015a 2 3 methods 2 3 1 estimation of mean precipitation and reference evapotranspiration the average precipitation was obtained here by calculating the mean of all available stations we divided the sum of rainfall from all stations by the number of stations furthermore we use geographical coordinates longitude latitude to extract each station from the climate model simulations before calculating their average as for the reference evapotranspiration we used hargreaves and samani 1985 reference evapotranspiration according to fao56 it is given by 1 e t 0 0 0023 t m e a n 17 8 t m a x t m i n 0 5 r a where et0 mm day 1 is the reference evapotranspiration ra the extraterrestrial radiation mjm 2 day 1 as a function of latitude and day of the year tmax the daily maximum temperature c and tmin the daily minimum temperature c 2 3 2 bias correction bias correction is a statistical technique widely used to correct climate simulations in climate change impact studies piani et al 2010 hagemann et al 2011 hempel et al 2013 mbaye et al 2015a etc in this study we use the cdf t cumulative distribution function transform developed by michelangeli et al 2009 to bias correct regional climate simulations cdf t is a statistical method based on quantile mapping qm that adjusts climate model simulations compared to observations this method considers the cdf change between historical and future climate simulations let fgh and fsh define the cdfs of a variable from the rcm subscript g and from a given reference location subscript s over a historical calibration period subscript h the transformation t allowing to go from fgh to fsh is given by 2 t f g h x f s h x replacing x with f 1 gh u where u is any probability in 0 1 we have x f g p 1 u 3 t u f s h f g h 1 u which provides a definition of t assuming t is stationary in time the transformation can be applied to fgf the cdf of the variable over a future or validation period f to generate fsf the cdf at the reference location for the same period f as follows 4 t f g f x f s f x that is 5 f s f x t f g f x f s f x f s h f g h 1 f g f x once fsf has been determined from eq 4 a qq quantile quantile approach is carried out between fgf and fsf to generate local time series famien et al 2018 the cdf t method generates quantile values through a qq performed between fgf and fsf values are then generated according to fsf in chronological agreement with future climate simulations 2 3 3 hydrological modeling in order to assess the impact of climate change on the hydrology of the basin we use the rainfall runoff hydrological model gr4j perrin et al 2003 this model operates at basin scale with daily time step the gr4j modelling approach is mainly empirical michel et al 2006 and consists of searching data for the most efficient model structures with the objective of getting a general efficient and robust model this model has been used widely in hydrological studies tegegne et al 2017 faty et al 2018 velázquez zapata 2019 kunnath poovakka and eldho 2019 etc compared with other hydrological models it has provided satisfactory results perrin 2000 perrin et al 2003 vaze et al 2011 etc the meteorological input data of the model are rainfall depth p and potential evapotranspiration e the output of this model is river flow all water quantities input output internal variables are expressed daily in mm by dividing water volumes by catchment area when necessary the scheme of the model is given in fig 2 details on the functioning of the model at each time step are given in the supplementary materials as described in perrin et al 2003 the meaning of each model s variable and parameter is given as following e average potential evapotranspiration p average rainfall en net evapotranspiration capacity pn net rainfall es actual evaporation ps amount of net rainfall that goes directly to the production store pn ps amount of net

production soil store mm x2 water exchange coefficient mm x3 capacity of the routing store mm x4 time parameter days for unit hydrographs 2 3 3 1 calibration and validation of the g4j the period 1984 2005 was divided into two periods for calibration and validation of the g4j we did two calibrations and two validations by changing each period first period last period and last period first period in order to get the best criteria in calibration and validation hence the model was finally calibrated under the period 1996 2005 and validated under the period 1985 1995 we took one year as warm up spin up period as done by zhang et al 2015 in order to avoid the influence of initial conditions in the water storages here we use automatic calibration that is based on changing by iteration the values of the parameters x1 x2 x3 and x4 in a regular interval until we get the optimal values of the performance criteria 2 3 3 2 model performance criteria in order to evaluate the performance of the gr4j model we use the following criteria nash sutcliffe efficiency 1970 which is commonly used to assess the goodness fit in hydrological models 6 n s e 1 j 1 n q o j q s j 2 j 1 n q o j q o 2 where q o j denotes the observed discharge at the day j q s j is the simulated one and q o is the averaged observed streamflow nse ranges from to 1 0 with high values indicating better agreement nse 1 indicates a perfect match of simulated and observed data nse 0 corresponds to the model predictions matching the mean of the measured data and nse 0shows that the measured mean is a better predictor than the model legates and mccabe 1999 table 1 gives the range of the performance values of nse according to bouizrou 2015 the two major outlets gourbassi and kidira of the basin were considered in the hydrological modeling 3 results and discussion 3 1 observed and simulated hydrographs during calibration and validation fig 3 presents the simulated red color and observed blue color daily hydrographs of the faleme watershed at gourbassi and kidira during the calibration period 1996 2005 the shape of the simulated hydrographs compared to that of the observed hydrographs is well reproduced in both stations however peak flows during the years 2001 and 2002 were underestimated at kidira and gourbassi low flows simulated and observed were found in years 2001 2002 and 2003 the peak flows at kidira up to 1500 m3 s are higher than those at gourbassi up to 1000 m3 s this is due to the fact that kidira is the main outlet which controls all the waters drained by the watershed as for validation fig 4 the signals of observed and simulated hydrographs are similar in other words there is a good correspondence between both datasets in the two sub watersheds gourbassi and kidira the simulated peak flows are well located in time but are often underestimated particularly in 1989 1990 and 1993 the underestimation of the flows simulated by the gr4j model is more marked in gourbassi than in kidira it should be noted that the values of the simulated flows during the calibration period are always greater than those of the simulated flows during the validation period this be can due to higher dynamics of the basin during the calibration period 1996 2005 which is dominated by wet years even though there are some dry years this period covers the end of severe drought periods before year 2000 and a relatively normal to wet conditions after year 2000 in the sahel it was also noted a higher interannual variability of precipitation and increased human activities that impact the basin s hydrology during this period as for the validation period 1985 1995 there are also wet and dry years even though the general trend is dry conditions this combined with lower basin s dynamics lead to relatively lower values of nse due to the normalized variance of the observed discharge data in the nse formula during the validation period krause et al 2005 furthermore during validation the simulation is better at gourbassi than at kidira this is probably due to the smaller size of the gourbassi sub basin which is more homogenous than the kidira sub basin the larger the basin the greater the complexity to handle adequately the hydrological processes other factors such as soil type vegetation topography that are not taken into account in the modeling scheme can justify mismatches the fact that the low flows were not successfully simulated by the gr4j is in line with the work of bodian et al 2016 the limited length of the time series of observed data which did not include all types of particular hydrometeorological events during both the calibration and validation periods may explain some mismatches between simulations and observations montecelos zamora et al 2018 the discrepancies between the calculated and observed runoff may be explained by the fact that the variation of some important factors such as soil type vegetation topography human activities etc that play a key role in the process of runoff are not taken into account by the model furthermore the change of direction of the aquifer river transfer during the year could be responsible of that then this complex behavior and the time invariance of model parameters may be the origin of the overestimation of streamflow during low flows season moreover low values of the capacity of the soil store production and the capacity of the routing store during the dry season may lead to a stronger response to the rainfall inputs and to a more rapid hydrological response zeng et al 2019 the limited number of rainfall stations and their spatial distribution over the basin affect also the simulations results the underestimation of peak flow can be explained also by the fact that the flood peaks are difficult to reproduce in magnitude due to their sudden appearance faye and sow 2014 3 2 model performance assessment table 2 summarizes model performance based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency during calibration and validation both values found during calibration are greater than or equal to 0 7 this shows the goodness of simulations however in the validation period values were 0 58 and 0 62 at kidira and gourbassi respectively these latter values are below 0 7 though still within the range of satisfactory values according to table 1 the highest nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was obtained during calibration in both stations the degradation of the nash criterion between calibration and validation is probably linked to the humidity and the inhomogeneity of two periods the distribution of atmospheric precipitation air temperature and years with extreme low and high precipitation over the basin affect considerably the average precipitation this basin is within the senegal river basin which is subject to a large south north precipitation gradient ranging from more than 1800 mm year 1 in the south to 200 mm year 1 in the north stisen et al 2008 the air temperature follows a zonal pattern with maximum values in the north and minimum values in the south mbaye et al 2015b the average precipitation over the basin and the downstream streamflow are considerably affected by the relative humid conditions in the south mbaye et al 2018a have shown that low rainfall intensity and low high rainfall events contribute to a drying of the basin during extreme wet years with increase of the frequency of heavy rainfall more water will be available for runoff generation the increase of extreme heavy rainfall events is known to cause flood because of large amount of water in short time in addition the global increase in warm nights and warm days could lead to an increase of water losses through evaporation that reduce soil water content mbaye et al 2018b years with extreme low precipitation combined with higher evapotranspiration rate would cause hydrological drought conditions with evidence of low water supplies mbaye et al 2019 the evaluation of the gr4j simulations during calibration and validation shows generally satisfactory results even though in some years the magnitudes of streamflow are not well captured this could be due to the shortcomings of the hydrological model to handle adequately some hydrological processes in addition the quality of the observed meteorological data and the fact that anthropogenic activity is not taken into account could affect the hydrological simulations once this evaluation process is performed during the historical period it is important to investigate the basin s hydroclimate in the future under climate change scenarios 3 3 potential changes of the basin hydroclimate 3 3 1 seasonal cycle of rainfall temperature and evapotranspiration these results are obtained by the average of all stations over the basin we compare the 1 5 c warming period 2029 2058 and the 2 0 c warming period 2064 2093 to the historical period 1976 2005 of the rcms data the seasonal cycle of rainfall fig 5 shows a decrease during the main rainy season under both warming levels the hirham model depicts the highest decrease however precipitation is likely to increase with smhi rca this difference in the climate change signal between climate models can be explained by the differences in physical parametrizations especially convection schemes as for temperature fig 6 and potential evapotranspiration fig 7 a general increase is projected in all models and scenarios the signal of temperature is similar to that of evapotranspiration this increase can be mainly attributed to increased greenhouse gases 3 3 2 evolution of river discharge the variation of river discharge from historical to future gwls is represented as boxplots in fig 8 streamflow is likely to decrease in both stations and scenarios with wrf and hirham but not with the rca regional climate model this decrease is due to the decrease of rainfall and the increase of potential evapotranspiration the analysis of the median values of the boxplots of the two drying models shows that during the historical period the median value obtained is much higher than the median values under the two warmings levels the median value obtained with 1 5 c warming is greater than that obtained with 2 c warming in contrast the smhi rca model projects an increase in streamflow under 1 5 c warming with a median value higher than that of the historical however this same model smhi rca predicts the same trend as the other two under 2 c warming this downward trend is more significant with the 2 c warming in gourbassi than in kidira these results indicate that the availability of surface water resources in the faleme watershed might decrease in the coming decades due to its higher decrease in precipitation the gourbassi sub basin seems to be the most vulnerable to climate change the flow changes are influenced by climate factors and other factors related to land use cover changes and anthropogenic activities and hydraulic infrastructures as we used a rainfall runoff model climate factors are the main drivers of the river flow changes the main climate factors are precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration then the decrease of precipitation combined with the increase of temperature and evapotranspiration lead to less water availability for runoff moreover high the evapotranspiration is less is soil moisture that facilitate runoff the increase of global warming enhances the water holding capacity of the atmosphere and therefore increases the loss of surface water and soil water through evapotranspiration process mbaye et al 2019 this impact the basin s flow 3 3 3 mean river discharge changes the projected flow changes by the hydrological model gr4j obtained by feeding the outputs of the regional climatic models fig 9 show a decrease in flows which can go beyond 40 all input data from rcms and their ensemble mean project a decrease in river flows over the entire basin which is more marked in gourbassi than in kidira except for results obtained with the smhi rca model which exhibits an increase up to 20 these results are in line with the monthly changes of river discharge figs 10 and 11 the drop in flow rate is more pronounced during the season of high flows july to october at both gauging stations during the dry season there is no substantial flow changes then the annual flow changes are almost the consequences of the seasonal changes during the rainy season this is the fact that precipitation is the dominant factor in rainfall runoff model the decrease of water flow is likely to be more significant under 2 0 c warming scenario the decline of streamflow could reach 200 m3s 1 by mid and end of 21st century a decrease in river discharge was also underlined by bodian et al 2018 over the gambia and the upper senegal basins the changes obtained under 2 0 c are more pronounced than the changes under 1 5 c this means that more warming will lead to greater water decline therefore limiting global warming under the ideal warming level target of the paris agreement 1 5 c will reduce considerably the consequences on water resources these results are similar to those of nangombe et al 2019 who stated that limiting global warming to 1 5 c instead of the previously suggested 2 c could indeed translate into substantial benefits of reducing the intensity and frequency of extreme heat events across africa the differences in the climate change impacts and signals are related to the driving gcm the rcm and the hydrological model arheimer and lindström 2015 the most considerable changes of the basin hydroclimate are those of temperature and potential evapotranspiration in addition to the effect of global warming other factors such as atmospheric humidity surface soil moisture the length of the vegetation period net radiation and the wind characteristics have substantial impacts on the changes of evapotranspiration olsson et al 2016 which in turn impact runoff 4 conclusions in this study we calibrate and validate the gr4j hydrological model with observational datasets and then assess the potential impact of global warming levels targets on the hydrology of the faleme catchment for the calibration and validation procedures the values of the statistical evaluation criteria were satisfactory and show the performance and robustness of the rainfall runoff model with regards to the simulated and observed hydrographs the hydrological regimes of the basin were fairly well reproduced by the hydrological model the simulated discharge at kidira is higher than the river flow at gourbassi however it has to be noted that in some years the hydrological model did not capture well the magnitude of streamflow in both stations as for future projections of the basin s hydroclimate all models predict a general rise in temperatures and potential evapotranspiration by mid and end of the 21st century under the two global warming levels considered here 1 5 c and 2 c two rcms dmi hirham and bccr wrf and the overall average of all three rcms show a substantial decrease of precipitation over the entire watershed while the smhi rca model projects a slight increase of rainfall the sharpest decline in water flow was observed at gourbassi under 2 c warming kidira station shows a similar trend with smaller amplitudes in the simulated flows with the input data of the smhi rca model we noted a general trend towards an increase in flows at the level of the kidira and gourbassi sub basins the results show that the water resources of the faleme watershed could be affected by climate change this is why it is important to develop strategies to adapt to climate change by taking into account the increase in temperature and evapotranspiration and the decrease in precipitation and streamflow to reduce the vulnerability of the riparian populations and resources in the basin to climate change it is recommended to share the climate information from research to stakeholders and decision makers set up techniques for collecting storing and conserving rainwater and promote water saving by raising public awareness optimizing irrigation by efficient management and techniques using less water e g drip irrigation promote integrated water resources management strengthen and intensify training on vulnerability assessments and adaptation measures in the water resources sector provide university and research institutions with technical and financial means to intensify research in the field of modeling of hydro meteorological processes and their impacts it should be noted that the results obtained at the end of this work have limitations and uncertainties related to the quality of observational data climate projections hydrological model etc from these results we plan to deepen this work with the use of other regional climate models and different methods for correcting climate output biases then the bias corrected climate simulations will be used as inputs of other hydrological models such as gr5j gr6j and swat to study the impact of climate change on water resources in addition it would be interesting also to study extreme hydro meteorological events over this basin funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors credit authorship contribution

8334,study region inadequate public participation has already been reported in the sustainable water resources management at langat river basin malaysia primarily due to weak enforcement of policies along with public apathy study focus a questionnaire survey was conducted among 402 random households in the study area in 2017 to assess people s attitudes perceptions and behaviour through partial least squares structural equation modelling pls sem in order to predict their willingness to participate in water resources management although there are a few studies on public participation in water management globally this study is the pioneer in predicting public participation in water management with moderate predictive power based on a pls sem model new hydrological insights for the region the model showed significant positive mediating effects of public s attitudes towards and perceptions of river and drinking water aprdw as well as positive moderating effects of their perceived water quality pwq to enhance their willingness to participate in water management at a 99 confidence interval however people s awareness about river and drinking water ardw and the value of river and drinking water vrdw showed no significant mediating and moderating effects respectively to increase their participation in a water management platform therefore environmental education along with information concerning water management programmes should be well disseminated to people via awareness raising and capacity building activities by relevant authorities to increase their willingness to participate in sustainable water resources management in langat river basin malaysia keywords malaysia langat river basin attitude public participation water management pls sem model 1 introduction public participation or community participation in integrated water resources management programmes are always challenged by the public s poor level of knowledge by their reluctance to participate as well as by the lack of an organised platform rault et al 2013 several studies however have reported potential willingness on the part of the public to participate in water management especially in the higher water stress countries bjerregaard 1998 carr et al 2012 de marchi 2003 rault et al 2013 also reported active potential participation of the public even in the limited number of democratic countries through expressing and exchanging views and opinions of their surroundings instead of communicating through any media therefore people would have sufficient knowledge of water management problems both at the institutional and household levels in malaysia the academy of sciences malaysia asm has already produced the national integrated water resources management plan 2016 in line with the 11th malaysia plan 2016 2020 integrated water resources management iwrm integrated river basin management irbm integrated lake basin management ilbm and others moreover there is the malaysia industry government group for high technology might to establish the public private partnerships for sustainable development including the management of water resources all these approaches including the approach of sustainable development solutions network sdsn are trying to involve civil society and local authorities in sustainable water resources management to achieve the sdgs sustainable development goals especially sdg target 6 1 concerning water resources management for safe drinking water for all and sdg target 17 17 whose goal is to strengthen public private academia ngo and civil society partnerships hence this study explored people s perceptions attitudes and behaviour towards river and drinking water management at langat river basin malaysia fig 1 for sustainable water resources management several studies have claimed that people s attitudes towards and perceptions of water resources are reflected in the government s water resources management programme as people s intentions are the necessary ingredients for political will and action burstein 2010 stoutenborough and vedlitz 2013 therefore when there is a reflection of people s perceptions and attitudes in the relevant water management programmes then there will be a healthy positive relationship between people s perceptions and attitudes as well as their willingness to be engaged in water resources management lai et al 2017 reported that educating people is very important and essential to reduce the non revenue water nrw tariff on water resources management in malaysia although the government is looking for the nrw tariff education can make people aware of engaging in water resources management and can also promote their interests to reduce the nrw tariff accordingly prediction and control approaches were used as an instrument to manage water resources for a quite long time especially the management dominated by engineering solutions such as supply water management through pipeline distribution however pollution control should address both the point and non point sources of pollution including the land use changes specially for rapid development activities pahl wostl et al 2008 therefore sustainable and integrated water resources management require societal search and learning processes for the inclusion of both infrastructural and non infrastructural measures pahl wostl 2002 in malaysia including the langat river basin the shortcomings in sustainable water resources management are reported mainly because of inadequate enforcement of laws lack of public participation along with an inadequate emphasis on non structural measures chan 2009 2012 mokhtar et al 2010 2011 moreover the transboundary pollution of the langat river mainly from the sewerage and industrial discharges agricultural runoff and such has been reported by several studies even though the river is one of the prime sources of drinking water in the selangor state malaysia ahmed et al 2016a 2016b 2018a 2018b 2019 alam et al 2015 therefore public engagement with the government non government academia and business sectors could be effective in water resources management chan 2012 mokhtar et al 2011 although there are a few studies in malaysia concerning public perceptions and involvement in integrated water resources management based on the statistical analysis ab razak et al 2015 afroz et al 2016 lai et al 2017 this study is the first significant one that has assessed people s perceptions with respect to their willingness to participate in integrated water resources management based on partial least squares structural equation modelling pls sem in this study public participation refers to participation at the local level for multi stakeholder platforms these small public participatory platforms ppps are led by community leaders and tare linked to their respective local authorities hence the ppps perform very important roles for water management via local authorities who have the mandate of water resources management water resources management refers here to natural water and the drinking water supply including wastewater treatment therefore this study based on pls sem modelling provides comprehensive and accurate indicators to enhance people s participation in water resources management through suggesting effective multi stakeholder platforms led by local authorities for the effective implementation of policies hence this study explored people s behavioural intentions in the langat river basin malaysia to estimate their willingness to participate in water resources management following the psychological theory of planned behaviour ajzen 1985 2 literature review and hypothesis development 2 1 literature review the theory of planned behaviour ajzen 1985 is well accepted in psychology to explain human s behavioural intentions following this theory the human intention to perform specific activities can be categorised into three broad factors i e humans attitudes their subjective norms and perceived behaviour control therefore several studies have reported that the public s participation in water management highly depends on their perceptions attitudes and beliefs along with their demographic characteristics table 1 a recent study on water resources management has focused sharply on the ethical perspective of human beings in managing water resources the ethical perspective of water management is based on the principles of human dignity and human equality which are beyond traditional and socio environmental water governance analysing the impact of these principles has also highlighted the importance of an ethical perspective in dealing with water issues in order to improve the living conditions of informal settlements in south africa robina ramírez and sañudo fontaneda 2018 similarly malaysians are not satisfied with the water quality regarding taste as well as with the sometimes suspended solids chlorine content odour and colour of the tap water khattab and wahid 2015 however many people in malaysia believe that their tap water does not comply with the drinking water quality standard proposed by the world health organisation who accordingly many of them perceive that pipe water is not safe for drinking and it is associated with risks to their health ab razak et al 2015 therefore many of these people are willing to purchase the bottled water from the market although the quality of bottled water also needs to be examined for quality hence the local people in malaysia think that the government should not increase their water tariff at this current level of quality for their water services however the government is asking people to be willing to pay for water resources management on the other hand gender and monthly household income as part of the demographic factor also play essential roles in enhancing people s willingness to pay for bottled water khattab and wahid 2015 water resources management through the strong regulations of the government is essential to harmonise interactions between the biodiversity and society along with their complex functioning systems however it is the water users upon which the government s water regulations are imposed for the harmonisation with nature therefore many experts have suggested that the government should not only depend on external motivation factors e g awareness raising activities to influence individuals to comply with water regulations but it also should emphasise internal motivation factors e g trust to comply with the laws internal motivation may be useful to individuals if the government can bring rewards and punishments effectively at the ground level for water management armitage et al 2009 berkes 2009 hamm et al 2013 therefore building the trust of the people concerning water resources management is very crucial for being successful in implementing the laws although the trust of people has become very important in water resources management among the trust related constructs used in pls studies institutional trust process fairness and dispositional trust are the most common similarly qualitative studies have also identified that these three trust related constructs are very important for natural resources management davenport et al 2007 leahy and anderson 2008 however some researchers have argued that the influence of these trust related constructs also depends on the situation cvetkovich and nakayachi 2007 earle and siegrist 2008 meanwhile researchers have argued that public trust leads to relationship commitment between institutes and individuals morgan and hunt 1994 similarly commitment especially in customer behaviour studies is highly desired and expected for valued relationships among individuals moorman et al 1992 where there is a commitment there is a higher level of responsibility both on the part of the owner and customers to make the relationship successful with respect to satisfaction and benefits jin et al 2010 morgan and hunt 1994 both commitment and trust can be seen as positive consequences of customer value and positively affect behavioural and attitudinal intent johnson et al 2006 yoon 2002 therefore self control and usefulness are important antecedents of customer value delivery for instance perceptions of online bank reputations were enhanced by the satisfaction derived from real customer encounters with online banking services loureiro et al 2014 scientists and practitioners have often identified human perceptions as primary determinants of the success and failure of environmental plans mascia et al 2003 hence most perceived weaknesses of water resources management are related to the lack of enforcement or human resource constraints in africa buschke and esterhuyse 2012 therefore several studies have suggested the inclusion of soft skills in research i e the incorporation of government non government and civil sectors along with the local population in interdisciplinary collaborative water resources management buschke and esterhuyse 2012 dess 1987 therefore the theory of planned behaviour has been adapted to define people s perceptions attitudes and beliefs for their behavioural intentions in this case their willingness to participate in water resources management as well as to develop the hypotheses hypotheses are developed to increase people s participation in water resources management via assessing their attitudes perceptions and beliefs towards water resources management programmes it is assumed based on the theory of planned behaviour that people s perceptions and attitudes about river and drinking water aprdw awareness of river and drinking water ardw perceived health risk phr and their trust in institutes and policymakers tipm have positive influences on increasing their willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm via the water resources management programme similarly people s perceived water quality pwq knowledge their residence places rp and their value of river and drinking water vrdw also strengthen their participation in water resources management wtpwrm 2 2 hypothesis development 2 2 1 perception and attitude public perceptions of water quality are crucial to taking action to support public policies and projects designed to improve the quality of water hu 2011 however evaluation of participatory programmes and projects is necessary to assess whether these public policies and projects designs are achieved as well as to identify how participatory programmes and projects can be improved carr et al 2012 hence this study chose the construct public s attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme apwrmp as the mediator between their willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm and other independent constructs on people s attitudes and behaviour therefore the following hypothesis has been developed h1 people s attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme have a direct relationship with their willingness to participate in water resources management public participation in water resources management can be highly recommended as a tool for educating people as well as for changing their behavioural intention page and bakker 2005 hence public participation in water resources management is considered a vital tool to involve local people in the different levels of national and international water governance page and bakker 2005 therefore this study uses the construct people s attitudes towards and perceptions of river and drinking water aprdw to assess their participation in a water resources management programme apwrmp in order to develop the following hypothesis the common people are supportive of the government s projects regarding water resources management unless or until the projects have negative impacts on their surrounding environment stoutenborough and vedlitz 2013 h2 people s attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme mediate the relationship between their attitudes towards and perceptions of river and drinking water and their willingness to participate in water resources management the public is more concerned about water quality along with the county decision makers for instance citizens of illinois are knowledgeable about their water supplies and they want to see their water supplies protected miller et al 2003 hence this study uses the construct public s awareness about river and drinking water ardw to estimate their participation in a water resources management programme apwrmp through the following hypothesis h3 people s attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme mediates the relationship between their awareness of river and drinking water and their willingness to participate in water resources management safe drinking water leads to a higher quality living standard fawell and nieuwenhuijsen 2003 so water management has received maximum attention considering its importance in changing climatic conditions for social stability therefore this study has adopted the construct perceived health risk phr of people to examine their attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme apwrmp h4 people s attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme mediate the relationship between their perceived health risk and their willingness to participate in water resources management meanwhile several studies have already used surveys to collect information on the public s perceived behaviour concerning water noga and wolbring 2013 robina ramírez and sañudo fontaneda 2018 sun et al 2019 regarding water quality many studies have found that the concerns about pollution in water are increasing particularly in drinking water miller et al 2003 hu et al 2011 khattab and wahid 2015 hence the construct perceived water quality pwq has been used for this study to explore its influence on the public s willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm via the following hypothesis h5 people s perception of water quality strengthens the relationship between their attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme and their willingness to participate in water resources management 2 2 2 subjective norms knowledge attitudes and practices kap are necessary elements in drinking water studies in malaysia ab razak et al 2015 there are also a few studies regarding perceived water quality perceived health risk hygiene and diseases in developing countries concerning drinking water aini et al 2007 kioko and obiri 2012 onabolu et al 2011 mahmood et al 2011 these studies found that unprotected water sources inadequate knowledge poor household water treatment and handwashing practices were the sources of heavy metal contamination of drinking water in malaysia nigeria kenya and pakistan aini et al 2007 dupont et al 2014 kioko and obiri 2012 onabolu et al 2011 embedded moral and ethical values also influence people to care about the environment hua and marsuki 2014 therefore the value of river and drinking water vrdw has been used to find out its moderating effects on the public s willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm through the following hypothesis h6 people s value of river and drinking water positively moderates the relationship between their attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme and their willingness to participate in water resources management all the existing great religions on earth have highly praised the glory of nature therefore followers of religion have considered nature very sacred and that it will protect them many religious leaders have already pointed out the connection between environmental sustainability and the need to change our way of living which is closely linked with moral decisions chuvieco 2012 hence the conservation of nature needs to be harmonious with human activities from a religious perspective however the religious vision of environmental policy is still inferior due to the secular perspective of human beings people have a firm belief that clean water is a fundamental human right and their perceptions of clean water are apparent i e that it is a public resource therefore the management of water should be given extra priority thus people s beliefs and perceptions of water conservation are vital since the value of water goes beyond its monetary worth noga and wolbring 2013 2 2 3 perceived behaviour control people s dispositional trust is mediated by their trust in the institution with respect to their intention to comply with the rules and regulations hamm et al 2013 therefore large scale government projects are needed for water management however public support is often a prerequisite for the government at all levels to enact such projects thus this study explores people s trust in institutes and policymakers tipm to find out their views on water resources management programmes apwrmp through the following hypothesis a few recent studies have explored public attitudes preferences and risk assessments concerning water management in the united states explicitly considering the importance of trust in water management burstein 2010 stoutenborough and vedlitz 2013 h7 people s attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme mediate the relationship between their trust in institutes and policymakers and their willingness to participate in water resources management the public is universally apathetic and throws light on current deterrents to participation in the local government s programmes lowndes et al 2001 for instance urban and rural farm residents in the united states have different perceptions of their water quality and they tend to differ in their views on significant water pollutants hu 2011 similarly significant differences were observed in malaysia and other countries of the world between the effects of residents perceptions and community participation on support for tourism development in urban and rural destinations cui and ryan 2011 liu 2006 rasoolimanesh et al 2017 accordingly poor water management due to public apathy along with inadequate enforcement of laws and regulations have already been reported in malaysia chan 2012 moreover city dwellers usually cannot see the sources of their drinking water which might differ from people in living rural areas or living near a river or lake therefore people living in rural areas are more concerned about water pollution and they are willing to participate in water resources management hence this study chose the construct people s residence place rp which acts as a perceived behaviour control to assess their willingness to participate in water resources management through developing the following hypothesis h8 people s residence place moderates the relationship between their attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme and their willingness to participate in water resources management socio demographic variables such as education levels and age have a significant effect on the public s perceptions as does their attitudes towards green activities and their satisfaction levels in malaysia and around the world afroz et al 2016 ponrahono et al 2016 rezai et al 2013 sheikh et al 2014 therefore the public s perceived behaviour or their subjective norms are critical determinants of their behavioural intentions as well as their willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm 2 3 significance of pls sem model partial least squares structural equation modelling pls sem has been widely used to estimate the significant relationships between environmental social and economic variables however there are not many studies on water resources management based on pls sem table 1 robina ramírez and sañudo fontaneda 2018 used several variables human water principles dignity and equality for the improvement of water services in south africa carlander et al 2016 studied that the perceived need for change had indirect effects on the social norms with respect to the willingness of people to comply with issues of water management in sweden therefore public participation is essential not only for urban water services but also for the rural water services globally because people s participation is positively influenced by their demographic characteristics especially their places of residence although in malaysia there has so far been no study on water resources management specifically drinking water based on pls sem lai et al 2017 have however highlighted inadequate public participation in the non revenue water nrw management based on a descriptive chi square test table 1 as with the global scenario demographic factors also significantly influence people s risk perception of drinking water quality in malaysia therefore it is reported that the respective agencies are key to improving the management of drinking water quality in malaysia effective multi stakeholder platforms are required for better management of water resources including drinking water however strengthening the capacity of multi stakeholder platforms largely depends on the proactive leadership roles of relevant agencies effective multi stakeholder platforms can incorporate civil society along with the government non government and business sector better for water resources management unfortunately the indicators to enhance people s participation in water resources management have not been statistically predicted which this robust pls sem model can significantly predict for sustainable water resources management pls sem is very useful to link the correlations between environmental and socio economic factors fernandes et al 2019 maziriri and madinga 2018 rodrigues et al 2019 sun et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 the partial least squares pls method was first used by wold 1980 to develop a casual path model between dependent and independent variables therefore the prediction model based on the pls sem is widely acceptable because of its advantage to interpret the data better than the other statistical model and to account for measurement errors hair et al 2017 lauzon gauthier et al 2018 lu et al 2015 wen and li 2019 yudatama et al 2019 compared with cb sem pls sem does not require a higher measuring range of samples and residual distributions because it is a soft modelling method tenenhaus et al 2005 pls sem can deal with a small sample size along with non normal distribution of data and it is based on regression and utilises a component centred way to depict the directed dependencies among a series of variables hair et al 2012 pls can be used to investigate theoretical models of greater complexity and scope willaby et al 2015 the partial least square model is free from multi collinearity problems and the model fits r² are high which is suitable to predict improved management techniques oliveira et al 2019 for instance fernandes et al 2019 reported that poor ecological status in the streams of portugal is a direct consequence of water contamination and it requires proper implementation and monitoring of existing watershed management plans based on pls modelling the pls sem model also can provide theoretical support to the government for the proper implementation of policies and guidelines wen and li 2019 which is also applicable to water resources management 2 4 model development the model was developed based on people s attitudes and perceptions to stimulate their behavioural intention in the classical persuasion model of psychology the theory of planned behaviour ajzen 1985 explained that people s beliefs attitudes and their perceived behavioural control have an important relationship with their behavioural intention in psychology an attitude refers to a set of emotions beliefs and behaviours toward a particular object person thing or event attitudes are often the result of experience or upbringing and they can have a powerful influence on behaviour chaiklin 2011 cherry 2017 hogg and vaughan 2005 therefore human attitude in this study under the theory of planned behaviour defines that attitudes towards and perceptions of river and drinking water aprdw as well as their awareness of river and drinking water ardw have a significant influence of their engagement in water resources management similarly the public s perceived water quality pwq and perceived health risk phr also influences their willingness to participate in water management a broad definition of perceived or subjective norm under the theory of planned behaviour is the perceived social pressure to perform or not to perform the particular behaviour ajzen 1991 in this model value of river and drinking water vrdw acts as the perceived social pressure to be involved in water resources management accordingly the concept of perceived behavioural control under the theory of planned behaviour defines the state of an individual s perception of the ease or difficulty of performing a particular behaviour ajzen 1985 1991 in this study people s trust in institutes and policymakers tipm and their residence place rp acts as the perceived behavioural control to influence their attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme as well as their willingness to participate in water resources management therefore the theory of planned behaviour has been used to prepare the model of people s willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm including several mediation and moderation factors the model analysed people s perceptions and attitudes towards river and drinking water as well as a water management programme to increase their participation in water resources management at langat river basin malaysia hence the model incorporated nine latent variables based on the hypothesis apwrmp wtpwrm aprdw phr tipm ardw pwq rp and vrdw fig 2 3 materials and methods 3 1 questionnaire development informal interviews with the public private and civil sectors were conducted to develop the household questionnaire especially the latent variables or constructs along with the extensive literature review the items or statements of each construct were adapted from the previous study for this exploratory research through the partial least squares structural equation modelling pls sem a preliminary household questionnaire survey was also conducted in the langat river basin malaysia to validate the questionnaire 3 2 sample size the total number of households in the langat river basin malaysia is 1 028 003 dos 2013 therefore 402 random households in the basin completed a questionnaire survey using eq 1 ahmed et al 2019 yamane 1967 from the following districts at langat river basin table 2 with the help of enumerators a total of 450 questionnaires were distributed for the survey to get the required number of the household questionnaire survey to run the statistical structural equation model for measuring people s willingness to participate in water management the enumerators visited the minimum odd number of households randomly in the specific area of each district table 2 to conduct the household questionnaire survey the household questionnaire survey form has been included with this manuscript as supplementary material appendix a accordingly the collected number of household questionnaire samples fulfilled the 10 times rule assumption to run the structural equation model sem through smartpls3 at 80 statistical power and 1 significance level since there are nine latent variables hair et al 2017 to obtain higher overall scores for the constructs each item is scored from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree 1 n n 1 n e 2 where n sample size n population size e level of precision i e 0 05 at 95 confidence level the household questionnaire survey was administered at the langat river basin malaysia from september 2016 to january 2017 local enumerators were hired to assist the author for secure communication with the residents to complete the household survey in a timely fashion 3 3 data analysis tools the study employs structural equation modelling sem to predict and estimate the hypothesis as well as the conceptualised research model which is widely accepted and an approach used in predicting human behaviour and customer psychology chin 1998 hair et al 2017 robina ramírez and sañudo fontaneda 2018 the main advantage of the sem approach is that it accounts for measurement error hair et al 2017 however among available sem estimating approaches partial least square structural equation modelling pls sem is suitable for this study because it allows non normality of data distribution which is quite expected in human psychological studies in addition pls sem is widely used by researchers in predicting models and in conducting confirmatory research son and benbasat 2007 moreover the previous studies relating to water management and human behaviour have used a pls sem approach chin and newsted 1999 ramírez et al 2016 robina ramírez and sañudo fontaneda 2018 wells et al 2016 therefore this study uses a pls sem approach to predict the conceptualised model and hypothesis 4 results and discussions 4 1 demographic characteristics people are well educated in the langat river basin malaysia since 44 of respondents were found to have obtained a degree table 3 followed by 19 70 with a diploma therefore in the model related to willingness to participate in water management the level of education of the respondents showed a significant direct influence t 2 724 p 0 007 on their willingness to participate in water resources management at a 99 confidence interval table 7 4 2 results of the measurement model the measurement model determines the reliability of the indicators used for measuring each latent variable or construct all the loads λ of the item or indicator appendix b used for the measurement model were acceptable since all the values were higher than the minimum acceptable value of 0 4 to obtain the acceptance value of each indicator a preliminary household questionnaire survey was also conducted in the study area along with the informal interviews of the public private and civil sectors for the questions to be established in the questionnaire therefore each construct was set with the reflective indicators this means that they reflect the reality of each latent variable or construct since all values exceeded this minimum load indicators adequately reflect each construct this means that indicators were defined appropriately by the household representative interviewee and the author therefore these indicators measured the reality of the latent variables to predict the people s willingness to participate in water resources management at the langat river basin i hence this study measured the relationships between each indicator and the construct wtpwrm apwrmp phr tipm ardw pwq rp and vrdw through the construct reliability thus the measured cronbach s alpha i e 0 7 table 4 indicates consistency among the indicators and the constructs used for this study although the constructs perceived health risk phr and residence place rp observed lower cronbach s alpha values these constructs are accepted since the composite reliability cr and average variance extracted ave values are accepted similarly the cr values are found to be 0 7 table 4 in this study and this indicates that the ave is explained by the indicators rather than the errors robina ramírez and sañudo fontaneda 2018 for instance if an ave is 0 50 then it means more than 50 of the variance of a construct is explained by the indicators hair et al 2017 although the ave of residence place rp is 0 409 table 4 the reported cr for the construct is well accepted since the value is 0 7 therefore the convergent validity of all the constructs was obtained all these statistics suggest that the indicators explained the constructs well since the convergent validity of all the constructs was achieved through significant statistical relationships among the indicators and constructs so the correlation among constructs was studied through the discriminant validity in this study people s willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm would be enhanced if wtpwrm was positively mediated by people s attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme apwrmp along with the attitudes towards and perceptions of river and drinking water aprdw perceived health risk phr trust in institutes and policymakers tipm and awareness about river and drinking water similarly people s participation in water management wtpwrm would also be enhanced if people s notions of perceived water quality pwq as well as their values of the river and drinking water vrdw along with their residence place rp positively moderated their participation in water management wtpwrm therefore positive relationships among the constructs are required to measure the relationship of the constructs hence in this study all the longitudinal values through the discriminant validity of the constructs are found to be higher than the relationships with other construct table 5 thus all the measured discriminant validity values of the constructs are accepted i e 0 85 hair et al 2017 and this indicates the correlations between the constructs of this study discriminant validity is also measured through the heterotrait monotrait ratio htmt and the defined htmt ratio must be less than 0 9 hair et al 2017 the latent variable or construct ratios less than 0 9 indicate that the constructs are different table 6 4 3 structural model analysis the structural model determined the strength of relationships among the latent constructs to predict people s willingness to participate in water resources management at langat river basin malaysia fig 3 therefore the structural mode analysed the standard path coefficients β to explain the variance of the latent variables the value ranging from 1 to 1 of the standard path coefficient is considered statistically significant hair et al 2017 while the value of β near 0 signifies weak relationships between the constructs in this study the hypotheses are fulfilled except for the mediating effect of h₃ as well as the moderating effect of h₆ and h₈ table 7 in the behavioural study there might be several opinions with respect to not fulfilling the hypotheses of people s awareness of river and drinking water ardw via people s attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme apwrmp to enhance their willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm in malaysia similarly people s residence place rp and their value of the river and drinking water vrdw also did not influence their participation in water management wtpwrm or their failure to fulfil the hypotheses it indicates that people need environmental education to change their mind set to enhance their awareness about water resources and their participation in water resources management moreover the fulfilled hypotheses are not done so with the same intensity there are compelling causal influences of attitudes and perceptions about water aprdw perceived health risk phr and trust in institutes and policymakers tipm concerning a water resources management programme apwrmp as well as apwrmp on participation in water management wtpwrm similarly perceived water quality pwq has strong causal influences on participation in water management wtpwrm therefore people s attitudes perceptions and behaviour towards water resources and a water resources management programme are highly valuable for influencing people s willingness to participate in water resources management in langat river basin malaysia therefore the goodness of fit of the structural model is determined from the t statistic of the latent constructs in this study the following t values are considered statistically significant in this study t 1 65 for a 90 confidence level t 1 96 for 95 and t 2 57 for 99 hair et al 2017 the t value obtained in this study table 7 has been used to explain the hypothesis for predicting participation in a water management wtpwrm model accordingly the effect size f² of the constructs was analysed to determine the statistical power of this confirmatory predictive model a small effect size f² 0 02 hair et al 2012 2017 was determined for all the mediating and moderating constructs in this study table 7 except the mediating construct attitude towards river and drinking water ardw and the moderating construct residence place rp that have an effect size less than 0 02 this small f² value might be because of the small sample number hogg and vaughan 2005 i e 402 households from a large population of around 1 028 003 households in the langat river basin malaysia from the eight hypotheses five hypotheses were fulfilled in this study h₁ was found to be significant at a 95 confidence interval while h₂ h₄ h₅ and h₇ were significant at a 99 level table 7 this reflects the strong influence of attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme apwrmp on participation in water management wtpwrm β 0 108 t 2 285 as well as the moderating effect of perceived water quality pwq on participation in water management wtpwrm β 0 218 t 4 313 the remaining mediating hypotheses of people s attitudes towards and perceptions aprdw of a water resources management programme apwrmp β 0 463 t 8 723 perceived health risk phr on apwrmp β 0 169 t 3 407 and trust in institutes and policymakers towards apwrmp β 0 174 t 2 675 also had a significant effect on enhancing people s willingness to participate in water resources management at the langat river basin although the moderating effects of residence place rp and value of river and drinking water vrdw have no significant effects on people s participation in water management wtpwrm at the basin both rp β 0 231 t 5 287 and vrdw β 0 116 t 5 287 have significant direct effects on enhancing people s wtpwrm similarly the control variables education β 0 121 t 2 724 and monthly income β 0 084 t 2 222 of the people were found significant in enhancing people s wtpwrm table 7 therefore all the correlations among the constructs in this study are highly accepted thus the objective of the study that the people s changing attitude toward and perception of water resources in the basin is very important to enhance their willingness to participate in water resources management the mediation analysis also found significant mediation of aprdw attitude towards and perception of river and drinking water apwrmp attitude towards and perception of water resources management programme wtpwrm willingness to participate in water resources management therefore apwrmp significantly mediates the positive relationship between aprdw and people s wtpwrm t 2 244 p 0 025 at a 95 confidence level table 8 similarly significant mediation of people s phr perceived health risk apwrmp attitude towards and perception of a water resources management programme wtpwrm willingness to participate in water resources management was observed t 1 738 p 0 083 at a 90 level although a water resources management programme acts as a mediator in the study no mediation effects were observed between tipm trust towards institutes and policymakers and people s willingness to participate in water management wtpwrm as well as ardw awareness about river and drinking water and people s wtpwrm it is assumed that people lack appropriate information about policy enforcement as well as a lack of environmental education however a strong direct effect t 2 285 p 0 023 has been determined between a water resources management programme apwrmp and people s participation in water management wtpwrm at a 95 level therefore the mediation and path coefficient analysis indicate that if people s perceptions of river and drinking water increases through effective education then there will be increased participation in managing the water resources thus the findings of the study followed the theory of planned behaviour ajzen 1985 in order to explain the relationship among beliefs attitudes and behavioral willingness of human beings to assess their willingness to participate wtp in better water resource management the theory has been proven right in explaining people s attitudes towards river and drinking water along with their perceptions of a water resources management programme and their willingness to participate in water resources management the r² value was calculated to determine the accuracy and weight of the model to predict people s willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm at langat river basin malaysia in this study the model explained about 32 2 of the total variance table 9 however when the control variables were included in the model the total variance explained by the model wtpwrm increased to r² 34 3 since the r² value of wtpwrm is above 33 the model wtpwrm has a moderate power to explain the variables hair et al 2017 the other latent variable attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme apwrmp also explained about 40 3 of the total variance and therefore it is significant chin 1998 accordingly the predictive relevance q² values of 0 02 0 15 and 0 35 denote small medium and large predictive relevance of the latent constructs cohen 2013 attitude toward and perception of river and drinking water aprdw and trust in institutes and policymakers tipm were found to have high predictive relevance as reported q² values are higher than 0 35 table 9 similarly willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme apwrmp perceived health risk phr awareness of river and drinking water ardw perceived water quality pwq and value of river and drinking water vrdw have medium predictive relevance since the reported q² values are higher than 0 15 while the residence place has small predictive relevance at 0 082 therefore this study model has a moderate predictive power to explain people s willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm 5 conclusions and recommendation the public s perception of and attitude towards river and drinking water as well as their perceived water quality were found to be the significant indicators influencing their participation in water management platforms therefore to assess the public s perception and attitude via the robust method of pls sem this study is not only important for academic sectors but also for policymakers in malaysia as well as globally in countries where the same scenario exists the study highlighted the significant positive mediating effects of people s attitudes towards and perceptions about river and drinking water aprdw t 8 723 p 0 001 as well as the moderating effects of people s perceived water quality pwq t 4 313 p 0 001 to increase their willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm at langat river basin therefore the public s attitudes and perceptions about water quality and its management can be positively changed especially through environmental education concerning their behavioural intention to be involved in water management willingly moreover the model wtpwrm showed a moderate predictive power r² 34 3 considering the demographic control variables however without the control variables the model wtpwrm also explained 32 2 of the total variance of the constructs along with a high predictive prevalence of q² 0 208 hence the pls sem model of this study can be used for other places for water resources management in brief it can be concluded that the responsible authorities at the langat river basin malaysia should focus on raising awareness advocacy and capacity building for people s effective participation in water resources management for instance the national water resources policy 2011 the water services industry act 2006 the waters act 1920 the environmental quality act 1974 and others mainly focus on raising awareness however advocacy and capacity building of the stakeholders in water management are not highlighted significantly in the policies and acts therefore the agencies should take special non structural measures such as campaigns advertisements water fairs trainings and such to raise the awareness and capacity building of the people to enhance their participation in the effective water resources management platform people in malaysia are aware of the importance of water quality not only for aquatic life but also for a healthy and high quality standard of living they also think that quality water is an essential requirement for economic development they are willing to participate in water resources management if they are well informed about the benefits of better water quality hence education and awareness raising activities should be advocated by the appropriate agencies to increase the number of people participating in a water resources management programme people also think that the effective implementation of policies is required for water management although there are many sound policies in malaysia for water resources management the promotion and enforcement of these policies are a big challenge and might be due to low participation on the part of relevant stakeholders and inadequate leadership roles from the relevant agencies therefore this study suggests an effective multi stakeholder platform for water resources management that would be useful for meaningful participation in a management programme along with government non government academic and business entities therefore the local authorities can take proactive leadership roles because they have the power of enforcement via the local government act of 1976 to change the mindset of people about the importance of water management through special training campaigns etc special training is also required for the training of the trainers tot to enhance their capacity building in water resources management thus campaigns and public meetings are useful tools for active participation of people in natural resources management and their participation can contribute significantly to sustainable water resources management credit authorship contribution statement minhaz farid ahmed conceptualization data curation

8334,study region inadequate public participation has already been reported in the sustainable water resources management at langat river basin malaysia primarily due to weak enforcement of policies along with public apathy study focus a questionnaire survey was conducted among 402 random households in the study area in 2017 to assess people s attitudes perceptions and behaviour through partial least squares structural equation modelling pls sem in order to predict their willingness to participate in water resources management although there are a few studies on public participation in water management globally this study is the pioneer in predicting public participation in water management with moderate predictive power based on a pls sem model new hydrological insights for the region the model showed significant positive mediating effects of public s attitudes towards and perceptions of river and drinking water aprdw as well as positive moderating effects of their perceived water quality pwq to enhance their willingness to participate in water management at a 99 confidence interval however people s awareness about river and drinking water ardw and the value of river and drinking water vrdw showed no significant mediating and moderating effects respectively to increase their participation in a water management platform therefore environmental education along with information concerning water management programmes should be well disseminated to people via awareness raising and capacity building activities by relevant authorities to increase their willingness to participate in sustainable water resources management in langat river basin malaysia keywords malaysia langat river basin attitude public participation water management pls sem model 1 introduction public participation or community participation in integrated water resources management programmes are always challenged by the public s poor level of knowledge by their reluctance to participate as well as by the lack of an organised platform rault et al 2013 several studies however have reported potential willingness on the part of the public to participate in water management especially in the higher water stress countries bjerregaard 1998 carr et al 2012 de marchi 2003 rault et al 2013 also reported active potential participation of the public even in the limited number of democratic countries through expressing and exchanging views and opinions of their surroundings instead of communicating through any media therefore people would have sufficient knowledge of water management problems both at the institutional and household levels in malaysia the academy of sciences malaysia asm has already produced the national integrated water resources management plan 2016 in line with the 11th malaysia plan 2016 2020 integrated water resources management iwrm integrated river basin management irbm integrated lake basin management ilbm and others moreover there is the malaysia industry government group for high technology might to establish the public private partnerships for sustainable development including the management of water resources all these approaches including the approach of sustainable development solutions network sdsn are trying to involve civil society and local authorities in sustainable water resources management to achieve the sdgs sustainable development goals especially sdg target 6 1 concerning water resources management for safe drinking water for all and sdg target 17 17 whose goal is to strengthen public private academia ngo and civil society partnerships hence this study explored people s perceptions attitudes and behaviour towards river and drinking water management at langat river basin malaysia fig 1 for sustainable water resources management several studies have claimed that people s attitudes towards and perceptions of water resources are reflected in the government s water resources management programme as people s intentions are the necessary ingredients for political will and action burstein 2010 stoutenborough and vedlitz 2013 therefore when there is a reflection of people s perceptions and attitudes in the relevant water management programmes then there will be a healthy positive relationship between people s perceptions and attitudes as well as their willingness to be engaged in water resources management lai et al 2017 reported that educating people is very important and essential to reduce the non revenue water nrw tariff on water resources management in malaysia although the government is looking for the nrw tariff education can make people aware of engaging in water resources management and can also promote their interests to reduce the nrw tariff accordingly prediction and control approaches were used as an instrument to manage water resources for a quite long time especially the management dominated by engineering solutions such as supply water management through pipeline distribution however pollution control should address both the point and non point sources of pollution including the land use changes specially for rapid development activities pahl wostl et al 2008 therefore sustainable and integrated water resources management require societal search and learning processes for the inclusion of both infrastructural and non infrastructural measures pahl wostl 2002 in malaysia including the langat river basin the shortcomings in sustainable water resources management are reported mainly because of inadequate enforcement of laws lack of public participation along with an inadequate emphasis on non structural measures chan 2009 2012 mokhtar et al 2010 2011 moreover the transboundary pollution of the langat river mainly from the sewerage and industrial discharges agricultural runoff and such has been reported by several studies even though the river is one of the prime sources of drinking water in the selangor state malaysia ahmed et al 2016a 2016b 2018a 2018b 2019 alam et al 2015 therefore public engagement with the government non government academia and business sectors could be effective in water resources management chan 2012 mokhtar et al 2011 although there are a few studies in malaysia concerning public perceptions and involvement in integrated water resources management based on the statistical analysis ab razak et al 2015 afroz et al 2016 lai et al 2017 this study is the first significant one that has assessed people s perceptions with respect to their willingness to participate in integrated water resources management based on partial least squares structural equation modelling pls sem in this study public participation refers to participation at the local level for multi stakeholder platforms these small public participatory platforms ppps are led by community leaders and tare linked to their respective local authorities hence the ppps perform very important roles for water management via local authorities who have the mandate of water resources management water resources management refers here to natural water and the drinking water supply including wastewater treatment therefore this study based on pls sem modelling provides comprehensive and accurate indicators to enhance people s participation in water resources management through suggesting effective multi stakeholder platforms led by local authorities for the effective implementation of policies hence this study explored people s behavioural intentions in the langat river basin malaysia to estimate their willingness to participate in water resources management following the psychological theory of planned behaviour ajzen 1985 2 literature review and hypothesis development 2 1 literature review the theory of planned behaviour ajzen 1985 is well accepted in psychology to explain human s behavioural intentions following this theory the human intention to perform specific activities can be categorised into three broad factors i e humans attitudes their subjective norms and perceived behaviour control therefore several studies have reported that the public s participation in water management highly depends on their perceptions attitudes and beliefs along with their demographic characteristics table 1 a recent study on water resources management has focused sharply on the ethical perspective of human beings in managing water resources the ethical perspective of water management is based on the principles of human dignity and human equality which are beyond traditional and socio environmental water governance analysing the impact of these principles has also highlighted the importance of an ethical perspective in dealing with water issues in order to improve the living conditions of informal settlements in south africa robina ramírez and sañudo fontaneda 2018 similarly malaysians are not satisfied with the water quality regarding taste as well as with the sometimes suspended solids chlorine content odour and colour of the tap water khattab and wahid 2015 however many people in malaysia believe that their tap water does not comply with the drinking water quality standard proposed by the world health organisation who accordingly many of them perceive that pipe water is not safe for drinking and it is associated with risks to their health ab razak et al 2015 therefore many of these people are willing to purchase the bottled water from the market although the quality of bottled water also needs to be examined for quality hence the local people in malaysia think that the government should not increase their water tariff at this current level of quality for their water services however the government is asking people to be willing to pay for water resources management on the other hand gender and monthly household income as part of the demographic factor also play essential roles in enhancing people s willingness to pay for bottled water khattab and wahid 2015 water resources management through the strong regulations of the government is essential to harmonise interactions between the biodiversity and society along with their complex functioning systems however it is the water users upon which the government s water regulations are imposed for the harmonisation with nature therefore many experts have suggested that the government should not only depend on external motivation factors e g awareness raising activities to influence individuals to comply with water regulations but it also should emphasise internal motivation factors e g trust to comply with the laws internal motivation may be useful to individuals if the government can bring rewards and punishments effectively at the ground level for water management armitage et al 2009 berkes 2009 hamm et al 2013 therefore building the trust of the people concerning water resources management is very crucial for being successful in implementing the laws although the trust of people has become very important in water resources management among the trust related constructs used in pls studies institutional trust process fairness and dispositional trust are the most common similarly qualitative studies have also identified that these three trust related constructs are very important for natural resources management davenport et al 2007 leahy and anderson 2008 however some researchers have argued that the influence of these trust related constructs also depends on the situation cvetkovich and nakayachi 2007 earle and siegrist 2008 meanwhile researchers have argued that public trust leads to relationship commitment between institutes and individuals morgan and hunt 1994 similarly commitment especially in customer behaviour studies is highly desired and expected for valued relationships among individuals moorman et al 1992 where there is a commitment there is a higher level of responsibility both on the part of the owner and customers to make the relationship successful with respect to satisfaction and benefits jin et al 2010 morgan and hunt 1994 both commitment and trust can be seen as positive consequences of customer value and positively affect behavioural and attitudinal intent johnson et al 2006 yoon 2002 therefore self control and usefulness are important antecedents of customer value delivery for instance perceptions of online bank reputations were enhanced by the satisfaction derived from real customer encounters with online banking services loureiro et al 2014 scientists and practitioners have often identified human perceptions as primary determinants of the success and failure of environmental plans mascia et al 2003 hence most perceived weaknesses of water resources management are related to the lack of enforcement or human resource constraints in africa buschke and esterhuyse 2012 therefore several studies have suggested the inclusion of soft skills in research i e the incorporation of government non government and civil sectors along with the local population in interdisciplinary collaborative water resources management buschke and esterhuyse 2012 dess 1987 therefore the theory of planned behaviour has been adapted to define people s perceptions attitudes and beliefs for their behavioural intentions in this case their willingness to participate in water resources management as well as to develop the hypotheses hypotheses are developed to increase people s participation in water resources management via assessing their attitudes perceptions and beliefs towards water resources management programmes it is assumed based on the theory of planned behaviour that people s perceptions and attitudes about river and drinking water aprdw awareness of river and drinking water ardw perceived health risk phr and their trust in institutes and policymakers tipm have positive influences on increasing their willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm via the water resources management programme similarly people s perceived water quality pwq knowledge their residence places rp and their value of river and drinking water vrdw also strengthen their participation in water resources management wtpwrm 2 2 hypothesis development 2 2 1 perception and attitude public perceptions of water quality are crucial to taking action to support public policies and projects designed to improve the quality of water hu 2011 however evaluation of participatory programmes and projects is necessary to assess whether these public policies and projects designs are achieved as well as to identify how participatory programmes and projects can be improved carr et al 2012 hence this study chose the construct public s attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme apwrmp as the mediator between their willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm and other independent constructs on people s attitudes and behaviour therefore the following hypothesis has been developed h1 people s attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme have a direct relationship with their willingness to participate in water resources management public participation in water resources management can be highly recommended as a tool for educating people as well as for changing their behavioural intention page and bakker 2005 hence public participation in water resources management is considered a vital tool to involve local people in the different levels of national and international water governance page and bakker 2005 therefore this study uses the construct people s attitudes towards and perceptions of river and drinking water aprdw to assess their participation in a water resources management programme apwrmp in order to develop the following hypothesis the common people are supportive of the government s projects regarding water resources management unless or until the projects have negative impacts on their surrounding environment stoutenborough and vedlitz 2013 h2 people s attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme mediate the relationship between their attitudes towards and perceptions of river and drinking water and their willingness to participate in water resources management the public is more concerned about water quality along with the county decision makers for instance citizens of illinois are knowledgeable about their water supplies and they want to see their water supplies protected miller et al 2003 hence this study uses the construct public s awareness about river and drinking water ardw to estimate their participation in a water resources management programme apwrmp through the following hypothesis h3 people s attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme mediates the relationship between their awareness of river and drinking water and their willingness to participate in water resources management safe drinking water leads to a higher quality living standard fawell and nieuwenhuijsen 2003 so water management has received maximum attention considering its importance in changing climatic conditions for social stability therefore this study has adopted the construct perceived health risk phr of people to examine their attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme apwrmp h4 people s attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme mediate the relationship between their perceived health risk and their willingness to participate in water resources management meanwhile several studies have already used surveys to collect information on the public s perceived behaviour concerning water noga and wolbring 2013 robina ramírez and sañudo fontaneda 2018 sun et al 2019 regarding water quality many studies have found that the concerns about pollution in water are increasing particularly in drinking water miller et al 2003 hu et al 2011 khattab and wahid 2015 hence the construct perceived water quality pwq has been used for this study to explore its influence on the public s willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm via the following hypothesis h5 people s perception of water quality strengthens the relationship between their attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme and their willingness to participate in water resources management 2 2 2 subjective norms knowledge attitudes and practices kap are necessary elements in drinking water studies in malaysia ab razak et al 2015 there are also a few studies regarding perceived water quality perceived health risk hygiene and diseases in developing countries concerning drinking water aini et al 2007 kioko and obiri 2012 onabolu et al 2011 mahmood et al 2011 these studies found that unprotected water sources inadequate knowledge poor household water treatment and handwashing practices were the sources of heavy metal contamination of drinking water in malaysia nigeria kenya and pakistan aini et al 2007 dupont et al 2014 kioko and obiri 2012 onabolu et al 2011 embedded moral and ethical values also influence people to care about the environment hua and marsuki 2014 therefore the value of river and drinking water vrdw has been used to find out its moderating effects on the public s willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm through the following hypothesis h6 people s value of river and drinking water positively moderates the relationship between their attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme and their willingness to participate in water resources management all the existing great religions on earth have highly praised the glory of nature therefore followers of religion have considered nature very sacred and that it will protect them many religious leaders have already pointed out the connection between environmental sustainability and the need to change our way of living which is closely linked with moral decisions chuvieco 2012 hence the conservation of nature needs to be harmonious with human activities from a religious perspective however the religious vision of environmental policy is still inferior due to the secular perspective of human beings people have a firm belief that clean water is a fundamental human right and their perceptions of clean water are apparent i e that it is a public resource therefore the management of water should be given extra priority thus people s beliefs and perceptions of water conservation are vital since the value of water goes beyond its monetary worth noga and wolbring 2013 2 2 3 perceived behaviour control people s dispositional trust is mediated by their trust in the institution with respect to their intention to comply with the rules and regulations hamm et al 2013 therefore large scale government projects are needed for water management however public support is often a prerequisite for the government at all levels to enact such projects thus this study explores people s trust in institutes and policymakers tipm to find out their views on water resources management programmes apwrmp through the following hypothesis a few recent studies have explored public attitudes preferences and risk assessments concerning water management in the united states explicitly considering the importance of trust in water management burstein 2010 stoutenborough and vedlitz 2013 h7 people s attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme mediate the relationship between their trust in institutes and policymakers and their willingness to participate in water resources management the public is universally apathetic and throws light on current deterrents to participation in the local government s programmes lowndes et al 2001 for instance urban and rural farm residents in the united states have different perceptions of their water quality and they tend to differ in their views on significant water pollutants hu 2011 similarly significant differences were observed in malaysia and other countries of the world between the effects of residents perceptions and community participation on support for tourism development in urban and rural destinations cui and ryan 2011 liu 2006 rasoolimanesh et al 2017 accordingly poor water management due to public apathy along with inadequate enforcement of laws and regulations have already been reported in malaysia chan 2012 moreover city dwellers usually cannot see the sources of their drinking water which might differ from people in living rural areas or living near a river or lake therefore people living in rural areas are more concerned about water pollution and they are willing to participate in water resources management hence this study chose the construct people s residence place rp which acts as a perceived behaviour control to assess their willingness to participate in water resources management through developing the following hypothesis h8 people s residence place moderates the relationship between their attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme and their willingness to participate in water resources management socio demographic variables such as education levels and age have a significant effect on the public s perceptions as does their attitudes towards green activities and their satisfaction levels in malaysia and around the world afroz et al 2016 ponrahono et al 2016 rezai et al 2013 sheikh et al 2014 therefore the public s perceived behaviour or their subjective norms are critical determinants of their behavioural intentions as well as their willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm 2 3 significance of pls sem model partial least squares structural equation modelling pls sem has been widely used to estimate the significant relationships between environmental social and economic variables however there are not many studies on water resources management based on pls sem table 1 robina ramírez and sañudo fontaneda 2018 used several variables human water principles dignity and equality for the improvement of water services in south africa carlander et al 2016 studied that the perceived need for change had indirect effects on the social norms with respect to the willingness of people to comply with issues of water management in sweden therefore public participation is essential not only for urban water services but also for the rural water services globally because people s participation is positively influenced by their demographic characteristics especially their places of residence although in malaysia there has so far been no study on water resources management specifically drinking water based on pls sem lai et al 2017 have however highlighted inadequate public participation in the non revenue water nrw management based on a descriptive chi square test table 1 as with the global scenario demographic factors also significantly influence people s risk perception of drinking water quality in malaysia therefore it is reported that the respective agencies are key to improving the management of drinking water quality in malaysia effective multi stakeholder platforms are required for better management of water resources including drinking water however strengthening the capacity of multi stakeholder platforms largely depends on the proactive leadership roles of relevant agencies effective multi stakeholder platforms can incorporate civil society along with the government non government and business sector better for water resources management unfortunately the indicators to enhance people s participation in water resources management have not been statistically predicted which this robust pls sem model can significantly predict for sustainable water resources management pls sem is very useful to link the correlations between environmental and socio economic factors fernandes et al 2019 maziriri and madinga 2018 rodrigues et al 2019 sun et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 the partial least squares pls method was first used by wold 1980 to develop a casual path model between dependent and independent variables therefore the prediction model based on the pls sem is widely acceptable because of its advantage to interpret the data better than the other statistical model and to account for measurement errors hair et al 2017 lauzon gauthier et al 2018 lu et al 2015 wen and li 2019 yudatama et al 2019 compared with cb sem pls sem does not require a higher measuring range of samples and residual distributions because it is a soft modelling method tenenhaus et al 2005 pls sem can deal with a small sample size along with non normal distribution of data and it is based on regression and utilises a component centred way to depict the directed dependencies among a series of variables hair et al 2012 pls can be used to investigate theoretical models of greater complexity and scope willaby et al 2015 the partial least square model is free from multi collinearity problems and the model fits r² are high which is suitable to predict improved management techniques oliveira et al 2019 for instance fernandes et al 2019 reported that poor ecological status in the streams of portugal is a direct consequence of water contamination and it requires proper implementation and monitoring of existing watershed management plans based on pls modelling the pls sem model also can provide theoretical support to the government for the proper implementation of policies and guidelines wen and li 2019 which is also applicable to water resources management 2 4 model development the model was developed based on people s attitudes and perceptions to stimulate their behavioural intention in the classical persuasion model of psychology the theory of planned behaviour ajzen 1985 explained that people s beliefs attitudes and their perceived behavioural control have an important relationship with their behavioural intention in psychology an attitude refers to a set of emotions beliefs and behaviours toward a particular object person thing or event attitudes are often the result of experience or upbringing and they can have a powerful influence on behaviour chaiklin 2011 cherry 2017 hogg and vaughan 2005 therefore human attitude in this study under the theory of planned behaviour defines that attitudes towards and perceptions of river and drinking water aprdw as well as their awareness of river and drinking water ardw have a significant influence of their engagement in water resources management similarly the public s perceived water quality pwq and perceived health risk phr also influences their willingness to participate in water management a broad definition of perceived or subjective norm under the theory of planned behaviour is the perceived social pressure to perform or not to perform the particular behaviour ajzen 1991 in this model value of river and drinking water vrdw acts as the perceived social pressure to be involved in water resources management accordingly the concept of perceived behavioural control under the theory of planned behaviour defines the state of an individual s perception of the ease or difficulty of performing a particular behaviour ajzen 1985 1991 in this study people s trust in institutes and policymakers tipm and their residence place rp acts as the perceived behavioural control to influence their attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme as well as their willingness to participate in water resources management therefore the theory of planned behaviour has been used to prepare the model of people s willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm including several mediation and moderation factors the model analysed people s perceptions and attitudes towards river and drinking water as well as a water management programme to increase their participation in water resources management at langat river basin malaysia hence the model incorporated nine latent variables based on the hypothesis apwrmp wtpwrm aprdw phr tipm ardw pwq rp and vrdw fig 2 3 materials and methods 3 1 questionnaire development informal interviews with the public private and civil sectors were conducted to develop the household questionnaire especially the latent variables or constructs along with the extensive literature review the items or statements of each construct were adapted from the previous study for this exploratory research through the partial least squares structural equation modelling pls sem a preliminary household questionnaire survey was also conducted in the langat river basin malaysia to validate the questionnaire 3 2 sample size the total number of households in the langat river basin malaysia is 1 028 003 dos 2013 therefore 402 random households in the basin completed a questionnaire survey using eq 1 ahmed et al 2019 yamane 1967 from the following districts at langat river basin table 2 with the help of enumerators a total of 450 questionnaires were distributed for the survey to get the required number of the household questionnaire survey to run the statistical structural equation model for measuring people s willingness to participate in water management the enumerators visited the minimum odd number of households randomly in the specific area of each district table 2 to conduct the household questionnaire survey the household questionnaire survey form has been included with this manuscript as supplementary material appendix a accordingly the collected number of household questionnaire samples fulfilled the 10 times rule assumption to run the structural equation model sem through smartpls3 at 80 statistical power and 1 significance level since there are nine latent variables hair et al 2017 to obtain higher overall scores for the constructs each item is scored from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree 1 n n 1 n e 2 where n sample size n population size e level of precision i e 0 05 at 95 confidence level the household questionnaire survey was administered at the langat river basin malaysia from september 2016 to january 2017 local enumerators were hired to assist the author for secure communication with the residents to complete the household survey in a timely fashion 3 3 data analysis tools the study employs structural equation modelling sem to predict and estimate the hypothesis as well as the conceptualised research model which is widely accepted and an approach used in predicting human behaviour and customer psychology chin 1998 hair et al 2017 robina ramírez and sañudo fontaneda 2018 the main advantage of the sem approach is that it accounts for measurement error hair et al 2017 however among available sem estimating approaches partial least square structural equation modelling pls sem is suitable for this study because it allows non normality of data distribution which is quite expected in human psychological studies in addition pls sem is widely used by researchers in predicting models and in conducting confirmatory research son and benbasat 2007 moreover the previous studies relating to water management and human behaviour have used a pls sem approach chin and newsted 1999 ramírez et al 2016 robina ramírez and sañudo fontaneda 2018 wells et al 2016 therefore this study uses a pls sem approach to predict the conceptualised model and hypothesis 4 results and discussions 4 1 demographic characteristics people are well educated in the langat river basin malaysia since 44 of respondents were found to have obtained a degree table 3 followed by 19 70 with a diploma therefore in the model related to willingness to participate in water management the level of education of the respondents showed a significant direct influence t 2 724 p 0 007 on their willingness to participate in water resources management at a 99 confidence interval table 7 4 2 results of the measurement model the measurement model determines the reliability of the indicators used for measuring each latent variable or construct all the loads λ of the item or indicator appendix b used for the measurement model were acceptable since all the values were higher than the minimum acceptable value of 0 4 to obtain the acceptance value of each indicator a preliminary household questionnaire survey was also conducted in the study area along with the informal interviews of the public private and civil sectors for the questions to be established in the questionnaire therefore each construct was set with the reflective indicators this means that they reflect the reality of each latent variable or construct since all values exceeded this minimum load indicators adequately reflect each construct this means that indicators were defined appropriately by the household representative interviewee and the author therefore these indicators measured the reality of the latent variables to predict the people s willingness to participate in water resources management at the langat river basin i hence this study measured the relationships between each indicator and the construct wtpwrm apwrmp phr tipm ardw pwq rp and vrdw through the construct reliability thus the measured cronbach s alpha i e 0 7 table 4 indicates consistency among the indicators and the constructs used for this study although the constructs perceived health risk phr and residence place rp observed lower cronbach s alpha values these constructs are accepted since the composite reliability cr and average variance extracted ave values are accepted similarly the cr values are found to be 0 7 table 4 in this study and this indicates that the ave is explained by the indicators rather than the errors robina ramírez and sañudo fontaneda 2018 for instance if an ave is 0 50 then it means more than 50 of the variance of a construct is explained by the indicators hair et al 2017 although the ave of residence place rp is 0 409 table 4 the reported cr for the construct is well accepted since the value is 0 7 therefore the convergent validity of all the constructs was obtained all these statistics suggest that the indicators explained the constructs well since the convergent validity of all the constructs was achieved through significant statistical relationships among the indicators and constructs so the correlation among constructs was studied through the discriminant validity in this study people s willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm would be enhanced if wtpwrm was positively mediated by people s attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme apwrmp along with the attitudes towards and perceptions of river and drinking water aprdw perceived health risk phr trust in institutes and policymakers tipm and awareness about river and drinking water similarly people s participation in water management wtpwrm would also be enhanced if people s notions of perceived water quality pwq as well as their values of the river and drinking water vrdw along with their residence place rp positively moderated their participation in water management wtpwrm therefore positive relationships among the constructs are required to measure the relationship of the constructs hence in this study all the longitudinal values through the discriminant validity of the constructs are found to be higher than the relationships with other construct table 5 thus all the measured discriminant validity values of the constructs are accepted i e 0 85 hair et al 2017 and this indicates the correlations between the constructs of this study discriminant validity is also measured through the heterotrait monotrait ratio htmt and the defined htmt ratio must be less than 0 9 hair et al 2017 the latent variable or construct ratios less than 0 9 indicate that the constructs are different table 6 4 3 structural model analysis the structural model determined the strength of relationships among the latent constructs to predict people s willingness to participate in water resources management at langat river basin malaysia fig 3 therefore the structural mode analysed the standard path coefficients β to explain the variance of the latent variables the value ranging from 1 to 1 of the standard path coefficient is considered statistically significant hair et al 2017 while the value of β near 0 signifies weak relationships between the constructs in this study the hypotheses are fulfilled except for the mediating effect of h₃ as well as the moderating effect of h₆ and h₈ table 7 in the behavioural study there might be several opinions with respect to not fulfilling the hypotheses of people s awareness of river and drinking water ardw via people s attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme apwrmp to enhance their willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm in malaysia similarly people s residence place rp and their value of the river and drinking water vrdw also did not influence their participation in water management wtpwrm or their failure to fulfil the hypotheses it indicates that people need environmental education to change their mind set to enhance their awareness about water resources and their participation in water resources management moreover the fulfilled hypotheses are not done so with the same intensity there are compelling causal influences of attitudes and perceptions about water aprdw perceived health risk phr and trust in institutes and policymakers tipm concerning a water resources management programme apwrmp as well as apwrmp on participation in water management wtpwrm similarly perceived water quality pwq has strong causal influences on participation in water management wtpwrm therefore people s attitudes perceptions and behaviour towards water resources and a water resources management programme are highly valuable for influencing people s willingness to participate in water resources management in langat river basin malaysia therefore the goodness of fit of the structural model is determined from the t statistic of the latent constructs in this study the following t values are considered statistically significant in this study t 1 65 for a 90 confidence level t 1 96 for 95 and t 2 57 for 99 hair et al 2017 the t value obtained in this study table 7 has been used to explain the hypothesis for predicting participation in a water management wtpwrm model accordingly the effect size f² of the constructs was analysed to determine the statistical power of this confirmatory predictive model a small effect size f² 0 02 hair et al 2012 2017 was determined for all the mediating and moderating constructs in this study table 7 except the mediating construct attitude towards river and drinking water ardw and the moderating construct residence place rp that have an effect size less than 0 02 this small f² value might be because of the small sample number hogg and vaughan 2005 i e 402 households from a large population of around 1 028 003 households in the langat river basin malaysia from the eight hypotheses five hypotheses were fulfilled in this study h₁ was found to be significant at a 95 confidence interval while h₂ h₄ h₅ and h₇ were significant at a 99 level table 7 this reflects the strong influence of attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme apwrmp on participation in water management wtpwrm β 0 108 t 2 285 as well as the moderating effect of perceived water quality pwq on participation in water management wtpwrm β 0 218 t 4 313 the remaining mediating hypotheses of people s attitudes towards and perceptions aprdw of a water resources management programme apwrmp β 0 463 t 8 723 perceived health risk phr on apwrmp β 0 169 t 3 407 and trust in institutes and policymakers towards apwrmp β 0 174 t 2 675 also had a significant effect on enhancing people s willingness to participate in water resources management at the langat river basin although the moderating effects of residence place rp and value of river and drinking water vrdw have no significant effects on people s participation in water management wtpwrm at the basin both rp β 0 231 t 5 287 and vrdw β 0 116 t 5 287 have significant direct effects on enhancing people s wtpwrm similarly the control variables education β 0 121 t 2 724 and monthly income β 0 084 t 2 222 of the people were found significant in enhancing people s wtpwrm table 7 therefore all the correlations among the constructs in this study are highly accepted thus the objective of the study that the people s changing attitude toward and perception of water resources in the basin is very important to enhance their willingness to participate in water resources management the mediation analysis also found significant mediation of aprdw attitude towards and perception of river and drinking water apwrmp attitude towards and perception of water resources management programme wtpwrm willingness to participate in water resources management therefore apwrmp significantly mediates the positive relationship between aprdw and people s wtpwrm t 2 244 p 0 025 at a 95 confidence level table 8 similarly significant mediation of people s phr perceived health risk apwrmp attitude towards and perception of a water resources management programme wtpwrm willingness to participate in water resources management was observed t 1 738 p 0 083 at a 90 level although a water resources management programme acts as a mediator in the study no mediation effects were observed between tipm trust towards institutes and policymakers and people s willingness to participate in water management wtpwrm as well as ardw awareness about river and drinking water and people s wtpwrm it is assumed that people lack appropriate information about policy enforcement as well as a lack of environmental education however a strong direct effect t 2 285 p 0 023 has been determined between a water resources management programme apwrmp and people s participation in water management wtpwrm at a 95 level therefore the mediation and path coefficient analysis indicate that if people s perceptions of river and drinking water increases through effective education then there will be increased participation in managing the water resources thus the findings of the study followed the theory of planned behaviour ajzen 1985 in order to explain the relationship among beliefs attitudes and behavioral willingness of human beings to assess their willingness to participate wtp in better water resource management the theory has been proven right in explaining people s attitudes towards river and drinking water along with their perceptions of a water resources management programme and their willingness to participate in water resources management the r² value was calculated to determine the accuracy and weight of the model to predict people s willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm at langat river basin malaysia in this study the model explained about 32 2 of the total variance table 9 however when the control variables were included in the model the total variance explained by the model wtpwrm increased to r² 34 3 since the r² value of wtpwrm is above 33 the model wtpwrm has a moderate power to explain the variables hair et al 2017 the other latent variable attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme apwrmp also explained about 40 3 of the total variance and therefore it is significant chin 1998 accordingly the predictive relevance q² values of 0 02 0 15 and 0 35 denote small medium and large predictive relevance of the latent constructs cohen 2013 attitude toward and perception of river and drinking water aprdw and trust in institutes and policymakers tipm were found to have high predictive relevance as reported q² values are higher than 0 35 table 9 similarly willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm attitudes towards and perceptions of a water resources management programme apwrmp perceived health risk phr awareness of river and drinking water ardw perceived water quality pwq and value of river and drinking water vrdw have medium predictive relevance since the reported q² values are higher than 0 15 while the residence place has small predictive relevance at 0 082 therefore this study model has a moderate predictive power to explain people s willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm 5 conclusions and recommendation the public s perception of and attitude towards river and drinking water as well as their perceived water quality were found to be the significant indicators influencing their participation in water management platforms therefore to assess the public s perception and attitude via the robust method of pls sem this study is not only important for academic sectors but also for policymakers in malaysia as well as globally in countries where the same scenario exists the study highlighted the significant positive mediating effects of people s attitudes towards and perceptions about river and drinking water aprdw t 8 723 p 0 001 as well as the moderating effects of people s perceived water quality pwq t 4 313 p 0 001 to increase their willingness to participate in water resources management wtpwrm at langat river basin therefore the public s attitudes and perceptions about water quality and its management can be positively changed especially through environmental education concerning their behavioural intention to be involved in water management willingly moreover the model wtpwrm showed a moderate predictive power r² 34 3 considering the demographic control variables however without the control variables the model wtpwrm also explained 32 2 of the total variance of the constructs along with a high predictive prevalence of q² 0 208 hence the pls sem model of this study can be used for other places for water resources management in brief it can be concluded that the responsible authorities at the langat river basin malaysia should focus on raising awareness advocacy and capacity building for people s effective participation in water resources management for instance the national water resources policy 2011 the water services industry act 2006 the waters act 1920 the environmental quality act 1974 and others mainly focus on raising awareness however advocacy and capacity building of the stakeholders in water management are not highlighted significantly in the policies and acts therefore the agencies should take special non structural measures such as campaigns advertisements water fairs trainings and such to raise the awareness and capacity building of the people to enhance their participation in the effective water resources management platform people in malaysia are aware of the importance of water quality not only for aquatic life but also for a healthy and high quality standard of living they also think that quality water is an essential requirement for economic development they are willing to participate in water resources management if they are well informed about the benefits of better water quality hence education and awareness raising activities should be advocated by the appropriate agencies to increase the number of people participating in a water resources management programme people also think that the effective implementation of policies is required for water management although there are many sound policies in malaysia for water resources management the promotion and enforcement of these policies are a big challenge and might be due to low participation on the part of relevant stakeholders and inadequate leadership roles from the relevant agencies therefore this study suggests an effective multi stakeholder platform for water resources management that would be useful for meaningful participation in a management programme along with government non government academic and business entities therefore the local authorities can take proactive leadership roles because they have the power of enforcement via the local government act of 1976 to change the mindset of people about the importance of water management through special training campaigns etc special training is also required for the training of the trainers tot to enhance their capacity building in water resources management thus campaigns and public meetings are useful tools for active participation of people in natural resources management and their participation can contribute significantly to sustainable water resources management credit authorship contribution statement minhaz farid ahmed conceptualization data curation
