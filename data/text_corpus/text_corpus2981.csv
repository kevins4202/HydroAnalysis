14905,drinking water treatment plants dwtps are designed to remove physical chemical and biological contaminants however until recently the role of dwtps in minimizing the cycling of antibiotic resistance determinants has got limited attention in particular the risk of selecting antibiotic resistant bacteria arb is largely overlooked in chlorine free dwtps where biological processes are applied here we combined high throughput quantitative pcr and metagenomics to analyze the abundance and dynamics of microbial communities antibiotic resistance genes args and mobile genetic elements mges across the treatment trains of two chlorine free dwtps involving dune based and reservoir based systems the microbial diversity of the water increased after all biological unit operations namely rapid and slow sand filtration ssf and granular activated carbon filtration both dwtps reduced the concentration of args and mges in the water by circa 2 5 log gene copies ml 1 despite their relative increase in the disinfection sub units ssf in dune based and uv treatment in reservoir based dwtps the total microbial concentration was also reduced 2 5 log units and none of the dwtps enriched for bacteria containing genes linked to antibiotic resistance our findings highlight the effectiveness of chlorine free dwtps in supplying safe drinking water while reducing the concentration of antibiotic resistance determinants to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that monitors the presence and dynamics of antibiotic resistance determinants in chlorine free dwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water treatment plants chlorine free sand filtration microbiome resistome mobilome data availability available in ncbi bioproject prjna886863 1 introduction access to safe water and sanitation is a key sustainable development goal united nations 2015 and a central objective of the water action decade united nations 2018 of the united nations drinking water treatment plants dwtps are used to remove water contaminants and deliver safe water for consumption the sources and types of contaminants in drinking water can vary based on multiple factors such as the water source yu et al 2018 geographical location unep united nations environment programme 2016 season kumpel et al 2017 and human activity in the water basin khatri and tyagi 2015 contaminants can be classified into two categories physical chemical agents such as suspended particles iron and ammonia and biological agents such as pathogens and antimicrobial resistances amr united states environmental protection agency 2021 the process configuration of dwtps is mainly dictated by the water source either groundwater or surface water while confined groundwater is generally microbiologically safe surface water may contain pathogenic organisms that must be eliminated smeets et al 2009 chemical disinfectants such as chlorine are usually applied to disinfect drinking water i e inactivate pathogenic microorganisms and or to prevent microbial re growth in the distribution network sedlak and von gunten 2011 however the use of disinfectants can generate by products with mutagenic and carcinogenic effects rook 1976 and selects for antibiotic resistant bacteria arb shi et al 2013 a few countries e g the netherlands denmark or switzerland ceased disinfectants use and rely on strict source to consumer production standards and engineering solutions for drinking water supply smeets et al 2009 for the chlorine free drinking water production from surface water two main dwtp configurations dune based and reservoir based are employed in the netherlands in both cases a large fraction of the treatment consists of biological biofilm based unit operations such as dune infiltration rapid sand filtration rsf slow sand filtration ssf or granular activated carbon gac filtration which combine biological and physical chemical processes in these systems chemlical and biological water contaminants are converted by microbial communities mouchet 1992 tekerlekopoulou et al 2013 which shape the microbiome of the drinking water that reaches consumers pinto et al 2012 therefore the biological safety of the microbial communities harbored in dwtps is of utmost importance for public health in contrast to wastewater environments calderón franco et al 2022 miłobedzka et al 2022 pallares vega et al 2019 few studies focus on the fate and removal of args and arb in dwtps biofilms are known reservoirs of arb and antibiotic resistance genes args balcázar et al 2015 there is limited knowledge on the impact of biofilm based dwtps on the generation and or persistence of arb in drinking water while antibiotic concentrations are very low or non existent stackelberg et al 2004 the generation of arb in biofilms by horizontal gene transfer hgt is a well known phenomenon farkas et al 2013 hgt is the transfer of genetic material from one organisms to another that is not its offspring including mechanisms such as bacterial conjugation transduction or transformation allowing for the spread of traits such as antibiotic resistance among microorganisms soucy et al 2015 therefore the effect of biofilms present in dwtps operational units on arb development needs to be uncovered to date molecular studies of microbial communities arb and args in dwtps have been limited by the low biomass concentration present in these systems for dna extraction sample collection logistics and sampling standardization ma et al 2017 the results often rely on either lab scale experiments stange et al 2019 wan et al 2019 or specific treatment processes such as biological activated carbon filters wan et al 2021 or tertiary treatments such as chlorine uv or a combination of them destiani and templeton 2019 shi et al 2013 therefore information about how biological treatments affect the fate of args and mges in full scale dwtps from an integral consideration of the treatment train and different geographical areas is missing most integrative studies have been carried out in china hu et al 2019 jia et al 2020 2015 su et al 2018 xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 s 2016 i e one of the largest antibiotic producing and consuming countries world wide huang et al 2019 the studies have used qpcr hu et al 2019 su et al 2018 s zhang et al 2016 high throughput qpcr xu et al 2016 or sequencing methods like amplicon sequencing and metagenomics jia et al 2020 2015 zhang et al 2019 to investigate the concentration and richness of args in full scale dwtps sevillano et al 2020 have compared the effect of disinfection systems on antimicrobial resistance determinants on tap water samples in dwtps from the netherlands uk and usa yet no detailed information about individual process units was provided moreover none of these studies have combined qualitative metagenomics and quantitative ht qpcr approaches for their analysis to get information about the total amount and diversity of amr determinants in chlorine free dwtps in this work we qualitatively and quantitatively resolve the role of chlorine free dwtps in the control of arb and args throughout the entire treatment train of two full scale dwtps in a low antibiotic consuming country specifically we aim at deciphering how the biofilms in biological unit operations shape the resistome and mobilome of the drinking water to do so we compared the contribution of different methods for water storage physical chemical contaminant removal and disinfection in one dune based dwtp and one reservoir based dwtp 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling of two full scale dwtps water samples were collected from two different chlorine free dwtps supplying drinking water to the south holland and zeeland provinces in the netherlands fig 1 the dune based dwtp in this study infiltrates pre treated river water into the sand dunes for storage and water quality improvement e g disinfection subsequently dune water is abstracted with wells and treated with pellet softening powdered activated carbon pac and rapid sand filtration rsf to remove hardness organic micro contaminants iron and ammonium slow sand filtration ssf is deployed as a final disinfection step as well as to ensure the biological stability of the water i e remove trace nutrients the reservoir based dwtp in this study stores water in open reservoirs and uses a treatment train of coagulation flocculation and rsf to eliminate physical chemical contaminants uv treatment for disinfection and granular activated carbon gac to remove organic contaminants e g color odor pesticides the first dune based dwtp n 52 7 1 9992 e 4 18 23 9184 treats surface water from the meuse river the second reservoir based dwtp n 51 48 44 4132 e 4 20 0 2112 processes surface water from the meuse river as well the netherlands after storage in a reservoir multiple wastewater treatment plants and an industrial complex discharge effluent water upstream of the intake point five sampling process stages per dwtp were targeted for water collection across their process stages fig 2 table 1 the dune based dwtp samples consisted of d1 influent from the meuse river water n 51 55 41 7288 e 4 46 15 7404 d2 outlet of the first rapid sand filtration d3 dune outlet 2 months hydraulic residence time d4 outlet of the second rapid sand filtration and d5 outlet of the slow sand filtration the reservoir based dwtp samples consisted of r1 influent of the reservoir from the meuse river water n 51 45 39 3228 e 4 46 8 6664 r2 a sample of water after being stored in the reservoir for 2 months r3 rapid sand filtration treatment outlet r4 uv treatment outlet and r5 gac outlet water quality parameters were provided by the dwtps figure s2 the volume of each water sample depended on the expected biomass concentration at each stage based on the author s experience and knowledge of dwtp personnel 2 2 dna extraction volumes indicated in table 1 above 10 l were filtered on the dwtp site through a pressure filter holder containing sterile 0 22 µm polyethersulfone membrane filters 293 mm diameter pall usa with a vacuum pump the membrane containing the biological retentate was folded and introduced into the dna extraction tubes the biomass collected in the membranes were stored at 4 c until dna extraction total dna was extracted using the dneasy powerwater dna extraction kit qiagen the netherlands following the manufacturers instructions dna qualities of the extracts were measured as absorbance ratio at 260 and 280 nm using a nanodrop spectrophotometer dna concentrations were measured with a qubit4 fluorometer thermo fisher scientific usa the dna quality and concentration obtained for each sample is given in table 1 2 3 library preparation sequencing quality control and assembly 2 3 1 preparation of metagenome libraries the dna analytes were sent to novogene cambridge united kingdom for metagenome library preparation and sequencing a total amount of 1 µg dna per sample was used as input material to prepare libraries that were generated using the nebnext ultra dna library prep kit for illumina neb usa following manufacturer s instructions index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample in short the dna sample was fragmented by sonication into fragment sizes of 350 bp the dna fragments were end polished a tailed and ligated with the full length adaptor for illumina sequencing with further pcr amplification to add the sequence adapters the pcr products were purified on ampure xp magnetic beads beckman coulter usa 2 3 2 sequencing of libraries the library preparations were sequenced with an illumina hiseq pe150 system ten raw sequencing files with 150 bp paired reads were obtained with an average of 5 6 gb per sample 41 million reads more details are given in table s1 2 3 3 quality control of sequenced reads the quality of the sequenced raw reads was assessed by fastqc version 0 11 7 with default parameters andrews 2010 and visualized with multiqc version 1 0 figure s1 low quality paired end reads were trimmed and filtered by trimmomatic version 0 39 on the paired end mode bolger et al 2014 2 3 4 assembly of sequence reads clean reads were assembled into contigs using metaspades version 3 13 0 with default parameters nurk et al 2017 an average of 37 744 2 total contigs of 4761 bp were obtained table s1 2 3 5 microbiome profiling obtained from dune and reservoir based dwtps taxonomic classification of raw reads was performed to profile the microbiome from each sample using the standard kraken2 version 2 database uses all complete bacterial archaeal and viral genomes in ncbi refseq database with default parameters wood et al 2019 raw reads divided into k mers substrings of length k contained within a biological sequence determined by kraken2 were matched with the ncbi database agarwala et al 2018 the absolute abundance of each taxonomic group was indicated as the number of k mers aligned to a specific taxonomic group the relative abundance is the normalization of the total number of k mers aligned in each sample the estimated average coverage of the samples was calculated using the online version of nonpareil http enve omics ce gatech edu nonpareil submit february 2023 with k mer kernel and k mer length 24 species richness s was measured as the number of different species detected in the raw datasets the shannon h diversity index was calculated with the following equation h i 1 s p i ln p i where pi represents the relative abundance of species i with respect to the total amount of species s microbial community distance estimation was calculated using minhash in mash v2 3 ondov et al 2016 with k 18 the minimum value required for distance estimation 2 3 6 resistome and mobilome profiling of dna analytes obtained from both dwtps args were annotated by aligning the assembled contigs 500 bp to the resfinder 4 0 resistance gene database using the blastn version 2 6 0 nucleotide alignment tool with a cut off e value 10 5 and sequence identity above 90 bortolaia et al 2020 the richness of args was defined as the number of different detected args coverage was manually checked on the identified hits being most of them above the standard 70 required for correct identification garber et al 2020 the mobilome was analyzed on the same set of contigs 500 bp using blastn version 2 6 0 with the following specific databases of mges with sequence identity 95 and an e value 10 20 the presence of plasmids was studied with the plsdb database galata et al 2019 integrons were detected with the integrall database moura et al 2009 the isfinder database was used to identify bacterial insertion sequences siguier et al 2006 the iceberg database version may 2 2018 detected bacterial integrative and conjugative elements liu et al 2019 for all queries the arg or mge identified with the best score was selected to annotate the query co occurrence or co localization of mges and args within the same contig was identified it was checked with the blastn outputs if a contig contained both args and mges contigs 500 bp that simultaneously included hits from the resfinder 4 0 database and at least one of the different mge databases were considered to have co localized afterward a specific kraken2 taxonomic analysis was performed with these contigs to identify the potential microbial host that might carry the co localized arg and mge 2 3 7 high throughput quantitative pcr analysis aliquots of the dna extracts were sent in parallel to resistomap helsinki finland for high throughput quantitative pcr ht qpcr to detect and quantify the presence and abundance of 295 genes listed in table s2 these genes belonged to args 238 genes mges 51 and pathogens 6 a concentration of 2 ng dna μl 1 in a reaction volume of 0 05 μl was used to obtain the number of gene copies of the different biomarkers ht qpcr results were corrected detailed explanation in supplementary material to get the number of gene copies existing per volume of filtered water from the dwtps sampling points gene detection and quantification were performed using the smartchip real time pcr system takarabio ca usa by resistomap oy helsinki finalnd qpcr cycling conditions and processing of raw data were previously described lai et al 2021 muurinen et al 2017 w i muziasari et al 2016 wang et al 2014 briefly the qpcr conditions included initial enzyme activation at 95 c for 10 min 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 30 s and then annealing at 60 c for 30 s for amplification melting curve analysis was performed for each primer set of all the samples amplicons with unspecific melting curves and multiple peaks based on the slope of melting profiles were false positive data and therefore discarded from the analysis melting curve analysis was processed using the smartchip qpcr software the threshold cycle ct of 27 was set as the detection limit muurinen et al 2017 muziasari et al 2017 w i 2016 standard curves and no template controls were run alongside samples each dna sample was analysed in three qpcr reactions i e technical replicates when a gene was detected in at least two technical replicates mean ct of three technical replicates in each qpcr reaction was calculated the gene abundance results were expressed in different ways the absolute abundance of args and mges was calculated as a number of gene copies per ml of filtered water as done in xu et al 2016 the absolute abundances of args and mges sorted by antibiotic class and mge type were averaged over all genetic components belonging to each group the relative abundance of args and mges was calculated based on the arg or mge copies per number of 16s rrna gene copies abundance values were logarithmically transformed for comprehensive data calculation and visualization 2 3 8 statistics and data visualization graphs were made with rstudio version 1 3 1093 microbiome absolute and relative abundances were calculated by r package pavian v 1 2 0 breitwieser and salzberg 2020 linear correlations between absolute abundances of args and mges were analyzed using pearson correlation coefficient ggpubr r package at value 0 05 pearson correlations between args and each specific type of mge plasmid insertion sequence integron and transposon were also calculated this gives the first hint proxy for examining the co localization of args and mges due to the logistical problems inherent to full scale studies we could not take a larger number of samples which compromises the statistical significance of the results consequently the analysis and discussion of results relies on trends and not on comparison between two stand alone values 3 results 3 1 microbial community composition 3 1 1 richness and alpha diversity of the water metagenomes the metagenomes of the microbial communities present at the different sampling points across the dune based and reservoir based dwtps were sequenced to obtain first their taxonomic profiles all sequenced samples had high quality rates quality rate per sequence base 30 q 10 x log10 p where p is the probability that a base call is erroneous figure s1 in analogy to other engineered ecosystems such as wastewater treatment plants and likely owing to current databases incompleteness an average of 24 6 6 5 of the raw reads were taxonomically classified the alpha diversity of the water microbiomes was assessed using the richness and the shannon index fig 3 a the former measures the number of different populations at the genus level in the community and the latter accounts for the number relative abundance and evenness of species hill et al 2003 richness was stable throughout both dwtps ranging between 7027 and 7959 different classified species detected from the water metagenomes fig 3 the richness of the influent of the reservoir based dwtp was 7 higher than the dune based dwtp influent water rapid sand filtration rsf1 and rsf2 slow sand filtration ssf and granular activated carbon gac increased the number of species by 2 9 1 7 1 7 3 3 1 1 and 4 9 respectively on the contrary dune infiltration reservoir and uv disinfection decreased it by 3 4 0 9 4 7 3 0 and 2 5 respectively the shannon h diversity index ranged between 4 9 and 7 7 across all samples i e equivalent to 134 to 2208 virtual equi abundant populations the dune based dwtp gradually increased from 5 3 to 7 7 throughout the plant equal h diversity values were found in the influent 6 7 and effluent 6 6 of the reservoir based dwtp despite its oscillating trend the distances between the microbial community compositions were calculated using the minhash dimensionality reduction technique in mash fig 3b higher distance indicates the larger dissimilarity between the microbial community at each sampling point and the influent the dissimilarity significantly increased after every step in both dwtps p value 0 05 except for after reservoir where p value 0 09 overall the differences in microbial community compositions across the process train of the dune based dwtp were higher than in reservoir based dwtp the average estimated coverage of the samples i e what fraction of the microbial community was sampled by dna sequencing was calculated to assess the reliability of alpha diversity indices 7 out of 10 samples had an estimated coverage above 60 the minimum value recommended figure s8 rodriguez r and konstantinidis 2014 the remaining three yielded average estimated coverages below the threshold despite the large sequencing effort 13 gb per sample however the values were close to the minimum and extreme differences in coverage twofold were never reached 3 1 2 taxonomic classification of microbial communities the relative abundance of the detected prokaryotic populations across the dwtps at genus and phylum levels is shown in fig 4 and figure s2 the river influent water of both dwtps had similar compositions at phylum level proteobacteria 68 1 5 5 in dune based dwtp vs 76 9 10 2 in reservoir based dwtp actinobacteria 17 1 6 5 vs 11 9 5 6 and bacteroidetes 6 2 3 8 vs 4 9 2 6 dominated the microbial communities of both dwtps at genus level the freshwater genera limnohabitans 24 6 vs 6 4 candidatus planktophila 8 2 vs 7 5 and flavobacterium 6 8 vs 6 1 were the main populations detected in both river waters their relative abundance decreased throughout the dwtp processes interestingly we found several genera in the effluent water that were absent in the influent with most of them appearing after dune infiltration ssf and gac filtration and thus likely coming from the biofilms within these unit operations in the dune based dwtp every sand filter decreased the relative abundance of members of the phylum bacteroidetes figure s2 and its most abundant genus flavobacterium this population decreased from 6 8 to 0 8 in rsf1 from 5 4 to 1 in rsf2 and from 1 to 0 2 in ssf in contrast no other genus systematically increased after all sand filtration steps the most notable changes were the increase in the relative abundance of pseudomonas 3 5 and acinetobacter 0 9 in rsf1 and streptomyces 4 5 in ssf genera that may contain pathogens overall the water infiltration in dunes had the highest impact on the microbial community composition i it substantially decreased the relative abundance of genera that were abundant in the influent namely limnohabitans from 6 1 to 0 2 and of ca planktophila from 12 8 to 0 1 and ii increased the relative abundances of other genera like sphingophyxis from 0 1 to 12 1 and sphingobium from 0 2 to 12 7 unlike dune infiltration in the dune based dwtp the water storage step in the reservoir based dwtp did not modify the microbial community of the water in this dwtp the most significant change took place in the disinfection step uv disinfection the relative abundance of pseudomonas increased from 7 6 to 60 and sphingopyxis raised from 4 0 to 7 5 concomitantly the presence of the other genera decreased however it is important to note that dna from nonviable microorganisms might have been extracted and thus included in this analysis in the following unit operation gac filtration the relative abundance of pseudomonas decreased to 22 1 whilst that of other genera such as massilia 3 7 polaromonas 1 3 and flavobacterium 2 4 increased 3 2 pathogenic bacteria decreased across both chlorine free drinking water treatment plants ht qpcr was used to detect the presence of acinetobacter baumannii pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae the three most critical antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria and family containing arbs as designated by the world health organization tacconelli and magrini 2017 overall the absolute abundance of the pathogenic bacteria detected by qpcr was low 106 gene copies ml 1 and further reduced along the two dwtps acinetobacter baumanii pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococci were detected 102 genes copies ml 1 while klebsiella pneumoniae campylobacter and staphylococci were not a baumanii was detected across both plants p aeruginosa was present across the treatment train of the dune based dwtp but was not detected after uv disinfection in the reservoir based dwtp interestingly enterococci was found only after rsf1 in the dune based dwtp but this could be an artifact due to low sample size 3 3 gram negative bacteria as potential carriers of args in dwtps the resistance determinants from the two dwtps exhibited a large diversity of args highlighted by both qualitative metagenomics and quantitative ht qpcr analyses the resistome richness ranged from 3 to 20 different args detected per sample in total 34 different args were detected in the water of the dune based dwtp and 58 in the water of the reservoir based dwtp fig 6 the most abundant args related to resistance against macrolides mlsb 57 different args followed by beta lactams 13 aminoglycosides 10 quinolones 7 sulfonamide 2 tetracycline 2 and trimethoprim 1 some args were present across the dwtps notably the msr d 2 af27302 gene conferring macrolide resistance remained in the treated water of the reservoir based dwtp in the dune based dwtp the dune infiltration step was most prominently increasing the diversity of args likely due to the pronounced shift in microbial community fig 4 in the reservoir based dwtp the rapid sand filtration before the uv step and the gac filtration introduced the highest variability in the resistome profile we linked arg contigs to potential microbial origins by assigning taxonomies to contigs carrying args the results of this analysis at genus level are given in figure s3 generally contigs containing args mainly affiliated with limnohabitants in the influent water samples of both dwtps other genera included paracoccus and ca fonsibacter in reservoir based dwtp and polynucleobacter acidovorax hydrogenophaga and ca fonsibacter in dunes based dwtp most of these populations but ca fonsibacter decreased across the treatment train in reservoir based dwtp while ca fonsibacter and limnohabitans persisted within the dune based dwtp in the reservoir based dwtp the last gac filtration step mostly increased the number of potential hosts carrying args this released bacteria potentially carrying args such as pseudomonas kaistella microbacterium cellulosimicrobium caulobacter methylobacterium rhodoplanes messorzhibium and rhodoferax among others in the dune based dwtp the dune infiltration step introduced the potential hosts carrying args in the drinking water treatment train acinetobacter rhodoferax and pseudomonas were the microbial genera that persisted throughout the process after infiltration in the dune 3 4 chlorine free dwtps achieve 2 3 logs removal of args and mges ht qpcr was used to assess the arg and mge removal efficiencies from both dwtps by quantifying the number of gene copies per volume of filtered water in each sampling point the absolute concentration of args decreased along the treatment trains down to 2 2 log gene copies ml 1 dune based dwtp and 2 6 log gene copies ml 1 reservoir based dwtp fig 7a mges decreased by 2 7 log gene copies ml 1 dune based dwtp and 2 6 log gene copies ml 1 reservoir based dwtp fig 7b similarly the bacterial proxy 16s rrna gene decreased by 2 5 dune based dwtp and 2 6 reservoir based dwtp log gene copies ml 1 the influent water samples from two water treatment plants had similar amounts of args 6 4 0 9 log arg copies ml 1 in the dune based plant and 6 8 0 9 log arg copies ml 1 in the reservoir based plant in the dune based plant the concentration of args decreased from 6 0 0 9 log arg copies ml 1 after the first rapid sand filtration to 4 2 0 9 log arg copies ml 1 after the last slow sand filtration in the reservoir based plant the arg concentration decreased from 5 7 0 7 log arg copies ml 1 after 2 months in the reservoir to 4 2 0 9 log arg copies ml 1 after gac filtration the concentration of mges in the dune based plant was 7 1 1 2 log mge copies ml 1 in the influent and decreased to 4 5 1 1 log mge copies ml 1 after the last slow sand filtration in the reservoir based plant the mge concentration decreased from 6 0 0 9 log mge copies ml 1 after 2 months in the reservoir to 4 4 1 2 log mge copies ml after gac filtration fig 7b some process stages increased the concentration of args and mges in water such as the slow sand filtration in the dune based dwtp 22 in args and 20 in mges and the uv treatment in the reservoir based dwtp 7 in args and 2 in mges however the decrease in the concentration of args and mges was progressive across both dwtps detailed information on the args and mges reduction throughout the processes per sampling point is given in table s2 several args persisted across both dwtps the aada7 aminoglycoside resistance 6 0 1 2 log gene copies ml 1 mexf multi drug resistance 5 6 1 2 and fox5 beta lactam resistance and 5 5 1 3 log gene copies ml 1 genes were the 3 most abundant args in both dwtps figure s4 other args were not present in the influent but appeared across the dwtps such as blatem blapao and vanwg from the 238 args tested 72 i e 30 were not detected in any sampling point regarding mges the integron genes were the most abundant in both dwtps 5 8 1 7 log gene copies ml 1 the inti1 1 integron repa plasmid inti3 integron and tn5403 transposon genes were the most abundant figure s5 the conjugative plasmid sequences such as incp orit and trbc and promiscuous plasmid incq orit gene sequences were also abundant despite the reduction in args and mges concentration in water the ratios of args and mges to the 16s rrna gene remained stable throughout both dwtps fig 7c this indicates that the dwtp process did not enrich for bacterial populations carrying args or mges 3 5 args and mges co localized on contigs of dwtp metagenomes when args and mges co localize on the same genetic fragment there is an increased chance that the fragment can be transferred between bacterial cells since facilitating the transfer conjugation integration and transposition of genes in genomes mge can pose a risk for the dissemination of args sets of 7 dune based dwtp and 12 reservoir based dwtp events of co localization of args and mges were detected on contigs retrieved from the sequenced metagenomes a detailed description of the co localization events is provided in table s3 co localizations were detected in all sampling points from both dwtps except for the influent of the reservoir based dwtp the args involved coded for mainly aminoglycosides and beta lactam resistance for instance the ant 3 ia gene is an aminoglycoside resistant gene broadly described in klebsiella pneumoniae this persistent arg was annotated from the metagenome of the dune based dwtp influent and in the outlets of the rsf1 reservoir uv and gac units this arg was embedded in plasmids integrons and bacterial integrative conjugative elements ices affiliating with polynucleobacter and pseudomonas genera the blavim arg against last resource beta lactamases carbapenem antibiotics was embedded in a plasmid between insertion sequences and in conjugative elements in different stages of the process in the reservoir based dwtp it taxonomically affiliated with sphingobium and sphingomonas before uv and with pseudomonas after uv and gac other args only appeared once the sul2 and blaoxa 287 genes appeared after rsf1 and dune infiltration respectively both affiliating with acinetobacter the sul2 gene was carried by plasmid integrons and bacterial integrative and conjugative elements a plasmid carried the blaoxa 287 gene the sul1 gene appeared before uv linked to sphingobium the blatem 181 gene after uv linked to bacillus both sul1 and blatem 181 genes were potentially carried by plasmids integrons and bacterial integrative and conjugative elements the srm b gene after gac was already assigned in rhodoferax the mef c and mph g genes appeared after gac as well with kaistella as the potential host these 2 args were detected on the same contig node 16870 which implied the possible existence of a plasmid co containing multiple resistance genes 4 discussion 4 1 operational units shape the structure of the drinking water microbiome in order to study the impact of each unit operation on the dynamics of the water microbiome we applied shotgun metagenomics on water samples collected along the treatment train of two chlorine free dwtps namely a dune based and a reservoir based plant the alpha diversities of both effluents calculated as h shannon diversity indices were varied from 4 9 to 7 7 average 6 3 0 8 these values are comparable to other chlorine free dwtps 4 37 0 1 6 02 0 4 palomo et al 2016 and significantly higher than the ones in plants with chemical disinfection ca 2 4 tiwari et al 2021 waak et al 2019 dai et al 2019 noticeably the alpha diversity increased after every biological filter rsf1 rsf2 ssf and gac filtration a likely consequence of direct seeding from biofilm detachment lautenschlager et al 2014 velten et al 2011 proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes were the most abundant phyla in both dwtps this matched with previous observations lin et al 2014 oh et al 2017 su et al 2018 and with the presence of actinobacteria and bacteroidetes in freshwater ecosystems neuenschwander et al 2018 warnecke et al 2004 interestingly the microbial community after the first operational unit of both dwtps namely rsf in dune based dwtp and reservoir in reservoir based dwtp was similar to the influent however the similarity decreased in the downstream stages of the dwtps fig 3b this aligned with the observations of pinto et al 2012 who highlighted that even though the source water seeds the drinking water microbiome the unit operations shape the structure of the effluent microbial community the conditions within biological sand filters have different impacts on microorganisms fitness hu et al 2020 yet webster fierer 2019 postulated that changes in community composition before and after lab scale biological sand filters are largely predictable in this line we found higher abundances of actinobacteria the rsf and ssf effluents as compared to their influents in the dune based dwtp figure s2 in analogy to the high actinobacteria abundance in bench scale sand filters xu et al al 2020 in contrast the relative abundance of bacteroidetes decreased after every biological sand filtration unit similar to earlier reports mukherjee et al 2016 pfannes et al 2015 another example are the common freshwater bacteria limnohabitans ca planktophila ca nanopelagicus and rhodoluna hahn 2016 kasalický et al 2013 neuenschwander et al 2018 abundant in the water influent but almost absent in the dwtps effluents overall our findings showcase common patterns in the effect of biological operational units on the water microbiome dynamics of full scale dwtp paving the way to predict and modulate the microbial community in the drinking water effluent 4 2 chlorine free dwtps remove antibiotic resistance determinants to the best of our knowledge this is the first study in which the fate of arg and arb is monitored throughout the treatment train of chlorine free dwtps both dwtps effectively reduced the concentration of args by ca 2 5 log gene copies ml 1 these removals are comparable to the highest reported in chlorine amended dwtps between 0 1 log arg copies ml 1 su et al 2018 s zhang et al 2016 and 2 4 log arg copies ml 1 hu et al 2019 moreover the total arg concentration in the water effluent of both chlorine free dwtps was ca 4 log arg copies ml 1 similar to what hu et al 2019 found in a chlorine amended dwtps overall both chlorine free dwtp proved at least as effective as chlorine amended dwtp at reducing args additionally the decrase in args and mges concentration was linearly correlated with that of 16s rrna fig 7c figure s6 proving that none of the biological unit operations in chlorine free dwtps selected for arb i e the arb 16s ratio did not increase the water storage steps yielded the highest arg and arb removal in both plants 2 1 and 1 6 arg copies ml 1 in dune and reservoir based dwtps respectively likely due to biomass decay and plasmid degradation due to the high hydraulic retention times and low nutrient availability in these systems amarasiri et al 2020 griffiths et al 1990 zhang et al 2021 likewise rsfs reduced the arg and arb concentration by decreasing biomass concentration as previously reported hu et al 2019 su et al 2018 s zhang et al 2016 unexpectedly gac filtration also decreased the concentration of args fig 7a in contrast to previous studies describing gac filtration as the critical step where resistance determinants increase su et al 2018 wan et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 however the decrease in args concentration in this study contrasted with the increase in arg richness fig 6 which suggests that the microbiome in the gac effluent is seeded by the gac biofilm the final treatment step before discharge to the environment is disinfection which is intended to suppress or inactivate harmful microorganisms and prevent the regrowth of opportunistic bacteria national research council safe drinking water committee 1980 however the ssf 0 75 log gene copies ml 1 and uv treatments 0 32 log gene copies ml 1 in this study increased the concentration args fig 7a b the fate of arg in ssf has not been directly studied before however xu et al 2020 showed that ssf hardly decreases the concentration of antibiotics in water and ciric 2022 reported that while their ssf removed most of the microorganisms those in the effluent were more prone to resistance to antibiotics in the case of uv treatment previous studies proved its efficacy for cell reduction plate counting but not for args removal chen and zhang 2013 stange et al 2019 gram negative bacteria and specifically pseudomonas tolerate uv by efficient repair mechanisms high growth rates or the use of low molecular weight organic carbon generated by uv illumination as an energy source chen et al 2020 this can explain the rise in relative abundance of pseudomonas a common multi drug resistant bacteria in drinking water systems su et al 2018 and the quantitative increase in the 16s rrna gene marker after uv disinfection fig 7a nevertheless despite the intermediate increase of args mges and pathogenic bacteria after disinfection dwtps successfully reduced their effluent concentration fig 5 fig 7 figure s7 4 3 clinical implications of gene transfer in chlorine free dwtps in concert with wastewater treatment plants wwtps dwtps are the ultimate barriers preventing the spread of waterborne diseases and the release of antibiotics arb and args into water systems collignon and mcewen 2019 miłobedzka et al 2022 one crucial aspect is the presence of args against last resort antibiotics such as carbapenems or colistin carbapenem resistance genes like blaimp or blavim class b beta lactamases resistant genes have been described in pathogenic bacteria such as pseudomonas acinetobacter or enterobacteriaceae nordmann et al 2012 shanthi amudhan et al 2012 carbapenem is a beta lactam antibiotic with a broad antimicrobial spectrum and administered as a last resort for treating drug resistant bacterial infections however the number of carbapenem resistant bacteria has steadily increased who 2017 and represents a primary concern in drinking water blaimp genes were rarely detected along both dwtps however blavim was detected along the dune based dwtp and in the effluent after gac treatment of the reservoir based dwtp figure s4 the taxonomic annotation of the contigs containing blavim genes revealed their potential co localization with multiple plasmids affiliating with sphingobium in the dune based dwtp and with sphingobium plant pathogen and pseudomonas in the reservoir based dwtp after gac filtration the carbapenem resistant pseudomonas is accounted by who within the list of critical priority pathogens for which new antibiotics are required tacconelli and magrini 2017 colistin resistance genes such as mcr1 variants were also highly abundant in both the dune based and the reservoir based dwtps however this is not unique to chlorine free dwtps as multiple last resort args have also been identified in conventional dwtp with chlorine use as well as in tap water dias et al 2020 importantly the mcr1 gene load decreased significantly along the water treatment trains and neither co localized with any mge nor affiliated with any pathogenic bacteria further research should underpin the regrowth capacity of such pathogens in chlorine free dwtp effluents 5 conclusions in this work we characterized for the very first time the abundance and dynamics of microbial communities antibiotic resistance genes args and mobile genetic elements mges across the treatment trains of two chlorine free drinking water treatment plants the in depth analysis of the metagenomes and resistomes led to the following main conclusions 1 chlorine free dwtps do not select for antibiotic resistant bacteria as supported by the linear correlated between args and mges and the 16s rrna gene concentrations 2 the measured reduction in args concentration by ca 2 5 log gene copies ml 1 in both chlorine free dwtps is comparable to the highest removals reported so far for chlorine amended dwtps 3 water storage systems alone reduced the abundance of the 16s rrna gene args and mges by ca 1 6 log gene copies ml 1 and dune infiltration achieved the highest removal 4 despite a ca 2 5 log 16s rrna gene copies ml 1 reduction the effluent microbial diversity increased likely due to the seeding from the biofilms actively growing in the rapid and slow sand filters and the granular activated carbon 5 despite the overall arg decrease in the dwtp disinfection slow sand filtration and uv radiation internally increased the concentration of args mges and 16s rrna genes by ca 0 5 log gene copies ml 1 yet with no impact on overall reduction overall our findings confirm the effectiveness of chlorine free dwtps in providing safe drinking water and reducing the load of antibiotic resistance determinants offering the water authorities the possibility to establish centralized risk management around these specific treatment steps data availability metagenome sequencing data were

14905,drinking water treatment plants dwtps are designed to remove physical chemical and biological contaminants however until recently the role of dwtps in minimizing the cycling of antibiotic resistance determinants has got limited attention in particular the risk of selecting antibiotic resistant bacteria arb is largely overlooked in chlorine free dwtps where biological processes are applied here we combined high throughput quantitative pcr and metagenomics to analyze the abundance and dynamics of microbial communities antibiotic resistance genes args and mobile genetic elements mges across the treatment trains of two chlorine free dwtps involving dune based and reservoir based systems the microbial diversity of the water increased after all biological unit operations namely rapid and slow sand filtration ssf and granular activated carbon filtration both dwtps reduced the concentration of args and mges in the water by circa 2 5 log gene copies ml 1 despite their relative increase in the disinfection sub units ssf in dune based and uv treatment in reservoir based dwtps the total microbial concentration was also reduced 2 5 log units and none of the dwtps enriched for bacteria containing genes linked to antibiotic resistance our findings highlight the effectiveness of chlorine free dwtps in supplying safe drinking water while reducing the concentration of antibiotic resistance determinants to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that monitors the presence and dynamics of antibiotic resistance determinants in chlorine free dwtps graphical

introduction access to safe water and sanitation is a key sustainable development goal united nations 2015 and a central objective of the water action decade united nations 2018 of the united nations drinking water treatment plants dwtps are used to remove water contaminants and deliver safe water for consumption the sources and types of contaminants in drinking water can vary based on multiple factors such as the water source yu et al 2018 geographical location unep united nations environment programme 2016 season kumpel et al 2017 and human activity in the water basin khatri and tyagi 2015 contaminants can be classified into two categories physical chemical agents such as suspended particles iron and ammonia and biological agents such as pathogens and antimicrobial resistances amr united states environmental protection agency 2021 the process configuration of dwtps is mainly dictated by the water source either groundwater or surface water while confined groundwater is generally microbiologically safe surface water may contain pathogenic organisms that must be eliminated smeets et al 2009 chemical disinfectants such as chlorine are usually applied to disinfect drinking water i e inactivate pathogenic microorganisms and or to prevent microbial re growth in the distribution network sedlak and von gunten 2011 however the use of disinfectants can generate by products with mutagenic and carcinogenic effects rook 1976 and selects for antibiotic resistant bacteria arb shi et al 2013 a few countries e g the netherlands denmark or switzerland ceased disinfectants use and rely on strict source to consumer production standards and engineering solutions for drinking water supply smeets et al 2009 for the chlorine free drinking water production from surface water two main dwtp configurations dune based and reservoir based are employed in the netherlands in both cases a large fraction of the treatment consists of biological biofilm based unit operations such as dune infiltration rapid sand filtration rsf slow sand filtration ssf or granular activated carbon gac filtration which combine biological and physical chemical processes in these systems chemlical and biological water contaminants are converted by microbial communities mouchet 1992 tekerlekopoulou et al 2013 which shape the microbiome of the drinking water that reaches consumers pinto et al 2012 therefore the biological safety of the microbial communities harbored in dwtps is of utmost importance for public health in contrast to wastewater environments calderón franco et al 2022 miłobedzka et al 2022 pallares vega et al 2019 few studies focus on the fate and removal of args and arb in dwtps biofilms are known reservoirs of arb and antibiotic resistance genes args balcázar et al 2015 there is limited knowledge on the impact of biofilm based dwtps on the generation and or persistence of arb in drinking water while antibiotic concentrations are very low or non existent stackelberg et al 2004 the generation of arb in biofilms by horizontal gene transfer hgt is a well known phenomenon farkas et al 2013 hgt is the transfer of genetic material from one organisms to another that is not its offspring including mechanisms such as bacterial conjugation transduction or transformation allowing for the spread of traits such as antibiotic resistance among microorganisms soucy et al 2015 therefore the effect of biofilms present in dwtps operational units on arb development needs to be uncovered to date molecular studies of microbial communities arb and args in dwtps have been limited by the low biomass concentration present in these systems for dna extraction sample collection logistics and sampling standardization ma et al 2017 the results often rely on either lab scale experiments stange et al 2019 wan et al 2019 or specific treatment processes such as biological activated carbon filters wan et al 2021 or tertiary treatments such as chlorine uv or a combination of them destiani and templeton 2019 shi et al 2013 therefore information about how biological treatments affect the fate of args and mges in full scale dwtps from an integral consideration of the treatment train and different geographical areas is missing most integrative studies have been carried out in china hu et al 2019 jia et al 2020 2015 su et al 2018 xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 s 2016 i e one of the largest antibiotic producing and consuming countries world wide huang et al 2019 the studies have used qpcr hu et al 2019 su et al 2018 s zhang et al 2016 high throughput qpcr xu et al 2016 or sequencing methods like amplicon sequencing and metagenomics jia et al 2020 2015 zhang et al 2019 to investigate the concentration and richness of args in full scale dwtps sevillano et al 2020 have compared the effect of disinfection systems on antimicrobial resistance determinants on tap water samples in dwtps from the netherlands uk and usa yet no detailed information about individual process units was provided moreover none of these studies have combined qualitative metagenomics and quantitative ht qpcr approaches for their analysis to get information about the total amount and diversity of amr determinants in chlorine free dwtps in this work we qualitatively and quantitatively resolve the role of chlorine free dwtps in the control of arb and args throughout the entire treatment train of two full scale dwtps in a low antibiotic consuming country specifically we aim at deciphering how the biofilms in biological unit operations shape the resistome and mobilome of the drinking water to do so we compared the contribution of different methods for water storage physical chemical contaminant removal and disinfection in one dune based dwtp and one reservoir based dwtp 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling of two full scale dwtps water samples were collected from two different chlorine free dwtps supplying drinking water to the south holland and zeeland provinces in the netherlands fig 1 the dune based dwtp in this study infiltrates pre treated river water into the sand dunes for storage and water quality improvement e g disinfection subsequently dune water is abstracted with wells and treated with pellet softening powdered activated carbon pac and rapid sand filtration rsf to remove hardness organic micro contaminants iron and ammonium slow sand filtration ssf is deployed as a final disinfection step as well as to ensure the biological stability of the water i e remove trace nutrients the reservoir based dwtp in this study stores water in open reservoirs and uses a treatment train of coagulation flocculation and rsf to eliminate physical chemical contaminants uv treatment for disinfection and granular activated carbon gac to remove organic

processes surface water from the meuse river as well the netherlands after storage in a reservoir multiple wastewater treatment plants and an industrial complex discharge effluent water upstream of the intake point five sampling process stages per dwtp were targeted for water collection across their process stages fig 2 table 1 the dune based dwtp samples consisted of d1 influent from the meuse

sample depended on the expected biomass concentration at each stage based on the author s experience and knowledge of dwtp personnel 2 2 dna extraction volumes indicated in table 1 above 10 l were filtered on the dwtp site through a pressure filter holder containing sterile 0 22 µm polyethersulfone membrane filters 293 mm diameter pall usa with a vacuum pump the membrane containing the biological retentate was folded and introduced into the dna extraction tubes the biomass collected in the membranes were stored at 4 c until dna extraction total dna was extracted using the dneasy powerwater dna extraction kit qiagen the netherlands following the manufacturers instructions dna qualities of the extracts were measured as absorbance ratio at 260 and 280 nm using a nanodrop spectrophotometer dna concentrations were measured with a qubit4 fluorometer thermo fisher scientific usa the dna quality and concentration obtained for each sample is given in table 1 2 3 library preparation sequencing quality control and assembly 2 3 1 preparation of metagenome libraries the dna analytes were sent to novogene cambridge united kingdom for metagenome library preparation and sequencing a total amount of 1 µg dna per sample was used as input material to prepare libraries that were generated using the nebnext ultra dna library prep kit for illumina neb usa following manufacturer s instructions index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample in short the dna sample was fragmented by sonication into fragment sizes of 350 bp the dna fragments were end polished a tailed and ligated with the full length adaptor for illumina sequencing with further pcr amplification to add the sequence adapters the pcr products were purified on ampure xp magnetic beads beckman coulter usa 2 3 2 sequencing of libraries the library preparations were sequenced with an illumina hiseq pe150 system ten raw sequencing files with 150 bp paired reads were obtained with an average of 5 6 gb per sample 41 million reads more details are given in table s1 2 3 3 quality control of sequenced reads the quality of the sequenced raw reads was assessed by fastqc version 0 11 7 with default parameters andrews 2010 and visualized with multiqc version 1 0 figure s1 low quality paired end reads were trimmed and filtered by trimmomatic version 0 39 on the paired end mode bolger et al 2014 2 3 4 assembly of sequence reads clean reads were assembled into contigs using metaspades version 3 13 0 with default parameters nurk et al 2017 an average of 37 744 2 total contigs of 4761 bp were obtained table s1 2 3 5 microbiome profiling obtained from dune and reservoir based dwtps taxonomic classification of raw reads was performed to profile the microbiome from each sample using the standard kraken2 version 2 database uses all complete bacterial archaeal and viral genomes in ncbi refseq database with default parameters wood et al 2019 raw reads divided into k mers substrings of length k contained within a biological sequence determined by kraken2 were matched with the ncbi database agarwala et al 2018 the absolute abundance of each taxonomic group was indicated as the number of k mers aligned to a specific taxonomic group the relative abundance is the normalization of the total number of k mers aligned in each sample the estimated average coverage of the samples was calculated using the online version of nonpareil http enve omics ce gatech edu nonpareil submit february 2023 with k mer kernel and k mer length 24 species richness s was measured as the number of different species detected in the raw datasets the shannon h diversity index was calculated with the following equation h i 1 s p i ln p i where pi represents the relative abundance of species i with respect to the total amount of species s microbial community distance estimation was calculated using minhash in mash v2 3 ondov et al 2016 with k 18 the minimum value required for distance estimation 2 3 6 resistome and mobilome profiling of dna analytes obtained from both dwtps args were annotated by aligning the assembled contigs 500 bp to the resfinder 4 0 resistance gene database using the blastn version 2 6 0 nucleotide alignment tool with a cut off e value 10 5 and sequence identity above 90 bortolaia et al 2020 the richness of args was defined as the number of different detected args coverage was manually checked on the identified hits being most of them above the standard 70 required for correct identification garber et al 2020 the mobilome was analyzed on the same set of contigs 500 bp using blastn version 2 6 0 with the following specific databases of mges with sequence identity 95 and an e value 10 20 the presence of plasmids was studied with the plsdb database galata et al 2019 integrons were detected with the integrall database moura et al 2009 the isfinder database was used to identify bacterial insertion sequences siguier et al 2006 the iceberg database version may 2 2018 detected bacterial integrative and conjugative elements liu et al 2019 for all queries the arg or mge identified with the best score was selected to annotate the query co occurrence or co localization of mges and args within the same contig was identified it was checked with the blastn outputs if a contig contained both args and mges contigs 500 bp that simultaneously included hits from the resfinder 4 0 database and at least one of the different mge databases were considered to have co localized afterward a specific kraken2 taxonomic analysis was performed with these contigs to identify the potential microbial host that might carry the co localized arg and mge 2 3 7 high throughput quantitative pcr analysis aliquots of the dna extracts were sent in parallel to resistomap helsinki finland for high throughput quantitative pcr ht qpcr to detect and quantify the presence and abundance of 295 genes listed in table s2 these genes belonged to args 238 genes mges 51 and pathogens 6 a concentration of 2 ng dna μl 1 in a reaction volume of 0 05 μl was used to obtain the number of gene copies of the different biomarkers ht qpcr results were corrected detailed explanation in supplementary material to get the number of gene copies existing per volume of filtered water from the dwtps sampling points gene detection and quantification were performed using the smartchip real time pcr system takarabio ca usa by resistomap oy helsinki finalnd qpcr cycling conditions and processing of raw data were previously described lai et al 2021 muurinen et al 2017 w i muziasari et al 2016 wang et al 2014 briefly the qpcr conditions included initial enzyme activation at 95 c for 10 min 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 30 s and then annealing at 60 c for 30 s for amplification melting curve analysis was performed for each primer set of all the samples amplicons with unspecific melting curves and multiple peaks based on the slope of melting profiles were false positive data and therefore discarded from the analysis melting curve analysis was processed using the smartchip qpcr software the threshold cycle ct of 27 was set as the detection limit muurinen et al 2017 muziasari et al 2017 w i 2016 standard curves and no template controls were run alongside samples each dna sample was analysed in three qpcr reactions i e technical replicates when a gene was detected in at least two technical replicates mean ct of three technical replicates in each qpcr reaction was calculated the gene abundance results were expressed in different ways the absolute abundance of args and mges was calculated as a number of gene copies per ml of filtered water as done in xu et al 2016 the absolute abundances of args and mges sorted by antibiotic class and mge type were averaged over all genetic components belonging to each group the relative abundance of args and mges was calculated based on the arg or mge copies per number of 16s rrna gene copies abundance values were logarithmically transformed for comprehensive data calculation and visualization 2 3 8 statistics and data visualization graphs were made with rstudio version 1 3 1093 microbiome absolute and relative abundances were calculated by r package pavian v 1 2 0 breitwieser and salzberg 2020 linear correlations between absolute abundances of args and mges were analyzed using pearson correlation coefficient ggpubr r package at value 0 05 pearson correlations between args and each specific type of mge plasmid insertion sequence integron and transposon were also calculated this gives the first hint proxy for examining the co localization of args and mges due to the logistical problems inherent to full scale studies we could not take a larger number of samples which compromises the statistical significance of the results consequently the analysis and discussion of results relies on trends and not on comparison between two stand alone values 3 results 3 1 microbial community composition 3 1 1 richness and alpha diversity of the water metagenomes the metagenomes of the microbial communities present at the different sampling points across the dune based and reservoir based dwtps were sequenced to obtain first their taxonomic profiles all sequenced samples had high quality rates quality rate per sequence base 30 q 10 x log10 p where p is the probability that a base call is erroneous figure s1 in analogy to other engineered ecosystems such as wastewater treatment plants and likely owing to current databases incompleteness an average of 24 6 6 5 of the raw reads were taxonomically classified the alpha diversity of the water microbiomes was assessed using the richness and the shannon index fig 3 a the former measures the number of different populations at the genus level in the community and the latter accounts for the number relative abundance and evenness of species hill et al 2003 richness was stable throughout both dwtps ranging between 7027 and 7959 different classified species detected from the water metagenomes fig 3 the richness of the influent of the reservoir based dwtp was 7 higher than the dune based dwtp influent water rapid sand filtration rsf1 and rsf2 slow sand filtration ssf and granular activated carbon gac increased the number of species by 2 9 1 7 1 7 3 3 1 1 and 4 9 respectively on the contrary dune infiltration reservoir and uv disinfection decreased it by 3 4 0 9 4 7 3 0 and 2 5 respectively the shannon h diversity index ranged between 4 9 and 7 7 across all samples i e equivalent to 134 to 2208 virtual equi abundant populations the dune based dwtp gradually increased from 5 3 to 7 7 throughout the plant equal h diversity values were found in the influent 6 7 and effluent 6 6 of the reservoir based dwtp despite its oscillating trend the distances between the microbial community compositions were calculated using the minhash dimensionality reduction technique in mash fig 3b higher distance indicates the larger dissimilarity between the microbial community at each sampling point and the influent the dissimilarity significantly increased after every step in both dwtps p value 0 05 except for after reservoir where p value 0 09 overall the differences in microbial community compositions across the process train of the dune based dwtp were higher than in reservoir based dwtp the average estimated coverage of the samples i e what fraction of the microbial community was sampled by dna sequencing was calculated to assess the reliability of alpha diversity indices 7 out of 10 samples had an estimated coverage above 60 the minimum value recommended figure s8 rodriguez r and konstantinidis 2014 the remaining three yielded average estimated coverages below the threshold despite the large sequencing effort 13 gb per sample however the values were close to the minimum and extreme differences in coverage twofold were never reached 3 1 2 taxonomic classification of microbial communities the relative abundance of the detected prokaryotic populations across the dwtps at genus and phylum levels is shown in fig 4 and figure s2 the river influent water of both dwtps had similar compositions at phylum level proteobacteria 68 1 5 5 in dune based dwtp vs 76 9 10 2 in reservoir based dwtp actinobacteria 17 1 6 5 vs 11 9 5 6 and bacteroidetes 6 2 3 8 vs 4 9 2 6 dominated the microbial communities of both dwtps at genus level the freshwater genera limnohabitans 24 6 vs 6 4 candidatus planktophila 8 2 vs 7 5 and flavobacterium 6 8 vs 6 1 were the main populations detected in both river waters their relative abundance decreased throughout the dwtp processes interestingly we found several genera in the effluent water that were absent in the influent with most of them appearing after dune infiltration ssf and gac filtration and thus likely coming from the biofilms within these unit operations in the dune based dwtp every sand filter decreased the relative abundance of members of the phylum bacteroidetes figure s2 and its most abundant genus flavobacterium this population decreased from 6 8 to 0 8 in rsf1 from 5 4 to 1 in rsf2 and from 1 to 0 2 in ssf in contrast no other genus systematically increased after all sand filtration steps the most notable changes were the increase in the relative abundance of pseudomonas 3 5 and acinetobacter 0 9 in rsf1 and streptomyces 4 5 in ssf genera that may contain pathogens overall the water infiltration in dunes had the highest impact on the microbial community composition i it substantially decreased the relative abundance of genera that were abundant in the influent namely limnohabitans from 6 1 to 0 2 and of ca planktophila from 12 8 to 0 1 and ii increased the relative abundances of other genera like sphingophyxis from 0 1 to 12 1 and sphingobium from 0 2 to 12 7 unlike dune infiltration in the dune based dwtp the water storage step in the reservoir based dwtp did not modify the microbial community of the water in this dwtp the most significant change took place in the disinfection step uv disinfection the relative abundance of pseudomonas increased from 7 6 to 60 and sphingopyxis raised from 4 0 to 7 5 concomitantly the presence of the other genera decreased however it is important to note that dna from nonviable microorganisms might have been extracted and thus included in this analysis in the following unit operation gac filtration the relative abundance of pseudomonas decreased to 22 1 whilst that of other genera such as massilia 3 7 polaromonas 1 3 and flavobacterium 2 4 increased 3 2 pathogenic bacteria decreased across both chlorine free drinking water treatment plants ht qpcr was used to detect the presence of acinetobacter baumannii pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae the three most critical antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria and family containing arbs as designated by the world health organization tacconelli and magrini 2017 overall the absolute abundance of the pathogenic bacteria detected by qpcr was low 106 gene copies ml 1 and further reduced along the two dwtps acinetobacter baumanii pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococci were detected 102 genes copies ml 1 while klebsiella pneumoniae campylobacter and staphylococci were not a baumanii was detected across both plants p aeruginosa was present across the treatment train of the dune based dwtp but was not detected after uv disinfection in the reservoir based dwtp interestingly enterococci was found only after rsf1 in the dune based dwtp but this could be an artifact due to low sample size 3 3 gram negative bacteria as potential carriers of args in dwtps the resistance determinants from the two dwtps exhibited a large diversity of args highlighted by both qualitative metagenomics and quantitative ht qpcr analyses the resistome richness ranged from 3 to 20 different args detected per sample in total 34 different args were detected in the water of the dune based dwtp and 58 in the water of the reservoir based dwtp fig 6 the most abundant args related to resistance against macrolides mlsb 57 different args followed by beta lactams 13 aminoglycosides 10 quinolones 7 sulfonamide 2 tetracycline 2 and trimethoprim 1 some args were present across the dwtps notably the msr d 2 af27302 gene conferring macrolide resistance remained in the treated water of the reservoir based dwtp in the dune based dwtp the dune infiltration step was most prominently increasing the diversity of args likely due to the pronounced shift in microbial community fig 4 in the reservoir based dwtp the rapid sand filtration before the uv step and the gac filtration introduced the highest variability in the resistome profile we linked arg contigs to potential microbial origins by assigning taxonomies to contigs carrying args the results of this analysis at genus level are given in figure s3 generally contigs containing args mainly affiliated with limnohabitants in the influent water samples of both dwtps other genera included paracoccus and ca fonsibacter in reservoir based dwtp and polynucleobacter acidovorax hydrogenophaga and ca fonsibacter in dunes based dwtp most of these populations but ca fonsibacter decreased across the treatment train in reservoir based dwtp while ca fonsibacter and limnohabitans persisted within the dune based dwtp in the reservoir based dwtp the last gac filtration step mostly increased the number of potential hosts carrying args this released bacteria potentially carrying args such as pseudomonas kaistella microbacterium cellulosimicrobium caulobacter methylobacterium rhodoplanes messorzhibium and rhodoferax among others in the dune based dwtp the dune infiltration step introduced the potential hosts carrying args in the drinking water treatment train acinetobacter rhodoferax and pseudomonas were the microbial genera that persisted throughout the process after infiltration in the dune 3 4 chlorine free dwtps achieve 2 3 logs removal of args and mges ht qpcr was used to assess the arg and mge removal efficiencies from both dwtps by quantifying the number of gene copies per volume of filtered water in each sampling point the absolute concentration of args decreased along the treatment trains down to 2 2 log gene copies ml 1 dune based dwtp and 2 6 log gene copies ml 1 reservoir based dwtp fig 7a mges decreased by 2 7 log gene copies ml 1 dune based dwtp and 2 6 log gene copies ml 1 reservoir based dwtp fig 7b similarly the bacterial proxy 16s rrna gene decreased by 2 5 dune based dwtp and 2 6 reservoir based dwtp log gene copies ml 1 the influent water samples from two water treatment plants had similar amounts of args 6 4 0 9 log arg copies ml 1 in the dune based plant and 6 8 0 9 log arg copies ml 1 in the reservoir based plant in the dune based plant the concentration of args decreased from 6 0 0 9 log arg copies ml 1 after the first rapid sand filtration to 4 2 0 9 log arg copies ml 1 after the last slow sand filtration in the reservoir based plant the arg concentration decreased from 5 7 0 7 log arg copies ml 1 after 2 months in the reservoir to 4 2 0 9 log arg copies ml 1 after gac filtration the concentration of mges in the dune based plant was 7 1 1 2 log mge copies ml 1 in the influent and decreased to 4 5 1 1 log mge copies ml 1 after the last slow sand filtration in the reservoir based plant the mge concentration decreased from 6 0 0 9 log mge copies ml 1 after 2 months in the reservoir to 4 4 1 2 log mge copies ml after gac filtration fig 7b some process stages increased the concentration of args and mges in water such as the slow sand filtration in the dune based dwtp 22 in args and 20 in mges and the uv treatment in the reservoir based dwtp 7 in args and 2 in mges however the decrease in the concentration of args and mges was progressive across both dwtps detailed information on the args and mges reduction throughout the processes per sampling point is given in table s2 several args persisted across both dwtps the aada7 aminoglycoside resistance 6 0 1 2 log gene copies ml 1 mexf multi drug resistance 5 6 1 2 and fox5 beta lactam resistance and 5 5 1 3 log gene copies ml 1 genes were the 3 most abundant args in both dwtps figure s4 other args were not present in the influent but appeared across the dwtps such as blatem blapao and vanwg from the 238 args tested 72 i e 30 were not detected in any sampling point regarding mges the integron genes were the most abundant in both dwtps 5 8 1 7 log gene copies ml 1 the inti1 1 integron repa plasmid inti3 integron and tn5403 transposon genes were the most abundant figure s5 the conjugative plasmid sequences such as incp orit and trbc and promiscuous plasmid incq orit gene sequences were also abundant despite the reduction in args and mges concentration in water the ratios of args and mges to the 16s rrna gene remained stable throughout both dwtps fig 7c this indicates that the dwtp process did not enrich for bacterial populations carrying args or mges 3 5 args and mges co localized on contigs of dwtp metagenomes when args and mges co localize on the same genetic fragment there is an increased chance that the fragment can be transferred between bacterial cells since facilitating the transfer conjugation integration and transposition of genes in genomes mge can pose a risk for the dissemination of args sets of 7 dune based dwtp and 12 reservoir based dwtp events of co localization of args and mges were detected on contigs retrieved from the sequenced metagenomes a detailed description of the co localization events is provided in table s3 co localizations were detected in all sampling points from both dwtps except for the influent of the reservoir based dwtp the args involved coded for mainly aminoglycosides and beta lactam resistance for instance the ant 3 ia gene is an aminoglycoside resistant gene broadly described in klebsiella pneumoniae this persistent arg was annotated from the metagenome of the dune based dwtp influent and in the outlets of the rsf1 reservoir uv and gac units this arg was embedded in plasmids integrons and bacterial integrative conjugative elements ices affiliating with polynucleobacter and pseudomonas genera the blavim arg against last resource beta lactamases carbapenem antibiotics was embedded in a plasmid between insertion sequences and in conjugative elements in different stages of the process in the reservoir based dwtp it taxonomically affiliated with sphingobium and sphingomonas before uv and with pseudomonas after uv and gac other args only appeared once the sul2 and blaoxa 287 genes appeared after rsf1 and dune infiltration respectively both affiliating with acinetobacter the sul2 gene was carried by plasmid integrons and bacterial integrative and conjugative elements a plasmid carried the blaoxa 287 gene the sul1 gene appeared before uv linked to sphingobium the blatem 181 gene after uv linked to bacillus both sul1 and blatem 181 genes were potentially carried by plasmids integrons and bacterial integrative and conjugative elements the srm b gene after gac was already assigned in rhodoferax the mef c and mph g genes appeared after gac as well with kaistella as the potential host these 2 args were detected on the same contig node 16870 which implied the possible existence of a plasmid co containing multiple resistance genes 4 discussion 4 1 operational units shape the structure of the drinking water microbiome in order to study the impact of each unit operation on the dynamics of the water microbiome we applied shotgun metagenomics on water samples collected along the treatment train of two chlorine free dwtps namely a dune based and a reservoir based plant the alpha diversities of both effluents calculated as h shannon diversity indices were varied from 4 9 to 7 7 average 6 3 0 8 these values are comparable to other chlorine free dwtps 4 37 0 1 6 02 0 4 palomo et al 2016 and significantly higher than the ones in plants with chemical disinfection ca 2 4 tiwari et al 2021 waak et al 2019 dai et al 2019 noticeably the alpha diversity increased after every biological filter rsf1 rsf2 ssf and gac filtration a likely consequence of direct seeding from biofilm detachment lautenschlager et al 2014 velten et al 2011 proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes were the most abundant phyla in both dwtps this matched with previous observations lin et al 2014 oh et al 2017 su et al 2018 and with the presence of actinobacteria and bacteroidetes in freshwater ecosystems neuenschwander et al 2018 warnecke et al 2004 interestingly the microbial community after the first operational unit of both dwtps namely rsf in dune based dwtp and reservoir in reservoir based dwtp was similar to the influent however the similarity decreased in the downstream stages of the dwtps fig 3b this aligned with the observations of pinto et al 2012 who highlighted that even though the source water seeds the drinking water microbiome the unit operations shape the structure of the effluent microbial community the conditions within biological sand filters have different impacts on microorganisms fitness hu et al 2020 yet webster fierer 2019 postulated that changes in community composition before and after lab scale biological sand filters are largely predictable in this line we found higher abundances of actinobacteria the rsf and ssf effluents as compared to their influents in the dune based dwtp figure s2 in analogy to the high actinobacteria abundance in bench scale sand filters xu et al al 2020 in contrast the relative abundance of bacteroidetes decreased after every biological sand filtration unit similar to earlier reports mukherjee et al 2016 pfannes et al 2015 another example are the common freshwater bacteria limnohabitans ca planktophila ca nanopelagicus and rhodoluna hahn 2016 kasalický et al 2013 neuenschwander et al 2018 abundant in the water influent but almost absent in the dwtps effluents overall our findings showcase common patterns in the effect of biological operational units on the water microbiome dynamics of full scale dwtp paving the way to predict and modulate the microbial community in the drinking water effluent 4 2 chlorine free dwtps remove antibiotic resistance determinants to the best of our knowledge this is the first study in which the fate of arg and arb is monitored throughout the treatment train of chlorine free dwtps both dwtps effectively reduced the concentration of args by ca 2 5 log gene copies ml 1 these removals are comparable to the highest reported in chlorine amended dwtps between 0 1 log arg copies ml 1 su et al 2018 s zhang et al 2016 and 2 4 log arg copies ml 1 hu et al 2019 moreover the total arg concentration in the water effluent of both chlorine free dwtps was ca 4 log arg copies ml 1 similar to what hu et al 2019 found in a chlorine amended dwtps overall both chlorine free dwtp proved at least as effective as chlorine amended dwtp at reducing args additionally the decrase in args and mges concentration was linearly correlated with that of 16s rrna fig 7c figure s6 proving that none of the biological unit operations in chlorine free dwtps selected for arb i e the arb 16s ratio did not increase the water storage steps yielded the highest arg and arb removal in both plants 2 1 and 1 6 arg copies ml 1 in dune and reservoir based dwtps respectively likely due to biomass decay and plasmid degradation due to the high hydraulic retention times and low nutrient availability in these systems amarasiri et al 2020 griffiths et al 1990 zhang et al 2021 likewise rsfs reduced the arg and arb concentration by decreasing biomass concentration as previously reported hu et al 2019 su et al 2018 s zhang et al 2016 unexpectedly gac filtration also decreased the concentration of args fig 7a in contrast to previous studies describing gac filtration as the critical step where resistance determinants increase su et al 2018 wan et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 however the decrease in args concentration in this study contrasted with the increase in arg richness fig 6 which suggests that the microbiome in the gac effluent is seeded by the gac biofilm the final treatment step before discharge to the environment is disinfection which is intended to suppress or inactivate harmful microorganisms and prevent the regrowth of opportunistic bacteria national research council safe drinking water committee 1980 however the ssf 0 75 log gene copies ml 1 and uv treatments 0 32 log gene copies ml 1 in this study increased the concentration args fig 7a b the fate of arg in ssf has not been directly studied before however xu et al 2020 showed that ssf hardly decreases the concentration of antibiotics in water and ciric 2022 reported that while their ssf removed most of the microorganisms those in the effluent were more prone to resistance to antibiotics in the case of uv treatment previous studies proved its efficacy for cell reduction plate counting but not for args removal chen and zhang 2013 stange et al 2019 gram negative bacteria and specifically pseudomonas tolerate uv by efficient repair mechanisms high growth rates or the use of low molecular weight organic carbon generated by uv illumination as an energy source chen et al 2020 this can explain the rise in relative abundance of pseudomonas a common multi drug resistant bacteria in drinking water systems su et al 2018 and the quantitative increase in the 16s rrna gene marker after uv disinfection fig 7a nevertheless despite the intermediate increase of args mges and pathogenic bacteria after disinfection dwtps successfully reduced their effluent concentration fig 5 fig 7 figure s7 4 3 clinical implications of gene transfer in chlorine free dwtps in concert with wastewater treatment plants wwtps dwtps are the ultimate barriers preventing the spread of waterborne diseases and the release of antibiotics arb and args into water systems collignon and mcewen 2019 miłobedzka et al 2022 one crucial aspect is the presence of args against last resort antibiotics such as carbapenems or colistin carbapenem resistance genes like blaimp or blavim class b beta lactamases resistant genes have been described in pathogenic bacteria such as pseudomonas acinetobacter or enterobacteriaceae nordmann et al 2012 shanthi amudhan et al 2012 carbapenem is a beta lactam antibiotic with a broad antimicrobial spectrum and administered as a last resort for treating drug resistant bacterial infections however the number of carbapenem resistant bacteria has steadily increased who 2017 and represents a primary concern in drinking water blaimp genes were rarely detected along both dwtps however blavim was detected along the dune based dwtp and in the effluent after gac treatment of the reservoir based dwtp figure s4 the taxonomic annotation of the contigs containing blavim genes revealed their potential co localization with multiple plasmids affiliating with sphingobium in the dune based dwtp and with sphingobium plant pathogen and pseudomonas in the reservoir based dwtp after gac filtration the carbapenem resistant pseudomonas is accounted by who within the list of critical priority pathogens for which new antibiotics are required tacconelli and magrini 2017 colistin resistance genes such as mcr1 variants were also highly abundant in both the dune based and the reservoir based dwtps however this is not unique to chlorine free dwtps as multiple last resort args have also been identified in conventional dwtp with chlorine use as well as in tap water dias et al 2020 importantly the mcr1 gene load decreased significantly along the water treatment trains and neither co localized with any mge nor affiliated with any pathogenic bacteria further research should underpin the regrowth capacity of such pathogens in chlorine free dwtp effluents 5 conclusions in this work we characterized for the very first time the abundance and dynamics of microbial communities antibiotic resistance genes args and mobile genetic elements mges across the treatment trains of two chlorine free drinking water treatment plants the in depth analysis of the metagenomes and resistomes led to the following main conclusions 1 chlorine free dwtps do not select for antibiotic resistant bacteria as supported by the linear correlated between args and mges and the 16s rrna gene concentrations 2 the measured reduction in args concentration by ca 2 5 log gene copies ml 1 in both chlorine free dwtps is comparable to the highest removals reported so far for chlorine amended dwtps 3 water storage systems alone reduced the abundance of the 16s rrna gene args and mges by ca 1 6 log gene copies ml 1 and dune infiltration achieved the highest removal 4 despite a ca 2 5 log 16s rrna gene copies ml 1 reduction the effluent microbial diversity increased likely due to the seeding from the biofilms actively growing in the rapid and slow sand filters and the granular activated carbon 5 despite the overall arg decrease in the dwtp disinfection slow sand filtration and uv radiation internally increased the concentration of args mges and 16s rrna genes by ca 0 5 log gene copies ml 1 yet with no impact on overall reduction overall our findings confirm the effectiveness of chlorine free dwtps in providing safe drinking water and reducing the load of antibiotic resistance determinants offering the water authorities the possibility to establish centralized risk management around these specific treatment steps data availability metagenome sequencing data were

14906,the ecological state of receiving water bodies can be significantly influenced by organic micropollutants that are emitted via stormwater runoff reported efforts to quantify the emission of micropollutants mainly focus on sampling at combined sewer overflows and storm sewer outfalls which can be challenging an alternative method called fingerprinting was developed and tested in this study the fingerprinting method utilizes wastewater treatment plant wwtp influent samples and derives the proportion of stormwater in a sample this is achieved by comparing the wet weather vs dry weather concentrations of substances tracers which are present only in wastewater it is then possible to estimate the concentration of organic micropollutants in stormwater runoff from measurements in the influent of a wwtp based on a mass balance in this research the fingerprinting method was applied in influent samples obtained in five wwtps in the netherlands in total 28 dwf and 22 wwf samples were used the chosen tracers were ibuprofen 2 hydroxyibuprofen naproxen and diclofenac subsequently the concentration in stormwater runoff of 403 organic micropollutants was estimated via the wwf samples the substances that were present and analyzed included glyphosate and ampa 24 out of 254 pesticides 6 out of 28 organochlorine pesticides 45 out of 63 pharmaceuticals 15 out of 15 pahs 2 of the 7 pcbs and 20 of 33 other substances e g bisphenol a a comparison with findings from other studies suggested that the fingerprinting method yields trustworthy results it was also noted that a representative and stable dry weather flow reference concentration is a strict requirement for the successful application of the proposed method graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pesticides priority substance stormwater micropollutants 1 introduction the ecological quality of receiving water bodies can be negatively affected by organic micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals pesticides and biocides beckers et al 2018 as urban wet weather discharges uwwds are one of the main emission pathways becouze et al 2016 uwwds comprise discharges via the wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent storm sewer outfalls ssos and combined sewer overflows csos hence the relative contribution of emissions via ssos csos and wwtps differs per substance and depends on the removal efficiency at the wwtp the origin of the substance wastewater or stormwater and the characteristics of the sewer systems e g combined or separated launay et al 2013 the water framework directive 2000 60 ec and subsequent directives decisions 2008 105 ec 2013 39 ec enforce the eu countries to improve and protect the aquatic ecology by explicitly referring to specific groups of pollutants and their maximum allowable concentration additionally a new proposal 2022 0345 was published lately by the european commission for an update of the urban wastewater directive 91 271 eec focusing among others on new micropollutants that can be harmful even at very low concentrations and new limit values for micropollutants that require additional treatment consequently exploration of the sources and concentrations of organic micropollutants in ssos and csos should receive significant attention however only sparse relative literature is found probably due to the high sampling and analysis costs monitoring projects aiming at detecting the occurrence of specific micropollutants at uwwds have taken place in france zgheib et al 2010 granger et al 2016 germany launay et al 2016 wicke et al 2016 2021 switzerland burkhardt et al 2007 wittmer et al 2010 denmark birch et al 2011 bollmann et al 2014 sweden bendz et al 2005 and the united states burant et al 2018 masoner et al 2019 results revealed that stormwater can contain a wide range of organic micropollutants and it can be a more dominant source of emission than wwtps for certain substances however the main pollutants may differ per country for example in denmark the pollutant terbutryn paint on exterior of buildings is found bollmann et al 2019 whereas in germany the pollutant carbendazim fungicide in paint on exterior of buildings is abundant wicke et al 2016 consequently there is a need to monitor organic micropollutants in stormwater also in other countries in order to establish effective protection measures the established way to obtain the necessary information on emission routes of micropollutants is to perform measurements at combined sewer overflows and stormwater outfalls e g birch et al 2011 gasperi et al 2012 launey et al 2016 beckers et al 2018 however many organic micropollutants are used infrequently this implies that the catchment discharging to the cso sso should be reasonably large in order to have a fair chance of capturing the pollutants from individual discharges monitoring csos has another drawback as the cso frequency can be very low resulting in very long monitoring periods before any statistically significant results are obtained these challenges can have an enormous impact on the monitoring programs of countries that share such characteristics for instance in the netherlands most of the ssos only serve a small subcatchment of 1 ha on average due to the small gradients of the ground surfaces while the spilling frequency of csos is approximately 4 times per year to overcome the mentioned difficulties of sampling during sso or cso events an alternative approach called fingerprinting has been developed which allows for the use only of wwtp influent performing measurements at a wwtp is advantageous as the necessary sampling equipment is standard available the fingerprinting method was inspired by the findings of launay et al 2016 who demonstrated that the proportion of stormwater in a sample taken at a cso can be determined by calculating the dilution rate based on specific substances hence the fingerprinting method is based on certain tracers which are found only in wastewater and can be used to estimate the concentration of compounds in stormwater runoff via a mass balance the method was deployed at five wwtps in the netherlands aiming at the analysis of a large number 403 of micropollutants the combination of such an extensive analysis with the demonstration of the fingerprinting method is expected to provide the knowledge and the tools for the quantification of micropollutants in stormwater runoff in a cost efficient and technically feasible way 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling locations the samples were collected at the influent of 5 different wwtps in the netherlands the wwtps are located in relatively rural areas each wwtp processes the wastewater that is drained by a combination of combined separated and improved separated the first flush is directed towards the wwtp sewer systems the main characteristics of the wwtps sewer systems and catchments are given in table 1 2 2 sampling procedure and chemical analysis the first step of this study was to select the appropriate tracers that can be used in order to determine the proportion of stormwater in a sample taken at the influent of a wwtp during a rain event a substance has to meet certain requirements so as to qualify as a tracer in terms of physicochemical properties it should be inert and demonstrate no adsorption to organic matter in terms of operational characteristics it should have a temporally constant load no weekly profile be used by a large proportion of population have no occurrence in runoff and be detected during both dry weather flow dwf and wet weather flow wwf in concentration levels that exceed the level of quantification loq ibuprofen and its breakdown product 2 hydroxyibuprofen diclofenac and naproxen are considered to meet all the mentioned requirements according to the findings of launay et al 2016 the concentrations of all the analyzed substances during dwf including the selected tracers had already been measured during a preceding dwf monitoring campaign see schuman et al 2019 for each wwtp five to six dwf samples of the influent were available on the basis of 48 h flow proportional sampling with an autosampler leading to a total of 28 dwf samples concerning the wwf samples a protocol was developed in order to ensure that the analysis is performed on samples with a sufficient mixture of wastewater and stormwater sampling was scheduled based on weather forecasts one day in advance that predicted high chances of rainfall that would lead to significant runoff analysis followed a two step procedure first an analysis was based on bod cod nitrogen ammonia and ammonium phosphorous and suspended solids if the results provided sufficient evidence of significant dilution i e high proportion of rain in the wwf sample the expensive second step was conducted to analyze the concentration of organic compounds 24 h flow proportional samples were taken via an autosampler at the wwtps during storm events in the summer of 2018 may september and 2019 june the specific sampling periods were selected in order to gain insight into the contribution of pesticides two additional wwf samples were taken during events in the winter of 2018 2019 to serve as control measurements for a period where pesticides are likely absent in the runoff in total 35 wwf samples were collected nonetheless only 22 samples were finally used in the analysis mainly due to inconsistent primary results further details are given in section 3 2 the complete analysis package for approved samples consisted of 403 substances including glyphosate amino methyl phosphonic acid ampa glyfosinate 254 pesticides 28 organochlorine pesticides 7 polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs 15 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs 33 other substances e g bisphenol a and triclosan and 63 pharmaceuticals an additional package of 32 heavy metals was analyzed in order to only test the efficiency of the method also to inorganic substances therefore the effect of heavy metals on water quality is not discussed an overview of the applied analysis per substance is given in the supplementary material 2 3 estimation of the concentration of micropollutants in stormwater 2 3 1 the kaplan meier method following the chemical analysis the data analysis had two objectives i determining the number of observations above the loq which provided insight into the presence of substances and ii determining the mean concentration per substance for the obtained samples the latter involves the challenges when chemical analysis yields concentrations lower than the loq and that the loq may vary depending on the different techniques patents applied to make the estimation feasible e g dilution of the sample this implies that common handling methods such as substituting values below loq with zero stein et al 2006 are not applicable in this study an alternative method was utilized the kaplan meier method kaplan and meier 1958 this method was originally developed for the analysis of survival rates as a function of time survival functions but has also proven useful to compute summary statistics when some observations are below the loq helsel 2010 the advantages of using the kaplan meier method are that the underlying distribution function of concentrations does not need to be known and that it considers all measured concentrations i e both above and below the loq the only precondition for applying the kaplan meier method is that at least two measured concentrations are above the loq the kaplan meier method is applied in steps initially the measured concentrations c i of a substance are sorted from higher to lower including values loq the following statistical term is then defined for every concentration 1 f 1 d n where d is the number of times a unique concentration has been measured above loq and n is the number of times a substance has been measured with this unique or lower concentration subsequently the cumulative distribution function cdf is estimated for every unique concentration based on the following equation 2 c d f i c d f i 1 f i 1 for i 1 and c d f i 1 for i 1 the mean concentration of a substance x adjusted for observations below loq is given by the area under the curve of the cdf with respect to unique concentrations this relation is given in the following formula 3 c x i 1 n c i c d f i c d f i 1 where n is the number of unique concentrations 2 3 2 the fingerprinting method the fingerprinting method was applied in two steps i finding the proportion of stormwater in each sample ii using a mass balance to estimate the concentration of every targeted substance in stormwater the proportion of stormwater per tracer p r a i n was calculated in each sample for every wwf event at each wwtp based on the degree of dilution of each tracer 4 p r a i n 1 c t w w f c t d w f where c t w w f is the concentration of every tracer in each wwf sample and c t d w f is the mean concentration of every tracer in the dwf samples estimated via the kaplan meier method for the second part of the method the proportion of rain per wwf sample was considered to be the mean of the p r a i n values averaged over the four used tracers in order to compensate for any random variability of the dwf background reference c t d w f of each tracer the concentration per substance in stormwater c x s t o r m w a t e r was then estimated in each wwf sample on the basis of a mass balance 5 c x s t o r m w a t e r c x w w f 1 p r a i n c x d w f p r a i n where c x w w f is the concentration of substance x in the considered sample p r a i n is the proportion of rain in each wwf sample eq 4 averaged over the selected tracers and c x d w f is the mean concentration of substance x in dwf estimated via the kaplan meier method eventually the concentration of a substance in stormwater was estimated by applying the kaplan meier method on the determined c x s t o r m w a t e r values per substance 3 results 3 1 reference concentrations of the fingerprints table 2 shows results regarding the dwf samples including the basic parameters and the mean concentrations of the selected tracers the characterization of wastewater proved indeed to be more sensitive to the tracers than the basic parameters since the deviations between the drug concentrations of the wwtps are clearer the concentrations of drugs were highest at the wwtp of heino which is the wwtp with the relatively largest share of domestic wastewater 77 the measured values of the tracers are normalized according to the ibuprofen concentration table 2 in parenthesis in order to track the relative contribution of the tracers in the wastewater received by every wwtp the results revealed that the ratio between the various pharmaceuticals does not differ much per wwtp comparing with respective ratios from german measurements launay et al 2016 the ratios of the current study prove to be very different an obvious explanation is the different policy of prescribing painkillers between the netherlands and germany 3 2 estimated proportion of stormwater fig 1 shows the results of the estimated proportion of stormwater for the wwtp of raalte after implementation of eq 5 and considering the measured background concentrations of the tracers table 2 the degree of dilution proved to be very consistent for the majority of the rain events which means that the proportion of stormwater can be determined with great certainty in the event of the 9th of august the variability is higher mainly due to a relatively lower value of diclofenac but the proportion of stormwater can still be determined within a reasonable margin further it is clear that no real share of stormwater can be determined during the storm on the 6th of september this was already apparent based on the results of the standard parameters and the laboratory was informed not to perform the full analysis on organic micropollutants however due to internal communication issues the samples have been analyzed in full additional analysis showed that on that date the predicted precipitation had hardly fallen and the sample therefore simply contained hardly any stormwater the observed variation on that date can be attributed to the variability in the mean dwf concentration of the tracers similar results were found in measurements at all wwtps on the 6th of september results for the rest of the wwtps are presented in tables s1 s5 supplementary material in total 33 samples were fully analyzed the results of fingerprinting proved inconsistent for eight samples due to low precipitation on the 31st may and 6th september additionally a minimum threshold 25 for the calculated proportion of stormwater was maintained as the uncertainty of estimated concentrations increases rapidly for lower values see eq s1 in supplementary material this roughly corresponded to storm events with less than 0 5 mm per day precipitation fig s1 a g in supplementary material consequently three more samples were discarded resulting in 22 useful wwf samples table 3 gives an overview of the storm events that were sampled indicating the events that were discarded and events that were used for further application of the fingerprinting method 3 3 detected micropollutants and their estimated concentration in stormwater an analysis was initially performed to identify the present micropollutants based on the available samples 28 dwf and 22 wwf the number of substances found in any of the wwf samples were glyphosate ampa from the set of glyphosate ampa glyphosate 24 out of 254 pesticides 6 out of 28 organochlorine pesticides 45 out of 63 pharmaceuticals 15 out of 15 pahs 2 of the 7 pcbs and 20 of the 33 other substances fig 2 gives the detection frequency of selected substances that were found per substance group tables s6 s12 in supplementary material provide an overview of the detection frequency of all substances found in both dwf and wwf samples furthermore the concentrations of micropollutants in stormwater runoff have been calculated using the fingerprinting method as described in section 2 3 2 by considering the estimated proportion of stormwater in each sample based on the mean concentrations of the tracers tables s1 s5 and applying eq 5 the concentration of each analyzed substance in stormwater runoff was estimated for substances that also occur in dwf it was noted that eq 5 yields a negative concentration in stormwater runoff if the concentration in the sample is higher than in the dwf this issue occurs partly because the dwf concentration for such substances is not constant and partly because some substances including x ray contrast agents exist only incidentally in high concentrations in samples taken during a storm event in this study if a negative concentration was calculated it was replaced by zero for substances with concentrations lower than the loq the kaplan meier method was used for the estimation of the mean concentration fig 3 presents the mean concentrations of several organic micropollutants in both dwf and stormwater runoff tables s6 s12 show the mean concentrations for all detected substances along with their respective loq values 3 3 1 glyphosate ampa glyphosate a herbicide was found in 12 wwf samples of which 11 were taken in the summer and in 3 dwf samples table s6 ampa a degradation product of glyphosate was traced in 8 wwf samples 6 in summer and 3 times in dwf samples this trend corresponds well with the use of glyphosate since herbicides are used during the growing season to control weeds on paved surfaces fig 3 presents the estimated concentrations of glyphosate and ampa via the fingerprinting method the estimated concentration of glyphosate in stormwater was 4 7 µg l almost twice the mean concentration found in the dwf samples this implies that stormwater runoff is an important emission route for glyphosate concentrations of the same order of magnitude have been found in another study in the netherlands withagen et al 2004 as well as in studies in belgium tang et al 2015 france botta et al 2009 switzerland hanke et al 2010 and the uk ramwell et al 2014 although the dwf concentration of ampa was similar to that of glyphosate the estimated stormwater concentration was 0 49 µg l similar patterns were also observed in botta et al 2009 ramwell et al 2014 a possible reason could be that the conditions in the urban environment do not favor the degradation to ampa therefore the lower concentration is the result of dilution due to stormwater 3 3 2 pesticides the most commonly encountered pesticides were found in both dwf and wwf samples fig 2 such substances are fipronil insecticide biocide against fleas mites and ticks phthalimide component of fungicides deet insect repellent and permethrin insecticide against mosquitoes ticks and woodworm this means that many of these substances are at least partly released via the wastewater emission route 14 of the analyzed substances seem to be released only via the stormwater route and only at the beginning of the growing season may june including diuron pesticide against weed and desethylterbutylazine herbicide in agriculture this pattern corresponds to agricultural use and agrees with international literature launay et al 2016 wittmer et al 2010 which shows that agricultural pesticides are discharged via stormwater sewers some substances such as fipronil are found in both summer and winter while others e g permethrin are mainly found in summer fig 3 provides an overview of the estimated concentrations for the pesticides found deet is the pesticide with a higher concentration in stormwater 6 2 µg l implying that the stormwater pathway should receive more attention for this substance fipronil and permethrin were found predominantly in dwf since the partition coefficient logkow is quite high for both substances 4 0 and 4 67 respectively it is quite possible that the calculated concentration in stormwater is caused by the contribution of the sediment and biofilm in the sewer it should be stressed that micropollutants which adsorb to organic material in the sewer may be released during a storm event hajj mohamad et al 2014 the contribution of organic material from the combined sewer that is released during a storm can vary in a range between 20 and 80 schilperoort et al 2012 since this share cannot be determined retrospectively the results indicate the substances for which the sewer may have had an influence via the so called in sewer stocks further phthalimide was found in both dwf and wwf samples but in higher concentrations in stormwater 0 48 µg l imidacloprid has only been detected in 3 wwf samples and on average occurs in low concentrations mecoprop p root repellent in roofing material has only been measured a few times but the estimated stormwater concentration 0 74 µg l is well above the loq 0 25 µg l simazine a priority substance was also estimated at a concentration 0 07 µg l well above the loq 0 04 µg l 3 3 3 organochlorine pesticides six organochlorine pesticides were found out of the 28 examined the most detected substance in the wwf samples was lindane which used to be a widely used pesticide in agriculture but currently is used in products against scabies and head lice lindane and 4 4 dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene degradation product of insecticides were found at similar rates in both dwf and wwf other substances such as pentachlorobenzene fire retardant and hexachlorobenzene fungicide were only found in wwf samples taken during summer table s8 gives a detailed overview of the detected organochlorine pesticides three of these were found only once or twice which is insufficient to calculate an average concentration therefore fig 3 contains the calculated concentrations for only three substances lindane was found in high concentrations in dwf 0 004 µg l and at significantly lower concentrations in stormwater 0 001 µg l stormwater runoff is clearly not an emission route of lindane based on a logkow of 3 8 the concentration in the wwf samples could be influenced by the sewer stocks this could also be the result of variation in the background concentration in dwf 3 3 4 polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs two of the 7 pcbs examined pcb138 and pcb153 were regularly found in wwf samples and only during summer these were found only once in dwf samples fig 2 the detected pcbs have been used in the past as an insulating agent and currently are used as coolants and hydraulic fluid table s9 indicates that the estimated stormwater concentrations are in the order of magnitude of the loq 0 001 µg l it is likely that both substances have been released after historical use zgheib et al 2012 and wicke et al 2021 found all seven of the investigated pcbs in their wwf samples in france and germany respectively while pcb 138 and pcb 153 were the most found pcbs additionally the mean estimated concentration in zgheib et al 2012 was considerable higher for both congeners 0 048 µg l 3 3 5 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs pahs have been detected in all wwf samples over the year and also in most of the dwf samples pahs are mainly released during the combustion of organic material and fossil fuels and are therefore ubiquitous in the environment the presence of pahs in wwf and dwf samples is therefore in line with expectations phenanthrene fluoranthene and pyrene are hydrocarbons that were found in all analyzed samples fig 2 the estimated concentrations via the fingerprinting method are within the ranges found in other studies göbel et al 2007 birch et al 2011 3 3 6 other substances most of the samples included other substances such as two variants of benzotriazole pharmaceutical and cleaning agent 2 ethylhexyl 4 methoxycinnamate uv filter cosmetics hhcb fragrance and trichloropropyl phosphate flame retardant other substances were found mainly in dwf samples but with occurrence also in the wwf samples such as butylhydroxytoluene antioxidant chloroxylenol bactericidal and fungicidal agent tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate plasticizer with flame retardant properties triclosan cosmetic products antibacterial and antifungal agent and triisobutyl phosphate plasticizer and solvent the industrial chemical bisphenol a used in food packaging and thermal paper has been detected a limited number of times mostly in dwf samples once in a winter wwf sample and five times in dwf samples after applying the fingerprinting method the estimated concentrations in stormwater are for most of these substances lower than in the dwf samples and are most likely affected by the variability in the dwf reference concentration c t d w f the exceptions are the substances trichloropropyl phosphate and triisobutyl phosphate the estimated stormwater concentration of these substances is at least at the same level with the average concentration in dwf indicating that the route via stormwater runoff can be considered important given the expected use of the substances e g flame retardants and plasticizers it is probable that they are released via the stormwater route bisphenol a was found in the dwf samples at an average concentration of 7 37 µg l while it was found only once in the wwf samples this corresponds well to another study in the netherlands vethaak et al 2002 in which bisphenol a was found in 2 out of 5 stormwater sample at a concentration of 0 06 µg l research in germany wicke et al 2016 shows comparable values 0 09 µg l while research in france gasperi et al 2014 demonstrates an order of magnitude higher concentrations 0 6 µg l comparing these values is challenging as a different loq is established depending on the lab method used it is obvious nonetheless that dwf is the dominant source for this substance and that the contribution of stormwater runoff is minimal nonetheless bisphenol a was found in stormwater in the usa yielding concentrations between 0 0019 and 0 158 μg l boyd et al 2004 3 3 7 pharmaceuticals several pharmaceutical substances have been found in many samples irrespectively of the type of influent dwf wwf and season summer winter 31 substances are present in at least 80 of the samples which confirms that pharmaceuticals are ubiquitous in the influent of wwtps some of the substances that were frequently detected are 2 hydroxyibuprofen diclofenac naproxen acetyl sulfamethoxazole atenolol carbamazepine gabapentin gemfibrozil levetiracetam iosartan metformin and paracetamol the whole range of detected pharmaceuticals is presented in table s12 table s12 also shows the high magnitudes of the estimated concentrations for iomeprol ioxitalamic acid and iopromide these substances are x ray contrast media which are known to be found in the influent occasionally their presence depends on the days on which such medical examinations are conducted in hospitals and on the coincidence that such patients live in the studied catchment area therefore the dwf concentration for these substances is not stable resulting in overestimated concentrations in the stormwater runoff in the case of clarithromycin lidocaine and candesartan the estimated stormwater concentrations are similar to the dwf unstable dwf reference measurements seem to be again the obvious cause of such observed irregularities 4 discussion 4 1 impact of detected substances on water quality in this section the emphasis lies on priority substances according to directive 2008 105 ec table 4 shows the substances that were found to be above the annual average concentration aa eqs or maximum acceptable concentration mac eqs six out of seven substances in table 4 belong to the pahs group indicating that restricting the amount of pahs that are driven to receiving surface waters is essential for preserving high water quality especially benzo a pyrene demonstrated a concentration also higher than the mac eqs limit pentachlorobenzene an organochlorine pesticide is a priority substance that was not released via dwf but with a significant concentration in stormwater runoff above the aa eqs additionally except for fluoranthene all the substances in table 4 are considered as hazardous substances 2013 39 eu anthracene dieldrin diuron hexachlorobenzene naphthalene and simazine are detected substances with concentrations lower than the respective eqs values with anthracene and hexachlorobenzene also being marked as hazardous priority substances glyphosate and mecoprop demonstrated concentrations well above their loqs while they are defined as substances subject to review for possible identification as priority substances 2008 105 ec furthermore the detected substances diclofenac ciprofloxacin oxadiazon and methiocarb are in the watch list of substances 2015 495 eu 2018 840 eu it is evident that the number and type of present substances have an impact on the ecology and biodiversity of the receiving water bodies in an effort to estimate the ecological risks of these substances the open access model of multi substance potentially affected fraction mspaf was used www sleutelfactortoxiciteit nl the mspaf of species expresses the mixture toxic pressure calculated with a mixed model using a sequence of concentration addition for substances with same toxic mode of action tmoa and response additivity for substances with dissimilar tmoa the model is explained in detail in de zwart and posthuma 2005 in the current study the default chemical properties were used as given in de zwart 2002 the mspaf for the present organic micropollutants in stormwater runoff was estimated to be 3 9 according to the dutch guidelines posthuma et al 2016 this value implies that the detected substances demonstrate a toxic impact but at a limited extent the substances with a determining effect on the outcome were benzo ghi perylene permethrin diazinon and benzo b fluoranthene nonetheless further research is necessary to confirm whether the calculated concentration in stormwater runoff of permethrin an insecticide was an artefact of the fingerprinting method or whether this substance was actually released via stormwater 4 2 evaluation of the fingerprinting method performance assessment of the fingerprinting method is achieved via a comparison with results from other studies which include the analysis of several micropollutant groups at the outlet of storm sewer outfalls with conventional techniques lc ms gc ms the comparison is depicted in fig 4 irrespectively of the analyzed micropollutant group the fingerprinting method yields results which are in line with the findings of other researchers especially in the case of pahs group which is of great interest for directives fingerprinting seems to provide similar results promising results are also found by estimating the concentration of heavy metals in stormwater with the fingerprinting method which are used here only as an additional comparison reference furthermore ibuprofen diclofenac 2 hydroibuprofen and naproxen were used as fingerprints to determine the proportion of stormwater in the wwf samples these substances were chosen because they are not released via the stormwater route and do occur in high concentrations in the wwtp influent during both wwf and dwf it would be expected that the estimated concentrations in stormwater of these substances would be negligible ideally equal to zero however a noticeable deviation from zero was observed fig 3 in order to explore the possible reasons for this deviation the theoretical framework of the uncertainty analysis on the fingerprinting method is given in the supplementary material based on this analysis two main sources of uncertainty are identified i the measuring error of the applied analytical methods and ii the standard deviation of the dwf reference the second source is considered to be the major source of the overall uncertainty as it affects both the estimation of rain proportion in a sample and the stormwater concentration of the targeted substance in particular eq s1 indicates that the uncertainty becomes considerably lower as the proportion of rain in the sample increases additionally the variability in the dwf concentrations stems from the inconsistent or occasional use of substances in this study the practical application of the uncertainty analysis would require more measurements in order to estimate the individual uncertainties of the parameters repeated measurements of the same samples could reveal the measuring error per substance in the applied analytical methods weighted averaging based on minimizing the uncertainty of the result could then be used to further improve estimates the analysis of additional dwf samples could also lead to a more consistent dwf reference to which the fingerprinting method seems to be highly sensitive moreover the fingerprinting method is only dedicated to estimating the concentration of micropollutants in stormwater runoff since sampling occurs only at the influent of wwtps it is not possible to differentiate among specific emission routes e g csos and ssos and the actual micropollutant load on the receiving water bodies may differ during significant precipitation events sewer overflows could be triggered in combined sewer systems leading to the discharge of untreated sewage which contains micropollutants expected to be present only in the dwf e g pharmaceuticals moreover illicit connections and cross flows are known issues in separate systems which constitute potential source for micropollutants emitted via stormwater outlets therefore exploring the actual emission routes and pressure on the aquatic environment for a specific location due to overflows prior to the wwtp requires complementary sampling also at other sewer outlets furthermore although the emission routes cannot be explored the fingerprinting method remains robust for estimating the micropollutants concentrations in stormwater even if the function of ssos and csos leads to a substantial amount of storm and wastewater being discharged before the wwtp this is achieved by taking into account the dilution rate in every sample which is expressed via the proportion of rain in the sample eq 5 as a result the considered mass balance can still quantify the concentration of substances given that even a small fraction reaches the wwtp 5 conclusions analysis of 403 micropollutants in the influent of five wastewater treatment plants wwtps revealed the concentrations in stormwater runoff of the detected substances based on a new method called fingerprinting the findings of this study show that the proposed fingerprinting method yields meaningful results in most cases which are in agreement with monitoring results from international literature even with just 5 dwf dry weather flow and 5 7 wwf wet weather flow sampling days it was possible to estimate the proportion of stormwater in the sample on the basis of the selected tracers ibuprofen its breakdown product 2 hydroxyibuprofen naproxen and diclofenac the fingerprinting method led to inconsistent results concerning rain events with a low proportion of stormwater in the samples 25 which is equivalent to a storm event with less than 0 5 mm per day at such low proportions of stormwater the errors in the estimation of the mean wwf concentrations became dominant it was noticed that a representative and stable dwf background concentration is a strict requirement for the successful application of the fingerprinting method the chemical analysis offered an overview of the present organic micropollutants in stormwater runoff all 15 examined polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs were found of the 63 pharmaceuticals investigated 45 were traced while 24 of the 254 examined organic pesticides were found at least once in addition 6 of the 28 examined organochlorine pesticides and 2 of the 7 investigated polychlorinated biphenyl pcbs were detected application of the fingerprinting method revealed substances with a significant concentration in stormwater runoff the seasonal pattern of glyphosate was clear with abundance in stormwater deet was released via both wastewater and stormwater runoff in significant concentrations phthalimide was frequently found in stormwater well above the limit of quantification mecoprop was also found in high concentration in stormwater the other detected pesticides can be divided into 2 groups the first group includes agricultural pesticides such as the regularly encountered herbicides terbuthylazine dimethenamid p chlorpropham and s metolachlor which were mainly found at the beginning of the growing season in addition there are about 20 substances that were found only once or a few times the second group concerns insecticides such as imidacloprid fipronil permethrin and lindane which were frequently found in dwf and not significantly in stormwater runoff pahs were found in higher concentrations in stormwater runoff while the concentrations for specific pahs benzo a pyrene benzo b fluoranthene benzo ghi perylene indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene and fluoranthene were above the environmental quality requirements aa eqs mac eqs for priority substances other examined substances e g 1 2 3 benzotriazole were frequently found but only three of them trichloropropyl phosphate pentachlorobenzene and triisobutyl phosphate with significant concentration in stormwater in general the concentrations of substances in stormwater vary for instance among measured pesticides from agricultural use and pesticides related to construction materials typically found in different prevalence in different countries knowing the concentrations of micropollutants in stormwater is an important prerequisite when developing storm water policies the fingerprinting method could be a useful tool in this effort with significant advantages over sampling at stormwater outlets where sampling is difficult and or the catchment area is quite small nonetheless sampling at such outlets is still required

14906,the ecological state of receiving water bodies can be significantly influenced by organic micropollutants that are emitted via stormwater runoff reported efforts to quantify the emission of micropollutants mainly focus on sampling at combined sewer overflows and storm sewer outfalls which can be challenging an alternative method called fingerprinting was developed and tested in this study the fingerprinting method utilizes wastewater treatment plant wwtp influent samples and derives the proportion of stormwater in a sample this is achieved by comparing the wet weather vs dry weather concentrations of substances tracers which are present only in wastewater it is then possible to estimate the concentration of organic micropollutants in stormwater runoff from measurements in the influent of a wwtp based on a mass balance in this research the fingerprinting method was applied in influent samples obtained in five wwtps in the netherlands in total 28 dwf and 22 wwf samples were used the chosen tracers were ibuprofen 2 hydroxyibuprofen naproxen and diclofenac subsequently the concentration in stormwater runoff of 403 organic micropollutants was estimated via the wwf samples the substances that were present and analyzed included glyphosate and ampa 24 out of 254 pesticides 6 out of 28 organochlorine pesticides 45 out of 63 pharmaceuticals 15 out of 15 pahs 2 of the 7 pcbs and 20 of 33 other substances e g bisphenol a a comparison with findings from other studies suggested that the fingerprinting method yields trustworthy results it was also noted that a representative and stable dry weather flow reference concentration is a strict requirement for the successful application of the proposed method graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pesticides priority substance stormwater micropollutants 1 introduction the ecological quality of receiving water bodies can be negatively affected by organic micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals pesticides and biocides beckers et al 2018 as urban wet weather discharges uwwds are one of the main emission pathways becouze et al 2016 uwwds comprise discharges via the wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent storm sewer outfalls ssos and combined sewer overflows csos hence the relative contribution of emissions via ssos csos and wwtps differs per substance and depends on the removal efficiency at the wwtp the origin of the substance wastewater or stormwater and the characteristics of the sewer systems e g combined or separated launay et al 2013 the water framework directive 2000 60 ec and subsequent directives decisions 2008 105 ec 2013 39 ec enforce the eu countries to improve and protect the aquatic ecology by explicitly referring to specific groups of pollutants and their maximum allowable concentration additionally a new proposal 2022 0345 was published lately by the european commission for an update of the urban wastewater directive 91 271 eec focusing among others on new micropollutants that can be harmful even at very low concentrations and new limit values for micropollutants that require additional treatment consequently exploration of the sources and concentrations of organic micropollutants in ssos and csos should receive significant attention however only sparse relative literature is found probably due to the high sampling and analysis costs monitoring projects aiming at detecting the occurrence of specific micropollutants at uwwds have taken place in france zgheib et al 2010 granger et al 2016 germany launay et al 2016 wicke et al 2016 2021 switzerland burkhardt et al 2007 wittmer et al 2010 denmark birch et al 2011 bollmann et al 2014 sweden bendz et al 2005 and the united states burant et al 2018 masoner et al 2019 results revealed that stormwater can contain a wide range of organic micropollutants and it can be a more dominant source of emission than wwtps for certain substances however the main pollutants may differ per country for example in denmark the pollutant terbutryn paint on exterior of buildings is found bollmann et al 2019 whereas in germany the pollutant carbendazim fungicide in paint on exterior of buildings is abundant wicke et al 2016 consequently there is a need to monitor organic micropollutants in stormwater also in other countries in order to establish effective protection measures the established way to obtain the necessary information on emission routes of micropollutants is to perform measurements at combined sewer overflows and stormwater outfalls e g birch et al 2011 gasperi et al 2012 launey et al 2016 beckers et al 2018 however many organic micropollutants are used infrequently this implies that the catchment discharging to the cso sso should be reasonably large in order to have a fair chance of capturing the pollutants from individual discharges monitoring csos has another drawback as the cso frequency can be very low resulting in very long monitoring periods before any statistically significant results are obtained these challenges can have an enormous impact on the monitoring programs of countries that share such characteristics for instance in the netherlands most of the ssos only serve a small subcatchment of 1 ha on average due to the small gradients of the ground surfaces while the spilling frequency of csos is approximately 4 times per year to overcome the mentioned difficulties of sampling during sso or cso events an alternative approach called fingerprinting has been developed which allows for the use only of wwtp influent performing measurements at a wwtp is advantageous as the necessary sampling equipment is standard available the fingerprinting method was inspired by the findings of launay et al 2016 who demonstrated that the proportion of stormwater in a sample taken at a cso can be determined by calculating the dilution rate based on specific substances hence the fingerprinting method is based on certain tracers which are found only in wastewater and can be used to estimate the concentration of compounds in stormwater runoff via a mass balance the method was deployed at five wwtps in the netherlands aiming at the analysis of a large number 403 of micropollutants the combination of such an extensive analysis with the demonstration of the fingerprinting method is expected to provide the knowledge and the tools for the quantification of micropollutants in stormwater runoff in a cost efficient and technically feasible way 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling locations the samples were collected at the influent of 5 different wwtps in the netherlands the wwtps are located in relatively rural areas each wwtp processes the wastewater that is drained by a combination of combined separated and improved separated the first flush is directed towards the wwtp sewer systems the main characteristics of the wwtps sewer systems and catchments are given in table 1 2 2 sampling procedure and chemical analysis the first step of this study was to select the appropriate tracers that can be used in order to determine the proportion of stormwater in a sample taken at the influent of a wwtp during a rain event a substance has to meet certain requirements so as to qualify as a tracer in terms of physicochemical properties it should be inert and demonstrate no adsorption to organic matter in terms of operational characteristics it should have a temporally constant load no weekly profile be used by a large proportion of population have no occurrence in runoff and be detected during both dry weather flow dwf and wet weather flow wwf in concentration levels that exceed the level of quantification loq ibuprofen and its breakdown product 2 hydroxyibuprofen diclofenac and naproxen are considered to meet all the mentioned requirements according to the findings of launay et al 2016 the concentrations of all the analyzed substances during dwf including the selected tracers had already been measured during a preceding dwf monitoring campaign see schuman et al 2019 for each wwtp five to six dwf samples of the influent were available on the basis of 48 h flow proportional sampling with an autosampler leading to a total of 28 dwf samples concerning the wwf samples a protocol was developed in order to ensure that the analysis is performed on samples with a sufficient mixture of wastewater and stormwater sampling was scheduled based on weather forecasts one day in advance that predicted high chances of rainfall that would lead to significant runoff analysis followed a two step procedure first an analysis was based on bod cod nitrogen ammonia and ammonium phosphorous and suspended solids if the results provided sufficient evidence of significant dilution i e high proportion of rain in the wwf sample the expensive second step was conducted to analyze the concentration of organic compounds 24 h flow proportional samples were taken via an autosampler at the wwtps during storm events in the summer of 2018 may september and 2019 june the specific sampling periods were selected in order to gain insight into the contribution of pesticides two additional wwf samples were taken during events in the winter of 2018 2019 to serve as control measurements for a period where pesticides are likely absent in the runoff in total 35 wwf samples were collected nonetheless only 22 samples were finally used in the analysis mainly due to inconsistent primary results further details are given in section 3 2 the complete analysis package for approved samples consisted of 403 substances including glyphosate amino methyl phosphonic acid ampa glyfosinate 254 pesticides 28 organochlorine pesticides 7 polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs 15 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs 33 other substances e g bisphenol a and triclosan and 63 pharmaceuticals an additional package of 32 heavy metals was analyzed in order to only test the efficiency of the method also to inorganic substances therefore the effect of heavy metals on water quality is not discussed an overview of the applied analysis per substance is given in the supplementary material 2 3 estimation of the concentration of micropollutants in stormwater 2 3 1 the kaplan meier method following the chemical analysis the data analysis had two objectives i determining the number of observations above the loq which provided insight into the presence of substances and ii determining the mean concentration per substance for the obtained samples the latter involves the challenges when chemical analysis yields concentrations lower than the loq and that the loq may vary depending on the different techniques patents applied to make the estimation feasible e g dilution of the sample this implies that common handling methods such as substituting values below loq with zero stein et al 2006 are not applicable in this study an alternative method was utilized the kaplan meier method kaplan and meier 1958 this method was originally developed for the analysis of survival rates as a function of time survival functions but has also proven useful to compute summary statistics when some observations are below the loq helsel 2010 the advantages of using the kaplan meier method are that the underlying distribution function of concentrations does not need to be known and that it considers all measured concentrations i e both above and below the loq the only precondition for applying the kaplan meier method is that at least two measured concentrations are above the loq the kaplan meier method is applied in steps initially the measured concentrations c i of a substance are sorted from higher to lower including values loq the following statistical term is then defined for every concentration 1 f 1 d n where d is the number of times a unique concentration has been measured above loq and n is the number of times a substance has been measured with this unique or lower concentration subsequently the cumulative distribution function cdf is estimated for every unique concentration based on the following equation 2 c d f i c d f i 1 f i 1 for i 1 and c d f i 1 for i 1 the mean concentration of a substance x adjusted for observations below loq is given by the area under the curve of the cdf with respect to unique concentrations this relation is given in the following formula 3 c x i 1 n c i c d f i c d f i 1 where n is the number of unique concentrations 2 3 2 the fingerprinting method the fingerprinting method was applied in two steps i finding the proportion of stormwater in each sample ii using a mass balance to estimate the concentration of every targeted substance in stormwater the proportion of stormwater per tracer p r a i n was calculated in each sample for every wwf event at each wwtp based on the degree of dilution of each tracer 4 p r a i n 1 c t w w f c t d w f where c t w w f is the concentration of every tracer in each wwf sample and c t d w f is the mean concentration of every tracer in the dwf samples estimated via the kaplan meier method for the second part of the method the proportion of rain per wwf sample was considered to be the mean of the p r a i n values averaged over the four used tracers in order to compensate for any random variability of the dwf background reference c t d w f of each tracer the concentration per substance in stormwater c x s t o r m w a t e r was then estimated in each wwf sample on the basis of a mass balance 5 c x s t o r m w a t e r c x w w f 1 p r a i n c x d w f p r a i n where c x w w f is the concentration of substance x in the considered sample p r a i n is the proportion of rain in each wwf sample eq 4 averaged over the selected tracers and c x d w f is the mean concentration of substance x in dwf estimated via the kaplan meier method eventually the concentration of a substance in stormwater was estimated by applying the kaplan meier method on the determined c x s t o r m w a t e r values per substance 3 results 3 1 reference concentrations of the fingerprints table 2 shows results regarding the dwf samples including the basic parameters and the mean concentrations of the selected tracers the characterization of wastewater proved indeed to be more sensitive to the tracers than the basic parameters since the deviations between the drug concentrations of the wwtps are clearer the concentrations of drugs were highest at the wwtp of heino which is the wwtp with the relatively largest share of domestic wastewater 77 the measured values of the tracers are normalized according to the ibuprofen concentration table 2 in parenthesis in order to track the relative contribution of the tracers in the wastewater received by every wwtp the results revealed that the ratio between the various pharmaceuticals does not differ much per wwtp comparing with respective ratios from german measurements launay et al 2016 the ratios of the current study prove to be very different an obvious explanation is the different policy of prescribing painkillers between the netherlands and germany 3 2 estimated proportion of stormwater fig 1 shows the results of the estimated proportion of stormwater for the wwtp of raalte after implementation of eq 5 and considering the measured background concentrations of the tracers table 2 the degree of dilution proved to be very consistent for the majority of the rain events which means that the proportion of stormwater can be determined with great certainty in the event of the 9th of august the variability is higher mainly due to a relatively lower value of diclofenac but the proportion of stormwater can still be determined within a reasonable margin further it is clear that no real share of stormwater can be determined during the storm on the 6th of september this was already apparent based on the results of the standard parameters and the laboratory was informed not to perform the full analysis on organic micropollutants however due to internal communication issues the samples have been analyzed in full additional analysis showed that on that date the predicted precipitation had hardly fallen and the sample therefore simply contained hardly any stormwater the observed variation on that date can be attributed to the variability in the mean dwf concentration of the tracers similar results were found in measurements at all wwtps on the 6th of september results for the rest of the wwtps are presented in tables s1 s5 supplementary material in total 33 samples were fully analyzed the results of fingerprinting proved inconsistent for eight samples due to low precipitation on the 31st may and 6th september additionally a minimum threshold 25 for the calculated proportion of stormwater was maintained as the uncertainty of estimated concentrations increases rapidly for lower values see eq s1 in supplementary material this roughly corresponded to storm events with less than 0 5 mm per day precipitation fig s1 a g in supplementary material consequently three more samples were discarded resulting in 22 useful wwf samples table 3 gives an overview of the storm events that were sampled indicating the events that were discarded and events that were used for further application of the fingerprinting method 3 3 detected micropollutants and their estimated concentration in stormwater an analysis was initially performed to identify the present micropollutants based on the available samples 28 dwf and 22 wwf the number of substances found in any of the wwf samples were glyphosate ampa from the set of glyphosate ampa glyphosate 24 out of 254 pesticides 6 out of 28 organochlorine pesticides 45 out of 63 pharmaceuticals 15 out of 15 pahs 2 of the 7 pcbs and 20 of the 33 other substances fig 2 gives the detection frequency of selected substances that were found per substance group tables s6 s12 in supplementary material provide an overview of the detection frequency of all substances found in both dwf and wwf samples furthermore the concentrations of micropollutants in stormwater runoff have been calculated using the fingerprinting method as described in section 2 3 2 by considering the estimated proportion of stormwater in each sample based on the mean concentrations of the tracers tables s1 s5 and applying eq 5 the concentration of each analyzed substance in stormwater runoff was estimated for substances that also occur in dwf it was noted that eq 5 yields a negative concentration in stormwater runoff if the concentration in the sample is higher than in the dwf this issue occurs partly because the dwf concentration for such substances is not constant and partly because some substances including x ray contrast agents exist only incidentally in high concentrations in samples taken during a storm event in this study if a negative concentration was calculated it was replaced by zero for substances with concentrations lower than the loq the kaplan meier method was used for the estimation of the mean concentration fig 3 presents the mean concentrations of several organic micropollutants in both dwf and stormwater runoff tables s6 s12 show the mean concentrations for all detected substances along with their respective loq values 3 3 1 glyphosate ampa glyphosate a herbicide was found in 12 wwf samples of which 11 were taken in the summer and in 3 dwf samples table s6 ampa a degradation product of glyphosate was traced in 8 wwf samples 6 in summer and 3 times in dwf samples this trend corresponds well with the use of glyphosate since herbicides are used during the growing season to control weeds on paved surfaces fig 3 presents the estimated concentrations of glyphosate and ampa via the fingerprinting method the estimated concentration of glyphosate in stormwater was 4 7 µg l almost twice the mean concentration found in the dwf samples this implies that stormwater runoff is an important emission route for glyphosate concentrations of the same order of magnitude have been found in another study in the netherlands withagen et al 2004 as well as in studies in belgium tang et al 2015 france botta et al 2009 switzerland hanke et al 2010 and the uk ramwell et al 2014 although the dwf concentration of ampa was similar to that of glyphosate the estimated stormwater concentration was 0 49 µg l similar patterns were also observed in botta et al 2009 ramwell et al 2014 a possible reason could be that the conditions in the urban environment do not favor the degradation to ampa therefore the lower concentration is the result of dilution due to stormwater 3 3 2 pesticides the most commonly encountered pesticides were found in both dwf and wwf samples fig 2 such substances are fipronil insecticide biocide against fleas mites and ticks phthalimide component of fungicides deet insect repellent and permethrin insecticide against mosquitoes ticks and woodworm this means that many of these substances are at least partly released via the wastewater emission route 14 of the analyzed substances seem to be released only via the stormwater route and only at the beginning of the growing season may june including diuron pesticide against weed and desethylterbutylazine herbicide in agriculture this pattern corresponds to agricultural use and agrees with international literature launay et al 2016 wittmer et al 2010 which shows that agricultural pesticides are discharged via stormwater sewers some substances such as fipronil are found in both summer and winter while others e g permethrin are mainly found in summer fig 3 provides an overview of the estimated concentrations for the pesticides found deet is the pesticide with a higher concentration in stormwater 6 2 µg l implying that the stormwater pathway should receive more attention for this substance fipronil and permethrin were found predominantly in dwf since the partition coefficient logkow is quite high for both substances 4 0 and 4 67 respectively it is quite possible that the calculated concentration in stormwater is caused by the contribution of the sediment and biofilm in the sewer it should be stressed that micropollutants which adsorb to organic material in the sewer may be released during a storm event hajj mohamad et al 2014 the contribution of organic material from the combined sewer that is released during a storm can vary in a range between 20 and 80 schilperoort et al 2012 since this share cannot be determined retrospectively the results indicate the substances for which the sewer may have had an influence via the so called in sewer stocks further phthalimide was found in both dwf and wwf samples but in higher concentrations in stormwater 0 48 µg l imidacloprid has only been detected in 3 wwf samples and on average occurs in low concentrations mecoprop p root repellent in roofing material has only been measured a few times but the estimated stormwater concentration 0 74 µg l is well above the loq 0 25 µg l simazine a priority substance was also estimated at a concentration 0 07 µg l well above the loq 0 04 µg l 3 3 3 organochlorine pesticides six organochlorine pesticides were found out of the 28 examined the most detected substance in the wwf samples was lindane which used to be a widely used pesticide in agriculture but currently is used in products against scabies and head lice lindane and 4 4 dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene degradation product of insecticides were found at similar rates in both dwf and wwf other substances such as pentachlorobenzene fire retardant and hexachlorobenzene fungicide were only found in wwf samples taken during summer table s8 gives a detailed overview of the detected organochlorine pesticides three of these were found only once or twice which is insufficient to calculate an average concentration therefore fig 3 contains the calculated concentrations for only three substances lindane was found in high concentrations in dwf 0 004 µg l and at significantly lower concentrations in stormwater 0 001 µg l stormwater runoff is clearly not an emission route of lindane based on a logkow of 3 8 the concentration in the wwf samples could be influenced by the sewer stocks this could also be the result of variation in the background concentration in dwf 3 3 4 polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs two of the 7 pcbs examined pcb138 and pcb153 were regularly found in wwf samples and only during summer these were found only once in dwf samples fig 2 the detected pcbs have been used in the past as an insulating agent and currently are used as coolants and hydraulic fluid table s9 indicates that the estimated stormwater concentrations are in the order of magnitude of the loq 0 001 µg l it is likely that both substances have been released after historical use zgheib et al 2012 and wicke et al 2021 found all seven of the investigated pcbs in their wwf samples in france and germany respectively while pcb 138 and pcb 153 were the most found pcbs additionally the mean estimated concentration in zgheib et al 2012 was considerable higher for both congeners 0 048 µg l 3 3 5 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs pahs have been detected in all wwf samples over the year and also in most of the dwf samples pahs are mainly released during the combustion of organic material and fossil fuels and are therefore ubiquitous in the environment the presence of pahs in wwf and dwf samples is therefore in line with expectations phenanthrene fluoranthene and pyrene are hydrocarbons that were found in all analyzed samples fig 2 the estimated concentrations via the fingerprinting method are within the ranges found in other studies göbel et al 2007 birch et al 2011 3 3 6 other substances most of the samples included other substances such as two variants of benzotriazole pharmaceutical and cleaning agent 2 ethylhexyl 4 methoxycinnamate uv filter cosmetics hhcb fragrance and trichloropropyl phosphate flame retardant other substances were found mainly in dwf samples but with occurrence also in the wwf samples such as butylhydroxytoluene antioxidant chloroxylenol bactericidal and fungicidal agent tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate plasticizer with flame retardant properties triclosan cosmetic products antibacterial and antifungal agent and triisobutyl phosphate plasticizer and solvent the industrial chemical bisphenol a used in food packaging and thermal paper has been detected a limited number of times mostly in dwf samples once in a winter wwf sample and five times in dwf samples after applying the fingerprinting method the estimated concentrations in stormwater are for most of these substances lower than in the dwf samples and are most likely affected by the variability in the dwf reference concentration c t d w f the exceptions are the substances trichloropropyl phosphate and triisobutyl phosphate the estimated stormwater concentration of these substances is at least at the same level with the average concentration in dwf indicating that the route via stormwater runoff can be considered important given the expected use of the substances e g flame retardants and plasticizers it is probable that they are released via the stormwater route bisphenol a was found in the dwf samples at an average concentration of 7 37 µg l while it was found only once in the wwf samples this corresponds well to another study in the netherlands vethaak et al 2002 in which bisphenol a was found in 2 out of 5 stormwater sample at a concentration of 0 06 µg l research in germany wicke et al 2016 shows comparable values 0 09 µg l while research in france gasperi et al 2014 demonstrates an order of magnitude higher concentrations 0 6 µg l comparing these values is challenging as a different loq is established depending on the lab method used it is obvious nonetheless that dwf is the dominant source for this substance and that the contribution of stormwater runoff is minimal nonetheless bisphenol a was found in stormwater in the usa yielding concentrations between 0 0019 and 0 158 μg l boyd et al 2004 3 3 7 pharmaceuticals several pharmaceutical substances have been found in many samples irrespectively of the type of influent dwf wwf and season summer winter 31 substances are present in at least 80 of the samples which confirms that pharmaceuticals are ubiquitous in the influent of wwtps some of the substances that were frequently detected are 2 hydroxyibuprofen diclofenac naproxen acetyl sulfamethoxazole atenolol carbamazepine gabapentin gemfibrozil levetiracetam iosartan metformin and paracetamol the whole range of detected pharmaceuticals is presented in table s12 table s12 also shows the high magnitudes of the estimated concentrations for iomeprol ioxitalamic acid and iopromide these substances are x ray contrast media which are known to be found in the influent occasionally their presence depends on the days on which such medical examinations are conducted in hospitals and on the coincidence that such patients live in the studied catchment area therefore the dwf concentration for these substances is not stable resulting in overestimated concentrations in the stormwater runoff in the case of clarithromycin lidocaine and candesartan the estimated stormwater concentrations are similar to the dwf unstable dwf reference measurements seem to be again the obvious cause of such observed irregularities 4 discussion 4 1 impact of detected substances on water quality in this section the emphasis lies on priority substances according to directive 2008 105 ec table 4 shows the substances that were found to be above the annual average concentration aa eqs or maximum acceptable concentration mac eqs six out of seven substances in table 4 belong to the pahs group indicating that restricting the amount of pahs that are driven to receiving surface waters is essential for preserving high water quality especially benzo a pyrene demonstrated a concentration also higher than the mac eqs limit pentachlorobenzene an organochlorine pesticide is a priority substance that was not released via dwf but with a significant concentration in stormwater runoff above the aa eqs additionally except for fluoranthene all the substances in table 4 are considered as hazardous substances 2013 39 eu anthracene dieldrin diuron hexachlorobenzene naphthalene and simazine are detected substances with concentrations lower than the respective eqs values with anthracene and hexachlorobenzene also being marked as hazardous priority substances glyphosate and mecoprop demonstrated concentrations well above their loqs while they are defined as substances subject to review for possible identification as priority substances 2008 105 ec furthermore the detected substances diclofenac ciprofloxacin oxadiazon and methiocarb are in the watch list of substances 2015 495 eu 2018 840 eu it is evident that the number and type of present substances have an impact on the ecology and biodiversity of the receiving water bodies in an effort to estimate the ecological risks of these substances the open access model of multi substance potentially affected fraction mspaf was used www sleutelfactortoxiciteit nl the mspaf of species expresses the mixture toxic pressure calculated with a mixed model using a sequence of concentration addition for substances with same toxic mode of action tmoa and response additivity for substances with dissimilar tmoa the model is explained in detail in de zwart and posthuma 2005 in the current study the default chemical properties were used as given in de zwart 2002 the mspaf for the present organic micropollutants in stormwater runoff was estimated to be 3 9 according to the dutch guidelines posthuma et al 2016 this value implies that the detected substances demonstrate a toxic impact but at a limited extent the substances with a determining effect on the outcome were benzo ghi perylene permethrin diazinon and benzo b fluoranthene nonetheless further research is necessary to confirm whether the calculated concentration in stormwater runoff of permethrin an insecticide was an artefact of the fingerprinting method or whether this substance was actually released via stormwater 4 2 evaluation of the fingerprinting method performance assessment of the fingerprinting method is achieved via a comparison with results from other studies which include the analysis of several micropollutant groups at the outlet of storm sewer outfalls with conventional techniques lc ms gc ms the comparison is depicted in fig 4 irrespectively of the analyzed micropollutant group the fingerprinting method yields results which are in line with the findings of other researchers especially in the case of pahs group which is of great interest for directives fingerprinting seems to provide similar results promising results are also found by estimating the concentration of heavy metals in stormwater with the fingerprinting method which are used here only as an additional comparison reference furthermore ibuprofen diclofenac 2 hydroibuprofen and naproxen were used as fingerprints to determine the proportion of stormwater in the wwf samples these substances were chosen because they are not released via the stormwater route and do occur in high concentrations in the wwtp influent during both wwf and dwf it would be expected that the estimated concentrations in stormwater of these substances would be negligible ideally equal to zero however a noticeable deviation from zero was observed fig 3 in order to explore the possible reasons for this deviation the theoretical framework of the uncertainty analysis on the fingerprinting method is given in the supplementary material based on this analysis two main sources of uncertainty are identified i the measuring error of the applied analytical methods and ii the standard deviation of the dwf reference the second source is considered to be the major source of the overall uncertainty as it affects both the estimation of rain proportion in a sample and the stormwater concentration of the targeted substance in particular eq s1 indicates that the uncertainty becomes considerably lower as the proportion of rain in the sample increases additionally the variability in the dwf concentrations stems from the inconsistent or occasional use of substances in this study the practical application of the uncertainty analysis would require more measurements in order to estimate the individual uncertainties of the parameters repeated measurements of the same samples could reveal the measuring error per substance in the applied analytical methods weighted averaging based on minimizing the uncertainty of the result could then be used to further improve estimates the analysis of additional dwf samples could also lead to a more consistent dwf reference to which the fingerprinting method seems to be highly sensitive moreover the fingerprinting method is only dedicated to estimating the concentration of micropollutants in stormwater runoff since sampling occurs only at the influent of wwtps it is not possible to differentiate among specific emission routes e g csos and ssos and the actual micropollutant load on the receiving water bodies may differ during significant precipitation events sewer overflows could be triggered in combined sewer systems leading to the discharge of untreated sewage which contains micropollutants expected to be present only in the dwf e g pharmaceuticals moreover illicit connections and cross flows are known issues in separate systems which constitute potential source for micropollutants emitted via stormwater outlets therefore exploring the actual emission routes and pressure on the aquatic environment for a specific location due to overflows prior to the wwtp requires complementary sampling also at other sewer outlets furthermore although the emission routes cannot be explored the fingerprinting method remains robust for estimating the micropollutants concentrations in stormwater even if the function of ssos and csos leads to a substantial amount of storm and wastewater being discharged before the wwtp this is achieved by taking into account the dilution rate in every sample which is expressed via the proportion of rain in the sample eq 5 as a result the considered mass balance can still quantify the concentration of substances given that even a small fraction reaches the wwtp 5 conclusions analysis of 403 micropollutants in the influent of five wastewater treatment plants wwtps revealed the concentrations in stormwater runoff of the detected substances based on a new method called fingerprinting the findings of this study show that the proposed fingerprinting method yields meaningful results in most cases which are in agreement with monitoring results from international literature even with just 5 dwf dry weather flow and 5 7 wwf wet weather flow sampling days it was possible to estimate the proportion of stormwater in the sample on the basis of the selected tracers ibuprofen its breakdown product 2 hydroxyibuprofen naproxen and diclofenac the fingerprinting method led to inconsistent results concerning rain events with a low proportion of stormwater in the samples 25 which is equivalent to a storm event with less than 0 5 mm per day at such low proportions of stormwater the errors in the estimation of the mean wwf concentrations became dominant it was noticed that a representative and stable dwf background concentration is a strict requirement for the successful application of the fingerprinting method the chemical analysis offered an overview of the present organic micropollutants in stormwater runoff all 15 examined polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs were found of the 63 pharmaceuticals investigated 45 were traced while 24 of the 254 examined organic pesticides were found at least once in addition 6 of the 28 examined organochlorine pesticides and 2 of the 7 investigated polychlorinated biphenyl pcbs were detected application of the fingerprinting method revealed substances with a significant concentration in stormwater runoff the seasonal pattern of glyphosate was clear with abundance in stormwater deet was released via both wastewater and stormwater runoff in significant concentrations phthalimide was frequently found in stormwater well above the limit of quantification mecoprop was also found in high concentration in stormwater the other detected pesticides can be divided into 2 groups the first group includes agricultural pesticides such as the regularly encountered herbicides terbuthylazine dimethenamid p chlorpropham and s metolachlor which were mainly found at the beginning of the growing season in addition there are about 20 substances that were found only once or a few times the second group concerns insecticides such as imidacloprid fipronil permethrin and lindane which were frequently found in dwf and not significantly in stormwater runoff pahs were found in higher concentrations in stormwater runoff while the concentrations for specific pahs benzo a pyrene benzo b fluoranthene benzo ghi perylene indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene and fluoranthene were above the environmental quality requirements aa eqs mac eqs for priority substances other examined substances e g 1 2 3 benzotriazole were frequently found but only three of them trichloropropyl phosphate pentachlorobenzene and triisobutyl phosphate with significant concentration in stormwater in general the concentrations of substances in stormwater vary for instance among measured pesticides from agricultural use and pesticides related to construction materials typically found in different prevalence in different countries knowing the concentrations of micropollutants in stormwater is an important prerequisite when developing storm water policies the fingerprinting method could be a useful tool in this effort with significant advantages over sampling at stormwater outlets where sampling is difficult and or the catchment area is quite small nonetheless sampling at such outlets is still required

14907,water resource and carbon emission involved in grain production in mainland china are redistributed among provinces as the grain was transported in recent years this study first calculated the water consumption and carbon emission during the growth of grain crops based on the water carbon footprint theory and then used the social equity method to calculate the inter regional grain virtual water and virtual carbon flow finally the regional and national trends in water saving and carbon emission reduction were calculated based on the spatial and temporal differences in grain planting among provinces in terms of virtual water carbon from 2000 to 2017 the amount of the inter provincial grain virtual water flow increased from 717 4 108 m3 to 1472 6 108 m3 heilongjiang and guangdong are the provinces with the largest amount of grain virtual water outflow 670 9 108 m3 and inflow 402 8 108 m3 in 2017 respectively and the total inter provincial grain virtual carbon flow increased from 2362 7 104 t co2e to 12 680 6 104 t co2e grain transport leads to water saving and carbon emission reduction the amount of water saving increased from 25 6 108 m3 to 77 0 108 m3 and the carbon emission reduction increased from 2 4 104 t co2e to 847 4 104 t co2e from 2000 to 2017 based on research results and from the perspective of socio hydrology combined with water saving and carbon emission reduction the regions could optimize the integration of water saving carbon emission reduction and sustainable development based on coordinating the grain planting structure according to their own climatic condition soil and water resource condition and socioeconomic condition graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water carbon coupling virtual water virtual carbon water saving carbon emission reduction socio hydrology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction according to the statistics from the food and agriculture organization of the united nations compared with 2010 60 more grain will be needed to feed the growing global population in 2050 due to factors such as population growth socioeconomic development and the scarcity of freshwater resources in the world about 1 2 billion people worldwide live in agricultural areas with water shortages fao 2020 since the 1990s agricultural production has taken up more than 50 of the world s available land and consumed more than 70 of the fresh water and global agricultural carbon emissions have increased by 14 epa 2020 based on ensuring grain security it is imperative to save water resources and reduce carbon emissions as the population grows china faces increasing pressure and challenges to achieve sustainable development on the basis of ensuring grain security zhao et al 2021 the advance of agricultural science and technology provides the internal driving force for the change of grain spatial pattern and the regional differences formed in the process of industrialization and urbanization are the external pulling force for the evolution of regional distribution of grain production and geographical and climatic constraints are important factors affecting the evolution of grain spatial distribution tan et al 2012 from the regional perspective the grain planting structure in some regions is constantly changing leading to the changes in water consumption and carbon emission during the process of grain planting since the economic reform and open up the growth of grain yield has mainly occurred in north china and the trend of inter regional grain transportation has become more and more obvious sun et al 2019a since the water consumption and carbon emissions in the grain production process of each province are different the phenomenon of water saving or not and emission reduction or not exists in the process of grain transportation therefore this study aims to explore the current situation of grain virtual water carbon flow between regions and based on this obtain the amount of water saving and emission reduction brought by grain transportation to provide references for regional grain production layout and water resource optimization allocation water footprint refers to the amount of fresh water resources required for products and services consumed by any known population such as individuals enterprises provinces states countries etc over a given period of time generally 1 year hoekstra et al 2011 on this basis water footprint of crop growth is defined as the amount of water resources consumed by the unit crop yield generally economic yield in a region and then becomes the main tool in the process of grain virtual water accounting hoekstra et al 2011 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 yin 2021 virtual water coagulated in grain allan 1993 flows with the transportation of grain compared with physical water resource virtual water is stored in grain in the form of invisible its convenient transportation makes grain trade become an effective tool to ensure grain security and alleviate water shortage based on the current inter regional economic and trade situation the research scale mainly includes virtual water flow between countries konapala and mishra 2020 between regions within a country dalin et al 2014 dang et al 2015 and within a river basin zhang et al 2021a in terms of virtual water flow quantification an et al 2021 simulated the inter provincial virtual grain water flow in china based on the linear optimization model and found that the increase of virtual water flow amount in north china would seriously exceed the local water resources in arid and semi arid regions which would have an obvious negative impact on the sustainable development of north china on the basis of a large number of studies about virtual water flow quantification other researches on virtual water mainly include the analysis of driving factors of virtual water flow between regions sun et al 2022 the impact evaluation of virtual water flow yin et al 2021 the suitability evaluation of regional virtual water flow and the prediction of future virtual water flow cui et al 2018 graham et al 2020 rearding the influencing factors of grain virtual water flow sun et al 2019b found that china s regional economic pattern and its evolution will affect the grain virtual water flow pattern by using the partial least squares structural equation model pls sem carbon emission is also called greenhouse gas emission and the increase of greenhouse gas will lead to global warming sea level rise destruction of biological community and increase of diseases and pests agricultural production activities will lead to carbon emission directly or indirectly so related scholars are devoted to the research of agricultural carbon emission carbon emission in the process of agricultural production mainly include soil carbon emissions specifically including co2 produced in the process of farming and soil biochemistry ch4 in paddy soil n2o produced by cropland irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application direct or indirect carbon emission caused by energy consumption including co2 emission directly generated by the use of fossil energy such as diesel gasoline and coal as well as co2 emission indirectly caused by electricity consumption such as pumping irrigation drainage and machine farming greenhouse gas emission from agricultural waste such as co2 emission from manure management processes and straw burning in terms of regional scale studies include global agricultural greenhouse gas emissions laborde et al 2021 national agricultural carbon emission yadav and wang 2017 and agricultural carbon footprint accounting within a certain region li et al 2021 wu et al 2018 found that the average unit carbon dioxide equivalents emissions were higher for exporting provinces than importing provinces based on grain transportation between provinces in mainland china in terms of carbon emission accounting methods including the application of life cycle analysis zhang et al 2013 simulation of carbon emission based on correlation models wang et al 2018a calculation of carbon emission using emission factors liu et al 2021 cillis et al 2018 used the salus model systems approach to land use sustainability to model soil carbon emission and they found the adoption of conservation tillage techniques decreased carbon emission related to farming operations while pa technologies led to an optimization of the exhaustible sources such as fossil fuels and fertilizers not only is water virtual but so is carbon at present many studies have quantified the status quo of inter provincial grain virtual water flow and carbon emissions from grain cultivation in china but there is basically no research on virtual carbon it s imperative to explore the virtual carbon transfer situation between regions in order to help realize the carbon emissions peak the initial purpose of agricultural development is to ensure grain security followed by the optimization of planting pattern based on the overall planning of water and soil resource allocation however the current crop growth process consumes water and produces carbon emission greenhouse gas coupling and interaction between water and carbon and it is important to explore the coupling mechanism between water and carbon wheat and maize are mainly cultivated in north china plain and relevant studies show that surface drip irrigation can improve irrigation water efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emission wang et al 2016 no tillage 70 mm pre sowing irrigation can improve the regulation of soil carbon emissions and water consumption by summer maize in the north china plain guo et al 2019 he et al 2022 took the middle reaches of the heihe basin in china as the research object and took into full account the goals of water conservation and carbon neutrality based on the optimization of the planting pattern and the classical optimal planting pattern with the improvement of economic benefits was obtained finally in terms of agricultural water footprint and virtual water the research content of water footprint mainly includes the accounting of water footprint quantity hoekstra et al 2011 sun et al 2013 2019a the analysis of influencing factors and driving forces of water footprint sun and fang 2019 yin et al 2021 and the sustainable evaluation research based on water footprint wu et al 2022 ji et al 2022 about virtual water in terms of virtual water accounting methods the most widely used method of virtual water accounting is virtual water accounting based on water footprint theory sun et al 2022 and virtual water accounting based on input output analysis ioa chen et al 2018 as for the impact assessment of virtual water flow at present the main content about the impact assessment of virtual water flow includes the quantification of the impact of virtual water flow on regional water resources ye et al 2018 the influence of virtual water flow on regional social economy an et al 2021 assessment on whether a region is suitable for implementing virtual water trade ali et al 2021 in terms of carbon emissions from agricultural production the main research contents include agricultural carbon emission accounting mainly based on ipcc emission coefficient method or denitrification

assessment of agricultural carbon emission gm 1 1 model stirpat model fu 2020 dai et al 2021 in view of the sustainable development goals water saving and carbon emission reduction in agricultural production is imperative therefore based on calculating the water carbon footprint of grain production this study calculated the virtual water carbon transfer amount combined with grain transport between regions and then obtained the trend of water saving and carbon emission reduction based on the differences of water carbon footprint between regions finally the challenges and opportunities faced by china in water saving and carbon emission reduction are analyzed from the perspective of socio hydrology this study has certain reference and innovation significance which can provide relevant basis for regional water resources protection carbon emission reduction and coordinated development of various industries and also provide reference for decision makers in related fields 2

provincial level administrative regions in mainland china are shown in fig 1 2 2 accounting of grain virtual water flow and grain virtual carbon flow based on the calculation of water footprint during

evolution of grain planting structure fig 2 shows the grain sown area and grain yield of 31 provinces in mainland china in 2000 2010 and 2020 the provinces with larger grain sown area and higher grain yield are mainly distributed in northern china northeast china heilongjiang jilin and inner mongolia and china s huang huai hai plain shandong henan and anhui regional water resource endowment and grain yield showed an opposite trend in space the water resource endowment in southern china is obviously better than that in northern china and the water resource pressure index in northern china is generally higher supplementary fig 1 3 the grain sown area and grain yield of henan located in the huang huai hai plain are at the highest level in the country from 2000 to 2020 the grain sown area increased from 7743 7 103 ha to 10 168 3 103 ha and the grain yield increased from 3669 7 104 t to 6631 8 104 t heilongjiang is located in northeast china and its grain sown area and grain yield follow closely behind henan the grain sown area and grain yield of southeast coastal areas such as zhejiang fujian and guangdong are decreasing year by year from 2000 to 2020 the grain sown area of zhejiang decreased from 1364 1 103 ha to 804 25 103 ha and the grain yield decreased from 952 1 104 t to 536 1 104 t in addition to xinjiang the trend of grain planting in many western regions shaanxi gansu sichuan guangxi etc did not change much from the perspective of mainland china fig 3 a from 2000 to 2020 the average annual sown area of maize accounts for the largest proportion 38 24 but the average annual yield of maize is less than that of rice 37 77 while the average annual yield of rice accounts for the largest proportion 39 25 the average annual sown area and yield of wheat are both relatively small from the perspective of specific provinces henan has the largest annual average grain sown area 9082 2 103 ha followed by heilongjiang shandong and anhui henan also has the largest annual average grain yield of 5123 9 104 t and heilongjiang sichuan and jiangsu also have relatively large annual average grain yield except for beijing shanghai and tianjin with relatively small area the grain sown area in western regions such as qinghai and tibet are also relatively small in mainland china in terms of grain types fig 3 b rice is mainly cultivated in southern china such as jiangxi fujian and zhejiang in northern china such as jilin liaoning and inner mongolia maize is the main grain crop the provinces with larger wheat and maize planting area are mainly in northwest china such as shaanxi gansu and xinjiang in the huang huai hai plain rice and maize are the main crops therefore china s grain production is mainly concentrated in northeast china and the huang huai hai plain which are the main sources of grain supply in mainland china 3 2 spatiotemporal evolution of grain virtual water flow based on the water footprint of grain production this study calculated the grain virtual water flow situation between provinces in mainland china about water footprint supplementary fig 5 the provinces with large water footprints are mainly concentrated in the western and southeastern china qinghai guangdong guangxi and hainan have relatively large water footprint which hainan has the largest water footprint increased from 2 27 m3 kg to 2 81 m3 kg from 2000 to 2017 northeast china and the huang huai hai plain are the main grain producing areas in china but the water footprint is small and decreases with time the water footprint in heilongjiang the main grain producing area decreased from 1 53 m3 kg to 1 19 m3 kg during 2000 2017 next is the situation of inter provincial grain transfer fig 4 and grain virtual water flow in 2000 and 2017 fig 5 supplementary fig 4 from the perspective of spatial distribution provinces with large amount of grain transportation are mainly distributed in the eastern china and less involved in the western part the transfer out areas mainly include northeast china heilongjiang jilin and inner mongolia and the huang huai hai plain shandong henan and anhui the transfer in areas mainly include beijing tianjin and the southeast coastal areas shanghai zhejiang fujian and guangdong from the perspective of virtual water flow from 2000 to 2017 the amount of inter provincial grain virtual water flow in mainland china increased from 717 4 108 m3 to 1472 6 108 m3 heilongjiang is the province with the largest amount of grain virtual water outflow which increased from 187 1 108 m3 to 670 9 108 m3 during the study period and the virtual water mainly flowed to guangdong zhejiang and shanghai guangdong is the province with the largest amount of grain virtual water inflow which increased from 195 8 108 m3 to 402 8 108 m3 during the study period and the virtual water mainly came from heilongjiang jilin and inner mongolia the role of grain virtual water flow virtual outflow area and virtual inflow area in some provinces changed during the study period for example liaoning changed from inflow area to outflow area while jiangsu hunan sichuan and tibet gradually changed from outflow area to inflow area 3 3 spatiotemporal evolution of carbon emission from grain cultivation and virtual carbon flow from the perspective of carbon emission from grain production fig 6 the carbon emission in northeast china heilongjiang and jilin and huang huai hai plain shandong jiangsu henan and anhui were large and showed an increasing trend year by year during the study period 2000 2020 henan has the largest amount of carbon emission increased from 4324 4 104 t co2e to 6617 3 104 t co2e followed by jiangsu and anhui the carbon emission of southwest china such as sichuan and guangxi and southeast coastal china such as guangdong and fujian shows a decreasing trend year by year the carbon emission reduction trend of fujian is obvious decreased from 1222 9 104 t co2e to 793 6 104 t co2e during the study period carbon emission mainly takes into account the emission of ch4 co2 and n2o fig 7 due to rice cultivation the regions with large ch4 emission are mainly hunan hubei and jiangxi among which hunan has the largest ch4 emission of 1451 6 t co2e the regions with large co2 emission are mainly henan shandong and heilongjiang among which henan has the largest co2 emission of 2363 3 104 t co2e anhui jiangsu and heilongjiang are the main regions with relatively large amount of n2o emission among which anhui has the largest n2o emission of 16 1 104 t co2e northwest and southwest regions such as gansu and qinghai have low amount of carbon emission in some regions such as jiangsu and anhui the grain yield remains basically unchanged but the carbon emissions are increasing on the whole with the growth of grain sown area and grain yield in the main grain producing areas their carbon emissions will also increase significantly based on the carbon emission in the process of grain planting and the amount of grain transportation between regions the inter provincial grain virtual carbon flow was further calculated in mainland china in 2000 and 2017 fig 8 from the perspective of spatial distribution the provinces of grain virtual carbon flow are mainly distributed in the eastern china the grain virtual carbon outflow areas mainly include northeast china heilongjiang jilin and inner mongolia and huang huai hai plain shandong henan and anhui and the inflow areas of grain virtual carbon mainly include beijing tianjin and southeast coastal areas shanghai zhejiang fujian and guangdong from 2000 to 2017 the inter provincial grain virtual carbon flow in mainland china increased from 2362 7 104 t co2e to 12 680 6 104 t co2e heilongjiang is the province with the largest amount of grain virtual carbon outflow which increased from 449 9 104 t co2e to 4818 3 104 t co2e during the study period and its virtual carbon mainly flowed to guangdong zhejiang and fujian other provinces with large amount of grain virtual carbon outflow include henan jilin and inner mongolia guangdong is the province with the largest amount of grain virtual carbon inflow which increased from 624 1 104 t co2e to 3487 6 104 t co2e during the study period and its virtual carbon inflow mainly came from heilongjiang jilin and anhui 4 discussion 4 1 water saving and carbon emission reduction effect caused by grain transportation based on the amount of grain transportation and the differences in the water consumption and carbon emissions in the process of grain planting between provinces in mainland china firstly the amount of water saving and carbon emission reduction in each province were calculated then the influencing factors of water saving and carbon emission reduction were analyzed finally the challenges and opportunities that provinces will face in optimizing water saving and carbon emission reduction were evaluated 4 1 1 water saving effect analysis of grain transportation among the grain transfer out provinces in mainland china the provinces with large amount of water saving mainly include heilongjiang jilin and henan heilongjiang located in northeast china is the main grain producing area with the largest grain transfer out in mainland china although heilongjiang has carried out relevant water saving measures in recent years due to the amount of agricultural water consumption accounts for about 75 of its total water consumption and the agricultural water use efficiency is low heilongjiang has become the province with the largest grain virtual water outflow based on grain transportation and from 1997 to 2017 the amount of water saving in heilongjiang increased from 0 52 108 m3 to 19 37 108 m3 and the amount of water saving is highest and growing fastest fig 9 the main reason is that compared with its grain trading partners the water consumption per unit of grain production in heilongjiang is lower and the grain trade volume is increasing year by year the main challenge heilongjiang faces in developing water saving agriculture is to improve the agricultural development mode based on its own topography natural resources endowment and social economic development status so as to achieve water saving while ensuring grain output specifically the administrative departments advocate water saving policies and continuously promote water saving technologies establishing effective water resources utilization mechanism and popularizing water saving irrigation technology adjusting planting structure and other measures to continuously improve water use efficiency based on the current situation of grain production in heilongjiang its future development opportunities mainly include making full use of black soil organic soil integrating biotechnology and breeding technology to cultivate excellent crop varieties and making full use of remote sensing technology to serve the information construction of irrigated areas other regions similar to heilongjiang such as jilin and inner mongolia can refer to the above suggestions for agricultural development according to their own conditions provinces with large amount of grain transfer in mainly include guangdong guangxi and zhejiang guangdong located in the south of the chinese mainland is the province with the largest amount of grain transfer in among the provinces increased from 950 9 104 t to 4113 9 104 t from 1997 to 2017 based on grain transportation the amount of water saving in guangdong increased from 0 52 108 m3 to 19 37 108 m3 from 1997 to 2017 and the amount of water saving is highest and growing fastest fig 9 grain production in guangdong consumes more water so the amount of water saving caused by grain transfer is higher firstly guangdong is the province with the largest population in mainland china but the sown area of crops is decreasing year by year with the increase of population the development of urbanization and the continuous improvement of people s living standards people s requirements for the quantity quality and safety of agricultural products have gradually increased however its grain yield is at the middle and lower level in mainland china and is decreasing year by year in addition guangdong is located in the subtropical humid region due to its climatic conditions the agricultural production in guangdong is more focused on the planting of vegetables and fruits than food crops guangdong has realized water saving based on grain transportation but it needs to consider the grain production background of its grain trading partners from the perspective of the country as a whole pearl river delta of guangdong has convenient water transportation and should continue to develop relevant economic industries based on the current development status the northern region of guangdong should develop a suitable crop planting structure according to its own climate soil and water resources status so as to ensure grain security other areas similar to guangdong such as southeast coastal areas can refer to the above suggestions for agricultural development according to their own conditions during the study period from the perspective of mainland china the amount of water saving increased from 25 64 108 m3 to 77 02 108 m3 beijing gansu and chongqing continued to be water consuming areas while shaanxi shanxi and sichuan were transformed from water saving areas to water consuming areas due to the amount of water required by producing per unit grain is different in each province water saving or not exists in inter regional grain transportation there are many factors that lead to differences in water use during grain planting between regions for example regional climate difference leads to significant difference in water demand during crop growth relevant studies have shown that changes in crop water demand and rainfall jointly affect irrigation demand and rainfall impact on irrigation demand varies widely across regions cao et al 2020 luo et al 2022 although water saving agriculture is carried out under the background of water shortage in many areas the expansion of irrigation area and changes in planting structure will lead to the rebound effect of irrigation water although water saving agriculture is carried out in many regions under the background of water resource shortage the expansion of irrigated area and the change of planting structure will lead to the rebound effect of irrigation water and the water saving effect will be offset by the increase of water consumption if it is not restricted yu et al 2021 in addition based on the concept of healthy ecosystem development regional differences in production materials input and the development of agricultural water saving technologies also lead to differences in water resource input in the process of grain planting zou et al 2020 regional policy differences also have an impact on the allocation of water resources for grain production so establishing effective water resources management system is an important way to promote optimal allocation of water resources zhang et al 2018 zhai et al 2021 based on the research status firstly the decision makers of each province should consider the water demand of agricultural production and the development of other industries industrial and service industries from the perspective of their own water resources endowment specific measures such as carrying out rational water saving irrigation measures according to regional agricultural development pattern and crop planting structure so as to achieve grain self sufficiency then if grain security is guaranteed by grain transportation the water consumption of grain production in all trading partners needs to be taken into account so as to achieve maximum water saving finally each province needs to formulate relevant policies about regulations of water resources management and the development of nature society economy system according to its own situation so as to optimize the allocation of water resources among industries to achieve sustainable development 4 1 2 carbon emission reduction effect analysis of grain transportation based on clarifying the inter provincial grain transportation volume in mainland china the amount of carbon emission reduction in each province was calculated according to the difference in carbon emission for grain production between regions and then obtained the overall carbon emission reduction of mainland china fig 10 from 2000 to 2017 from the regional perspective the provinces with larger amount of carbon emission reduction among the grain transfer out provinces mainly include heilongjiang jilin and inner mongolia and the amount of carbon emission reduction in heilongjiang increased from 7 30 104 t co2e to 334 78 104 t co2e based on grain transportation the amount of carbon emission reduction in heilongjiang grown significantly primarily because heilongjiang produces less carbon emissions per unit of grain than its grain trading partners but for heilongjiang itself the carbon emissions from grain planting are increasing year by year therefore to achieve carbon emission reduction heilongjiang needs to start from the challenges and opportunities faced by its own carbon emissions the first is to develop and utilize environmental organic fertilizers to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides and at the same time popularize the awareness of grain growers that chemical fertilizers and pesticides will harm the soil then cultivate water saving and drought resisting crop variety reduce straw burning and promote straw returning to the field finally optimize the crop planting structure eliminate the traditional farming methods with high energy consumption and high pollution by promoting the development of high tech and new energy carry out the project of returning farmland to forests and grasslands based on ensuring food security so as to realize the integration of carbon source and carbon sink during the study period from the perspective of mainland china the amount of carbon emission reduction increased from 2 42 104 t co2e to 847 44 104 t co2e guangdong s carbon emission reduction changed significantly based on grain transportation the amount of carbon emission increasing is 29 32 104 t in 2000 while the amount of carbon emission reduction is 343 26 104 t in 2017 fig 10 in addition tianjin and shanxi changed from carbon emission reduction regions to carbon emission increasing regions while zhejiang fujian guangxi and hainan all changed from carbon emission increasing regions to carbon emission reduction regions carrying out relevant measures to achieve carbon emission reduction is an issue that needs to be focused on such as the rational input of production factors like chemical fertilizers and the comprehensive consideration of the geographical location of farmland and weather conditions to develop appropriate grain planting structure experimental studies have found that under the same management practices the experimental yield of crops is higher than the actual yield of farmers the difference can be attributed to extreme weather conditions crop diseases and sub optimal management factors wang et al 2018a production factors such as fuels inorganic fertilizers and pesticides used in wheat and maize production produce a large amount of carbon emissions however by calculating the carbon footprint of the crop production system it is found that the carbon footprint of crops can be effectively reduced through comprehensive improvement of crop farming methods or promotion of organic agriculture gan et al 2014 searchinger et al 2018 there is direct carbon emission in the process of grain production but indirect carbon emission is generated when considering inter regional grain transportation some regions reduce their own carbon emission through grain transportation but increase the carbon emission of grain producing areas therefore environmental protection behind carbon emissions is a sustainable development direction that should be considered in all regions smith et al 2019 xu et al 2020 in addition in view of the difference of agricultural production conditions and environmental protection policies in each region the means of production input and carbon emission management methods in the process of grain production are also different which will lead to different final carbon emission 4 1 3 challenges and opportunities faced by china in water saving and carbon emission reduction ensuring grain security water security and low carbon agriculture simultaneously is an important guarantee for sustainable development despite the water and land resources are relative scarcity china feeds 22 of the world s population with 9 of its arable land and 6 of its freshwater resources in 2020 when the covid 19 epidemic was raging china s per capita grain supply exceeded 470 kg significantly exceeding the international grain security standard of 400 kg while ensuring china s own grain security it is imperative to actively maintain world grain security and it is even more important to achieve water conservation and carbon emission reduction based on ensuring grain security from the perspective of mainland china from 2000 to 2017 the amount of water saving and emission reduction continued to grow however if the regional water saving and carbon emission reduction situation is comprehensively analyzed there are some differences in each province take beijing as an example in 2017 based on the grain transfer in beijing achieved 19 42 104 t co2e carbon emission reduction but at the same time 1 50 108 m3 water resource waste one of the main reasons for this phenomenon is the grain direction of transportation because beijing has higher water use efficiency and lower water consumption per unit of grain whether beijing transport grain in and how to improve water use efficiency of grain transfer out regions need to be further improved contrary to the situation in beijing in 2017 anhui s grain transfer achieved water conservation but carbon emissions increased the main reason was that compared with grain trade objects anhui s grain production process had higher carbon emissions anhui s planting structure is mainly concentrated in two crops of rice and wheat and the planting area is large and the amount of nitrogen fertilizer application in the planting process is relatively larger in 2017 xinjiang s grain transportation caused it to waste 0 66 108 m3 of water resources and increase carbon emission by 0 70 104 co2e which is an obvious unsustainable phenomenon although xinjiang s grain transportation ensures the grain security of its trading provinces xinjiang needs to consider its current situation of water resources and carbon emission and achieve sustainable development by improving planting patterns and input of production materials in order to reduce carbon emission during grain cultivation first of all it is necessary to consider reducing the application of carbon emission sources such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides and then agricultural greenhouse gas sinks must be enhanced or newly created since each carbon emission mitigation measure has different effects on different gasses formulating and adopting different measures for different gasses are necessary so as to formulate greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies for china s agricultural ecosystems based on ensuring food security guo and zhou 2007 wang et al 2018a the inter provincial grain transportation in mainland china triggered the inter regional transfer of water resources and carbon emission then due to the differences in water carbon footprint of grain production between regions status of water saving and emission reduction in the context of grain transport come into being and each province is facing with different challenges and opportunities fig 11 water saving and emission reduction exist in inter regional grain transport but it s also imperative to carry out water saving and emission reduction in the process of grain planting in grain producing areas in terms of water saving for example the grain producing areas need to consider their own water soil resource endowment and economic status as a whole to plant grain crops and then optimize water saving irrigation technology to save water then improve grain types and grain planting structure through remote sensing technology in terms of carbon emission reduction the grain producing areas should consider applying organic fertilizer firstly and then apply appropriate types and quantities of fertilizer according to crop types 4 2 study s limitations and directions for future research 4 2 1 water carbon coupling mechanism based on socio hydrology perspective socio hydrology emerged under the coupling of human and water hall 2019 thinks that current research on socio hydrology appears to be fragmentary dealing with specific issues in specific situations rather than in depth study representing a social level which appears to be some fragments of a larger conundrum hall may be right but perhaps the evolution of socio hydrology is based on the integration of many fragmented related studies because socio hydrology is to study the mutual feedback relationship and co evolution process of human water coupled systems so its research content and research scope are relatively wide so this study carried out agricultural water carbon coupling research based on existing socio hydrology related researches based on existing researches water is regard as a link to connect socio hydrology with the water carbon coupling system at present china s grain production is facing major dual pressures on the one hand producing more grain to feed the growing regional population on the other hand achieving water saving and carbon emission reduction based on ensuring grain security the factors affecting the inter regional grain transportation can be roughly divided into three aspects fig 12 in terms of natural system regional climate change and water soil resource differences will lead to regional difference in grain planting structure and then lead to inter regional grain transportation in terms of social system regional difference in population policy and custom will lead to regional difference in grain demand and then lead to inter regional grain transportation in terms of economic system regional gdp national income difference and other factors will lead to change in regional industrial pattern agriculture industry and service and then lead to change in agricultural production and grain yield sun et al 2022 under the influence of many social and hydrological factors the interregional grain transportation will lead to the redistribution of water resource and carbon emission because in the process of grain planting the precipitation and irrigation water used for crop growth will flow from the grain producing areas to the grain shortage areas along with the grain transportation therefore the grain shortage areas will apply more local water resource to non agricultural industries based on ensuring food security during the growth of grain crop the input of production factors such as chemical fertilizer and pesticide will lead to carbon emission from soil and crop while the increase of co2 concentration in the atmosphere will affect the biological and abiotic condition in the soil such as microbial activity and soil water content and then affect the growth of crop resulting in water carbon coupling effect pendall et al 2004 van groenigen et al 2011 the existence of water carbon coupling effect triggers the difference of industrial structure among regions and the nature society economy system of each region also makes corresponding response thus forming a social hydrological cycle system this study may be a small part of the development of socio hydrology which has some limitations so it needs more detailed and rigorous further research 4 2 2 limitations and directions for future research theoretically this study can provide a relatively strong reference for scholars in the field of water carbon for agricultural production in terms of research ideas and research methods practically it can also provide a reference for relevant policy makers and farmers about water resources use and carry out relevant agricultural measures in the process of grain production even so this study also has some limitations firstly since there is no data related to inter provincial grain trade volume and trade direction in mainland china this study calculates inter provincial grain transport volume and transportation direction based on the population and geographical distance of each province using social equity method so there is a certain degree of error in inter provincial grain virtual water flow then based on the relevant research of socio hydrology the impact of natural social and economic factors on the water carbon coupling system was analyzed qualitatively based on grain production from the perspective of socio hydrology based on the limitations of the research the subsequent research should comprehensively consider the current research on inter provincial grain virtual water flow in china and carefully examine the methods used by each research so as to further accurately calculate inter provincial grain transportation volume dang et al 2015 wu et al 2018 d odorico et al 2020 at the same time based on qualitative research the influence of natural social and economic factors on the water carbon coupling system in the background of inter regional grain transportation need to be quantitatively analyzed by referring to relevant literatures sivapalan and blöschl 2015 hall 2019 wu et al 2019 5 conclusion the grain planting in mainland china was mainly concentrated in the northeast and the huang huai hai plain the grain sown area and grain yield in henan are at the highest level in china from 2000 to 2020 the grain sown area increased from 7743 7 103 ha to 10 168 3 103 ha and the grain yield increased from 3669 7 104 t to 6631 8 104 t from 2000 to 2017 the inter provincial grain virtual water flow increased year by year and the total inter provincial flow increased from 717 4 108 m3 to 1472 6 108 m3 heilongjiang and guangdong are the provinces with the largest amount of grain virtual water outflow and inflow respectively in terms of carbon emission from grain planting and virtual carbon flow the amount of carbon emission in northeast heilongjiang and jilin and the huang huai hai plain shandong jiangsu henan and anhui were large during the study period relatively henan has the largest carbon emission increased from 4324 4 104 t co2e to 6617 3 104 t co2e and the carbon emission reduction trend of fujian is obvious decreased from 1222 9 104 t co2e to 793 6 104 t co2e during the study period in addition the northwest and southwest regions have lower carbon emission from 2000 to 2017 the inter provincial grain virtual carbon flow in mainland china increased from 2362 7 104 t co2e to 12 680 6 104 t co2e heilongjiang is the province with the largest amount of grain virtual carbon outflow which increased from 449 9 104 t co2e to 4818 3 104 t co2e during the study period guangdong is the province with the largest amount of grain virtual carbon inflow which increased from 624 1 104 t

14907,water resource and carbon emission involved in grain production in mainland china are redistributed among provinces as the grain was transported in recent years this study first calculated the water consumption and carbon emission during the growth of grain crops based on the water carbon footprint theory and then used the social equity method to calculate the inter regional grain virtual water and virtual carbon flow finally the regional and national trends in water saving and carbon emission reduction were calculated based on the spatial and temporal differences in grain planting among provinces in terms of virtual water carbon from 2000 to 2017 the amount of the inter provincial grain virtual water flow increased from 717 4 108 m3 to 1472 6 108 m3 heilongjiang and guangdong are the provinces with the largest amount of grain virtual water outflow 670 9 108 m3 and inflow 402 8 108 m3 in 2017 respectively and the total inter provincial grain virtual carbon flow increased from 2362 7 104 t co2e to 12 680 6 104 t co2e grain transport leads to water saving and carbon emission reduction the amount of water saving increased from 25 6 108 m3 to 77 0 108 m3 and the carbon emission reduction increased from 2 4 104 t co2e to 847 4 104 t co2e from 2000 to 2017 based on research results and from the perspective of socio hydrology combined with water saving and carbon emission reduction the regions could optimize the integration of water saving carbon emission reduction and sustainable development based on coordinating the grain planting structure according to their own climatic condition soil and water resource condition and socioeconomic condition graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water carbon coupling virtual water virtual carbon water saving carbon emission reduction socio hydrology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction according to the statistics from the food and agriculture organization of the united nations compared with 2010 60 more grain will be needed to feed the growing global population in 2050 due to factors such as population growth socioeconomic development and the scarcity of freshwater resources in the world about 1 2 billion people worldwide live in agricultural areas with water shortages fao 2020 since the 1990s agricultural production has taken up more than 50 of the world s available land and consumed more than 70 of the fresh water and global agricultural carbon emissions have increased by 14 epa 2020 based on ensuring grain security it is imperative to save water resources and reduce carbon emissions as the population grows china faces increasing pressure and challenges to achieve sustainable development on the basis of ensuring grain security zhao et al 2021 the advance of agricultural science and technology provides the internal driving force for the change of grain spatial pattern and the regional differences formed in the process of industrialization and urbanization are the external pulling force for the evolution of regional distribution of grain production and geographical and climatic constraints are important factors affecting the evolution of grain spatial distribution tan et al 2012 from the regional perspective the grain planting structure in some regions is constantly changing leading to the changes in water consumption and carbon emission during the process of grain planting since the economic reform and open up the growth of grain yield has mainly occurred in north china and the trend of inter regional grain transportation has become more and more obvious sun et al 2019a since the water consumption and carbon emissions in the grain production process of each province are different the phenomenon of water saving or not and emission reduction or not exists in the process of grain transportation therefore this study aims to explore the current situation of grain virtual water carbon flow between regions and based on this obtain the amount of water saving and emission reduction brought by grain transportation to provide references for regional grain production layout and water resource optimization allocation water footprint refers to the amount of fresh water resources required for products and services consumed by any known population such as individuals enterprises provinces states countries etc over a given period of time generally 1 year hoekstra et al 2011 on this basis water footprint of crop growth is defined as the amount of water resources consumed by the unit crop yield generally economic yield in a region and then becomes the main tool in the process of grain virtual water accounting hoekstra et al 2011 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 yin 2021 virtual water coagulated in grain allan 1993 flows with the transportation of grain compared with physical water resource virtual water is stored in grain in the form of invisible its convenient transportation makes grain trade become an effective tool to ensure grain security and alleviate water shortage based on the current inter regional economic and trade situation the research scale mainly includes virtual water flow between countries konapala and mishra 2020 between regions within a country dalin et al 2014 dang et al 2015 and within a river basin zhang et al 2021a in terms of virtual water flow quantification an et al 2021 simulated the inter provincial virtual grain water flow in china based on the linear optimization model and found that the increase of virtual water flow amount in north china would seriously exceed the local water resources in arid and semi arid regions which would have an obvious negative impact on the sustainable development of north china on the basis of a large number of studies about virtual water flow quantification other researches on virtual water mainly include the analysis of driving factors of virtual water flow between regions sun et al 2022 the impact evaluation of virtual water flow yin et al 2021 the suitability evaluation of regional virtual water flow and the prediction of future virtual water flow cui et al 2018 graham et al 2020 rearding the influencing factors of grain virtual water flow sun et al 2019b found that china s regional economic pattern and its evolution will affect the grain virtual water flow pattern by using the partial least squares structural equation model pls sem carbon emission is also called greenhouse gas emission and the increase of greenhouse gas will lead to global warming sea level rise destruction of biological community and increase of diseases and pests agricultural production activities will lead to carbon emission directly or indirectly so related scholars are devoted to the research of agricultural carbon emission carbon emission in the process of agricultural production mainly include soil carbon emissions specifically including co2 produced in the process of farming and soil biochemistry ch4 in paddy soil n2o produced by cropland irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application direct or indirect carbon emission caused by energy consumption including co2 emission directly generated by the use of fossil energy such as diesel gasoline and coal as well as co2 emission indirectly caused by electricity consumption such as pumping irrigation drainage and machine farming greenhouse gas emission from agricultural waste such as co2 emission from manure management processes and straw burning in terms of regional scale studies include global agricultural greenhouse gas emissions laborde et al 2021 national agricultural carbon emission yadav and wang 2017 and agricultural carbon footprint accounting within a certain region li et al 2021 wu et al 2018 found that the average unit carbon dioxide equivalents emissions were higher for exporting provinces than importing provinces based on grain transportation between provinces in mainland china in terms of carbon emission accounting methods including the application of life cycle analysis zhang et al 2013 simulation of carbon emission based on correlation models wang et al 2018a calculation of carbon emission using emission factors liu et al 2021 cillis et al 2018 used the salus model systems approach to land use sustainability to model soil carbon emission and they found the adoption of conservation tillage techniques decreased carbon emission related to farming operations while pa technologies led to an optimization of the exhaustible sources such as fossil fuels and fertilizers not only is water virtual but so is carbon at present many studies have quantified the status quo of inter provincial grain virtual water flow and carbon emissions from grain cultivation in china but there is basically no research on virtual carbon it s imperative to explore the virtual carbon transfer situation between regions in order to help realize the carbon emissions peak the initial purpose of agricultural development is to ensure grain security followed by the optimization of planting pattern based on the overall planning of water and soil resource allocation however the current crop growth process consumes water and produces carbon emission greenhouse gas coupling and interaction between water and carbon and it is important to explore the coupling mechanism between water and carbon wheat and maize are mainly cultivated in north china plain and relevant studies show that surface drip irrigation can improve irrigation water efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emission wang et al 2016 no tillage 70 mm pre sowing irrigation can improve the regulation of soil carbon emissions and water consumption by summer maize in the north china plain guo et al 2019 he et al 2022 took the middle reaches of the heihe basin in china as the research object and took into full account the goals of water conservation and carbon neutrality based on the optimization of the planting pattern and the classical optimal planting pattern with the improvement of economic benefits was obtained finally in terms of agricultural water footprint and virtual water the research content of water footprint mainly includes the accounting of water footprint quantity hoekstra et al 2011 sun et al 2013 2019a the analysis of influencing factors and driving forces of water footprint sun and fang

assessment of agricultural carbon emission gm 1 1 model stirpat model fu 2020 dai et al 2021 in view of the sustainable development goals water saving and carbon emission reduction in agricultural production is imperative therefore based on calculating the water carbon footprint of grain production this study calculated the virtual water carbon transfer amount combined with grain transport between regions and then obtained the trend of water saving and carbon emission reduction based on the differences of water carbon footprint between regions finally the challenges and opportunities faced by china in water saving and carbon emission reduction are analyzed from the perspective of socio hydrology this study has certain reference and innovation significance which can provide relevant basis for regional water resources protection carbon emission reduction and coordinated development of various industries and also provide reference for decision makers in related fields 2

evolution of grain planting structure fig 2 shows the grain sown area and grain yield of 31 provinces in mainland china in 2000 2010 and 2020 the provinces with larger grain sown area and higher grain yield are mainly distributed in northern china northeast china heilongjiang jilin and inner mongolia and china s huang huai hai plain shandong henan and anhui regional water resource endowment and grain yield showed an opposite trend in space the water resource endowment in southern china is obviously better than that in northern china and the water resource pressure index in northern china is generally higher supplementary fig 1 3 the grain sown area and grain yield of henan located in the huang huai hai plain are at the highest level in the country from 2000 to 2020 the grain sown area increased from 7743 7 103 ha to 10 168 3 103 ha and the grain yield increased from 3669 7 104 t to 6631 8 104 t heilongjiang is located in northeast china and its grain sown area and grain yield follow closely behind henan the grain sown area and grain yield of southeast coastal areas such as zhejiang fujian and guangdong are decreasing year by year from 2000 to 2020 the grain sown area of zhejiang decreased from 1364 1 103 ha to 804 25 103 ha and the grain yield decreased from 952 1 104 t to 536 1 104 t in addition to xinjiang the trend of grain planting in many western regions shaanxi gansu sichuan guangxi etc did not change much from the perspective of mainland china fig 3 a from 2000 to 2020 the average annual sown area of maize accounts for the largest proportion 38 24 but the average annual yield of maize is less than that of rice 37 77 while the average annual yield of rice accounts for the largest proportion 39 25 the average annual sown area and yield of wheat are both relatively small from the perspective of specific provinces henan has the largest annual average grain sown area 9082 2 103 ha followed by heilongjiang shandong and anhui henan also has the largest annual average grain yield of 5123 9 104 t and heilongjiang sichuan and jiangsu also have relatively large annual average grain yield except for beijing shanghai and tianjin with relatively small area the grain sown area in western regions such as qinghai and tibet are also relatively small in mainland china in terms of grain types fig 3 b rice is mainly cultivated in southern china such as jiangxi fujian and zhejiang in northern china such as jilin liaoning and inner mongolia maize is the main grain crop the provinces with larger wheat and maize planting area are mainly in northwest china such as shaanxi gansu and xinjiang in the huang huai hai plain rice and maize are the main crops therefore china s grain production is mainly concentrated in northeast china and the huang huai hai plain which are the main sources of grain supply in mainland china 3 2 spatiotemporal evolution of grain virtual water flow based on the water footprint of grain production this study calculated the grain virtual water flow situation between provinces in mainland china about water footprint supplementary fig 5 the provinces with large water footprints are mainly concentrated in the western and southeastern china qinghai guangdong guangxi and hainan have relatively large water footprint which hainan has the largest water footprint increased from 2 27 m3 kg to 2 81 m3 kg from 2000 to 2017 northeast china and the huang huai hai plain are the main grain producing areas in china but the water footprint is small and decreases with time the water footprint in heilongjiang the main grain producing area decreased from 1 53 m3 kg to 1 19 m3 kg during 2000 2017 next is the situation of inter provincial grain transfer fig 4 and grain virtual water flow in 2000 and 2017 fig 5 supplementary fig 4 from the perspective of spatial distribution provinces with large amount of grain transportation are mainly distributed in the eastern china and less involved in the western part the transfer out areas mainly include northeast china heilongjiang jilin and inner mongolia and the huang huai hai plain shandong henan and anhui the transfer in areas mainly include beijing tianjin and the southeast coastal areas shanghai zhejiang fujian and guangdong from the perspective of virtual water flow from 2000 to 2017 the amount of inter provincial grain virtual water flow in mainland china increased from 717 4 108 m3 to 1472 6 108 m3 heilongjiang is the province with the largest amount of grain virtual water outflow which increased from 187 1 108 m3 to 670 9 108 m3 during the study period and the virtual water mainly flowed to guangdong zhejiang and shanghai guangdong is the province with the largest amount of grain virtual water inflow which increased from 195 8 108 m3 to 402 8 108 m3 during the study period and the virtual water mainly came from heilongjiang jilin and inner mongolia the role of grain virtual water flow virtual outflow area and virtual inflow area in some provinces changed during the study period for example liaoning changed from inflow area to outflow area while jiangsu hunan sichuan and tibet gradually changed from outflow area to inflow area 3 3 spatiotemporal evolution of carbon emission from grain cultivation and virtual carbon flow from the perspective of carbon emission from grain production fig 6 the carbon emission in northeast china heilongjiang and jilin and huang huai hai plain shandong jiangsu henan and anhui were large and showed an increasing trend year by year during the study period 2000 2020 henan has the largest amount of carbon emission increased from 4324 4 104 t co2e to 6617 3 104 t co2e followed by jiangsu and anhui the carbon emission of southwest china such as sichuan and guangxi and southeast coastal china such as guangdong and fujian shows a decreasing trend year by year the carbon emission reduction trend of fujian is obvious decreased from 1222 9 104 t co2e to 793 6 104 t co2e during the study period carbon emission mainly takes into account the emission of ch4 co2 and n2o fig 7 due to rice cultivation the regions with large ch4 emission are mainly hunan hubei and jiangxi among which hunan has the largest ch4 emission of 1451 6 t co2e the regions with large co2 emission are mainly henan shandong and heilongjiang among which henan has the largest co2 emission of 2363 3 104 t co2e anhui jiangsu and heilongjiang are the main regions with relatively large amount of n2o emission among which anhui has the largest n2o emission of 16 1 104 t co2e northwest and southwest regions such as gansu and qinghai have low amount of carbon emission in some regions such as jiangsu and anhui the grain yield remains basically unchanged but the carbon emissions are increasing on the whole with the growth of grain sown area and grain yield in the main grain producing areas their carbon emissions will also increase significantly based on the carbon emission in the process of grain planting and the amount of grain transportation between regions the inter provincial grain virtual carbon flow was further calculated in mainland china in 2000 and 2017 fig 8 from the perspective of spatial distribution the provinces of grain virtual carbon flow are mainly distributed in the eastern china the grain virtual carbon outflow areas mainly include northeast china heilongjiang jilin and inner mongolia and huang huai hai plain shandong henan and anhui and the inflow areas of grain virtual carbon mainly include beijing tianjin and southeast coastal areas shanghai zhejiang fujian and guangdong from 2000 to 2017 the inter provincial grain virtual carbon flow in mainland china increased from 2362 7 104 t co2e to 12 680 6 104 t co2e heilongjiang is the province with the largest amount of grain virtual carbon outflow which increased from 449 9 104 t co2e to 4818 3 104 t co2e during the study period and its virtual carbon mainly flowed to guangdong zhejiang and fujian other provinces with large amount of grain virtual carbon outflow include henan jilin and inner mongolia guangdong is the province with the largest amount of grain virtual carbon inflow which increased from 624 1 104 t co2e to 3487 6 104 t co2e during the study period and its virtual carbon inflow mainly came from heilongjiang jilin and anhui 4 discussion 4 1 water saving and carbon emission reduction effect caused by grain transportation based on the amount of grain transportation and the differences in the water consumption and carbon emissions in the process of grain planting between provinces in mainland china firstly the amount of water saving and carbon emission reduction in each province were calculated then the influencing factors of water saving and carbon emission reduction were analyzed finally the challenges and opportunities that provinces will face in optimizing water saving and carbon emission reduction were evaluated 4 1 1 water saving effect analysis of grain transportation among the grain transfer out provinces in mainland china the provinces with large amount of water saving mainly include heilongjiang jilin and henan heilongjiang located in northeast china is the main grain producing area with the largest grain transfer out in mainland china although heilongjiang has carried out relevant water saving measures in recent years due to the amount of agricultural water consumption accounts for about 75 of its total water consumption and the agricultural water use efficiency is low heilongjiang has become the province with the largest grain virtual water outflow based on grain transportation and from 1997 to 2017 the amount of water saving in heilongjiang increased from 0 52 108 m3 to 19 37 108 m3 and the amount of water saving is highest and growing fastest fig 9 the main reason is that compared with its grain trading partners the water consumption per unit of grain production in heilongjiang is lower and the grain trade volume is increasing year by year the main challenge heilongjiang faces in developing water saving agriculture is to improve the agricultural development mode based on its own topography natural resources endowment and social economic development status so as to achieve water saving while ensuring grain output specifically the administrative departments advocate water saving policies and continuously promote water saving technologies establishing effective water resources utilization mechanism and popularizing water saving irrigation technology adjusting planting structure and other measures to continuously improve water use efficiency based on the current situation of grain production in heilongjiang its future development opportunities mainly include making full use of black soil organic soil integrating biotechnology and breeding technology to cultivate excellent crop varieties and making full use of remote sensing technology to serve the information construction of irrigated areas other regions similar to heilongjiang such as jilin and inner mongolia can refer to the above suggestions for agricultural development according to their own conditions provinces with large amount of grain transfer in mainly include guangdong guangxi and zhejiang guangdong located in the south of the chinese mainland is the province with the largest amount of grain transfer in among the provinces increased from 950 9 104 t to 4113 9 104 t from 1997 to 2017 based on grain transportation the amount of water saving in guangdong increased from 0 52 108 m3 to 19 37 108 m3 from 1997 to 2017 and the amount of water saving is highest and growing fastest fig 9 grain production in guangdong consumes more water so the amount of water saving caused by grain transfer is higher firstly guangdong is the province with the largest population in mainland china but the sown area of crops is decreasing year by year with the increase of population the development of urbanization and the continuous improvement of people s living standards people s requirements for the quantity quality and safety of agricultural products have gradually increased however its grain yield is at the middle and lower level in mainland china and is decreasing year by year in addition guangdong is located in the subtropical humid region due to its climatic conditions the agricultural production in guangdong is more focused on the planting of vegetables and fruits than food crops guangdong has realized water saving based on grain transportation but it needs to consider the grain production background of its grain trading partners from the perspective of the country as a whole pearl river delta of guangdong has convenient water transportation and should continue to develop relevant economic industries based on the current development status the northern region of guangdong should develop a suitable crop planting structure according to its own climate soil and water resources status so as to ensure grain security other areas similar to guangdong such as southeast coastal areas can refer to the above suggestions for agricultural development according to their own conditions during the study period from the perspective of mainland china the amount of water saving increased from 25 64 108 m3 to 77 02 108 m3 beijing gansu and chongqing continued to be water consuming areas while shaanxi shanxi and sichuan were transformed from water saving areas to water consuming areas due to the amount of water required by producing per unit grain is different in each province water saving or not exists in inter regional grain transportation there are many factors that lead to differences in water use during grain planting between regions for example regional climate difference leads to significant difference in water demand during crop growth relevant studies have shown that changes in crop water demand and rainfall jointly affect irrigation demand and rainfall impact on irrigation demand varies widely across regions cao et al 2020 luo et al 2022 although water saving agriculture is carried out under the background of water shortage in many areas the expansion of irrigation area and changes in planting structure will lead to the rebound effect of irrigation water although water saving agriculture is carried out in many regions under the background of water resource shortage the expansion of irrigated area and the change of planting structure will lead to the rebound effect of irrigation water and the water saving effect will be offset by the increase of water consumption if it is not restricted yu et al 2021 in addition based on the concept of healthy ecosystem development regional differences in production materials input and the development of agricultural water saving technologies also lead to differences in water resource input in the process of grain planting zou et al 2020 regional policy differences also have an impact on the allocation of water resources for grain production so establishing effective water resources management system is an important way to promote optimal allocation of water resources zhang et al 2018 zhai et al 2021 based on the research status firstly the decision makers of each province should consider the water demand of agricultural production and the development of other industries industrial and service industries from the perspective of their own water resources endowment specific measures such as carrying out rational water saving irrigation measures according to regional agricultural development pattern and crop planting structure so as to achieve grain self sufficiency then if grain security is guaranteed by grain transportation the water consumption of grain production in all trading partners needs to be taken into account so as to achieve maximum water saving finally each province needs to formulate relevant policies about regulations of water resources management and the development of nature society economy system according to its own situation so as to optimize the allocation of water resources among industries to achieve sustainable development 4 1 2 carbon emission reduction effect analysis of grain transportation based on clarifying the inter provincial grain transportation volume in mainland china the amount of carbon emission reduction in each province was calculated according to the difference in carbon emission for grain production between regions and then obtained the overall carbon emission reduction of mainland china fig 10 from 2000 to 2017 from the regional perspective the provinces with larger amount of carbon emission reduction among the grain transfer out provinces mainly include heilongjiang jilin and inner mongolia and the amount of carbon emission reduction in heilongjiang increased from 7 30 104 t co2e to 334 78 104 t co2e based on grain transportation the amount of carbon emission reduction in heilongjiang grown significantly primarily because heilongjiang produces less carbon emissions per unit of grain than its grain trading partners but for heilongjiang itself the carbon emissions from grain planting are increasing year by year therefore to achieve carbon emission reduction heilongjiang needs to start from the challenges and opportunities faced by its own carbon emissions the first is to develop and utilize environmental organic fertilizers to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides and at the same time popularize the awareness of grain growers that chemical fertilizers and pesticides will harm the soil then cultivate water saving and drought resisting crop variety reduce straw burning and promote straw returning to the field finally optimize the crop planting structure eliminate the traditional farming methods with high energy consumption and high pollution by promoting the development of high tech and new energy carry out the project of returning farmland to forests and grasslands based on ensuring food security so as to realize the integration of carbon source and carbon sink during the study period from the perspective of mainland china the amount of carbon emission reduction increased from 2 42 104 t co2e to 847 44 104 t co2e guangdong s carbon emission reduction changed significantly based on grain transportation the amount of carbon emission increasing is 29 32 104 t in 2000 while the amount of carbon emission reduction is 343 26 104 t in 2017 fig 10 in addition tianjin and shanxi changed from carbon emission reduction regions to carbon emission increasing regions while zhejiang fujian guangxi and hainan all changed from carbon emission increasing regions to carbon emission reduction regions carrying out relevant measures to achieve carbon emission reduction is an issue that needs to be focused on such as the rational input of production factors like chemical fertilizers and the comprehensive consideration of the geographical location of farmland and weather conditions to develop appropriate grain planting structure experimental studies have found that under the same management practices the experimental yield of crops is higher than the actual yield of farmers the difference can be attributed to extreme weather conditions crop diseases and sub optimal management factors wang et al 2018a production factors such as fuels inorganic fertilizers and pesticides used in wheat and maize production produce a large amount of carbon emissions however by calculating the carbon footprint of the crop production system it is found that the carbon footprint of crops can be effectively reduced through comprehensive improvement of crop farming methods or promotion of organic agriculture gan et al 2014 searchinger et al 2018 there is direct carbon emission in the process of grain production but indirect carbon emission is generated when considering inter regional grain transportation some regions reduce their own carbon emission through grain transportation but increase the carbon emission of grain producing areas therefore environmental protection behind carbon emissions is a sustainable development direction that should be considered in all regions smith et al 2019 xu et al 2020 in addition in view of the difference of agricultural production conditions and environmental protection policies in each region the means of production input and carbon emission management methods in the process of grain production are also different which will lead to different final carbon emission 4 1 3 challenges and opportunities faced by china in water saving and carbon emission reduction ensuring grain security water security and low carbon agriculture simultaneously is an important guarantee for sustainable development despite the water and land resources are relative scarcity china feeds 22 of the world s population with 9 of its arable land and 6 of its freshwater resources in 2020 when the covid 19 epidemic was raging china s per capita grain supply exceeded 470 kg significantly exceeding the international grain security standard of 400 kg while ensuring china s own grain security it is imperative to actively maintain world grain security and it is even more important to achieve water conservation and carbon emission reduction based on ensuring grain security from the perspective of mainland china from 2000 to 2017 the amount of water saving and emission reduction continued to grow however if the regional water saving and carbon emission reduction situation is comprehensively analyzed there are some differences in each province take beijing as an example in 2017 based on the grain transfer in beijing achieved 19 42 104 t co2e carbon emission reduction but at the same time 1 50 108 m3 water resource waste one of the main reasons for this phenomenon is the grain direction of transportation because beijing has higher water use efficiency and lower water consumption per unit of grain whether beijing transport grain in and how to improve water use efficiency of grain transfer out regions need to be further improved contrary to the situation in beijing in 2017 anhui s grain transfer achieved water conservation but carbon emissions increased the main reason was that compared with grain trade objects anhui s grain production process had higher carbon emissions anhui s planting structure is mainly concentrated in two crops of rice and wheat and the planting area is large and the amount of nitrogen fertilizer application in the planting process is relatively larger in 2017 xinjiang s grain transportation caused it to waste 0 66 108 m3 of water resources and increase carbon emission by 0 70 104 co2e which is an obvious unsustainable phenomenon although xinjiang s grain transportation ensures the grain security of its trading provinces xinjiang needs to consider its current situation of water resources and carbon emission and achieve sustainable development by improving planting patterns and input of production materials in order to reduce carbon emission during grain cultivation first of all it is necessary to consider reducing the application of carbon emission sources such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides and then agricultural greenhouse gas sinks must be enhanced or newly created since each carbon emission mitigation measure has different effects on different gasses formulating and adopting different measures for different gasses are necessary so as to formulate greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies for china s agricultural ecosystems based on ensuring food security guo and zhou 2007 wang et al 2018a the inter provincial grain transportation in mainland china triggered the inter regional transfer of water resources and carbon emission then due to the differences in water carbon footprint of grain production between regions status of water saving and emission reduction in the context of grain transport come into being and each province is facing with different challenges and opportunities fig 11 water saving and emission reduction exist in inter regional grain transport but it s also imperative to carry out water saving and emission reduction in the process of grain planting in grain producing areas in terms of water saving for example the grain producing areas need to consider their own water soil resource endowment and economic status as a whole to plant grain crops and then optimize water saving irrigation technology to save water then improve grain types and grain planting structure through remote sensing technology in terms of carbon emission reduction the grain producing areas should consider applying organic fertilizer firstly and then apply appropriate types and quantities of fertilizer according to crop types 4 2 study s limitations and directions for future research 4 2 1 water carbon coupling mechanism based on socio hydrology perspective socio hydrology emerged under the coupling of human and water hall 2019 thinks that current research on socio hydrology appears to be fragmentary dealing with specific issues in specific situations rather than in depth study representing a social level which appears to be some fragments of a larger conundrum hall may be right but perhaps the evolution of socio hydrology is based on the integration of many fragmented related studies because socio hydrology is to study the mutual feedback relationship and co evolution process of human water coupled systems so its research content and research scope are relatively wide so this study carried out agricultural water carbon coupling research based on existing socio hydrology related researches based on existing researches water is regard as a link to connect socio hydrology with the water carbon coupling system at present china s grain production is facing major dual pressures on the one hand producing more grain to feed the growing regional population on the other hand achieving water saving and carbon emission reduction based on ensuring grain security the factors affecting the inter regional grain transportation can be roughly divided into three aspects fig 12 in terms of natural system regional climate change and water soil resource differences will lead to regional difference in grain planting structure and then lead to inter regional grain transportation in terms of social system regional difference in population policy and custom will lead to regional difference in grain demand and then lead to inter regional grain transportation in terms of economic system regional gdp national income difference and other factors will lead to change in regional industrial pattern agriculture industry and service and then lead to change in agricultural production and grain yield sun et al 2022 under the influence of many social and hydrological factors the interregional grain transportation will lead to the redistribution of water resource and carbon emission because in the process of grain planting the precipitation and irrigation water used for crop growth will flow from the grain producing areas to the grain shortage areas along with the grain transportation therefore the grain shortage areas will apply more local water resource to non agricultural industries based on ensuring food security during the growth of grain crop the input of production factors such as chemical fertilizer and pesticide will lead to carbon emission from soil and crop while the increase of co2 concentration in the atmosphere will affect the biological and abiotic condition in the soil such as microbial activity and soil water content and then affect the growth of crop resulting in water carbon coupling effect pendall et al 2004 van groenigen et al 2011 the existence of water carbon coupling effect triggers the difference of industrial structure among regions and the nature society economy system of each region also makes corresponding response thus forming a social hydrological cycle system this study may be a small part of the development of socio hydrology which has some limitations so it needs more detailed and rigorous further research 4 2 2 limitations and directions for future research theoretically this study can provide a relatively strong reference for scholars in the field of water carbon for agricultural production in terms of research ideas and research methods practically it can also provide a reference for relevant policy makers and farmers about water resources use and carry out relevant agricultural measures in the process of grain production even so this study also has some limitations firstly since there is no data related to inter provincial grain trade volume and trade direction in mainland china this study calculates inter provincial grain transport volume and transportation direction based on the population and geographical distance of each province using social equity method so there is a certain degree of error in inter provincial grain virtual water flow then based on the relevant research of socio hydrology the impact of natural social and economic factors on the water carbon coupling system was analyzed qualitatively based on grain production from the perspective of socio hydrology based on the limitations of the research the subsequent research should comprehensively consider the current research on inter provincial grain virtual water flow in china and carefully examine the methods used by each research so as to further accurately calculate inter provincial grain transportation volume dang et al 2015 wu et al 2018 d odorico et al 2020 at the same time based on qualitative research the influence of natural social and economic factors on the water carbon coupling system in the background of inter regional grain transportation need to be quantitatively analyzed by referring to relevant literatures sivapalan and blöschl 2015 hall 2019 wu et al 2019 5 conclusion the grain planting in mainland china was mainly concentrated in the northeast and the huang huai hai plain the grain sown area and grain yield in henan are at the highest level in china from 2000 to 2020 the grain sown area increased from 7743 7 103 ha to 10 168 3 103 ha and the grain yield increased from 3669 7 104 t to 6631 8 104 t from 2000 to 2017 the inter provincial grain virtual water flow increased year by year and the total inter provincial flow increased from 717 4 108 m3 to 1472 6 108 m3 heilongjiang and guangdong are the provinces with the largest amount of grain virtual water outflow and inflow respectively in terms of carbon emission from grain planting and virtual carbon flow the amount of carbon emission in northeast heilongjiang and jilin and the huang huai hai plain shandong jiangsu henan and anhui were large during the study period relatively henan has the largest carbon emission increased from 4324 4 104 t co2e to 6617 3 104 t co2e and the carbon emission reduction trend of fujian is obvious decreased from 1222 9 104 t co2e to 793 6 104 t co2e during the study period in addition the northwest and southwest regions have lower carbon emission from 2000 to 2017 the inter provincial grain virtual carbon flow in mainland china increased from 2362 7 104 t co2e to 12 680 6 104 t co2e heilongjiang is the province with the largest amount of grain virtual carbon outflow which increased from 449 9 104 t co2e to 4818 3 104 t co2e during the study period guangdong is the province with the largest amount of grain virtual carbon inflow which increased from 624 1 104 t co2e to 3487 6 104 t co2e in terms of water saving and carbon emission reduction based on grain transportation the overall situation of water saving and carbon emission reduction in china showed that the amount of water saving increased from 25 6 108 m3 to 77 0 108 m3 and the carbon emission reduction increased from 2 4 104 t co2e to 847 4 104 t co2e inter regional differences in climate change irrigation patterns planting structures input of production materials the management system of relevant departments and relevant regional policies will all affect the water saving and carbon emission reduction effects brought by inter regional grain transportation from the perspective of socio hydrology the regions could optimize the integration of water saving carbon emission reduction and sustainable development based on optimizing the grain planting structure according to their own climatic condition soil and water resource condition and socioeconomic condition the study can provide a relatively powerful reference for the improvement of regional grain trade pattern and the regulation of water saving and carbon emission reduction mechanism as well as provide a basis for the relevant policy makers to improve policies or regulations and a reference for farmers to improve the grain planting structure and optimize the input of production materials contributions jingxin sun analyzed

14908,direct interspecies electron transfer diet has been demonstrated to be an efficient type of mutualism in methanogenesis however few studies have reported its presence in mixed microbial communities and its trigger mechanism in the natural environment and engineered systems here we reported diet like mutualism of geobacter and methanogens in the planktonic microbiome for the first time in anaerobic electrochemical digestion aed fed with propionate potentially triggered by excessive cathodic hydrogen 56 times higher than the lowest under the electrochemical condition in contrast with model prediction without diet the highest current density and hydrogen and methane production were concurrently observed at 0 2 v where an abundance of geobacter 49 and extracellular electron transfer genes were identified in the planktonic microbiome via metagenomic analysis metagenomic assembly genomes annotated to geobacter anodireducens were identified alongside two methanogens methanothrix harundinacea and methanosarcina mazei which were previously identified to participate in diet this discovery revealed that diet like mutualism could be triggered without external conductive materials highlighting its potentially ubiquitous presence such mutualism simultaneously boosted methane and hydrogen production thereby demonstrating the potential of aed in engineering applications graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords direct interspecies electron transfer methanogenesis geobacter anodireducens anaerobic digestion mutualism data availability the shotgun sequence data for the nine metagenomes and the 23 metagenomics assembly genome sequences generated in this study are deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive under bioproject prjna845914 1 introduction microbial methanogenesis is an ancient and universal metabolism that is vital in natural anaerobic food chains and engineered systems such as anaerobic digestion ad appels et al 2008 in such systems complex organics are fermented to various volatile fatty acids vfas however only formate and acetate are directly utilized by methanogens longer chain acids such as propionate and butyrate rely on interspecies syntrophy for further degradation owing to thermodynamic barriers mcinerney et al 2009 schink 1997 interspecies hydrogen transfer iht is crucial for such a relationship because the partial pressure of hydrogen must be maintained at a substantially low level 1 pa stams and plugge 2009 to facilitate vfa oxidation in addition interspecies formate transfer ift and direct interspecies electron transfer diet have been reported as alternatives to iht in methanogenetic syntrophy lovley 2017 which are considered as competing processes depending on the conditions owing to the omission of interspecies electron carriers diet is a more efficient method of syntrophy compared with iht and ift storck et al 2015 diet has attracted considerable attention in diverse natural and engineering systems and studies have reported enhanced methane production after inserting polarized electrodes into ad reactors a process known as anaerobic electrochemical digestion aed premier et al 2013 sangeetha et al 2017 such processes provide additional energy from the applied voltage yan and wang 2022 or anodic potential and are believed to enhance diet wang et al 2020 diet relies on conductive filaments and other electron channels that link electroactive bacteria to methanogens lovley 2017 with different conductive materials reported to enhance these connections and electron transfer in defined cocultures of specific methanogens and geobacter spp as well as in mixed culture systems martins et al 2018 mei et al 2018 rotaru et al 2018 syntrophic methanogenesis between g metallireducens and methanosaeta spp based on ethanol was reported in a brewery wastewater digester rotaru et al 2014a however there exists limited knowledge regarding the comparison of the trigger mechanism of diet and traditional iht in such systems in aed systems methanogens are commonly suspended in the bulk far from electrodes and the electroactive microbiome is primarily observed on the electrode surface dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 siegert et al 2015 wang et al 2020 yu et al 2018 syntrophic iht activity requires an extremely low hydrogen partial pressure for maintenance however the hydrogen constantly generated from the cathodic reaction might hinder this process therefore we hypothesize that if a large amount of hydrogen is supplied in situ via cathode electrolysis wang et al 2021 it will break the iht based syntrophy shift the interspecies electron transfer pathway inhibit vfa degradation and may eventually influence the methane production rate hence considering its higher efficiency diet could be a potential alternative to iht in such a situation storck et al 2015 however to the best of our knowledge no studies have explored this possibility therefore in this study using propionate as a model substrate and the sole carbon source we present a combined approach integrating experimental investigation metagenomics and mathematical modeling to elucidate the microbial mutualism in such conditions we operated a series of aed systems at different anodic potentials and identified the possible mutualism between electroactive microorganisms and methanogens with boosted gas production biofilm and suspension samples were collected and whole genome metagenomic analysis was performed which provided fundamental insights into the possible mechanisms of interspecies electron transfer according to functional gene profiles and key metagenomic assembly genome analysis and to verify the influence of merely hydrogen non electrochemical batch systems fed with propionate with additional hydrogen were investigated then a pure culture experiment with g anodireducens sd 1 was conducted to confirm the metabolic potential found by the metagenomic analysis in addition with the goal of advancing fundamental understanding of the experimental observation we utilized multispecies modeling to test the dynamic interactions among complex metabolic groups 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor construction inoculation and operation in total three sets of experiment were conducted 1 the mix culture aed systems with four different potentials to explore the impact of bioelectrohydrogen fig s1a the inoculum was a mixture of microbial fuel cell mfc suspended effluent and anaerobic sludge that was obtained from a brewery wastewater treatment plant the mfc had been operated with propionate for 2 years yan et al 2020 and the anaerobic sludge was collected from the anaerobic digestor of the tianjin snow brewery utilizing 16s rrna sequencing as previously described yan et al 2020 the microbial community of the inoculum fig s1b was analyzed the sludge was initially bubbled using mix gas n2 co2 4 1 for 1 h and acclimated with 50 mm propionate per week for 2 months before inoculation the 300 ml of inoculum contained 55 sludge and 45 mfc effluent media containing 50 mm phosphate buffer saline and trace metals as previously described yan et al 2020 and 50 mm propionate was added to the sludge to generate a total volume of 550 ml at an anodic potential of 0 2 v to 0 1 v vs ag agcl poised by a four channel potentiostat multi autolab m204 metrohm netherlands the reactor comprised an anode working electrode 81 64 cm2 a cathode stainless steel mesh and a reference electrode ag agcl 2 a non electrochemical batch experiment on a series of 100 ml constantly shaking serum bottles to explore the role of hydrogen 20 mm propionate and 30 hydrogen or pure nitrogen gas in the headspace were used the same inoculum as in the aeds was used for batch experiments 3 a pure culture microbial electrolysis cell with geobacter anodireducens sd 1 pure culture to confirm the metabolic potential of geobacter the mecs was inoculated and operated as previously described tian et al 2022 all reactors were operated in an incubator at 303 k information regarding the reactors configuration and operation is detailed in section 1 of the supporting information 2 2 chemical and electrochemical analyses samples for vfa analysis were collected using 1 ml syringes they were then centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 10 min and filtered using a 0 22 μm membrane next they were analyzed via gas chromatography flame ionization detector gc fid fl 9790ii fuli instrument zhejiang china using a 30 m 1 0 μm 0 53 mm column kb innowax kromat corporation new jersey usa the gas was quantified using gas chromatography thermal conductivity detector gc tcd fl 9790ii fuli instrument zhejiang china the average production rate was calculated by dividing the production volume with the sampling time cyclic voltammetry was conducted in the steady state of microbial growth in the potential range of 0 6 v to 0 2 v versus ag agcl with a scan rate of 1 mv s 1 using multi autolab m204 the parameters of detection are detailed in section 1 in the supporting information 2 3 metagenomic analysis the samples for metagenomic analysis were collected separately from the suspension and biofilm in four aed systems except for the open circuit control whose electrode was unable to provide enough biomass for dna extraction suspension samples were collected after scratching the anodic biofilm to avoid contamination moreover the dna collected from the cathode surface was insufficient for metagenomic analysis indicating that cathodic methanogenesis did not dominate our system dna sequencing was conducted by novogene beijing china the data were analyzed by the authors based on the clean data provided a methodology combining both read based and metagenome assembled genome mag based approaches was designed fig s2 afgan et al 2018 bankevich et al 2012 kanehisa et al 2016 li et al 2009 olm et al 2017 2020 patro et al 2017 seemann 2014 tanizawa et al 2018 von meijenfeldt et al 2019 wu et al 2016 first based on reads annotation with a reference database the taxa composition was preliminarily analyzed principal coordinate analysis pca was performed on the read based taxa composition then de novo assembly was conducted on the reads to construct draft mags based on dereplication and profiling key mags were identified for whole genome annotation the key marker genes were identified by comparing the annotated coding sequence with genes of interest summarized from the kegg pathway database du et al 2021 table s1 to profile their relative abundance and functional gene variation these marker genes were mapped back to the original read library the identified key mags were also annotated with regard to the presence of functional genes and taxonomy information the detailed descriptions of all the tools employed in this study are detailed in the supporting information section 2 data analysis and visualization was performed using r packages ggplot2 villanueva and chen 2019 vegan oksanen et al 2013 circlize gu et al 2014 and ggtree yu 2020 2 4 model description and sensitivity tests to explore the possibility that electrode potential would thermodynamically influence the methane production without diet modeling investigation was conducted based on merely ift and iht the one dimensional multispecies model was based on our previous study involving the simulation of propionate electricity conversion in the microbial electrolysis cell mec yan et al 2021 the model framework is a combination of modified nernst monod kinetics of electroactive biofilm lee et al 2016 molecular diffusion kato marcus et al 2007 and thermodynamic based microbial energetics liang et al 2019 wilson and kim 2016 dividing the system into suspension and biofilm bioreactions this dynamic model considered seven bioreactions in the suspension 1 hydrogen producing propionate fermentation 2 formate producing propionate fermentation 3 hydrogenotrophic acetogenesis 4 methylotrophic acetogenesis 5 aceticlastic methanogenesis 6 hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and 7 methylotrophic methanogenesis and two reactions in the biofilm 1 hydrogenotrophic electrogenesis and 2 aceticlastic electrogenesis fig s12 in addition the gibbs free energy of each bioreaction was calculated and used to determine the microbial yield coefficient at each time step as a constraint wilson and kim 2016 an extra energy term provided by the anodic potential n f e a n o d e was added to the two biofilm reactions wilson and kim 2016 the initial simulation was calibrated based on the findings of our previous work yan et al 2021 based on the corresponding steady current density and using methane and hydrogen production as the index a sensitivity test was conducted at a relatively wide range of 0 6 to 1 0 v vs ag agcl a detailed description of the model hypothesis fig s11 mathematical expression section 10 initial simulation and sensitivity test fig s12 and parameters table s5 is present in the supporting information to test our hypothesis and as the mathematical expression of diet in dynamic modeling remains unsolved we assumed diet as a negligible process and there was no direct interaction between the biofilm and suspension in this model 3 results 3 1 simultaneous enhancement of methane and hydrogen production at 0 2 v to operate the aed systems four electrode potentials were selected 0 2 0 1 0 and 0 1 v along with an open circuit control oc these systems were constantly operated until the current and gas production were highly repeatable in consecutive cycles gas production has been shown in table 1 oc exhibited an average methane production rate of 6 3 2 µl h 1 in the whole cycle fig 1 a among all reactors with poised potential the reactor operating at 0 v demonstrated the lowest methane production rate at 1 3 0 04 µl h 1 while the system operating at 0 2 v showed the highest rate at 132 11 µl h 1 100 times higher than the 0 v system the reactor operating at 0 1 v produced 102 12 µl h of methane interestingly the reactor operating at 0 2 v also showed the highest hydrogen production 146 3 7 µl h which is approximately three times higher than the one operating at 0 1 v 49 0 02 µl h the amount of hydrogen produced at 0 v and 0 1 v was very small 2 6 0 04 µl h and 7 5 2 µl h respectively similar to methane in mecs with similar operational conditions cathode material stainless steel mesh and anode substrate acetate as well as at a similar current density range the cathode potential was 0 6 v to 0 9 v vs she ribot llobet et al 2013 zhang et al 2010 this was more negative than e0 0 41 v of hydrogen evolution thus the cathodic hydrogen evolution namely bioelectrohydrogen different from the hydrogen from fermentation is thermodynamical favorable in the aed systems the complete current densities of the three consecutive cycles were shown in fig s3a the reactor operating at 0 2 v exhibited the highest current density reaching a maximum of 1 97 a m 2 after 74 h and eventually stabilizing at 0 99 a m fig 1b the 0 1 v reactor exhibited a lower current density of 0 70 a m the reactor operating at 0 v exhibited the fastest growth which began increasing after 15 h to a peak of 0 81 a m and stabilizing at 0 51 a m cyclic voltammetries at steady stage confirmed that the electroactive biofilm in the aed operating at 0 2 v had the highest electrochemical activity with the peak current of 0 01 a however the main extracellular electron transfer eet pathways in each system might be changed because different middle point potentials were recognized in derivative cyclic voltammetries fig s3 strycharz et al 2011 another possible intermediate formate was also profiled fig s4 showing a concentration of 0 032 0 004 mmol l 1 during the operation and demonstrated no difference among the different potentials therefore ift was considered a nondominant pathway in terms of propionate degradation the reactors operating at 0 1 v to 0 1 v and oc were faster during the initial 65 h depicting more than twice the propionate removal at 0 2 v in the same timeframe fig 1c such a phenomenon at 0 2 v corresponded to hydrogen accumulation indicating that the abiotic hydrogen originating from the cathodic process inhibited propionate fermentation fig 1a interestingly acetate accumulation of 3 7 0 9 mmol l 1 also occurred after 24 h under this potential fig 1c which was not observed in the other systems till 65 h considering the high current density acetate generated form planktonic fermentation was probably mostly utilized by electroactive bacteria rather than acetolactic methanogens according to electron balance calculation acetate oxidation mainly contributed to the anodic current rather than hydrogen recycling table s2 electron losses in the other systems where propionate was also massively degraded could be attributed to other possible microbial processes in the sludge considering its exceptionally high biomass content and microbial diversity see section 6 in the supporting information as the propionate fermentation was inhibited the early accumulation of acetate at 0 2 v might have been due to the growth of homoacetogenesis thereby warranting further investigation in conventional ads hydrogen generated from fermentation is utilized for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis therefore hydrogen and methane production in ad cannot be expected to occur concurrently however hydrogen production and methanogenesis was promoted in these aed systems especially at 0 2 v the excess and constant hydrogen generation in aeds could be only resulted from the cathodic process as the hydrogen generating propionate fermentation requires low hydrogen partial pressure further the degradation of propionate embedded in a hydrogen enriched environment indicated a different pathway fig 1 in terms of electrochemical activity the aed at 0 v showed the fastest growth and second highest current density however its methane production rate was 100 times lower than that at 0 2 v conversely the aed at 0 1 v showed 77 of the methane production at 0 2 v however the current density and hydrogen production rates were significantly lower overall the hydrogen production was basically in proportion to the current indicating that the hydrogen mainly came from cathodic process according to the faraday s law i e bioelectrohydrogen therefore the cathodic methanogenesis with direct electron acceptance and the fermentation generated hydrogen could be ruled out as the dominant processes more interestingly the slowest propionate degradation and earliest acetate accumulation also occurred at a potential of 0 2 v fig 1c these findings indicate a different methanogenic pathway occurring at 0 2 v which was potentially associated with the excess bioelectrohydrogen thus metagenomic analysis was conducted to elucidate how and why such a difference was triggered 3 2 high abundance of geobacter and eet genes in the suspension of the 0 2 v system samples were collected separately from the biofilm and suspended microbiome and analyzed using whole genome metagenomic analysis segata et al 2012 read based taxonomy annotation at the genus level demonstrated that in the biofilm the typical electroactive bacteria geobacter predominated 62 95 in each sample indicating a key role in current generation of geobacter fig 2 a the potential electrogen acinetobacter liao et al 2018 showed only in the biofilm at 0 2 v which also indicated a probable unique process the dominant genus was methanothrix formally methanosaeta 20 38 in the suspension where methanogenesis hypothetically happened the proportion of this genus dropped by 40 in conventional ad compared with aeds suggesting that the dominant methanogen varied in response to the applied voltage compared to the low abundance of geobacter in the suspension samples from reactors poised at other potentials 4 8 the unexpectedly high abundance 49 of geobacter in the suspension of the 0 2 v system was especially noteworthy as it had not been previously reported however geobacter did not exhibit dominant status in the inoculum fig s1b neither in the mfc suspension 0 5 0 1 nor in the ad sludge 10 5 such coexistence potentially suggests a new pathway of diet based methanogenesis in the suspension as methanothrix has been reported to be capable of performing diet with geobacter rotaru et al 2014b this hypothesis helped to explain the surprisingly high methanogenesis activity accompanied by a high level of hydrogen accumulation in the 0 2 v system fig 1a pca revealed that in terms of beta diversity the biofilm samples at 0 2 v and 0 v showed the greatest similarity while the suspensions at 0 2 v and 0 v were located far away from each fig 2b this also corresponds to the similar electrochemical activity and the difference in methane production observed in these two systems fig 1 the typical hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanoculleus xu et al 2021 showed the highest abundance in the suspension at 0 v indicating a possible dominant iht in such condition therefore the difference between the suspensions at 0 2 v and 0 v might provide vital information regarding the simultaneous enhancement of methanogenesis and electrochemical activity these two systems were focused on the mag analysis discussion regarding the systems at 0 1 v and 0 1 v is present in the supporting information fig s5 s9 and s10 named per the order of assembly there were 43 12 de novo assembled mags in the biofilm and 78 10 in the suspension mags after dereplication were profiled and selected based on abundance coverage and taxa annotation with 23 key mags selected for further investigation fig s6 and s7 the relative abundance of the interesting genes based on the gene annotation of these mags table s1 is illustrated in fig 2c corresponding to mag annotation genes coding type c outer membrane cytochromes omcytc such as omcf omcs and omcb were abundant in the biofilm samples and suspensions at 0 2 v b 0 2 v and s 0 2 v but not among the top 30 abundant genes in the other suspended microbiomes fig 2c and s9 the biofilm at 0 2 v and 0 v b 0 2 v and b 0 v possessed more than thrice the abundance of omcytc genes 9464 3372 transcript per million tpm than the other biofilms 3056 848 tpm in addition omcytc genes exhibited a relatively high abundance 2639 443 tpm in s 0 2 v indicating a possible diet based syntrophy in this microbiome if we assume the genes participating in diet were the same as those participating in eet lovley 2017 genes related to type iv pilus assembly protein such as pilp exhibited similar trends with regard to propionate metabolism genes participating in the methylmanonyl coa pathway were abundant in all the samples fig s9 the dominant hydrogen formation gene associated with propionate degradation in biofilm samples was uxs averaging 11 477 3327 tpm in b 0 2 v and b 0 v and was also relatively high in s 0 2 v 2903 tpm but was not among the top 30 genes in s 0 v methanogenesis associated genes demonstrated similar trends more discussion regarding the gene profile is present in supporting information section 7 table s4 and fig s9 the distinctive distribution of these genes indicates that the dominant microbial function in the suspension and biofilm was different at 0 v similar trends were observed at 0 1 v and 0 1 v fig s9 however in the suspension of 0 2 v the predominant pathways were more similar in suspension and biofilm than at other potentials the high abundance of geobacter spp and omcytc genes in both the suspension and biofilm at 0 2 v further support the mutualism hypothesis based on the experimental observation and indicate potential diet in such a system 3 3 diet like mutualism between geobacter anodireducens and methanogens the selected 23 mags were annotated to seven species with an average nucleotide identity ani threshold of 90 fig 3 a corresponding to the reads based taxonomy composition in fig 2a mags annotated to g anodireducens b 0 1v 002 b 0v 001 b 0 1v 001 and b 0 2v 002 showed relatively higher abundance 0 7 1 3 in the biofilm samples particularly in the 0 v biofilm the highest abundance 2 8 and coverage 1238 6 among all mags indicated that the microbial community was highly dominated by g anodireducens mags annotated to azoarcus communis b 0 1v 001 and b 0 2v 004 also exhibited high abundance 1 2 0 7 indicating a potentially important role in the aed system operated at 0 2 v the highly enriched geobacter 49 in the suspension was also annotated to g anodireducens 0 7 s 0 2v 001 accompanied by another widely distributed bacteria azonexus hydrophilus mags annotated to methanogens generally showed low abundance and coverage probably owing to their relatively larger genome size in the calculation see section 6 in the supporting information in all the suspension samples there were mags annotated to methanothrix harundinacea with an average abundance of 0 02 0 007 and average coverage of 11 1 4 however merely in s 0 2 v a mag annotated to methanosarcina mazei s 0 2v 043 average abundance of 0 02 and coverage of 6 2 was identified in the suspension a mag annotated to proteinclasticum ruminis b 0 2v 007 with an abundance of 0 1 and coverage of 37 0 in b 0 2 v was detected and annotated with acetogenesis related genes fig s10d indicating a unique bioprocess in such a system ani coverages and relative abundances of these mags are listed in table s4 these experimental and metagenomic results suggest a potential role played by g anodireducens in cooperation with methanogens at 0 2 v to further investigate such a possibility genomes annotated to g anodireducens m harundinacea and m mazei were annotated with functional genes genes related to type c outer membrane cytochromes such as omcb and omcs were merely identified in mags annotated to g anodireducens b 0 2v 002 b 0v 001 s 0 2v 001 however genes related to type iv pilus assembly protein were also annotated to m harundinacea s 0 2v 025 s 0v 041 and m mazei s 0 2v 043 such as pilm fig 3b gene pilq pilo and piln were annotated only in s 0 2v 043 m mazei but not in those mags as m harundinacea type iv pilus was previously reported to be important for the diet of methanogens thus the unique mag at 0 2 v s 0 2v 043 showed a higher potential to form a syntrophic relationship with b 0 2v 002 this fact also corresponded to a previous report regarding m mazei in co occurrence with geobacteraceae supposedly participating in diet yee and rotaru 2020 zheng et al 2015a genes related to methylotrophic methanogenesis were merely identified in s 0 2v 043 fig 3b probably as a response to the high hydrogen and methane accumulation at 0 2 v conversely the presence of methylmanonyl coa pathway a key pathway in propionate metabolism in s 0 2v 001 suggested the possible propionate metabolism conducted by g anodireducens to confirm the propionate utilizing potential of g anodireducens pure culture mecs were operated as shown in fig 3c the maximum current density was 0 0034 0 0008 a m when merely fed with 20 mm propionate in comparison the maximum current density generated was 5 03 1 5 a m when fed by propionate with an additional 1 mm of acetate assuming the current was completely generated from acetate the coulombic efficiency would exceed 636 additionally the coulombic efficiency would be 19 which is relatively reasonable if we calculate the coulombic efficiency based on both propionate and acetate this observation preliminarily suggested that g anodireducens was capable of propionate utilization if there was a slight amount of acetate to initialize its growth vfa monitoring in such a system also indicated that propionate was continuously degraded till 16 within 12 d when 1 mm acetate was exhausted fig s13 these observations indicate the metabolic potential of g anodireducens m mazei and m harundinacea to form a mutualism based on diet as a response to the high bioelectrohydrogen accumulation at 0 2 v 4 discussion to assess if diet like mutualism was necessary in promoting methane production a multispecies dynamic model based on iht and ift was established assuming that there was no direct interaction between the biofilm and suspension fig s11 sensitivity tests on such a model indicated that most propionate ended up as methane at a more negative potential 0 5 to 0 1 v whereas electrons generated by propionate fermentation were primarily converted into current via acetate at a more positive potential 0 1 v to 0 5 v fig s12e however in terms of the experimental results shown above at 0 2 v the anodic respiration and methanogenesis were synergistically boosted generating not only the highest current density 1 97 a m but also the highest methane production rate at 132 11µl h fig 1 in comparison with the same end product aed systems operated at other potentials and the open circuit condition generated methane in a much lower rate with rapid propionate degradation indicating that unknown metabolism other than iht was occurring in the suspended community at 0 2 v fig 1a c metagenomic analysis revealed an interestingly high abundance 49 of the typical exoelectrogen reguera and kashefi 2019 geobacter in the suspension at 0 2 v fig 2a which also dominated all the biofilm samples 62 95 the mag assembled from this suspended sample with the highest abundance 0 7 was annotated to g anodireducens fig 3a omcytc genes including omcs were recognized as the core of eet in anodic respiration filman et al 2019 ishii et al 2018 while the abundance of omcytc genes in the suspension at 0 2 v was 36 times higher than that of other suspended microbiomes fig 3b the abundance of genes related to the wood ljungdahl pathway in b 0 2 v and b 0 v was notable fig 2c which was probably a consequence of the dominant status of geobacter in these two microbiomes as these abundant genes were annotated in b 0 2v 002 and b 0v 001 fig s10 these genes did not represent much difference between 0 2 and 0 v and therefore could hardly explain the difference in methane production potential methanogen mags assembled from this sample were annotated to methanothrix harundinacea and methanosarcina mazei fig 3a these methanogens were previously reported to be capable of accepting electrons from geobacter spp rotaru et al 2018 2014a yee and rotaru 2020 zhao et al 2018 zheng et al 2015b especially the assembled m mazei which held more type iv pili genes and only appeared in s 0 2 v based on all these observations it is reasonable to consider that a diet like mutualism exists between g anodireducens and methanogens that metabolizes propionate which has not been reported in the planktonic mixed microbial community in the literature in addition to the surprisingly high methane and current generation the reactor operating at 0 2 v exhibited the highest hydrogen accumulation 146 3 7 µl h and the earliest acetate accumulation among all the conditions revealing the possibility of propionate utilization in geobacter species recently g metalireducens was reported to utilize propionate with g sulfurreducens as the electron acceptor in an mec shi et al 2021 here propionate metabolism genes such as those participating in the methylmanonyl coa pathway were identified in mags annotated as g anodireducens fig 3a with relatively high abundance fig 2c in the suspension at 0 2 v however g anodireducens has not been reported to be capable of metabolizing propionate directly pure culture mec investigation further supported the hypothesis that g anodireducens is capable of metabolizing propionate when a slight amount of acetate exists as the initiator fig 3c such an assumption also corresponds to the fact that the earliest acetate accumulation occurred at 0 2 v fig 1c and the only potential acetogen of p ruminis was identified at 0 2 v who was annotated with the acetogenesis genes fig 3a and fig s10d a possible mechanism to explain this observation is that at this potential a high electrochemical activity caused high hydrogen accumulation triggering the hydrogenotrophic acetogenesis process the produced extra acetate then initialized the propionate metabolism of g anodireducens which was already actively conducting eet on the anodic biofilm and then enriched in the suspension and formed a diet like mutualism with m mazei or m harundinacea engendering an extraordinarily high methane production rate fig 1c eventually propionate was utilized directly in current generation and methanogenesis with a higher efficiency than the hydrogen or acetate mediated pattern fig 4 batch experiments with 30 hydrogen in the headspace did not introduce a boost in the geobacter abundance all samples remained an abundance of 6 8 1 6 with no significant increase compared to the inoculum in a duration of 10 days supplementary fig s14 demonstrating that merely extra hydrogen was not sufficient to trigger such mutualism and the influence of electrochemical condition was necessarily needed however we recognize that there are multiple possible pathways and an in depth investigation of the mechanism requires further confirmation such as by using defined coculture experiments of g anodireducens m mazei and m harundinacea in situ imaging of the microbial consortia e g aggregates of geobacter and methanogens and mutagenic studies 5 conclusions the findings of this study suggest an alternative to iht potentially involving diet which might help to better understand and improve methanogenesis in engineering systems microbial electrochemical technologies are promising for improving ad performance however they are limited by the electrode area because electroactive bacteria are believed to reside only on the electrode our findings in this study reveal that the influence of the electrode planktonic microbial communities can be much greater via gas production and prompt microbial mutualism by utilizing the electrode potential as a regulator it is possible to promote microbial communities with enhanced methanogenesis and hydrogen evolution and our results show that methane production could be enhanced two fold via planktonic mutualism of geobacter and methanogens moreover the proposed mutualistic model indicates the potential importance of electroactive bacteria and diet in propionate metabolism as well as new pathways to

14908,direct interspecies electron transfer diet has been demonstrated to be an efficient type of mutualism in methanogenesis however few studies have reported its presence in mixed microbial communities and its trigger mechanism in the natural environment and engineered systems here we reported diet like mutualism of geobacter and methanogens in the planktonic microbiome for the first time in anaerobic electrochemical digestion aed fed with propionate potentially triggered by excessive cathodic hydrogen 56 times higher than the lowest under the electrochemical condition in contrast with model prediction without diet the highest current density and hydrogen and methane production were concurrently observed at 0 2 v where an abundance of geobacter 49 and extracellular electron transfer genes were identified in the planktonic microbiome via metagenomic analysis metagenomic assembly genomes annotated to geobacter anodireducens were identified alongside two methanogens methanothrix harundinacea and methanosarcina mazei which were previously identified to participate in diet this discovery revealed that diet like mutualism could be triggered without external conductive materials highlighting its potentially ubiquitous presence such mutualism simultaneously boosted methane and hydrogen production thereby demonstrating the potential of aed in engineering applications graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords direct interspecies electron transfer methanogenesis geobacter anodireducens anaerobic digestion mutualism data availability the shotgun sequence data for the nine metagenomes and the 23 metagenomics assembly genome sequences generated in this study are deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive under bioproject prjna845914 1 introduction microbial methanogenesis is an ancient and universal metabolism that is vital in natural anaerobic food chains and engineered systems such as anaerobic digestion ad appels et al 2008 in such systems complex organics are fermented to various volatile fatty acids vfas however only formate and acetate are directly utilized by methanogens longer chain acids such as propionate and butyrate rely on interspecies syntrophy for further degradation owing to thermodynamic barriers mcinerney et al 2009 schink 1997 interspecies hydrogen transfer iht is crucial for such a relationship because the partial pressure of hydrogen must be maintained at a substantially low level 1 pa stams and plugge 2009 to facilitate vfa oxidation in addition interspecies formate transfer ift and direct interspecies electron transfer diet have been reported as alternatives to iht in methanogenetic syntrophy lovley 2017 which are considered as competing processes depending on the conditions owing to the omission of interspecies electron carriers diet is a more efficient method of syntrophy compared with iht and ift storck et al 2015 diet has attracted considerable attention in diverse natural and engineering systems and studies have reported enhanced methane production after inserting polarized electrodes into ad reactors a process known as anaerobic electrochemical digestion aed premier et al 2013 sangeetha et al 2017 such processes provide additional energy from the applied voltage yan and wang 2022 or anodic potential and are believed to enhance diet wang et al 2020 diet relies on conductive filaments and other electron channels that link electroactive bacteria to methanogens lovley 2017 with different conductive materials reported to enhance these connections and electron transfer in defined cocultures of specific methanogens and geobacter spp as well as in mixed culture systems martins et al 2018 mei et al 2018 rotaru et al 2018 syntrophic methanogenesis between g metallireducens and methanosaeta spp based on ethanol was reported in a brewery wastewater digester rotaru et al 2014a however there exists limited knowledge regarding the comparison of the trigger mechanism of diet and traditional iht in such systems in aed systems methanogens are commonly suspended in the bulk far from electrodes and the electroactive microbiome is primarily observed on the electrode surface dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 siegert et al 2015 wang et al 2020 yu et al 2018 syntrophic iht activity requires an extremely low hydrogen partial pressure for maintenance however the hydrogen constantly generated from the cathodic reaction might hinder this process therefore we hypothesize that if a large amount of hydrogen is supplied in situ via cathode electrolysis wang et al 2021 it will break the iht based syntrophy shift the interspecies electron transfer pathway inhibit vfa degradation and may eventually influence the methane production rate hence considering its higher efficiency diet could be a potential alternative to iht in such a situation storck et al 2015 however to the best of our knowledge no studies have explored this possibility therefore in this study using propionate as a model substrate and the sole carbon source we present a combined approach integrating experimental investigation metagenomics and mathematical modeling to elucidate the microbial mutualism in such conditions we operated a series of aed systems at different anodic potentials and identified the possible mutualism between electroactive microorganisms and methanogens with boosted gas production biofilm and suspension samples were collected and whole genome metagenomic analysis was performed which provided fundamental insights into the possible mechanisms of interspecies electron transfer according to functional gene profiles and key metagenomic assembly genome analysis and to verify the influence of merely hydrogen non electrochemical batch systems fed with propionate with additional hydrogen were investigated then a pure culture experiment with g anodireducens sd 1 was conducted to confirm the metabolic potential found by the metagenomic analysis in addition with the goal of advancing fundamental understanding of the experimental observation we utilized multispecies modeling to test the dynamic interactions among complex metabolic groups 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor construction inoculation and operation in total three sets of experiment were conducted 1 the mix culture aed systems with four different potentials to explore the impact of bioelectrohydrogen fig s1a the inoculum was a mixture of microbial fuel cell mfc suspended effluent and anaerobic sludge that was obtained from a brewery wastewater treatment plant the mfc had been operated with propionate for 2 years yan et al 2020 and the anaerobic sludge was collected from the anaerobic digestor of the tianjin snow brewery utilizing 16s rrna sequencing as previously described yan et al 2020 the microbial community of the inoculum fig s1b was analyzed the sludge was initially bubbled using mix gas n2 co2 4 1 for 1 h and acclimated with 50 mm propionate per week for 2 months before inoculation the 300 ml of inoculum contained 55 sludge and 45 mfc effluent media containing 50 mm phosphate buffer saline and trace metals as previously described yan et al 2020 and 50 mm propionate was added to the sludge to generate a total volume of 550 ml at an anodic potential of 0 2 v to 0 1 v vs ag agcl poised by a four channel potentiostat multi autolab m204 metrohm netherlands the reactor comprised an anode working electrode 81 64 cm2 a cathode stainless steel mesh and a reference electrode ag agcl 2 a non electrochemical batch experiment on a series of 100 ml constantly shaking serum bottles to explore the role of hydrogen 20 mm propionate and 30 hydrogen or pure nitrogen gas in the headspace were used the same inoculum as in the aeds was used for batch experiments 3 a pure culture microbial electrolysis cell with geobacter anodireducens sd 1 pure culture to confirm the metabolic potential of geobacter the mecs was inoculated and operated as previously described tian et al 2022 all reactors were operated in an incubator at 303 k information regarding the reactors configuration and operation is detailed in section 1 of the supporting information 2 2 chemical and electrochemical analyses samples for vfa analysis were collected using 1 ml syringes they were then centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 10 min and filtered using a 0 22 μm membrane next they were analyzed via gas chromatography flame ionization detector gc fid fl 9790ii fuli instrument zhejiang china using a 30 m 1 0 μm 0 53 mm column kb innowax kromat corporation new jersey usa the gas was quantified using gas chromatography thermal conductivity detector gc tcd fl 9790ii fuli instrument zhejiang china the average production rate was calculated by dividing the production volume with the sampling time cyclic voltammetry was conducted in the steady state of microbial growth in the potential range of 0 6 v to 0 2 v versus ag agcl with a scan rate of 1 mv s 1 using multi autolab m204 the parameters of detection are detailed in section 1 in the supporting information 2 3 metagenomic analysis the samples for metagenomic analysis were collected separately from the suspension and biofilm in four aed systems except for the open circuit control whose electrode was unable to provide enough biomass for dna extraction suspension samples were collected after scratching the anodic biofilm to avoid contamination moreover the dna collected from the cathode surface was insufficient for metagenomic analysis indicating that cathodic methanogenesis did not dominate our system dna sequencing was conducted by novogene beijing china the data were analyzed by the authors based on the clean data provided a methodology combining both read based and metagenome assembled genome mag based approaches was designed fig s2 afgan et al 2018 bankevich et al 2012 kanehisa et al 2016 li et al 2009 olm et al 2017 2020 patro et al 2017 seemann 2014 tanizawa et al 2018 von meijenfeldt et al 2019 wu et al 2016 first based on reads annotation with a reference database the taxa composition was preliminarily analyzed principal coordinate analysis pca was performed on the read based taxa composition then de novo assembly was conducted on the reads to construct draft mags based on dereplication and profiling key mags were identified for whole genome annotation the key marker genes were identified by comparing the annotated coding sequence with genes of interest summarized from the kegg pathway database du et al 2021 table s1 to profile their relative abundance and functional gene variation these marker genes were mapped back to the original read library the identified key mags were also annotated with regard to the presence of functional genes and taxonomy information the detailed descriptions of all the tools employed in this study are detailed in the supporting information section 2 data analysis and visualization was performed using r packages ggplot2 villanueva and chen 2019 vegan oksanen et al 2013 circlize gu et al 2014 and ggtree yu 2020 2 4 model description and sensitivity tests to explore the possibility that electrode potential would thermodynamically influence the methane production without diet modeling investigation was conducted based on merely ift and iht the one dimensional multispecies model was based on our previous study involving the simulation of propionate electricity conversion in the microbial electrolysis cell mec yan et al 2021 the model framework is a combination of modified nernst monod kinetics of electroactive biofilm lee et al 2016 molecular diffusion kato marcus et al 2007 and thermodynamic based microbial energetics liang et al 2019 wilson and kim 2016 dividing the system into suspension and biofilm bioreactions this dynamic model considered seven bioreactions in the suspension 1 hydrogen producing propionate fermentation 2 formate producing propionate fermentation 3 hydrogenotrophic acetogenesis 4 methylotrophic acetogenesis 5 aceticlastic methanogenesis 6 hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and 7 methylotrophic methanogenesis and two reactions in the biofilm 1 hydrogenotrophic electrogenesis and 2 aceticlastic electrogenesis fig s12 in addition the gibbs free energy of each bioreaction was calculated and used to determine the microbial yield coefficient at each time step as a constraint wilson and kim 2016 an extra energy term provided by the anodic potential n f e a n o d e was added to the two biofilm reactions wilson and kim 2016 the initial simulation was calibrated based on the findings of our previous work yan et al 2021 based on the corresponding steady current density and using methane and hydrogen production as the index a sensitivity test was conducted at a relatively wide range of 0 6 to 1 0 v vs ag agcl a detailed description of the model hypothesis fig s11 mathematical expression section 10 initial simulation and sensitivity test fig s12 and parameters table s5 is present in the supporting information to test our hypothesis and as the mathematical expression of diet in dynamic modeling remains unsolved we assumed diet as a negligible process and there was no direct interaction between the biofilm and suspension in this model 3 results 3 1 simultaneous enhancement of methane and hydrogen production at 0 2 v to operate the aed systems four electrode potentials were selected 0 2 0 1 0 and 0 1 v along with an open circuit control oc these systems were constantly operated until the current and gas production were highly repeatable in consecutive cycles gas production has been shown in table 1 oc exhibited an average methane production rate of 6 3 2 µl h 1 in the whole cycle fig 1 a among all reactors with poised potential the reactor operating at 0 v demonstrated the lowest methane production rate at 1 3 0 04 µl h 1 while the system operating at 0 2 v showed the highest rate at 132 11 µl h 1 100 times higher than the 0 v system the reactor operating at 0 1 v produced 102 12 µl h of methane interestingly the reactor operating at 0 2 v also showed the highest hydrogen production 146 3 7 µl h which is approximately three times higher than the one operating at 0 1 v 49 0 02 µl h the amount of hydrogen produced at 0 v and 0 1 v was very small 2 6 0 04 µl h and 7 5 2 µl h respectively similar to methane in mecs with similar operational conditions cathode material stainless steel mesh and anode substrate acetate as well as at a similar current density range the cathode potential was 0 6 v to 0 9 v vs she ribot llobet et al 2013 zhang et al 2010 this was more negative than e0 0 41 v of hydrogen evolution thus the cathodic hydrogen evolution namely bioelectrohydrogen different from the hydrogen from fermentation is thermodynamical favorable in the aed systems the complete current densities of the three consecutive cycles were shown in fig s3a the reactor operating at 0 2 v exhibited the highest current density reaching a maximum of 1 97 a m 2 after 74 h and eventually stabilizing at 0 99 a m fig 1b the 0 1 v reactor exhibited a lower current density of 0 70 a m the reactor operating at 0 v exhibited the fastest growth which began increasing after 15 h to a peak of 0 81 a m and stabilizing at 0 51 a m cyclic voltammetries at steady stage confirmed that the electroactive biofilm in the aed operating at 0 2 v had the highest electrochemical activity with the peak current of 0 01 a however the main extracellular electron transfer eet pathways in each system might be changed because different middle point potentials were recognized in derivative cyclic voltammetries fig s3 strycharz et al 2011 another possible intermediate formate was also profiled fig s4 showing a concentration of 0 032 0 004 mmol l 1 during the operation and demonstrated no difference among the different potentials therefore ift was considered a nondominant pathway in terms of propionate degradation the reactors operating at 0 1 v to 0 1 v and oc were faster during the initial 65 h depicting more than twice the propionate removal at 0 2 v in the same timeframe fig 1c such a phenomenon at 0 2 v corresponded to hydrogen accumulation indicating that the abiotic hydrogen originating from the cathodic process inhibited propionate fermentation fig 1a interestingly acetate accumulation of 3 7 0 9 mmol l 1 also occurred after 24 h under this potential fig 1c which was not observed in the other systems till 65 h considering the high current density acetate generated form planktonic fermentation was probably mostly utilized by electroactive bacteria rather than acetolactic methanogens according to electron balance calculation acetate oxidation mainly contributed to the anodic current rather than hydrogen recycling table s2 electron losses in the other systems where propionate was also massively degraded could be attributed to other possible microbial processes in the sludge considering its exceptionally high biomass content and microbial diversity see section 6 in the supporting information as the propionate fermentation was inhibited the early accumulation of acetate at 0 2 v might have been due to the growth of homoacetogenesis thereby warranting further investigation in conventional ads hydrogen generated from fermentation is utilized for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis therefore hydrogen and methane production in ad cannot be expected to occur concurrently however hydrogen production and methanogenesis was promoted in these aed systems especially at 0 2 v the excess and constant hydrogen generation in aeds could be only resulted from the cathodic process as the hydrogen generating propionate fermentation requires low hydrogen partial pressure further the degradation of propionate embedded in a hydrogen enriched environment indicated a different pathway fig 1 in terms of electrochemical activity the aed at 0 v showed the fastest growth and second highest current density however its methane production rate was 100 times lower than that at 0 2 v conversely the aed at 0 1 v showed 77 of the methane production at 0 2 v however the current density and hydrogen production rates were significantly lower overall the hydrogen production was basically in proportion to the current indicating that the hydrogen mainly came from cathodic process according to the faraday s law i e bioelectrohydrogen therefore the cathodic methanogenesis with direct electron acceptance and the fermentation generated hydrogen could be ruled out as the dominant processes more interestingly the slowest propionate degradation and earliest acetate accumulation also occurred at a potential of 0 2 v fig 1c these findings indicate a different methanogenic pathway occurring at 0 2 v which was potentially associated with the excess bioelectrohydrogen thus metagenomic analysis was conducted to elucidate how and why such a difference was triggered 3 2 high abundance of geobacter and eet genes in the suspension of the 0 2 v system samples were collected separately from the biofilm and suspended microbiome and analyzed using whole genome metagenomic analysis segata et al 2012 read based taxonomy annotation at the genus level demonstrated that in the biofilm the typical electroactive bacteria geobacter predominated 62 95 in each sample indicating a key role in current generation of geobacter fig 2 a the potential electrogen acinetobacter liao et al 2018 showed only in the biofilm at 0 2 v which also indicated a probable unique process the dominant genus was methanothrix formally methanosaeta 20 38 in the suspension where methanogenesis hypothetically happened the proportion of this genus dropped by 40 in conventional ad compared with aeds suggesting that the dominant methanogen varied in response to the applied voltage compared to the low abundance of geobacter in the suspension samples from reactors poised at other potentials 4 8 the unexpectedly high abundance 49 of geobacter in the suspension of the 0 2 v system was especially noteworthy as it had not been previously reported however geobacter did not exhibit dominant status in the inoculum fig s1b neither in the mfc suspension 0 5 0 1 nor in the ad sludge 10 5 such coexistence potentially suggests a new pathway of diet based methanogenesis in the suspension as methanothrix has been reported to be capable of performing diet with geobacter rotaru et al 2014b this hypothesis helped to explain the surprisingly high methanogenesis activity accompanied by a high level of hydrogen accumulation in the 0 2 v system fig 1a pca revealed that in terms of beta diversity the biofilm samples at 0 2 v and 0 v showed the greatest similarity while the suspensions at 0 2 v and 0 v were located far away from each fig 2b this also corresponds to the similar electrochemical activity and the difference in methane production observed in these two systems fig 1 the typical hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanoculleus xu et al 2021 showed the highest abundance in the suspension at 0 v indicating a possible dominant iht in such condition therefore the difference between the suspensions at 0 2 v and 0 v might provide vital information regarding the simultaneous enhancement of methanogenesis and electrochemical activity these two systems were focused on the mag analysis discussion regarding the systems at 0 1 v and 0 1 v is present in the supporting information fig s5 s9 and s10 named per the order of assembly there were 43 12 de novo assembled mags in the biofilm and 78 10 in the suspension mags after dereplication were profiled and selected based on abundance coverage and taxa annotation with 23 key mags selected for further investigation fig s6 and s7 the relative abundance of the interesting genes based on the gene annotation of these mags table s1 is illustrated in fig 2c corresponding to mag annotation genes coding type c outer membrane cytochromes omcytc such as omcf omcs and omcb were abundant in the biofilm samples and suspensions at 0 2 v b 0 2 v and s 0 2 v but not among the top 30 abundant genes in the other suspended microbiomes fig 2c and s9 the biofilm at 0 2 v and 0 v b 0 2 v and b 0 v possessed more than thrice the abundance of omcytc genes 9464 3372 transcript per million tpm than the other biofilms 3056 848 tpm in addition omcytc genes exhibited a relatively high abundance 2639 443 tpm in s 0 2 v indicating a possible diet based syntrophy in this microbiome if we assume the genes participating in diet were the same as those participating in eet lovley 2017 genes related to type iv pilus assembly protein such as pilp exhibited similar trends with regard to propionate metabolism genes participating in the methylmanonyl coa pathway were abundant in all the samples fig s9 the dominant hydrogen formation gene associated with propionate degradation in biofilm samples was uxs averaging 11 477 3327 tpm in b 0 2 v and b 0 v and was also relatively high in s 0 2 v 2903 tpm but was not among the top 30 genes in s 0 v methanogenesis associated genes demonstrated similar trends more discussion regarding the gene profile is present in supporting information section 7 table s4 and fig s9 the distinctive distribution of these genes indicates that the dominant microbial function in the suspension and biofilm was different at 0 v similar trends were observed at 0 1 v and 0 1 v fig s9 however in the suspension of 0 2 v the predominant pathways were more similar in suspension and biofilm than at other potentials the high abundance of geobacter spp and omcytc genes in both the suspension and biofilm at 0 2 v further support the mutualism hypothesis based on the experimental observation and indicate potential diet in such a system 3 3 diet like mutualism between geobacter anodireducens and methanogens the selected 23 mags were annotated to seven species with an average nucleotide identity ani threshold of 90 fig 3 a corresponding to the reads based taxonomy composition in fig 2a mags annotated to g anodireducens b 0 1v 002 b 0v 001 b 0 1v 001 and b 0 2v 002 showed relatively higher abundance 0 7 1 3 in the biofilm samples particularly in the 0 v biofilm the highest abundance 2 8 and coverage 1238 6 among all mags indicated that the microbial community was highly dominated by g anodireducens mags annotated to azoarcus communis b 0 1v 001 and b 0 2v 004 also exhibited high abundance 1 2 0 7 indicating a potentially important role in the aed system operated at 0 2 v the highly enriched geobacter 49 in the suspension was also annotated to g anodireducens 0 7 s 0 2v 001 accompanied by another widely distributed bacteria azonexus hydrophilus mags annotated to methanogens generally showed low abundance and coverage probably owing to their relatively larger genome size in the calculation see section 6 in the supporting information in all the suspension samples there were mags annotated to methanothrix harundinacea with an average abundance of 0 02 0 007 and average coverage of 11 1 4 however merely in s 0 2 v a mag annotated to methanosarcina mazei s 0 2v 043 average abundance of 0 02 and coverage of 6 2 was identified in the suspension a mag annotated to proteinclasticum ruminis b 0 2v 007 with an abundance of 0 1 and coverage of 37 0 in b 0 2 v was detected and annotated with acetogenesis related genes fig s10d indicating a unique bioprocess in such a system ani coverages and relative abundances of these mags are listed in table s4 these experimental and metagenomic results suggest a potential role played by g anodireducens in cooperation with methanogens at 0 2 v to further investigate such a possibility genomes annotated to g anodireducens m harundinacea and m mazei were annotated with functional genes genes related to type c outer membrane cytochromes such as omcb and omcs were merely identified in mags annotated to g anodireducens b 0 2v 002 b 0v 001 s 0 2v 001 however genes related to type iv pilus assembly protein were also annotated to m harundinacea s 0 2v 025 s 0v 041 and m mazei s 0 2v 043 such as pilm fig 3b gene pilq pilo and piln were annotated only in s 0 2v 043 m mazei but not in those mags as m harundinacea type iv pilus was previously reported to be important for the diet of methanogens thus the unique mag at 0 2 v s 0 2v 043 showed a higher potential to form a syntrophic relationship with b 0 2v 002 this fact also corresponded to a previous report regarding m mazei in co occurrence with geobacteraceae supposedly participating in diet yee and rotaru 2020 zheng et al 2015a genes related to methylotrophic methanogenesis were merely identified in s 0 2v 043 fig 3b probably as a response to the high hydrogen and methane accumulation at 0 2 v conversely the presence of methylmanonyl coa pathway a key pathway in propionate metabolism in s 0 2v 001 suggested the possible propionate metabolism conducted by g anodireducens to confirm the propionate utilizing potential of g anodireducens pure culture mecs were operated as shown in fig 3c the maximum current density was 0 0034 0 0008 a m when merely fed with 20 mm propionate in comparison the maximum current density generated was 5 03 1 5 a m when fed by propionate with an additional 1 mm of acetate assuming the current was completely generated from acetate the coulombic efficiency would exceed 636 additionally the coulombic efficiency would be 19 which is relatively reasonable if we calculate the coulombic efficiency based on both propionate and acetate this observation preliminarily suggested that g anodireducens was capable of propionate utilization if there was a slight amount of acetate to initialize its growth vfa monitoring in such a system also indicated that propionate was continuously degraded till 16 within 12 d when 1 mm acetate was exhausted fig s13 these observations indicate the metabolic potential of g anodireducens m mazei and m harundinacea to form a mutualism based on diet as a response to the high bioelectrohydrogen accumulation at 0 2 v 4 discussion to assess if diet like mutualism was necessary in promoting methane production a multispecies dynamic model based on iht and ift was established assuming that there was no direct interaction between the biofilm and suspension fig s11 sensitivity tests on such a model indicated that most propionate ended up as methane at a more negative potential 0 5 to 0 1 v whereas electrons generated by propionate fermentation were primarily converted into current via acetate at a more positive potential 0 1 v to 0 5 v fig s12e however in terms of the experimental results shown above at 0 2 v the anodic respiration and methanogenesis were synergistically boosted generating not only the highest current density 1 97 a m but also the highest methane production rate at 132 11µl h fig 1 in comparison with the same end product aed systems operated at other potentials and the open circuit condition generated methane in a much lower rate with rapid propionate degradation indicating that unknown metabolism other than iht was occurring in the suspended community at 0 2 v fig 1a c metagenomic analysis revealed an interestingly high abundance 49 of the typical exoelectrogen reguera and kashefi 2019 geobacter in the suspension at 0 2 v fig 2a which also dominated all the biofilm samples 62 95 the mag assembled from this suspended sample with the highest abundance 0 7 was annotated to g anodireducens fig 3a omcytc genes including omcs were recognized as the core of eet in anodic respiration filman et al 2019 ishii et al 2018 while the abundance of omcytc genes in the suspension at 0 2 v was 36 times higher than that of other suspended microbiomes fig 3b the abundance of genes related to the wood ljungdahl pathway in b 0 2 v and b 0 v was notable fig 2c which was probably a consequence of the dominant status of geobacter in these two microbiomes as these abundant genes were annotated in b 0 2v 002 and b 0v 001 fig s10 these genes did not represent much difference between 0 2 and 0 v and therefore could hardly explain the difference in methane production potential methanogen mags assembled from this sample were annotated to methanothrix harundinacea and methanosarcina mazei fig 3a these methanogens were previously reported to be capable of accepting electrons from geobacter spp rotaru et al 2018 2014a yee and rotaru 2020 zhao et al 2018 zheng et al 2015b especially the assembled m mazei which held more type iv pili genes and only appeared in s 0 2 v based on all these observations it is reasonable to consider that a diet like mutualism exists between g anodireducens and methanogens that metabolizes propionate which has not been reported in the planktonic mixed microbial community in the literature in addition to the surprisingly high methane and current generation the reactor operating at 0 2 v exhibited the highest hydrogen accumulation 146 3 7 µl h and the earliest acetate accumulation among all the conditions revealing the possibility of propionate utilization in geobacter species recently g metalireducens was reported to utilize propionate with g sulfurreducens as the electron acceptor in an mec shi et al 2021 here propionate metabolism genes such as those participating in the methylmanonyl coa pathway were identified in mags annotated as g anodireducens fig 3a with relatively high abundance fig 2c in the suspension at 0 2 v however g anodireducens has not been reported to be capable of metabolizing propionate directly pure culture mec investigation further supported the hypothesis that g anodireducens is capable of metabolizing propionate when a slight amount of acetate exists as the initiator fig 3c such an assumption also corresponds to the fact that the earliest acetate accumulation occurred at 0 2 v fig 1c and the only potential acetogen of p ruminis was identified at 0 2 v who was annotated with the acetogenesis genes fig 3a and fig s10d a possible mechanism to explain this observation is that at this potential a high electrochemical activity caused high hydrogen accumulation triggering the hydrogenotrophic acetogenesis process the produced extra acetate then initialized the propionate metabolism of g anodireducens which was already actively conducting eet on the anodic biofilm and then enriched in the suspension and formed a diet like mutualism with m mazei or m harundinacea engendering an extraordinarily high methane production rate fig 1c eventually propionate was utilized directly in current generation and methanogenesis with a higher efficiency than the hydrogen or acetate mediated pattern fig 4 batch experiments with 30 hydrogen in the headspace did not introduce a boost in the geobacter abundance all samples remained an abundance of 6 8 1 6 with no significant increase compared to the inoculum in a duration of 10 days supplementary fig s14 demonstrating that merely extra hydrogen was not sufficient to trigger such mutualism and the influence of electrochemical condition was necessarily needed however we recognize that there are multiple possible pathways and an in depth investigation of the mechanism requires further confirmation such as by using defined coculture experiments of g anodireducens m mazei and m harundinacea in situ imaging of the microbial consortia e g aggregates of geobacter and methanogens and mutagenic studies 5 conclusions the findings of this study suggest an alternative to iht potentially involving diet which might help to better understand and improve methanogenesis in engineering systems microbial electrochemical technologies are promising for improving ad performance however they are limited by the electrode area because electroactive bacteria are believed to reside only on the electrode our findings in this study reveal that the influence of the electrode planktonic microbial communities can be much greater via gas production and prompt microbial mutualism by utilizing the electrode potential as a regulator it is possible to promote microbial communities with enhanced methanogenesis and hydrogen evolution and our results show that methane production could be enhanced two fold via planktonic mutualism of geobacter and methanogens moreover the proposed mutualistic model indicates the potential importance of electroactive bacteria and diet in propionate metabolism as well as new pathways to

14909,coupling municipal anaerobic digestate mad treatments with microalgal cultivation can concomitantly achieve nutrient removal and microalgal bioenergy production however the high cost caused by dilution water and microalgal harvesting is a great challenge in this study scenedesmus quadricauda was screened as the most appropriate algae strain due to its potential for growth and auto flocculation and the mad diluted 5 fold with wwtp effluent was demonstrated as an ideal medium for s quadricauda growth moreover inspired by naturally generated silica shells of diatoms a low cost and biomimetic auto flocculation strategy that combined high light intensity induction and microalgal silicification was proposed to accelerate the auto flocculation process compared with low light intensity groups this strategy imparted diatom like features to s quadricauda cells and contributed to 3 07 fold higher auto flocculation efficiency within 30 min it was attributed to the fact that the high light intensity of 150 μmol m 2 s 1 stimulated the extracellular polymeric substances eps secretion and induced the variation in property and composition of eps especially the protein secondary structures which allowed silica nanoparticles to spontaneously attach onto s quadricauda cells in the presence of viscous eps furthermore this strategy significantly increased microalgal biomass yield to a dry weight of 1 37 g l 1 accompanied by 93 78 96 39 and 91 36 removals of nh4 n tp and cod respectively the productivity of valuable by products including lipid carbohydrate protein and pigment reached 56 30 101 35 30 39 and 11 28 mg l 1 d 1 respectively overall this study supplies a novel approach for low cost microalgal bioenergy production from mad and energy efficient microalgae harvest by auto flocculation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestate scenedesmus quadricauda nutrient removal auto flocculation eps silica nanoparticle data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microalgae based biomass is a highly promising candidate for sustainable and renewable biofuels production in the future owing to its striking advantages such as high biomass yields stronger co2 sequestration capacity low area requirements and higher tolerance to severe conditions khan et al 2018 kafil et al 2022 in recent years increasing efforts have been made to couple anaerobic digestate treatments with microalgal cultivation for simultaneous nutrient removal and microalgal bioenergy production cho et al 2013 wang et al 2019 despite these promising developments the large scale application of such an integrated strategy faces several core issues such as the high cost of pretreatment for anaerobic digestate and high energy demand for microalgal harvesting chong et al 2022 dilution has emerged as a feasible solution to alleviate the inhibition of anaerobic digestate and the effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtp can provide an available water source for dilution resulting in significant cost savings cho et al 2013 however harvesting microalgae from suspended culture systems remains a major challenge due to the small size of microalgal cells around 10 μm for one cell strong hydrophilicity and negative cell surface charge cheng et al 2020a this process has been demonstrated to take up approximately 30 of the total energy input molina grima et al 2003 auto flocculation is a promising approach to harvesting microalgal cells without the need for chemical flocculants thereby avoiding secondary pollution and energy consumption cheng et al 2020a auto flocculation refers to spontaneous aggregation and adhesion of microalgal cells to each other and gravity driven settlement and it can naturally occur in liquid media chen et al 2021 previous studies suggested that auto flocculation was related with the surface charge of microalgal cell aljuboori et al 2016 however more recent research demonstrated that auto flocculation could occur as a result of the production excretion adsorption and bridging of extracellular polymeric substances eps originating from microalgal surface salim et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 these epss are comprised of polysaccharides ps proteins pn and other substances they exhibit strong adhesion force due to their unique three dimensional structure thus facilitating the spontaneous adhesion and aggregation of microalgal cells chen et al 2021 several microalgae strains with auto flocculation characteristics were reported in previous research including scenedesmus quadricauda aljuboori et al 2016 tribonema sp cheng et al 2020b and ettlia texensis salim et al 2014 moreover optimizing the culture conditions could increase the auto flocculation efficiency for example chlorella sp a low flocculation microalgae strain exhibited 4 3 fold higher auto flocculation efficiencies at the high light intensity compared to low light intensity this was attributed to the enrichment of biological functions and positional rearrangement of increased pn within eps which promoted algal cell adhesion and bridging chen et al 2021 nonetheless the real anaerobic digestate is a complex system containing large amounts of negative charged organic substrates to date few studies have been conducted to decipher the effects of anaerobic digestate characteristics and culture conditions on auto flocculation behavior unfortunately it takes at least two hours for microalgal auto flocculation to achieve a stable harvest efficiency and the floating characteristic is an important factor leading to the low efficiency of microalgal auto flocculation cheng et al 2020a compared with other microalgae diatoms are more prone to remain sedimentary in water since their siliceous cell walls made of hydrated silicon dioxide can be used as a ballast to control water column position xiong et al 2017 however the major challenge is that microalgae without diatoms cannot inherently generate silica walls inspired by silica shells of diatoms the auto flocculation microalgae can be encapsulated within silica nanoparticles and endowed with diatom like characteristics to accelerate auto flocculation process in real municipal anaerobic digestate mad actually engineered nanoparticles have been widely applied in microalgal cultivation and harvesting a previous review reported that the effects of silica based nanoparticles on microalgae could be significantly altered by particle dosage size and microalgal species for instance 38 190 nm sio2 nanoparticles slightly promoted the growth of chlorella vulgaris but 50 mg l 1 sio2 nanoparticles 10 20 nm reduced the chlorophyll contents of scenedesmus obliquus lee et al 2015 for algal harvesting previous research reported that sio2 nanoparticles could not effectively incorporated onto microalgal cells by directly mixing with the microalgal suspension due to the lack of silicification proteins in microalgae but it also demonstrated that silicified cyanobacteria aggregates generated by using sio2 nanoparticles and polyelectrolyte were prone to settling and harvesting due to increased density and reduced buoyancy xiong et al 2017 furthermore particle based flocculation techniques were also developed such as those utilizing magnetic nanoparticles and aminoclay based nanoparticles which relied on charge neutralization bridging and electrostatic attraction mechanisms matter et al 2019 nevertheless no research has investigated the spontaneous incorporation of nanoparticles onto algal cells to accelerate the auto flocculation process and elucidate underlying mechanisms with this in mind this research screened the appropriate dilution ratio of mad and screened the dominant microalgae strains suitable for growth in real mad according to the biomass productivity and auto flocculation efficiency meanwhile to accelerate the auto flocculation of microalgae we developed a feasible treatment method of incorporating silica nanoparticles onto dominant microalgae cells by elevating the light irradiation to our knowledge it is a new method for incorporating silica nanoparticles to microalgae the dominant microalgae was cultivated by this method and microalgal growth nutrient removal biomass composition and auto flocculation efficiency were compared the aggregation effect microstructure and eps characteristics of dominant microalgae were further investigated to decipher the key dominating factors underlying microalgal auto flocculation this research can supply a reference for energy efficient microalgae separation and sustainable microalgal based biofuel production coupled with anaerobic digestate treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae incubation scenedesmus quadricauda fachb 44 chlorella vulgaris fachb 2338 chlorella pyrenoidosa fachb 27 and tribonema minus fachb 2215 were used in this study due to their versatility and effectiveness in removing pollutants from municipal and agricultural wastewater from different sources and their potential to produce valuable by products ge and champagne 2016 kafil et al 2022 liu et al 2022 wang et al 2020 the four microalgae strains were all obtained from the freshwater algae culture collection the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of science china the seed of strains were cultured in autoclaved bg 11 medium allen and stanier 1968 then the microalgae were incubated at 25 c in an illuminated incubator under a light intensity of 50 μmol m 2 s 1 with a 12 h 12 h light and dark cycle microalgae cultured in the mad were collected during rapid growth phase before inoculation in the mad the microalgae were collected by centrifuging 5000 rpm 15 min and washed to remove impurities by using distilled water 2 2 real anaerobic digestate and wastewater treatment plant effluent the mad was collected from an anaerobic digestor at the bailonggang wwtp in shanghai china which was a municipal wwtp the wwtp effluent was also collected from this wastewater treatment plant both mad and wwtp effluent were immediately transported back to the lab and stored at 4 c until use the collected sample was pretreated by sedimentation and filtration through 0 7 μm filter for solid separation the filtered sample was later passed through 0 45 μm and 0 22 μm sterile filters to ensure an axenic condition wang et al 2019 five concentration ratios of mad 50 33 3 20 10 and 5 v v diluted with wwtp effluent were used for microalgal cultivation and they were denoted as mad 50 mad 33 mad 20 mad 10 and mad 5 respectively the physicochemical characteristics of mad at different dilution rations and wwtp effluent are listed in table 1 2 3 experimental setup 2 3 1 screening of microalgae and anaerobic digestate firstly four microalgae s quadricauda c vulgaris c pyrenoidosa and t minus were cultured in mad 20 using the self designed photobioreactors pbr with 500 ml working volume fig s1 the air pump which was equipped with 0 22 μm bacteria filtered polyethersulfone membranes was connected to the cover of the pbr for through the silicone tubes each pbr contained an initial total microalgal biomass of approximately 0 22 g dry cell weight dw l 1 and it was aerated with filtered ambient air at 0 2 vvm 100 ml min 1 all pbrs were operated at 25 c under a light intensity of 50 μmol m 2 s 1 with a 12 h 12 h light and dark cycle the dominant microalgae strain was initially screened for subsequent experiments according to the biomass productivity and auto flocculation efficiency the second experiments tested the growth of the selected microalgae in different dilutions of anaerobic digestate media under the same conditions mentioned above to determine the appropriate dilution ratio the two tests conducted three replicates for each treatment then the dominant microalgae were sub cultured in diluted mad for six cycles to obtain stable activities prior to the following experiments chen et al 2021 2 3 2 cultivation and auto flocculation of s quadricauda in anaerobic digestate in this experiment silica nanoparticles 99 5 particle size 15 nm 5 nm were obtained from shanghai meryer chemical technology co ltd china before the experiment sio2 nanoparticles were prepared to 5 g l 1 in deionized water and were sonicated for 30 min 25 c and 40 khz to ensure that sio2 nanoparticles were fully dispersed to optimize the concentrations of sio2 nanoparticles the dominant microalgae were exposed to five concentrations of sio2 nanoparticles 0 10 25 50 and 100 mg l 1 and cultivated at the light intensity of 50 and 150 μmol m 2 s 1 in mad 20 with an initial total microalgal biomass of around 0 20 g dw l 1 the premade sio2 nanoparticles suspension was then added to the screened diluted anaerobic digestate at a concentration of 25 mg l 1 the dominant microalgae were collected by centrifuging 5000 rpm 15 min and subsequently inoculated into the diluted anaerobic digestion with an initial total microalgal biomass of around 0 19 g dw l 1 the cultivation procedure was conducted at two light intensities of 50 and 150 μmol m 2 s 1 which were attained by adjusting the number of lamps and the distance between lamps and pbrs specifically the 50 μmol m 2 s 1 was categorized as the low light intensity ll and the high light intensity hl with 150 μmol m 2 s 1 was regarded as the optimal light intensity for producing algal biomass as reported in previous studies jiang et al 2016 gao et al 2022 hence the pbrs were divided into four experimental groups in three replicates 1 pbrs without sio2 nanoparticles at low light intensity 2 pbrs containing sio2 nanoparticles at low light intensity 3 pbrs without sio2 nanoparticles at high light intensity and 4 pbrs containing sio2 nanoparticles at high light intensity they were denoted as ll ll sio2 hl and hl sio2 groups respectively the other cultivation conditions of pbrs were adopted as described in section 2 3 1 during the cultivation period samples were daily collected to determine the microalgal growth and pollutants removal using sterile syringes at the end of cultivation auto flocculation tests were conducted at 25 c under ambient light irradiation chen et al 2021 samples were also collected for analysis of the aggregation effect microstructure biomass compositions and eps compositions of the dominant microalgae cells 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 algal growth the microalgal biomass concentration g l 1 was gravimetrically characterized by the dw chen et al 2021 in detail the 0 7 μm glass microfiber filter membrane whatman gf f 1825 047 was washed by passing 50 ml deionized water and dried at 60 c to a constant weight m0 mg then the microalgal cell

the standard methods apha 2012 2 4 3 flocculation efficiency at the end of cultivation day 6 the microalgal suspensions from each pbrs were collected half of the sampled microalgal cells were washed three times with 1 m phosphate buffered saline pbs and then resuspended in pbs to obtain eps free microalgal cells chen et al 2021 the suspensions of sampled microalgae and eps free microalgae were subsequently transferred into 50 ml glass measuring cylinders and allowed to place under ambient light irradiation at 25 c for 120 min chen et al 2021 at specified intervals the supernatant was sampled at a depth of 5 cm below the water surface and the optical density at 680 nm od680 of the supernatant was measured with a spectrophotometer dr6000 hach usa mi et al 2022 the auto flocculation

brief the collected microalgae were washed three times by 0 1 m pbs and then prefixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde at 4 c for 24 h after fixation the samples were dehydrated by a series of ethanol and tertiary butanol 50 75 90 and 100 5 min per step and coated with a layer of gold 2 4 5 eps extraction and characterization the eps base extraction were employed to obtain the freeze dried eps ge and champagne 2016 park and novak 2007 supporting information text s2 the freeze dried eps were redissolved in deionized water pn content of eps from s quadricauda was quantified using the bradford method

excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra of eps were measured using an f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer hitachi japan at 25 c with the excitation wavelength from 200 to 400 nm and emission wavelength from 250 to 550 nm ye et al 2020 subsequently the freeze dried eps powder was ground with potassium bromide to analyze the major functional groups of eps using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo scientific nicolet is20 usa in the 4000 400 cm 1 frequency band for further analysis of protein secondary structures in eps the second derivative spectra and deconvolution spectra of amide

and sludge production during denitrification were 2 86 mg cod g n 3 93 g g n and 0 67 g vss g n respectively qiu et al 2021 moreover the light radiation was regarded as input energy and the bioenergy of microalgal biomass was stored as lipids carbohydrates and proteins with their heating values of 36 3 17 3 and 23 9 kj g respectively chang et al 2023 details are described in supporting information text s5 2 5 statistical analysis statistical package of the social sciences 20 0 spss 20 0 software was used for statistical analysis significant differences between each treatment were tested by one way analysis of variance anova a p value less than 0 05 was considered as statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening of dominant algae species and suitable anaerobic digestate screening appropriate microalgal species is a crucial step for microalgae cultivation in anaerobic digestate systems four species of microalgae including s quadricauda c vulgaris c pyrenoidosa and t minus were screen in this study the results showed the different adaptability of four selected microalgae species to diluted anaerobic digestate as shown in fig 1 a s quadricauda and c vulgaris grew well in mad 20 during the 7 day cultivation and the maximum biomass yields of s quadricauda and c vulgaris reached a dw of 0 98 and 1 05 g l 1 on day 6 respectively by contrast despite the initial high growth rates in the first two days c pyrenoidosa and t minus exhibited a slower increase from day 2 to 7 and the maximum biomass yields were 0 81 and 0 69 g l 1 respectively which was significantly lower than s quadricauda and c vulgaris moreover after 7 day cultivation microalgal auto flocculation characteristics was evaluated the ae in 2 h was 63 62 for s quadricauda which was significantly higher than the values for c vulgaris c pyrenoidosa and t minus with 33 36 37 14 and 55 08 respectively p 0 05 fig 1b considering the reasonable growth and auto flocculation efficiency s quadricauda was screened as dominant microalgae strain for further study based on the above results the growth status of s quadricauda in mad with different dilution ratios was further explored after inoculation the growth of s quadricauda obviously declined in mad undiluted mad 50 and mad 33 which might be attributed to the toxicity from hazardous substances in anaerobic digestate such as ammonia chong et al 2022 previous studies have documented that high concentration of free ammonia in full or high strength digestions could diffuse across the cell membrane in microalgae thereby disrupting the microalgal photosynthetic system and even causing the lysis and death of algal cells pang et al 2020 in these cases dilution was typically used to alleviate inhibition of liquid digestions cho et al 2013 in this study when mad was diluted with wwtp effluents s quadricauda quickly adapted to mad 20 mad 10 and mad 5 without a noticeable lag growth period at the end of cultivation s quadricauda in mad 20 reached the maximum biomass production with 0 94 mg l 1 which was significantly higher than that in mad 10 and mad 5 p 0 05 fig s2 therefore it is possible to highlight that mad 20 is an ideal medium for s quadricauda growth considering the final biomass yields 3 2 growth and auto flocculation efficiency of s quadricauda as shown in fig s3 the optimization of sio2 nanoparticle concentration was conducted when the concentration exceeded 50 mg l 1 although exhibiting a higher auto flocculation efficiency it significantly inhibited the growth of s quadricauda p 0 05 in contrast regardless of low or high light intensity conditions after 6 days of cultivation 25 mg l 1 sio2 nanoparticles had no significant impact on the growth of s quadricauda p 0 85 and 0 61 respectively and presented better auto flocculation efficiency than the concentration of 10 mg l 1 therefore in this study s quadricauda was cultured in mad 20 with and without the incorporation of 25 mg l 1 sio2 nanoparticles at two light intensities of 50 and 150 μmol m 2 s 1 s quadricauda in all pbrs adapted well in mad 20 as indicated by the rapid growth during the first two days then the growth rates tended to slow and even zero and the dw maintained at 0 94 0 89 1 30 and 1 37 g l 1 in ll ll sio2 hl and hl sio2 groups on day 6 respectively fig 2 a in comparison to ll and hl groups there was no significant difference in the microalgal biomass of ll sio2 and hl sio2 groups p 0 60 and 0 44 respectively moreover the dynamics of microalgal biomass in groups containing sio2 nanoparticles shared a similar trend with that groups without sio2 nanoparticles fig 2a this founding was consistent with those reported by miglietta et al 2011 and yu et al 2018 who found that there was no significant inhibition of up to 200 mg l 1 sio2 nanoparticles particle size around 15 nm on growth of isocrisys galbana and chlamydomonas reinhardtii however another study observed that an exposure of 200 mg l 1 sio2 nanoparticles particle size 10 20 nm damaged around 40 of dunaliella tertiolecta cells and even exerted a moderate genotoxic action schiavo et al 2016 which differed from the findings presented here a possible explanation for this was the lower concentration of sio2 nanoparticles 25 mg l 1 added to mad 20 in this study in addition previous studies experimentally demonstrated that adsorption established between organic acid groups and hydroxyl groups on the silica surface and microalgae cells prevents the direct interaction van hoecke et al 2011 the decrease in toxicity might also attributed to the shielding of the sio2 nanoparticles by organic matter in anaerobic digestate moreover the biomass of s quadricauda was greatly affected by the variation of light intensity light is one of the most important environmental elements for microalgae cultivation and it determines the growth rate cell composition and physiological properties of microalgal cells gao et al 2022 khan et al 2018 it is apparent from fig 2a that the microalgal biomass was significantly elevated when the light intensity increased from 50 to 150 μmol m 2 s 1 p 0 05 correspondingly the pave in hl and hl sio2 groups was 0 19 and 0 20 mg l 1 d 1 respectively which was more than 1 5 fold higher than that in ll and ll sio2 groups with 0 12 mg l 1 d 1 fig s4 jiang et al 2016 gao et al 2022 overall the 25 mg l 1 sio2 nanoparticles added in mad 20 posed low risk to the growth of s quadricauda and it provided a prerequisite for silicifying the microalgal cells and enhancing the auto flocculation efficiency at the end of the cultivation different microalgal auto flocculation trends were observed as indicated by the ae variations in ll ll sio2 hl and hl sio2 groups fig 2a specifically the ae of hl and hl sio2 groups reached the peak value of approximately 85 and 92 at 60 and 40 min respectively while the ae of ll and ll sio2 groups reached only 61 09 and 68 66 even after 100 and 80 min respectively these observations suggested that s quadricauda cultivated at high light intensity of 150 μmol m 2 s 1 were more conducive to trigger their auto flocculation in real mad 20 furthermore the silicification of s quadricauda cells by sio2 nanoparticles contributed to their rapid sedimentation in a short time xiong et al 2017 with the ae levels in ll sio2 and hl sio2 groups at 30 min compared to those in ll and hl groups at 120 min fig 2b 3 3 bioremediation performance of s quadricauda s quadricauda not only exhibited excellent growth rates but also was efficient in removing nitrogen phosphorus and cod in mad 20 the specific growth rate generally was considered as a vital criterion for evaluating growth status of microalgae in wastewater liu et al 2022 the higher μmax value indicated that the algae strain had strong environmental adaptability which was usually positive to the higher nutrient removal efficiency liu et al 2022 the present results supported this and showed that s quadricauda cultured at light intensity of 150 μmol m 2 s 1 with and without incorporation of sio2 nanoparticles exhibited higher removal efficiencies of nh4 n 94 68 and 93 78 no3 n 87 40 and 85 52 tp 97 22 and 96 39 and cod 93 55 and 91 36 in mad 20 fig 3 accompanied by the observation of higher μmax value 0 87 and 0 81 d 1 in hl and hl sio2 groups fig s4 it should be noted that there was no significant difference in nutrient removal rate between groups with or without sio2 nanoparticles p 0 05 fig 3 which might be the shielding of the sio2 nanoparticles by organic matter in anaerobic digestate van hoecke et al 2011 moreover high light intensity enhanced the uptake of nutrients by s quadricauda especially phosphorus phosphorus is an important macronutrient that regulates growth and metabolism of microalgae phosphorus uptake with microalgae was affected by light intensity as a result of energy dependence of phosphorus uptake process powell et al 2009 in this study it should be noted that the rapid tp removal by s quadricauda was observed in hl and hl sio2 groups on day 1 which was 68 52 and 66 67 while the tp removal rate in ll and ll sio2 groups was 35 37 and 33 24 respectively fig 3c suggesting that the light intensity of 150 μmol m 2 s 1 contributed to the rapid phosphorous uptake with s quadricauda during the initial growth stage powell et al 2009 overall considering bioremediation performance and biomass yield it was advisable for s quadricauda cultivation in mad 20 at the light intensity of 150 μmol m 2 s 1 3 4 biomass content and productivity of s quadricauda the biomass content and productivity of microalgae determine their potential as biofuel feedstocks and other high value bioproducts when culture conditions including light intensity temperature carbon dioxide and nutrient concentrations are altered microalgae are capable of programmatic changes in carbon flow allocation and cellular biomass component in response to changes in the growth environment wang et al 2013 it has been reported that microalgae diverted the carbon fixed in the photosynthesis process from the pathway of protein synthesis to the pathway of lipid or carbohydrate synthesis to adapt to conditions of high light and nitrogen limitation wang et al 2013 in this study cellular biochemical compositions particularly in the relative amounts of protein lipid carbohydrate and pigments in s quadricauda varied with the changes in light intensity rather than the incorporation of sio2 nanoparticles as shown in fig 4 a the maximum content of protein was obtained in ll and ll sio2 groups 505 72 and 496 30 mg g 1 biomass respectively which was significantly higher than that in hl and hl sio2 groups 440 04 and 444 80 mg g 1 biomass respectively p 0 05 this might be attributed to the adverse effects of high light irradiance on photosystem ii in microalgal cells causing the detachment of the protein complex from the grana membranes while the protein synthesis by microalgae is hardly affected by the low light irradiance jiang et al 2016 nonetheless due to the higher concentration of microalgal biomass at the end of cultivation the protein productivity of s quadricauda in hl and hl sio2 groups were more considerable and reached 95 37 and 101 36 mg l 1 d 1 respectively fig 4c additionally previous research indicated that carbohydrate a carbon storage compound in microalgae cells was often utilized as the predecessor for protein synthesis jiang et al 2016 thereby the relatively high protein content led to the reduction of carbohydrate accumulation in microalgal cells as shown in fig 4a the carbohydrate content of s quadricauda cultivated under different conditions ranged from 97 43 to 133 36 mg g 1 biomass and it was lower than the common content of microalgae 200 to 300 mg g 1 biomass recorded by previous work gao et al 2022 lipid is a major component of biodiesel and the lipid productivity of microalgae is a key parameter to assess production capacity of biodiesel during large scale engineering applications of microalgae technology khan et al 2018 in this study the lipid content and productivity in hl and hl sio2 groups was approximately 1 3 and 1 8 fold higher than those in ll and ll sio2 groups respectively fig 4a and c which also might be related to nitrogen and or phosphorus depletion at the end of cultivation in hl and hl sio2 groups wang et al 2013 as it was considered that starvation of nitrogen and or phosphorus could block the division and growth of microalgae and lipid accumulation was triggered under such environment stresses in microalgal cells ge and champagne 2016 moreover the light intensity of 150 μmol m 2 s 1 was beneficial for the enhancement of microalgal photosynthesis contributing to the biosynthesis and accumulation of pigments in s quadricauda cells the present result showed that the content of chl a and chl b significantly elevated with the increase of light intensity from 50 to 150 μmol m 2 s 1 p 0 05 and the carotenoid content also increased in high light groups although not significantly p 0 05 fig 4b although microalgae cellular pigments produced from wastewater are not suitable for food or medical industry they can be added to aquaculture and poultry feed as natural coloring ingredients khan et al 2018 which also increases considerable economic benefits 3 5 the potential mechanism of auto flocculation efficiency 3 5 1 influence of eps on auto flocculation efficiency to date the role of eps and cell surface charge in the auto flocculation of microalgae is still a controversial topic salim et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 the eps secretion of microalgal cells are susceptible to many factors including light intensity photoperiod nutrients and temperature zhao et al 2019 in the present study in response to high light irradiation eps secretion was obviously stimulated fig 5 a clearly showed that the total eps concentration in hl and hl sio2 groups was 2 14 fold higher than that in ll and ll sio2 groups among them the pn was the main component of eps in all groups accounting for 64 23 to 66 71 of the total eps more protein like substances in high light groups were also observed via eem fluorescence ex em 275 300 350 nm fig 5b chen et al 2021 correspondingly higher auto flocculation efficiencies of s quadricauda were recorded when cultivated under high light intensity suggesting that stimulating eps secretion enhanced the adsorption and bridging effect between microalgal cells and induced the aggregation and settlement of algal flocs salim et al 2014 these observations also agreed well with the previous study which found that chlorella sp cultivated at high light intensity exhibited a 4 3 fold higher auto flocculation than that in low light intensity and the protein in eps was the major contributor chen et al 2021 moreover to further demonstrate the significance of eps for auto flocculation the harvested s quadricauda was deprived of eps and the eps free algae cells in four groups were difficult to settle with a similar and lower ae of about 15 fig 2b concomitantly the properties of eps varied with light intensity as indicated by the ftir spectra fig 5c all groups showed a peak at 3420 cm 1 which is related to the stretching vibration of the associated o h groups in the ps zhao et al 2019 however more hydrophobic functional groups were observed in hl and hl sio2 groups the co stretching in proteins at the peak approximately 1655 cm 1 chen et al 2021 and c h deformation bending or stretching in the ps at the peak approximately 1440 cm 1 herrera et al 2022 further analysis revealed the distinct relative contents of four protein secondary structures in eps between high and low light groups fig s5 previous studies denoted that the pn secondary structures could strongly impact microbial bioflocculation and aggregation hou et al 2015 especially the β sheet the twisted and folded sheet structure in the β sheet was reported to allow the easier exposure of a large number of internal hydrophobic groups of amino acids contributing to a looser pn structure and hydrophobic algal surface hou et al 2015 jia et al 2017 in this study the proportion of β sheet structures was obviously elevated in hl and hl sio2 groups and a decrease of approximately 20 in hydrophily degree values was observed table 2 thus the more hydrophobic surface of s quadricauda cells was formed when cultivated under high light intensity which was conducive to trigger their auto flocculation in mad 20 moreover fig 5d showed that the zeta potential of s quadricauda cultivated under high light intensity decreased by 37 18 to 40 49 compared to that under low light intensity this might be attributed to the enhanced eps secretion in hl and hl sio2 groups resulting in the local generation of positive charges when the eps bound to the microalgae cells cheng et al 2020b in this case the repulsive electrostatic forces on the surface of the microalgae were reduced and overcome by the van der waals forces causing s quadricauda to flocculate salim et al 2014 therefore the variation in zeta potential of s quadricauda cells in this study was actually induced by the change in eps the property and composition of eps especially the protein secondary structures played a more critical role in auto flocculation of s quadricauda 3 5 2 influence of silicification on auto flocculation rate inspired by the silica shell of diatoms sio2 nanoparticles were incorporated onto s quadricauda to accelerate the auto flocculation process at the end of the cultivation large amounts of sio2 nanoparticles were attached to the cell surface of s quadricauda in hl sio2 groups as observed by sem and eds fig 6 d s6 and s7 under this condition the silicified s quadricauda aggregates overcame the buoyancy and rapidly auto flocculated by 89 25 within 30 min fig 2b which was significantly faster than the two hours or more commonly used in previous laboratory scale studies chen et al 2021 ge and champagne 2016 however due to the lack of natural silicification proteins or polypeptides cationic polyelectrolytes were previously added to impart the silicification ability of microalgae xiong et al 2017 in this study the eps secreted by s quadricauda in ll sio2 groups was insufficient and sio2 nanoparticles could not effectively adhere onto the algal cells surface fig 6b fortunately the high light intensity in hl sio2 groups stimulated the secretion of eps by s quadricauda which facilitated the attachment of sio2 nanoparticles to the surface of microalgae cells bridging was identified as a probable mechanism for this phenomenon when eps was partially bound the unoccupied part of eps could be bridged with sio2 nanoparticles and other algae cells forming a network of polymer silica and s quadricauda cells jiang et al 2021 conversely when eps bound completely with the microalgal cells it might locally generate positive charges cheng et al 2020b triggering localized electrostatic attraction between microalgal cells and bare sio2 nanoparticles with negative surface charges thus this strategy allowed silica to spontaneously bind to the surface of primary and proliferating s quadricauda cells without additional complex treatment and imparted diatom like characteristics to them greatly speeding up the auto flocculation process 3 6 economic feasibility and environmental significance the economic feasibility is a critical factor affecting the engineering application of coupling mad treatments with microalgae biomass production high cost pretreatment and dilution water as well as microalgae harvesting with high energy demand are the main challenges of this strategy chong et al 2022 it has been demonstrated that when mechanical centrifugation membrane filtration chemical flocculation or flotation is used microalgal harvesting processes typically account for 10 35 of the total energy demand sometimes up to 90 or more tu et al 2017 in addition it is difficult to separate chemical flocculants from flocculated microalgae which is the potential contamination of downstream processing different from conventional technologies auto flocculation is promising to be an alternative to reduce energy input currently few studies attempt to improve the auto flocculation of microalgae used for wastewater treatment in this study a low cost and bioinspired auto flocculation strategy that combined high light intensity induction and microalgal silicification was proposed this strategy involved the microalgal silicification process and secretion of functional eps by elevating light intensity thus facilitating the adhesion of s quadricauda cells and accelerating gravity sedimentation the applied silica nanoparticles 25 mg l 1 are biocompatible and environmentally friendly xiong et al 2017 as the silica is a common inorganic mineral therefore it greatly reduced the contamination risk to microalgae and downstream products however it should be noted that despite low toxicity at 25 mg l 1 the presence of remaining nanosilica in microalgal biomass might still pose potential health risks saleem et al 2021 it is recommended to investigate methods for the recovery and reuse of nanoparticles after microalgae harvest in future to reduce costs and potential toxicity risks furthermore in china most wwtps lack tertiary treatment units resulting in the direct discharge of effluent into natural water bodies in this study the effluent from wwtps was used to dilute the mad and it could not only alleviate the nutrient burden on downstream treatment units contributed by the reintroduction of mad into the original sewage channel but also greatly reduce environmental risks and costs related to dilution water concomitantly it also brought economic and environmental benefits taking a wwtp with an average daily sewage flow of 100 000 m3 as an example 3 65 106 m3 y 1 of mad is produced through anaerobic digestion systems based on 10 of the average daily sewage flow qiu et al 2021 according to the results of hl sio2 groups and the average element composition of microalgae c106h181o45n16p xia and murphy 2016 the microalgae system could produce 4 61 106 kg y 1 of dry algal biomass capture nitrogen and phosphorus in mad up to 4 26 105 kg y 1 world market value of 1 4 per kg and 5 90 104 kg y 1 0 13 per kg and sequestrate 2 42 106 kg y 1c co2 ge and champagne 2016 the microalgal biomass also contained extractable proteins 2 05 106 kg y 1 polysaccharides 6 15 105 kg y 1 lipids 1 14 106 kg y 1 and phytochromes 2 28 105 kg y 1 which could serve as suitable ingredient for biofuel animal and aquaculture feedstuff and agricultural fertilizer to increase economic profitability in terms of energy conversion although this strategy required higher light intensity it increased the biomass yield of s quadricauda and the content of lipid with high heating value fig 4a leading to obviously higher efficiency conversion efficiency in high light groups significantly higher than that in low light groups table s1 moreover compared to the conventional process of nitrification and denitrification the microalgae system could annually reduce the consumption of 6 67 103 kg of carbon sources and 1 13 107 kg of oxygen and avoid the emission of 9 17 106 kg of co2 and the production of 2 01 106 kg of sludge qiu et al 2021 in summary this study supplies an integrated strategy for low cost microalgae based biofuel production and anaerobic digestion treatment as well as energy efficient microalgae harvesting which is a meaningful step toward carbon neutrality and sustainable development of microalgal industry 4 conclusions s quadricauda was screened as dominant algae among the four candidate microalgae strains due to its potential for growth and auto flocculation efficiency and the mad 20 diluted with the wwtp effluent was an alternative to culture medium for s quadricauda growth s quadricauda showed remarkable growth rates nutrient removals and productivity of photosynthetic pigment lipid and carbohydrate when cultivated at high light intensity of 150 μmol m 2 s 1 concomitantly inspired by naturally generated silica shells of diatoms a low cost and bioinspired auto flocculation strategy that combined high light intensity induction and microalgal silicification was proposed the high light intensity stimulated the eps secretion of s quadricauda and induced the variation in content and property of eps especially the protein secondary structures moreover silica nanoparticles were spontaneously attached onto s quadricauda cells in the presence of the viscous eps and the silicified s quadricauda aggregates rapidly auto flocculated by 89 25 within 30 min at high light intensity the results of this study supply a promising approach for low cost microalgal based biofuel production

14909,coupling municipal anaerobic digestate mad treatments with microalgal cultivation can concomitantly achieve nutrient removal and microalgal bioenergy production however the high cost caused by dilution water and microalgal harvesting is a great challenge in this study scenedesmus quadricauda was screened as the most appropriate algae strain due to its potential for growth and auto flocculation and the mad diluted 5 fold with wwtp effluent was demonstrated as an ideal medium for s quadricauda growth moreover inspired by naturally generated silica shells of diatoms a low cost and biomimetic auto flocculation strategy that combined high light intensity induction and microalgal silicification was proposed to accelerate the auto flocculation process compared with low light intensity groups this strategy imparted diatom like features to s quadricauda cells and contributed to 3 07 fold higher auto flocculation efficiency within 30 min it was attributed to the fact that the high light intensity of 150 μmol m 2 s 1 stimulated the extracellular polymeric substances eps secretion and induced the variation in property and composition of eps especially the protein secondary structures which allowed silica nanoparticles to spontaneously attach onto s quadricauda cells in the presence of viscous eps furthermore this strategy significantly increased microalgal biomass yield to a dry weight of 1 37 g l 1 accompanied by 93 78 96 39 and 91 36 removals of nh4 n tp and cod respectively the productivity of valuable by products including lipid carbohydrate protein and pigment reached 56 30 101 35 30 39 and 11 28 mg l 1 d 1 respectively overall this study supplies a novel approach for low cost microalgal bioenergy production from mad and energy efficient microalgae harvest by auto flocculation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestate scenedesmus quadricauda nutrient removal auto flocculation eps silica nanoparticle data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microalgae based biomass is a highly promising candidate for sustainable and renewable biofuels production in the future owing to its striking advantages such as high biomass yields stronger co2 sequestration capacity low area requirements and higher tolerance to severe conditions khan et al 2018 kafil et al 2022 in recent years increasing efforts have been made to couple anaerobic digestate treatments with microalgal cultivation for simultaneous nutrient removal and microalgal bioenergy production cho et al 2013 wang et al 2019 despite these promising developments the large scale application of such an integrated strategy faces several core issues such as the high cost of pretreatment for anaerobic digestate and high energy demand for microalgal harvesting chong et al 2022 dilution has emerged as a feasible solution to alleviate the inhibition of anaerobic digestate and the effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtp can provide an available water source for dilution resulting in significant cost savings cho et al 2013 however harvesting microalgae from suspended culture systems remains a major challenge due to the small size of microalgal cells around 10 μm for one cell strong hydrophilicity and negative cell surface charge cheng et al 2020a this process has been demonstrated to take up approximately 30 of the total energy input molina grima et al 2003 auto flocculation is a promising approach to harvesting microalgal cells without the need for chemical flocculants thereby avoiding secondary pollution and energy consumption cheng et al 2020a auto flocculation refers to spontaneous aggregation and adhesion of microalgal cells to each other and gravity driven settlement and it can naturally occur in liquid media chen et al 2021 previous studies suggested that auto flocculation was related with the surface charge of microalgal cell aljuboori et al 2016 however more recent research demonstrated that auto flocculation could occur as a result of the production excretion adsorption and bridging of extracellular polymeric substances eps originating from microalgal surface salim et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 these epss are comprised of polysaccharides ps proteins pn and other substances they exhibit strong adhesion force due to their unique three dimensional structure thus facilitating the spontaneous adhesion and aggregation of microalgal cells chen et al 2021 several microalgae strains with auto flocculation characteristics were reported in previous research including scenedesmus quadricauda aljuboori et al 2016 tribonema sp cheng et al 2020b and ettlia texensis salim et al 2014 moreover optimizing the culture conditions could increase the auto flocculation efficiency for example chlorella sp a low flocculation microalgae strain exhibited 4 3 fold higher auto flocculation efficiencies at the high light intensity compared to low light intensity this was attributed to the enrichment of biological functions and positional rearrangement of increased pn within eps which promoted algal cell adhesion and bridging chen et al 2021 nonetheless the real anaerobic digestate is a complex system containing large amounts of negative charged organic substrates to date few studies have been conducted to decipher the effects of anaerobic digestate characteristics and culture conditions on auto flocculation behavior unfortunately it takes at least two hours for microalgal auto flocculation to achieve a stable harvest efficiency and the floating characteristic is an important factor leading to the low efficiency of microalgal auto flocculation cheng et al 2020a compared with other microalgae diatoms are more prone to remain sedimentary in water since their siliceous cell walls made of hydrated silicon dioxide can be used as a ballast to control water column position xiong et al 2017 however the major challenge is that microalgae without diatoms cannot inherently generate silica walls inspired by silica shells of diatoms the auto flocculation microalgae can be encapsulated within silica nanoparticles and endowed with diatom like characteristics to accelerate auto flocculation process in real municipal anaerobic digestate mad actually engineered nanoparticles have been widely applied in microalgal cultivation and harvesting a previous review reported that the effects of silica based nanoparticles on microalgae could be significantly altered by particle dosage size and microalgal species for instance 38 190 nm sio2 nanoparticles slightly promoted the growth of chlorella vulgaris but 50 mg l 1 sio2 nanoparticles 10 20 nm reduced the chlorophyll contents of scenedesmus obliquus lee et al 2015 for algal harvesting previous research reported that sio2 nanoparticles could not effectively incorporated onto microalgal cells by directly mixing with the microalgal suspension due to the lack of silicification proteins in microalgae but it also demonstrated that silicified cyanobacteria aggregates generated by using sio2 nanoparticles and polyelectrolyte were prone to settling and harvesting due to increased density and reduced buoyancy xiong et al 2017 furthermore particle based flocculation techniques were also developed such as those utilizing magnetic nanoparticles and aminoclay based nanoparticles which relied on charge neutralization bridging and electrostatic attraction mechanisms matter et al 2019 nevertheless no research has investigated the spontaneous incorporation of nanoparticles onto algal cells to accelerate the auto flocculation process and elucidate underlying mechanisms with this in mind this research screened the appropriate dilution ratio of mad and screened the dominant microalgae strains suitable for growth in real mad according to the biomass productivity and auto flocculation efficiency meanwhile to accelerate the auto flocculation of microalgae we developed a feasible treatment method of incorporating silica nanoparticles onto dominant microalgae cells by elevating the light irradiation to our knowledge it is a new method for incorporating silica nanoparticles to microalgae the dominant microalgae was cultivated by this method and microalgal growth nutrient removal biomass composition and auto flocculation efficiency were compared the aggregation effect microstructure and eps characteristics of dominant microalgae were further investigated to decipher the key dominating factors underlying microalgal auto flocculation this research can supply a reference for energy efficient microalgae separation and sustainable microalgal based biofuel production coupled with anaerobic digestate treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae incubation scenedesmus quadricauda fachb 44 chlorella vulgaris fachb 2338 chlorella pyrenoidosa fachb 27 and tribonema minus fachb 2215 were used in this study due to their versatility and effectiveness in removing pollutants from municipal and agricultural wastewater from different sources and their potential to produce valuable by products ge and champagne 2016 kafil et al 2022 liu et al 2022 wang et al 2020 the four microalgae strains were all obtained from the freshwater algae culture collection the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of science china the seed of strains were cultured in autoclaved bg 11 medium allen and stanier 1968 then the microalgae were incubated at 25 c in an illuminated incubator under a light intensity of 50 μmol m 2 s 1 with a 12 h 12 h light and dark cycle microalgae cultured in the mad were collected during rapid growth phase before inoculation in the mad the microalgae were collected by centrifuging 5000 rpm 15 min and washed to remove impurities by using distilled water 2 2 real anaerobic digestate and wastewater treatment plant effluent the mad was collected from an anaerobic digestor at the bailonggang wwtp in shanghai china which was a municipal wwtp the wwtp effluent was also collected from this wastewater treatment plant both mad and wwtp effluent were immediately transported back to the lab and stored at 4 c until use the collected sample was pretreated by sedimentation and filtration through 0 7 μm filter for solid separation the filtered sample was later passed through 0 45 μm and 0 22 μm sterile filters to ensure an axenic condition wang et al 2019 five concentration ratios of mad 50 33 3 20 10 and 5 v v diluted with wwtp effluent were used for microalgal cultivation and they were denoted as mad 50 mad 33 mad 20 mad 10 and mad 5 respectively the physicochemical characteristics of mad at different dilution rations and wwtp effluent are listed in table 1 2 3 experimental setup 2 3 1 screening of microalgae and anaerobic digestate firstly four microalgae s quadricauda c vulgaris c pyrenoidosa and t minus were cultured in mad 20 using the self designed photobioreactors pbr with 500 ml working volume fig s1 the air pump which was equipped with 0 22 μm bacteria filtered polyethersulfone membranes was connected to the cover of the pbr for through the silicone tubes each pbr contained an initial total microalgal biomass of approximately 0 22 g dry cell weight dw l 1 and it was aerated with filtered ambient air at 0 2 vvm 100 ml min 1 all pbrs were operated at 25 c under a light intensity of 50 μmol m 2 s 1 with a 12 h 12 h light and dark cycle the dominant microalgae strain was initially screened for subsequent experiments according to the biomass productivity and auto flocculation efficiency the second experiments tested the growth of the selected microalgae in different dilutions of anaerobic digestate media under the same conditions mentioned above to determine the appropriate dilution ratio the two tests conducted three replicates for each treatment then the dominant microalgae were sub cultured in diluted mad for six cycles to obtain stable activities prior to the following experiments chen et al 2021 2 3 2 cultivation and auto flocculation of s quadricauda in anaerobic digestate in this experiment silica nanoparticles 99 5 particle size 15 nm 5 nm were obtained from shanghai meryer chemical technology co ltd china before the experiment sio2 nanoparticles were prepared to 5 g l 1 in deionized water and were sonicated for 30 min 25 c and 40 khz to ensure that sio2 nanoparticles were fully dispersed to optimize the concentrations of sio2 nanoparticles the dominant microalgae were exposed to five concentrations of sio2 nanoparticles 0 10 25 50

then added to the screened diluted anaerobic digestate at a concentration of 25 mg l 1 the dominant microalgae were collected by centrifuging 5000 rpm 15 min and subsequently inoculated into the diluted anaerobic digestion with an initial total microalgal biomass of around 0 19 g dw l 1 the cultivation procedure was conducted at two light intensities of 50 and 150 μmol m 2 s 1 which were attained by adjusting the number of lamps and the distance between lamps and pbrs specifically the 50 μmol m 2 s 1 was categorized as the low light intensity ll and the high light intensity hl with 150 μmol m 2 s 1 was regarded as the optimal light intensity for producing algal biomass as reported in previous studies jiang et al 2016 gao et al 2022 hence the pbrs were divided into four experimental groups in three replicates 1 pbrs without sio2 nanoparticles at low light intensity 2 pbrs containing sio2 nanoparticles at low light intensity 3 pbrs without sio2 nanoparticles at high light intensity and 4 pbrs containing sio2 nanoparticles at high light intensity they were denoted as ll ll sio2 hl and hl sio2 groups respectively the other cultivation conditions of pbrs were adopted as described in section 2 3 1 during the cultivation period samples were daily collected to determine the microalgal growth and pollutants removal using sterile syringes at the end of cultivation auto flocculation tests were conducted at 25 c under ambient light irradiation chen et al 2021 samples were also collected for analysis of the aggregation effect microstructure biomass

brief the collected microalgae were washed three times by 0 1 m pbs and then prefixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde at 4 c for 24 h after fixation the samples were dehydrated by a series of ethanol and tertiary butanol 50 75 90 and 100 5 min per step and coated with a layer of gold 2 4 5 eps extraction and characterization the eps base extraction were employed to obtain the freeze dried eps ge and champagne 2016 park and novak 2007 supporting information text s2 the freeze dried eps were redissolved in deionized water pn content of eps from s quadricauda was quantified using the bradford method with bovine serum albumin as the standard bradford 1976 ps content was determined according to the anthrone sulfuric method with glucose as the standard dubois et al 1956 the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra of eps were measured using an f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer hitachi japan at 25 c with the excitation wavelength from 200 to 400 nm and emission wavelength from 250 to 550 nm ye et al 2020 subsequently the freeze dried eps powder was ground with potassium bromide to analyze the major functional groups of eps using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo scientific nicolet is20 usa in the 4000 400 cm 1 frequency band for further analysis of protein secondary structures in eps the second derivative spectra and deconvolution spectra of amide

chlorophyll a chl a chlorophyll b chl b and carotenoids were extracted with 80 acetone and analyzed using spectrophotometry method liu et al 2022 lipid content was extracted using chloroform methanol 2 1 v v method ge et al 2018 carbohydrate and protein were extracted according to an approach presented by the previous publications ge et al 2018 and quantified using anthrone sulfuric method and bradford method respectively details are described in supporting information text s4 2 4 7 economic and energy analysis the advantages of microalgal systems compared to traditional nitrification and denitrification systems were analyzed briefly the sludge production and oxygen demand during nitrification were 0 19 g vss g n and 4 86 g g n respectively while the carbon consumption co2 production and sludge production during denitrification were 2 86 mg cod g n 3 93 g g n and 0 67 g vss g n respectively qiu et al 2021 moreover the light radiation was regarded as input energy and the bioenergy of microalgal biomass was stored as lipids carbohydrates and proteins with their heating values of 36 3 17 3 and 23 9 kj g respectively chang et al 2023 details are described in supporting information text s5 2 5 statistical analysis statistical package of the social sciences 20 0 spss 20 0 software was used for statistical analysis significant differences between each treatment were tested by one way analysis of variance anova a p value less than 0 05 was considered as statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening of dominant algae species and suitable anaerobic digestate screening appropriate microalgal species is a crucial step for microalgae cultivation in anaerobic digestate systems four species of microalgae including s quadricauda c vulgaris c pyrenoidosa and t minus were screen in this study the results showed the different adaptability of four selected microalgae species to diluted anaerobic digestate as shown in fig 1 a s quadricauda and c vulgaris grew well in mad 20 during the 7 day cultivation and the maximum biomass yields of s quadricauda and c vulgaris reached a dw of 0 98 and 1 05 g l 1 on day 6 respectively by contrast despite the initial high growth rates in the first two days c pyrenoidosa and t minus exhibited a slower increase from day 2 to 7 and the maximum biomass yields were 0 81 and 0 69 g l 1 respectively which was significantly lower than s quadricauda and c vulgaris moreover after 7 day cultivation microalgal auto flocculation characteristics was evaluated the ae in 2 h was 63 62 for s quadricauda which was significantly higher than the values for c vulgaris c pyrenoidosa and t minus with 33 36 37 14 and 55 08 respectively p 0 05 fig 1b considering the reasonable growth and auto flocculation efficiency s quadricauda was screened as dominant microalgae strain for further study based on the above results the growth status of s quadricauda in mad with different dilution ratios was further explored after inoculation the growth of s quadricauda obviously declined in mad undiluted mad 50 and mad 33 which might be attributed to the toxicity from hazardous substances in anaerobic digestate such as ammonia chong et al 2022 previous studies have documented that high concentration of free ammonia in full or high strength digestions could diffuse across the cell membrane in microalgae thereby disrupting the microalgal photosynthetic system and even causing the lysis and death of algal cells pang et al 2020 in these cases dilution was typically used to alleviate inhibition of liquid digestions cho et al 2013 in this study when mad was diluted with wwtp effluents s quadricauda quickly adapted to mad 20 mad 10 and mad 5 without a noticeable lag growth period at the end of cultivation s quadricauda in mad 20 reached the maximum biomass production with 0 94 mg l 1 which was significantly higher than that in mad 10 and mad 5 p 0 05 fig s2 therefore it is possible to highlight that mad 20 is an ideal medium for s quadricauda growth considering the final biomass yields 3 2 growth and auto flocculation efficiency of s quadricauda as shown in fig s3 the optimization of sio2 nanoparticle concentration was conducted when the concentration exceeded 50 mg l 1 although exhibiting a higher auto flocculation efficiency it significantly inhibited the growth of s quadricauda p 0 05 in contrast regardless of low or high light intensity conditions after 6 days of cultivation 25 mg l 1 sio2 nanoparticles had no significant impact on the growth of s quadricauda p 0 85 and 0 61 respectively and presented better auto flocculation efficiency than the concentration of 10 mg l 1 therefore in this study s quadricauda was cultured in mad 20 with and without the incorporation of 25 mg l 1 sio2 nanoparticles at two light intensities of 50 and 150 μmol m 2 s 1 s quadricauda in all pbrs adapted well in mad 20 as indicated by the rapid growth during the first two days then the growth rates tended to slow and even zero and the dw maintained at 0 94 0 89 1 30 and 1 37 g l 1 in ll ll sio2 hl and hl sio2 groups on day 6 respectively fig 2 a in comparison to ll and hl groups there was no significant difference in the microalgal biomass of ll sio2 and hl sio2 groups p 0 60 and 0 44 respectively moreover the dynamics of microalgal biomass in groups containing sio2 nanoparticles shared a similar trend with that groups without sio2 nanoparticles fig 2a this founding was consistent with those reported by miglietta et al 2011 and yu et al 2018 who found that there was no significant inhibition of up to 200 mg l 1 sio2 nanoparticles particle size around 15 nm on growth of isocrisys galbana and chlamydomonas reinhardtii however another study observed that an exposure of 200 mg l 1 sio2 nanoparticles particle size 10 20 nm damaged around 40 of dunaliella tertiolecta cells and even exerted a moderate genotoxic action schiavo et al 2016 which differed from the findings presented here a possible explanation for this was the lower concentration of sio2 nanoparticles 25 mg l 1 added to mad 20 in this study in addition previous studies experimentally demonstrated that adsorption established between organic acid groups and hydroxyl groups on the silica surface and microalgae cells prevents the direct interaction van hoecke et al 2011 the decrease in toxicity might also attributed to the shielding of the sio2 nanoparticles by organic matter in anaerobic digestate moreover the biomass of s quadricauda was greatly affected by the variation of light intensity light is one of the most important environmental elements for microalgae cultivation and it determines the growth rate cell composition and physiological properties of microalgal cells gao et al 2022 khan et al 2018 it is apparent from fig 2a that the microalgal biomass was significantly elevated when the light intensity increased from 50 to 150 μmol m 2 s 1 p 0 05 correspondingly the pave in hl and hl sio2 groups was 0 19 and 0 20 mg l 1 d 1 respectively which was more than 1 5 fold higher than that in ll and ll sio2 groups with 0 12 mg l 1 d 1 fig s4 jiang et al 2016 gao et al 2022 overall the 25 mg l 1 sio2 nanoparticles added in mad 20 posed low risk to the growth of s quadricauda and it provided a prerequisite for silicifying the microalgal cells and enhancing the auto flocculation efficiency at the end of the cultivation different microalgal auto flocculation trends were observed as indicated by the ae variations in ll ll sio2 hl and hl sio2 groups fig 2a specifically the ae of hl and hl sio2 groups reached the peak value of approximately 85 and 92 at 60 and 40 min respectively while the ae of ll and ll sio2 groups reached only 61 09 and 68 66 even after 100 and 80 min respectively these observations suggested that s quadricauda cultivated at high light intensity of 150 μmol m 2 s 1 were more conducive to trigger their auto flocculation in real mad 20 furthermore the silicification of s quadricauda cells by sio2 nanoparticles contributed to their rapid sedimentation in a short time xiong et al 2017 with the ae levels in ll sio2 and hl sio2 groups at 30 min compared to those in ll and hl groups at 120 min fig 2b 3 3 bioremediation performance of s quadricauda s quadricauda not only exhibited excellent growth rates but also was efficient in removing nitrogen phosphorus and cod in mad 20 the specific growth rate generally was considered as a vital criterion for evaluating growth status of microalgae in wastewater liu et al 2022 the higher μmax value indicated that the algae strain had strong environmental adaptability which was usually positive to the higher nutrient removal efficiency liu et al 2022 the present results supported this and showed that s quadricauda cultured at light intensity of 150 μmol m 2 s 1 with and without incorporation of sio2 nanoparticles exhibited higher removal efficiencies of nh4 n 94 68 and 93 78 no3 n 87 40 and 85 52 tp 97 22 and 96 39 and cod 93 55 and 91 36 in mad 20 fig 3 accompanied by the observation of higher μmax value 0 87 and 0 81 d 1 in hl and hl sio2 groups fig s4 it should be noted that there was no significant difference in nutrient removal rate between groups with or without sio2 nanoparticles p 0 05 fig 3 which might be the shielding of the sio2 nanoparticles by organic matter in anaerobic digestate van hoecke et al 2011 moreover high light intensity enhanced the uptake of nutrients by s quadricauda especially phosphorus phosphorus is an important macronutrient that regulates growth and metabolism of microalgae phosphorus uptake with microalgae was affected by light intensity as a result of energy dependence of phosphorus uptake process powell et al 2009 in this study it should be noted that the rapid tp removal by s quadricauda was observed in hl and hl sio2 groups on day 1 which was 68 52 and 66 67 while the tp removal rate in ll and ll sio2 groups was 35 37 and 33 24 respectively fig 3c suggesting that the light intensity of 150 μmol m 2 s 1 contributed to the rapid phosphorous uptake with s quadricauda during the initial growth stage powell et al 2009 overall considering bioremediation performance and biomass yield it was advisable for s quadricauda cultivation in mad 20 at the light intensity of 150 μmol m 2 s 1 3 4 biomass content and productivity of s quadricauda the biomass content and productivity of microalgae determine their potential as biofuel feedstocks and other high value bioproducts when culture conditions including light intensity temperature carbon dioxide and nutrient concentrations are altered microalgae are capable of programmatic changes in carbon flow allocation and cellular biomass component in response to changes in the growth environment wang et al 2013 it has been reported that microalgae diverted the carbon fixed in the photosynthesis process from the pathway of protein synthesis to the pathway of lipid or carbohydrate synthesis to adapt to conditions of high light and nitrogen limitation wang et al 2013 in this study cellular biochemical compositions particularly in the relative amounts of protein lipid carbohydrate and pigments in s quadricauda varied with the changes in light intensity rather than the incorporation of sio2 nanoparticles as shown in fig 4 a the maximum content of protein was obtained in ll and ll sio2 groups 505 72 and 496 30 mg g 1 biomass respectively which was significantly higher than that in hl and hl sio2 groups 440 04 and 444 80 mg g 1 biomass respectively p 0 05 this might be attributed to the adverse effects of high light irradiance on photosystem ii in microalgal cells causing the detachment of the protein complex from the grana membranes while the protein synthesis by microalgae is hardly affected by the low light irradiance jiang et al 2016 nonetheless due to the higher concentration of microalgal biomass at the end of cultivation the protein productivity of s quadricauda in hl and hl sio2 groups were more considerable and reached 95 37 and 101 36 mg l 1 d 1 respectively fig 4c additionally previous research indicated that carbohydrate a carbon storage compound in microalgae cells was often utilized as the predecessor for protein synthesis jiang et al 2016 thereby the relatively high protein content led to the reduction of carbohydrate accumulation in microalgal cells as shown in fig 4a the carbohydrate content of s quadricauda cultivated under different conditions ranged from 97 43 to 133 36 mg g 1 biomass and it was lower than the common content of microalgae 200 to 300 mg g 1 biomass recorded by previous work gao et al 2022 lipid is a major component of biodiesel and the lipid productivity of microalgae is a key parameter to assess production capacity of biodiesel during large scale engineering applications of microalgae technology khan et al 2018 in this study the lipid content and productivity in hl and hl sio2 groups was approximately 1 3 and 1 8 fold higher than those in ll and ll sio2 groups respectively fig 4a and c which also might be related to nitrogen and or phosphorus depletion at the end of cultivation in hl and hl sio2 groups wang et al 2013 as it was considered that starvation of nitrogen and or phosphorus could block the division and growth of microalgae and lipid accumulation was triggered under such environment stresses in microalgal cells ge and champagne 2016 moreover the light intensity of 150 μmol m 2 s 1 was beneficial for the enhancement of microalgal photosynthesis contributing to the biosynthesis and accumulation of pigments in s quadricauda cells the present result showed that the content of chl a and chl b significantly elevated with the increase of light intensity from 50 to 150 μmol m 2 s 1 p 0 05 and the carotenoid content also increased in high light groups although not significantly p 0 05 fig 4b although microalgae cellular pigments produced from wastewater are not suitable for food or medical industry they can be added to aquaculture and poultry feed as natural coloring ingredients khan et al 2018 which also increases considerable economic benefits 3 5 the potential mechanism of auto flocculation efficiency 3 5 1 influence of eps on auto flocculation efficiency to date the role of eps and cell surface charge in the auto flocculation of microalgae is still a controversial topic salim et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 the eps secretion of microalgal cells are susceptible to many factors including light intensity photoperiod nutrients and temperature zhao et al 2019 in the present study in response to high light irradiation eps secretion was obviously stimulated fig 5 a clearly showed that the total eps concentration in hl and hl sio2 groups was 2 14 fold higher than that in ll and ll sio2 groups among them the pn was the main component of eps in all groups accounting for 64 23 to 66 71 of the total eps more protein like substances in high light groups were also observed via eem fluorescence ex em 275 300 350 nm fig 5b chen et al 2021 correspondingly higher auto flocculation efficiencies of s quadricauda were recorded when cultivated under high light intensity suggesting that stimulating eps secretion enhanced the adsorption and bridging effect between microalgal cells and induced the aggregation and settlement of algal flocs salim et al 2014 these observations also agreed well with the previous study which found that chlorella sp cultivated at high light intensity exhibited a 4 3 fold higher auto flocculation than that in low light intensity and the protein in eps was the major contributor chen et al 2021 moreover to further demonstrate the significance of eps for auto flocculation the harvested s quadricauda was deprived of eps and the eps free algae cells in four groups were difficult to settle with a similar and lower ae of about 15 fig 2b concomitantly the properties of eps varied with light intensity as indicated by the ftir spectra fig 5c all groups showed a peak at 3420 cm 1 which is related to the stretching vibration of the associated o h groups in the ps zhao et al 2019 however more hydrophobic functional groups were observed in hl and hl sio2 groups the co stretching in proteins at the peak approximately 1655 cm 1 chen et al 2021 and c h deformation bending or stretching in the ps at the peak approximately 1440 cm 1 herrera et al 2022 further analysis revealed the distinct relative contents of four protein secondary structures in eps between high and low light groups fig s5 previous studies denoted that the pn secondary structures could strongly impact microbial bioflocculation and aggregation hou et al 2015 especially the β sheet the twisted and folded sheet structure in the β sheet was reported to allow the easier exposure of a large number of internal hydrophobic groups of amino acids contributing to a looser pn structure and hydrophobic algal surface hou et al 2015 jia et al 2017 in this study the proportion of β sheet structures was obviously elevated in hl and hl sio2 groups and a decrease of approximately 20 in hydrophily degree values was observed table 2 thus the more hydrophobic surface of s quadricauda cells was formed when cultivated under high light intensity which was conducive to trigger their auto flocculation in mad 20 moreover fig 5d showed that the zeta potential of s quadricauda cultivated under high light intensity decreased by 37 18 to 40 49 compared to that under low light intensity this might be attributed to the enhanced eps secretion in hl and hl sio2 groups resulting in the local generation of positive charges when the eps bound to the microalgae cells cheng et al 2020b in this case the repulsive electrostatic forces on the surface of the microalgae were reduced and overcome by the van der waals forces causing s quadricauda to flocculate salim et al 2014 therefore the variation in zeta potential of s quadricauda cells in this study was actually induced by the change in eps the property and composition of eps especially the protein secondary structures played a more critical role in auto flocculation of s quadricauda 3 5 2 influence of silicification on auto flocculation rate inspired by the silica shell of diatoms sio2 nanoparticles were incorporated onto s quadricauda to accelerate the auto flocculation process at the end of the cultivation large amounts of sio2 nanoparticles were attached to the cell surface of s quadricauda in hl sio2 groups as observed by sem and eds fig 6 d s6 and s7 under this condition the silicified s quadricauda aggregates overcame the buoyancy and rapidly auto flocculated by 89 25 within 30 min fig 2b which was significantly faster than the two hours or more commonly used in previous laboratory scale studies chen et al 2021 ge and champagne 2016 however due to the lack of natural silicification proteins or polypeptides cationic polyelectrolytes were previously added to impart the silicification ability of microalgae xiong et al 2017 in this study the eps secreted by s quadricauda in ll sio2 groups was insufficient and sio2 nanoparticles could not effectively adhere onto the algal cells surface fig 6b fortunately the high light intensity in hl sio2 groups stimulated the secretion of eps by s quadricauda which facilitated the attachment of sio2 nanoparticles to the surface of microalgae cells bridging was identified as a probable mechanism for this phenomenon when eps was partially bound the unoccupied part of eps could be bridged with sio2 nanoparticles and other algae cells forming a network of polymer silica and s quadricauda cells jiang et al 2021 conversely when eps bound completely with the microalgal cells it might locally generate positive charges cheng et al 2020b triggering localized electrostatic attraction between microalgal cells and bare sio2 nanoparticles with negative surface charges thus this strategy allowed silica to spontaneously bind to the surface of primary and proliferating s quadricauda cells without additional complex treatment and imparted diatom like characteristics to them greatly speeding up the auto flocculation process 3 6 economic feasibility and environmental significance the economic feasibility is a critical factor affecting the engineering application of coupling mad treatments with microalgae biomass production high cost pretreatment and dilution water as well as microalgae harvesting with high energy demand are the main challenges of this strategy chong et al 2022 it has been demonstrated that when mechanical centrifugation membrane filtration chemical flocculation or flotation is used microalgal harvesting processes typically account for 10 35 of the total energy demand sometimes up to 90 or more tu et al 2017 in addition it is difficult to separate chemical flocculants from flocculated microalgae which is the potential contamination of downstream processing different from conventional technologies auto flocculation is promising to be an alternative to reduce energy input currently few studies attempt to improve the auto flocculation of microalgae used for wastewater treatment in this study a low cost and bioinspired auto flocculation strategy that combined high light intensity induction and microalgal silicification was proposed this strategy involved the microalgal silicification process and secretion of functional eps by elevating light intensity thus facilitating the adhesion of s quadricauda cells and accelerating gravity sedimentation the applied silica nanoparticles 25 mg l 1 are biocompatible and environmentally friendly xiong et al 2017 as the silica is a common inorganic mineral therefore it greatly reduced the contamination risk to microalgae and downstream products however it should be noted that despite low toxicity at 25 mg l 1 the presence of remaining nanosilica in microalgal biomass might still pose potential health risks saleem et al 2021 it is recommended to investigate methods for the recovery and reuse of nanoparticles after microalgae harvest in future to reduce costs and potential toxicity risks furthermore in china most wwtps lack tertiary treatment units resulting in the direct discharge of effluent into natural water bodies in this study the effluent from wwtps was used to dilute the mad and it could not only alleviate the nutrient burden on downstream treatment units contributed by the reintroduction of mad into the original sewage channel but also greatly reduce environmental risks and costs related to dilution water concomitantly it also brought economic and environmental benefits taking a wwtp with an average daily sewage flow of 100 000 m3 as an example 3 65 106 m3 y 1 of mad is produced through anaerobic digestion systems based on 10 of the average daily sewage flow qiu et al 2021 according to the results of hl sio2 groups and the average element composition of microalgae c106h181o45n16p xia and murphy 2016 the microalgae system could produce 4 61 106 kg y 1 of dry algal biomass capture nitrogen and phosphorus in mad up to 4 26 105 kg y 1 world market value of 1 4 per kg and 5 90 104 kg y 1 0 13 per kg and sequestrate 2 42 106 kg y 1c co2 ge and champagne 2016 the microalgal biomass also contained extractable proteins 2 05 106 kg y 1 polysaccharides 6 15 105 kg y 1 lipids 1 14 106 kg y 1 and phytochromes 2 28 105 kg y 1 which could serve as suitable ingredient for biofuel animal and aquaculture feedstuff and agricultural fertilizer to increase economic profitability in terms of energy conversion although this strategy required higher light intensity it increased the biomass yield of s quadricauda and the content of lipid with high heating value fig 4a leading to obviously higher efficiency conversion efficiency in high light groups significantly higher than that in low light groups table s1 moreover compared to the conventional process of nitrification and denitrification the microalgae system could annually reduce the consumption of 6 67 103 kg of carbon sources and 1 13 107 kg of oxygen and avoid the emission of 9 17 106 kg of co2 and the production of 2 01 106 kg of sludge qiu et al 2021 in summary this study supplies an integrated strategy for low cost microalgae based biofuel production and anaerobic digestion treatment as well as energy efficient microalgae harvesting which is a meaningful step toward carbon neutrality and sustainable development of microalgal industry 4 conclusions s quadricauda was screened as dominant algae among the four candidate microalgae strains due to its potential for growth and auto flocculation efficiency and the mad 20 diluted with the wwtp effluent was an alternative to culture medium for s quadricauda growth s quadricauda showed remarkable growth rates nutrient removals and productivity of photosynthetic pigment lipid and carbohydrate when cultivated at high light intensity of 150 μmol m 2 s 1 concomitantly inspired by naturally generated silica shells of diatoms a low cost and bioinspired auto flocculation strategy that combined high light intensity induction and microalgal silicification was proposed the high light intensity stimulated the eps secretion of s quadricauda and induced the variation in content and property of eps especially the protein secondary structures moreover silica nanoparticles were spontaneously attached onto s quadricauda cells in the presence of the viscous eps and the silicified s quadricauda aggregates rapidly auto flocculated by 89 25 within 30 min at high light intensity the results of this study supply a promising approach for low cost microalgal based biofuel production
