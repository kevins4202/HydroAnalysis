11975,in the past few decades numerous natural and human induced changes have led to decreases in the quantity and quality of water resources in iran the country s groundwater resources are currently in critical condition due to overexploitation and recent droughts the decline in groundwater aquifer levels has led to serious restrictions in more than 404 of 609 study areas and to a cumulative storage deficit of around 130 billion cubic meters in groundwater resources in 2014 implementation of the groundwater resources sustainability management plan was approved by the ministry of energy to reduce groundwater abstraction the project aims to reconcile water withdrawal rates with the natural recharge capacity of these resources and to restore the storage capacity lost in the last 20 years currently despite the ministry of energy s efforts over the last 5 years to develop a water sustainability plan the downward trend in groundwater levels has not only continued but has accelerated to discover the reasons for this failure pathological factors in the process were analyzed by identifying commonalities and differences in comparison to experiences in other countries the experiences of different countries in the field of water sustainability were evaluated to assess the status of sustainability plans in iran leading countries in the implementation of groundwater resources sustainability management were identified and laws pertinent to sustainability in these countries were studied for potential implementation to improve the water sustainability plan in iran based on the investigation of the sustainability plan in comparison to experiences in other countries suggestions are offered in four areas organizational and structural management information management human resource management and water supply through financial management to improve the groundwater resources sustainability management plan in iran according to the results of the present comparative analysis water governance structures and local community participation need to be improved in order to strengthen the effectiveness of the national sustainability plan water resource management should take place in a democratic manner with the participation and consent of all stakeholders and should follow integrated and adaptive management guidelines otherwise water resource management and sustainability are unlikely to be optimized and the tangible outcomes of continued failure are unforeseeable graphical abstract image 1 keywords challenge water sustainability plan comparative studies iran 1 introduction the term sustainable development was first used by the world commission on environment and development in a report titled our common future by brundtland et al 1987 and approved that same year by the united nations general assembly under resolution a res 42 187 according to the definition in this resolution sustainable development means meeting the needs of the current human generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs this definition also takes into account natural environmental sustainability alley et al 1999 considered groundwater sustainability as the development and exploitation of these resources at an infinite time with no detrimental environmental economic or social impacts according to their interpretation the definition of destructive effects is highly dependent on expert judgment and requires several criteria in addition groundwater sustainability must be defined in terms of the hydrological cycle of which groundwater is a part because a rate of groundwater exploitation considered acceptable based on changes in groundwater level may still result in a severe undesirable reduction in surface water resources iran is located in arid and semi arid regions of the earth recent droughts have reduced average long term rainfall from 254 mm to about 240 mm per year equivalent to one third of the global average and less than half of the continental rainfall in asia rainfall in iran is estimated at 405 billion cubic meters per year of which about 280 billion cubic meters are directly lost through evapotranspiration with less than the remaining 120 billion cubic meters in water reservoirs in the country 90 billion cubic meters of surface water and 30 billion cubic meters of groundwater the rate of groundwater use in iran is estimated to be three times as high as the global average sustainability plan progress report 2016 as a result of declines in groundwater levels and reservoirs volumes about 404 out of 609 study areas are in a state of restricted exploitation and development a further important consideration is that more than 90 of the groundwater potential of iran is located in these restricted areas fig 1 the country s aquifers now face an average reservoir volume deficit of 5 8 billion cubic meters annually in the last 47 years groundwater reservoir consumption has been around 130 billion cubic meters about 40 billion cubic meters of this loss occurred in the first 30 years of this 47 year period with more than 90 billion cubic meters lost in the last 17 years and 28 billion cubic meters lost in the last 7 years fig 2 these losses refer to quantitative changes in these sources but from a qualitative point of view the country s groundwater resources face other severe challenges with salinity in these study areas more than doubling over 17 years in several aquifers in iran the quality of groundwater has undergone unsustainable changes that will bring groundwater reserves very close to extinction if there is continued overuse disregarding the status of groundwater in iran is having a number of consequences springs qanats wells rivers and lagoons are drying up with an average reduction of 40 in groundwater resources in the last 10 years gardens and agricultural lands are also drying up given that approximately 5 million hectares of agricultural lands are irrigated with groundwater resources groundwater quality is deteriorating due to saline water intrusion and land subsidence the destruction of natural groundwater reservoirs and damage to infrastructures are also among the consequences wells are being displaced and the depth of wells is increasing along with energy consumption due to increased water depth urban migration and suburbanization around major cities are further contributing factors which may endanger political security and increase food insecurity report on security challenges and consequences of water scarcity in iran 2016 in 2014 the groundwater resources sustainability management plan grsmp was approved by the ministry of energy to reduce water abstraction and restore groundwater resources one of the short term aims of this plan called for 500 million cubic meters of reservoir deficit to be recovered in 2015 and an intermediate term aim targeted the recovery of a mean reservoir deficit of 5 7 billion cubic meters over the following 6 years up to 2021 a long term aim was the recovery of a 130 billion cubic meter reservoir deficit over a period of 15 years to provide some context for these goals before 1970 the groundwater reservoir deficit amounted to 123 million cubic meters between 1970 and 1983 this deficit was 1 7 billion cubic meters between 1983 and 2006 it was 68 billion cubic meters between 2006 and 2011 it was 34 billion cubic meters and from 2011 to the present this deficit has been about 28 billion cubic meters in all more than 130 billion cubic meters of aquifer reserves have been lost fig 2 five years after the implementation of the grsmp in iran groundwater reservoirs continue to shrink it is a good time to pose some questions regarding the continuing trend for groundwater reservoir volume deficits to increase why are groundwater reserves decreasing despite various plans to halt this trend can the grsmp in iran stop this process or will withdrawals from fixed reserves continue are the reasons for the ineffectiveness of the measures known in this article the grsmp in iran is critically reviewed to characterize the pathological elements that limit its success based on comparisons with selected countries first the history of groundwater sustainability management plans in iran is summarized and the latest ongoing sustainability plans are outlined then the status of sustainability plans in the usa states of california spain and india is described in order to compare the performance of the grsmp in iran with similar projects in other countries these comparisons are grounded on the assumption that applying international experiences can help develop optimal policies while saving costs and time this is followed by investigating the grsmp in iran based on these comparisons to conclude suggestions are offered in four areas organizational and structural management information and data management human resource management and water supply through financial management these proposals are intended to improve the sustainability of groundwater resources in iran this data and analyses in this article are potentially useful to other developing countries and countries that foresee the implementation of new sustainability plans for their water resource management 2 background and summary of the groundwater resources sustainability management plan in iran 2 1 roots of water resource development and management in iran the roots of water resource management in iran go back 60 years in the first stage between 1960 and 1980 there were three major events the first was technological evolution and the arrival of deep well technology the second was the change in water rights and the extension of public rights to water resources wherein legislation nationalized water resources and ended private water laws these measures were supplemented by the fair water distribution act the third was the islamic revolution the result of which was a wave of unauthorized exploitation and licensing of wells between 1970 and 1980 in the second stage the ministry of energy developed a plan to reform groundwater management in 2004 a plan for sustainability artificial recharge and flood distribution in 2005 led to continued improvements in groundwater management the national goals of this plan were to increase the efficiency of groundwater resources and to avoid the overexploitation of aquifers located in off limits and critical plains the quantitative target of the plan called for achieving the aim of equilibrium through four 5 year plans but because of the lack of support from other agencies the lack of effort among water sector managers and the lack of sufficient funding the project did not yield the desired results in the third stage in 2010 a law was passed to determine the status of unauthorized wells which resulted in the suspension of activities in the field of water resource instability finally in 2014 the grsmp comprising 15 projects was approved at the ministerial level according to this plan the 15 projects are implemented directly by three governmental organizations with the cooperation and support of the ministry of the interior and the management and planning organization eleven projects are under the purview of the ministry of energy three projects are overseen by the ministry of agriculture jihad and one project is managed by the geological survey of iran implementation of the projects in different provinces of the country is in the responsibility of regional water companies agriculture jihad departments natural resources and watershed management departments and the geological survey table 1 3 background and summary of alternative groundwater resource management efforts 3 1 sustainable water management plan in california usa california is located in southwestern usa the state covers an area of 493 970 square kilometers i e about a quarter of iran the annual rainfall in the state varies from 3500 mm in the northwest to less than 100 mm in the southeast and averages 600 mm a year groundwater plays a vital role in providing california s water resources as it supplies approximately 40 of the water used in california s farms and cities and up to 60 percent during drought periods of california s total population about 30 million people 85 depend on groundwater for drinking water currently from 515 basins and sub basins in this state 21 are in a critical situation because of overexploitation chappelle et al 2017 groundwater management in california can be divided into two periods until 2014 groundwater management was not mandatory and there were no groundwater management laws that could be implemented in a unified manner across the state accordingly prior to 2014 groundwater management was optionally implemented by local companies with the change in attitude to water resource management in 2014 the sustainable groundwater management act sgma the first legislation of its kind in california was announced by governor jerry brown the department of water resources categorized basins and sub basins as high medium and low priority this organization also classified 127 watersheds into medium and high priority according to the crisis level these 127 basins supply 96 of the groundwater resources in california and more than 88 of the population that uses groundwater resides in these basins moir et al 2018 hanak and harter 2017 aquifers with the highest crisis level are at the forefront in the implementation of the following aims 1 by the end of 2017 agencies in the field of groundwater management should be established 2 sustainability plans for these basins should be developed by 2020 3 all aquifers should reach sustainability by 2040 and achieve increasing groundwater levels if possible 4 if water agencies in some areas face problems in planning and implementing these measures the department of water resources shall intervene as the reference organization the department of water resource of california has outlined a general framework for a sustainability plan to be developed by groundwater sustainability agencies according to which the plan should be formulated for the purpose of groundwater management and utilization in such a way that there are no undesirable effects during implementation and long term groundwater exploitation possible undesirable consequences include severe groundwater depletion ground subsidence loss of groundwater quality depletion of surface water saline water intrusion in coastal aquifers and depletion of strategic reserves cwf 2014 california legislative information 2014 smith and abhold 2015 girard 2016 wef 2016 moir et al 2018 rogers 2016 in california participatory management is part of the sgma to ensure the participation of local people in the development of this law the california water foundation formed a stakeholder council to provide recommendations for achieving sustainable groundwater management the council is made up of representatives of farmers water agencies and environmentalists the creation of such an advisory body within the groundwater management system enables problems to be identified as accurately and efficiently as possible this dialogue does not seek final agreement on solutions rather it focuses on identifying and understanding the full range of stakeholder opinions concerns and ideas participants provide their criticisms and recommendations based on their personal experience and expertise without formal organization and with flexibility and openness in discussions cwf 2014 hanak and jezdimirovic 2016 research in california found that information about social norms related to water scarcity is more effective than providing information on how to save water fielding and hornsey 2016 seyranian et al 2015 the biggest problem with public information efforts about water scarcity problems is the lack of immediate obvious consequences for local communities because of the easy uninterrupted access to water resources therefore one efficient approach is to use animated and live action films to illustrate social norms caused by water scarcity 3 2 sustainable water management plan in india india has about 16 of the world s population about 2 45 of the world s total land area and about 4 of the world s fresh water the average annual volume of rainfall is 4000 billion cubic meters of which only about 1869 billion cubic meters are available of this latter volume only 1123 billion cubic meters are used 690 billion cubic meters of surface water and 433 billion cubic meters of groundwater suhag 2016 india is one of the largest users of groundwater resources in the world experience has shown that groundwater management faces many challenges in this country groundwater is the main source of agricultural water supply in india currently accounting for about 80 of the agricultural water in addition groundwater is also important as a source of drinking water with approximately 90 of the rural water supply coming from groundwater resources kulkarni and shankar 2010 jha and sinha 2009 kulkarni et al 2009 according to the groundwater management committee report in 2004 about 28 of india s blocks nationally recognized administrative units were in semi critical critical or over critical condition in terms of groundwater development compared to only 4 in 1995 the rapid change in status between 1995 and 2004 should be considered a warning for the future planning commission 2007 india has recently made significant efforts in the field of sustainable groundwater management by utilizing multidimensional management which includes vegetation management groundwater resource management urban area management education and health management in 1970 the ministry of water resources enacted a series of laws to protect groundwater resources and regulate water use these laws were revised in 1972 1996 and 2005 suhag 2016 and included mandatory registration for water well owners the need to obtain permits to drill new wells and limits on the depth of wells in addition to creating safeguards to the groundwater supply of drinking water the requirements of the environmental protection act of 1986 includes measures to review groundwater potentials on a scientific basis regarding current water quality adjust the exploitation of groundwater resources so that no further extraction over recharge occurs integrate and coordinate surface and groundwater management and prevent excessive groundwater extraction near the coast to prevent seawater intrusion in 2000 plans and projects under the urban water supply program were implemented in india the projects explored various factors that have reduced water resources in india and outlined several ways to achieve sustainable management the factors that have reduced water resources in india include 1 competitive demand for groundwater for irrigation and industrial use 2 overexploitation of groundwater resources without considering recharge conditions 3 low energy prices for agricultural and industrial uses 4 lack of groundwater management and scientific research 5 misconceptions about water resources as a free and ever lasting commodity and 6 lack of sustainability laws to prevent unsustainable use rwsp 2000 the project proposes the following methods for achieving sustainable resources 1 considering water as an economic resource not as a free commodity 2 the need to ensure local community participation in planning developing and implementing a water supply plan to achieve sustainability 3 enforcing payment and legal penalties for water consumption control especially in stressed areas 4 gradually eliminating all industry and agricultural water supply subsidies 5 raising awareness of the need for water conservation and encouraging self centric conservation of water resources through education systems and communication programs 6 regular groundwater monitoring 7 providing alternative water supplies in critical areas 8 restoring traditional water extraction and consumption systems 9 rainwater storage to cover a range of household uses and 10 attention to basin level development and management and promoting the protection of forests to help increase groundwater recharge rwsp 2000 successful water resource management practices in india are including tailoring strategies for sustainable water resource management to different climates and water conditions areas with different hydrogeological characteristics and diverse customs and local traditions rather than implementing a single strategy energy tariffs on agricultural and industrial uses and pricing have be increased by establishing a water regulatory agency in each state and also by enforcing payment and penalties to improve consumption control especially in stressed areas traditional water extraction and consumption systems restored forest conservation promoted to help increase groundwater recharge training programs developed for farmers to increase public understanding of groundwater resources and encourage local actors to participate in agricultural planning among the main potential achievements of this project are improved cropping patterns increased groundwater levels and economic benefits due to better management of agricultural plans and groundwater resources hamilton 2012 perveen et al 2012 changing the top down management approach to local management has made it possible for india to undertake the creation of local institutions and has yielded valuable expertise in this field in this country government organizations with the help of non governmental local agencies have established farmers associations and some local institutes and this cooperation has improved groundwater management hamilton 2012 3 3 sustainable water management plan in spain spain is the most arid country in the european union especially in its central and eastern areas and thus faces significant problems in relation to water use and management currently groundwater provides between 15 and 20 of all water used in the country although it may approach 100 in some peninsular areas and island regions hernández mora et al 2007 average aquifer recharge in spain has been estimated at about 30 000 mm3 year or about 30 of the total water resources available in the country ministerio de medio ambiente 2000 groundwater use in spain has increased from 2000 million cubic meters in 1960 6500 million cubic meters in 2000 mma 2000 however due to differences in climate geology population density and the relative importance of agriculture groundwater use rates vary widely across spain molinero et al 2011 following implementation of the wfd a report titled baseline description was submitted to the european union by spanish water authorities ministerio de medio ambiente 2006 lopez geta 2007 according to the report 699 aquifers have been recognized in spain taking into account qualitative and quantitative aspects a total of 259 37 aquifers were categorized in the danger status according to wfd environmental objectives 89 aquifers due to quantitative data and the rest due to qualitative conditions 184 26 were reported to be in a safe state in good environmental condition and 256 37 were awaiting further evaluation to determine their environmental conditions insufficient information was available to determine the exact status of these aquifers hernandez mora et al 2007 molinero et al 2011 water resource management in spain is carried out by river basin agencies these organizations managed by the central government started operating in the late 1920s and represent a major breakthrough in water management in the country the 1985 spanish water act declared groundwater as a public domain resource management in each basin was assigned to the river basin agencies restrictions apply to users in both public and private property regimes and no new pumping permits can be granted in overexploited basins the river basin agencies are charged with developing a management plan and determining the amount of withdrawal for each consumer in every basin in 2000 after 15 years of implementation of this act the spanish ministry of environment reported that the status of groundwater resources remained poor and that the formal declaration of catchments as overexploited with consequent limitations on withdrawal had not significantly improved the groundwater situation the report noted that out of the 500 000 wells in spain only 25 were officially registered and licensed in addition the report indicated that a major challenge was the drilling of unauthorized wells and the inability of river basin agencies to control and prevent the increase in the number of wells the report identified the root of the problem by stating that river basin agencies have failed to attract public participation in groundwater management due to the existence of top down management policies and the imposition of decisions on farmers in 2004 the spanish ministry of the environment following on from the development of a groundwater management reform plan held a public consultation to identify major shortcomings and needs in groundwater management six public meetings were held and were attended by university professors stakeholder representatives river basin agencies and research institutes in this public consultation a plan was proposed to promote and strengthen the role of groundwater user associations as management direction bodies in other words instead of the river basin agencies the user associations would become responsible for the task of planning decision making operation and evaluation in each basin the project is thus an effort to change the spanish government s approach from centralized management to participatory management hernández mora et al 2010 molinero et al 2011 esteban and dinar 2013 4 comparative analysis of grsmp and alternative groundwater resource management in this section according to comparative analysis with successful plans in other countries and based on domestic experience challenges of the groundwater resources sustainability management plan implementation in iran are presented and practical solutions suggested to improve the grsmp implementation in iran within the framework of four main strategies and sub strategies organizational and management structure data management and information updating human resource management and measures to attract local support and water supply through financial management flowchart that presented in fig 3 is showing the schematic representation of comparative analysis processes in this part the solutions for improving grsmp in iran are also summarized in table 2 this table shows from which countries the suggestions are modeled on 4 1 organizational structure management 4 1 1 the high burden of tasks and duties at first glance one of the major drawbacks of the grsmp in iran is the considerable number of projects foreseen according to the well known 80 20 law also known as pareto s law a well studied principle in management quality 80 of the achievements come from 20 of the efforts accordingly focusing 80 of the time and energy on the 20 that really matters is likely to be an efficient way to arrive at an intelligent solution for a problem biham et al 2004 a review of the list of sustainability projects in iran shows an overwhelming number and variety of areas ranging from police and emergency measures to educational and cultural activities as well as technical measures such as implementing artificial recharge and improving the groundwater monitoring network which can divert the focus of the project manager from the main aim it might have been better to prioritize the implementation of the 15 projects noted above in section 2 1 with more weight and priority being given to the main projects depending on local conditions and the possibility of fund allocation 4 1 2 lack of participatory management regarding participatory management community involvement goes far beyond consumption management community support and oversight are essential to rebuild successful governance and groundwater management groundwater management in iran has been centralized from the top down in this approach decisions are made centrally and then transferred to the lower levels and the relationships between levels are completely vertical in this structure water beneficiaries are required to execute programs developed at the highest levels although they do not themselves have a role in decision making or planning this lack of involvement by stakeholders in key processes has not only made them reluctant to participate in the implementation of government programs to protect groundwater resources but has also fomented confrontation with government officials in some cases there is evidence that in almost all cases sealing an unauthorized well despite a court order and the presence of law enforcement officers results in conflict the california groundwater sustainability act is a notable example of participatory local management implementation where the frameworks and constraints are well defined and there is flexibility to consider the specific conditions of each basin in addition in spain after about 20 years of centralized management experiences and high costs it was concluded that effective groundwater management would not be possible without public participation and that public participation would not be achieved through top down management rules esteban and dinar 2013 also in groundwater sustainability plan in india in 2000 and 2005 mentioned that main way to achieve sustainable management is to ensure local community participation in planning developing and implementing a water supply plan to achieve sustainability another challenge in the formulation of projects within the grsmp in iran is the lack of consideration of the private sector s and stakeholders inputs and concerns projects have been formulated by experts and government officials and a governance perspective can be perceived in all areas based on the procedures proposed here for optimal water governance water conservation guidelines and measures should be based on the will of the people to ensure sustainable support for program execution therefore the projects should be evaluated surveyed revised and amended by water users as a way to favor acceptance and compliance while as mentioned in section 3 in spain and california this style of local participation has been applied and they received useful management mechanisms with this consulting system 4 1 3 the definition of a nationwide general management system according to california s sustainability act and management style in india groundwater management should be designed for the specific conditions and needs of each basin even within a basin management goals can change according to different conditions wef 2016 however in iran the same rules for sustainable groundwater resources have been put in place nationwide despite the fact that climatic conditions vary widely over different areas of this very large country 4 1 4 incomplete implementation of the grsmp in iran for all 15 sustainability projects in iran one study area as a pilot was required initially and if a thorough evaluation determined that the pilot was successful the project was to be implemented for other aquifers for a full evaluation of the sustainability plan it is necessary to have all 15 projects implemented together in a pilot in which case the status of the aquifer and the effectiveness of the projects after implementation will be assessed however only one or two projects are currently running in each of the pilots selected by the water resources management department which can only be evaluated separately if sustainability is not achieved it would be justifiable to reconsider full implementation of all plans it may even be possible to implement some of these projects in numerical models and use them to check the results rather than investing considerable amounts of money in pilot aquifers 4 1 5 non normative targeting the definition of short medium and long term goals has been encumbered by inappropriate timing defining a reasonable time horizon is essential in all current and foreseeable situations climate change population growth groundwater level fluctuations and environmental goals are important for efforts to update groundwater management plans in other words programs should not be considered as final all are highly dynamic and capable of modification the effects of overexploitation for several decades require a considerable amount of time to overturn and achieve equilibrium as one example of the time needed compensate for the damage to aquifers in iran the cumulative overdraft of groundwater resources is about 120 billion cubic meters and if we could reduce withdrawal to about 6 billion cubic meters annually it would take us almost 20 years to reach 120 billion cubic meters to stabilize the situation as another example renewable groundwater natural recharge in iran is about 30 billion cubic meters annually and if we divide 120 by 30 4 years of groundwater recharge without any abstraction from aquifers would be needed to compensate for 120 billion cubic meters however implementation of the second example is impossible given that aquifer abstraction cannot realistically be halted an additional concern is the unrealistically short timeframe of only 6 years to stop the negative trend in groundwater levels and storage also after 20 years of grsmp involvement in aquifer restoration 4 1 6 failure to consider requirements and barriers barriers and the consequences of delays are not considered in project implementation planning norms prior to defining projects and goals requires an awareness of structural administrative and judicial requirements in addition legal and social barriers should be considered including unemployment and lack of alternative occupational opportunities for unauthorized users stakeholders reluctance to participate in water resource conservation plans and a lack of social capital institutional and structural constraints are another potential issue that can interfere with duties or undermine authority and the undeniable influence of outside decision making authorities must also be considered moreover technical constraints in for example the field of optimum water use technologies along with political and international factors such as sanctions present further challenges if these barriers are not anticipated in the plan its goals will not be met therefore further implementation of grsmp in iran should identify possible constraints and delays so that planning can be modified accordingly in addition the root causes of the problems need to be analyzed and appropriate solutions considered before the plan and project are formulated however these procedures are not observed in preparing sustainability projects in iran 4 1 7 inadequate prioritization of projects implementation prioritizing project implementation is of great importance for example participatory project management which was not costly to implement has been suspended and the more expensive project to install meters and close unauthorized wells has been given priority in all mentioned countries the first priority for reaching water sustainability is focusing on the potential of local people in addition to the cost issue it is imperative that compulsory measures such as well sealing and meter installation be incorporated in participatory management awareness raising and governance improvement projects the issue of participatory management is clearly fading in importance sealing unauthorized wells should be prioritized over the meter installation project because the consumption from unauthorized wells is not measured and abstraction from these wells is continuing without any limitation 4 1 8 contradictions among rules one of the problems with implementation of the sustainability plan in iran is the inconsistency in the rules governing the installation of meters for authorized wells according to article 12 of the law on the fair distribution of water the operator should pay for the well meter yet the fifth plan of development indicates that the cost should paid by the government the sixth plan states that the cost should be borne by the operator although the facilities are provided at no cost the government s budget for 2018 states that the cost is to be borne by the operator but says nothing about the cost of facilities these contradictions will cause distrust among the users the cost of installing well meters in california is shared between farmers and the government 4 1 9 neglecting the need for adaptive management adaptive management has thus far been neglected in iran in areas of high water demand for agricultural use the hydrogeological and socioeconomic environment of a given aquifer usually determines the form of management and can limit the management options also because groundwater systems are constantly evolving and there is significant uncertainty and sometimes rapid change the adaptive approach to groundwater resource management would seem most appropriate 4 1 10 neglecting integrated water resource management failure to apply integrated water resource management strategies is another drawback of current efforts in iran to define sustainability in a given catchment addressing surface water resources and groundwater independently can lead to miscalculation of the amount of water resources that can be exploited therefore the sustainability of a specific catchment should be determined by considering a suite of factors including surface water groundwater environmental needs and water body quality in order to estimate the sustainable discharge or programmable sustainable water resources for a given basin 4 2 data management 4 2 1 neglecting water quality sustainability all projects to date emphasize quantitative sustainability and disregard qualitative sustainability of groundwater resources the sustainability plan objectives are designed with a view to reservoir deficit compensation and quantitative sustainability while qualitative sustainability has not been considered to be effective a sustainable management plan should include multidimensional parameters such as vegetation management groundwater management urban area management education and health management in addition to quantitative sustainability social economic environmental and political sustainability also need to be addressed 4 2 2 incompatibility between plans and policies in iran some elements of the aquifer sustainability plan are incompatible with food self sufficiency policies water based employment and livelihood problems have arisen after changes in agricultural productivity criteria to deal with this problem production per hectare should be replaced by production per unit of consumable water 4 3 human resource management 4 3 1 lack of transparency the documentation in this massive program regarding steps to ensure transparency in project implementation for the public is scarce moreover the evaluation of past performance is inadequate accurate consistent information is unavailable for stakeholders or institutions that are expected to collaborate in activities for sustainability management this is another shortcoming given that the results need to be analyzed documented and disseminated to different levels of society there is a slim boundary between not knowing the risks for groundwater sustainability and honestly defending the benefits of exploitation on one hand and blatant corruption and disregard for known negative consequences on the other the most effective way to deal with this is to help raise awareness of the constraints and vulnerabilities among all water users and to improve transparency of the information through free access to data and information on wells and on the status of groundwater resources and their quality the confidential nature of some water resource information and its inaccessibility to the general public are among the problems that preclude the assessment of the overall status of groundwater resource sustainability at the national level in iran 4 3 2 lack of cooperation between different organizations a final barrier is the lack of cooperation and support from the ministry of agriculture jihad although this government project was designed as a complement to the groundwater sustainability plan unfortunately some aspects of the jihad have created impediments to sustainability efforts for example the ministry of agriculture has not shown strong performance in encouraging farmers to change to low water crops due to the lack of market demand for these crops 4 4 others 4 4 1 development of a modern irrigation network without reducing the groundwater discharge capacity another issue is the development of a modern irrigation network without reducing the groundwater discharge capacity which needs to be considered in the light of local cropping patterns in most areas the project has not reduced the amount of water discharge because farmers maintain the water discharge level they have expanded their land use and changed cropping patterns to increase yields so the implementation of this plan has thus far not helped to save the country s water resources 5 conclusions in this study we trace the challenges of the grsmp in iran first by identifying the regulations relevant to the sustainability of groundwater resources in this country then by identifying weaknesses in previous and current projects and their implementation by comparing existing laws to those in developed and developing countries finally a number of suggestions are offered to address these weaknesses and move forward what is clear is that until now the management of water resources by the ministry of energy without stakeholder involvement and without considering the potential limitations to groundwater resource recharge has created prerequisites for overexploitation with negative implications for aquifers around the country only a participatory management approach based on awareness and transparency between government agencies and stakeholders can create a stimulus for better water resource management therefore it is recommended that the ministry of energy and water management authorities in the country define and put in place an effective mechanism to implement this approach it should be noted that the preparation and implementation of participatory plans will require cooperation oversight and executive support from the relevant government departments and agencies this approach will have two important consequences 1 gaining the trust and support of water users in the implementation of the groundwater sustainability plan and 2 empirical identification by water users of potential problems of the plans and implementation of the necessary improvements at each evaluation stage practical solutions to improve the country s water resource management through a sustainability plan can be developed in four main strategies 1 organizational structure management can be optimized through the establishment of an advisory system to review the sustainability plan development of participatory and local management implementation of integrated and adaptive management and reform of the administrative structure and management of traditional groundwater exploitation systems 2 information management can be strengthened by defining the amount of groundwater abstraction according to 6 criteria decline in groundwater quality and quantity ground subsidence surface water depletion saline water intrusion and strategic reserves decline and by documenting all measures and sharing all existing information 3 human resource management can be improved by creating voluntary water reduction goals recruiting empowered staff in different sectors and increasing public awareness 4 financial management can be optimized through water pricing examining virtual water issues and rainwater storage focusing on water loss from old infrastructures modernizing agricultural irrigation systems and prioritizing the implementation of sustainability projects in study areas based on their critical priority declaration of competing interest the authors

11975,in the past few decades numerous natural and human induced changes have led to decreases in the quantity and quality of water resources in iran the country s groundwater resources are currently in critical condition due to overexploitation and recent droughts the decline in groundwater aquifer levels has led to serious restrictions in more than 404 of 609 study areas and to a cumulative storage deficit of around 130 billion cubic meters in groundwater resources in 2014 implementation of the groundwater resources sustainability management plan was approved by the ministry of energy to reduce groundwater abstraction the project aims to reconcile water withdrawal rates with the natural recharge capacity of these resources and to restore the storage capacity lost in the last 20 years currently despite the ministry of energy s efforts over the last 5 years to develop a water sustainability plan the downward trend in groundwater levels has not only continued but has accelerated to discover the reasons for this failure pathological factors in the process were analyzed by identifying commonalities and differences in comparison to experiences in other countries the experiences of different countries in the field of water sustainability were evaluated to assess the status of sustainability plans in iran leading countries in the implementation of groundwater resources sustainability management were identified and laws pertinent to sustainability in these countries were studied for potential implementation to improve the water sustainability plan in iran based on the investigation of the sustainability plan in comparison to experiences in other countries suggestions are offered in four areas organizational and structural management information management human resource management and water supply through financial management to improve the groundwater resources sustainability management plan in iran according to the results of the present comparative analysis water governance structures and local community participation need to be improved in order to strengthen the effectiveness of the national sustainability plan water resource management should take place in a democratic manner with the participation and consent of all stakeholders and should follow integrated and adaptive management guidelines otherwise water resource management and sustainability are unlikely to be optimized and the tangible outcomes of continued failure are unforeseeable graphical abstract image 1 keywords challenge water sustainability plan comparative studies iran 1 introduction the term sustainable development was first used by the world commission on environment and development in a report titled our common future by brundtland et al 1987 and approved that same year by the united nations general assembly under resolution a res 42 187 according to the definition in this resolution sustainable development means meeting the needs of the current human generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs this definition also takes into account natural environmental sustainability alley et al 1999 considered groundwater sustainability as the development and exploitation of these resources at an infinite time with no detrimental environmental economic or social impacts according to their interpretation the definition of destructive effects is highly dependent on expert judgment and requires several criteria in addition groundwater sustainability must be defined in terms of the hydrological cycle of which groundwater is a part because a rate of groundwater exploitation considered acceptable based on changes in groundwater level may still result in a severe undesirable reduction in surface water resources iran is located in arid and semi arid regions of the earth recent droughts have reduced average long term rainfall from 254 mm to about 240 mm per year equivalent to one third of the global average and less than half of the continental rainfall in asia rainfall in iran is estimated at 405 billion cubic meters per year of which about 280 billion cubic meters are directly lost through evapotranspiration with less than the remaining 120 billion cubic meters in water reservoirs in the country 90 billion cubic meters of surface water and 30 billion cubic meters of groundwater the rate of groundwater use in iran is estimated to be three times as high as the global average sustainability plan progress report 2016 as a result of declines in groundwater levels and reservoirs volumes about 404 out of 609 study areas are in a state of restricted exploitation and development a further important consideration is that more than 90 of the groundwater potential of iran is located in these restricted areas fig 1 the country s aquifers now face an average reservoir volume deficit of 5 8 billion cubic meters annually in the last 47 years groundwater reservoir consumption has been around 130 billion cubic meters about 40 billion cubic meters of this loss occurred in the first 30 years of this 47 year period with more than 90 billion cubic meters lost in the last 17 years and 28 billion cubic meters lost in the last 7 years fig 2 these losses refer to quantitative changes in these sources but from a qualitative point of view the country s groundwater resources face other severe challenges with salinity in these study areas more than doubling over 17 years in several aquifers in iran the quality of groundwater has undergone unsustainable changes that will bring groundwater reserves very close to extinction if there is continued overuse disregarding the status of groundwater in iran is having a number of consequences springs qanats wells rivers and lagoons are drying up with an average reduction of 40 in groundwater resources in the last 10 years gardens and agricultural lands are also drying up given that approximately 5 million hectares of agricultural lands are irrigated with groundwater resources groundwater quality is deteriorating due to saline water intrusion and land subsidence the destruction of natural groundwater reservoirs and damage to infrastructures are also among the consequences wells are being displaced and the depth of wells is increasing along with energy consumption due to increased water depth urban migration and suburbanization around major cities are further contributing factors which may endanger political security and increase food insecurity report on security challenges and consequences of water scarcity in iran 2016 in 2014 the groundwater resources sustainability management plan grsmp was approved by the ministry of energy to reduce water abstraction and restore groundwater resources one of the short term aims of this plan called for 500 million cubic meters of reservoir deficit to be recovered in 2015 and an intermediate term aim targeted the recovery of a mean reservoir deficit of 5 7 billion cubic meters over the following 6 years up to 2021 a long term aim was the recovery of a 130 billion cubic meter reservoir deficit over a period of 15 years to provide some context for these goals before 1970 the groundwater reservoir deficit amounted to 123 million cubic meters between 1970 and 1983 this deficit was 1 7 billion cubic meters between 1983 and 2006 it was 68 billion cubic meters between 2006 and 2011 it was 34 billion cubic meters and from 2011 to the present this deficit has been about 28 billion cubic meters in all more than 130 billion cubic meters of aquifer reserves have been lost fig 2 five years after the implementation of the grsmp in iran groundwater reservoirs continue to shrink it is a good time to pose some questions regarding the continuing trend for groundwater reservoir volume deficits to increase why are groundwater reserves decreasing despite various plans to halt this trend can the grsmp in iran stop this process or will withdrawals from fixed reserves continue are the reasons for the ineffectiveness of the measures known in this article the grsmp in iran is critically reviewed to characterize the pathological elements that limit its success based on comparisons with selected countries first the history of groundwater sustainability management plans in iran is summarized and the latest ongoing sustainability plans are outlined then the status of sustainability plans in the usa states of california spain and india is described in order to compare the performance of the grsmp in iran with similar projects in other countries these comparisons are grounded on the assumption that applying international experiences can help develop optimal policies while saving costs and time this is followed by investigating the grsmp in iran based on these comparisons to conclude suggestions are offered in four areas organizational and structural management information and data management human resource management and water supply through financial management these proposals are intended to improve the sustainability of groundwater resources in iran this data and analyses in this article are potentially useful to other developing countries and countries that foresee the implementation of new sustainability plans for their water resource management 2 background and summary of the groundwater resources sustainability management plan in iran 2 1 roots of water resource development and management in iran the roots of water resource management in iran go back 60 years in the first stage between 1960 and 1980 there were three major events the first was technological evolution and the arrival of deep well technology the second was the change in water rights and the extension of public rights to water resources wherein legislation nationalized water resources and ended private water laws these measures were supplemented by the fair water distribution act the third was the islamic revolution the result of which was a wave of unauthorized exploitation and licensing of wells between 1970 and 1980 in the second stage the ministry of energy developed a plan to reform groundwater management in 2004 a plan for sustainability artificial recharge and flood distribution in 2005 led to continued improvements in groundwater management the national goals of this plan were to increase the efficiency of groundwater resources and to avoid the overexploitation of aquifers located in off limits and critical plains the quantitative target of the plan called for achieving the aim of equilibrium through four 5 year plans but because of the lack of support from other agencies the lack of effort among water sector managers and the lack of sufficient funding the project did not yield the desired results in the third stage in 2010 a law was passed to determine the status of unauthorized wells which resulted in the suspension of activities in the field of water resource instability finally in 2014 the grsmp comprising 15 projects was approved at the ministerial level according to this plan the 15 projects are implemented directly by three governmental organizations with the cooperation and support of the ministry of the interior and the management and planning organization eleven projects are under the purview of the ministry of energy three projects are overseen by the ministry of agriculture jihad and one project is managed by the geological survey of iran implementation of the projects in different provinces of the country is in the responsibility of regional water companies agriculture jihad departments natural resources and watershed management departments and the geological survey table 1 3 background and summary of alternative groundwater resource management efforts 3 1 sustainable water management plan in california usa california is located in southwestern usa the state covers an area of 493 970 square kilometers i e about a quarter of iran the annual rainfall in the state varies from 3500 mm in the northwest to less than 100 mm in the southeast and averages 600 mm a year groundwater plays a vital role in providing california s water resources as it supplies approximately 40 of the water used in california s farms and cities and up to 60 percent during drought periods of california s total population about 30 million people 85 depend on groundwater for drinking water currently from 515 basins and sub basins in this state 21 are in a critical situation because of overexploitation chappelle et al 2017 groundwater management in california can be divided into two periods until 2014 groundwater management was not mandatory and there were no groundwater management laws that could be implemented in a unified manner across the state accordingly prior to 2014 groundwater management was optionally implemented by local companies with the change in attitude to water resource management in 2014 the sustainable groundwater management act sgma the first legislation of its kind in california was announced by governor jerry brown the department of water resources categorized basins and sub basins as high medium and low priority this organization also classified 127 watersheds into medium and high priority according to the crisis level these 127 basins supply 96 of the groundwater resources in california and more than 88 of the population that uses groundwater resides in these basins moir et al 2018 hanak and harter 2017 aquifers with the highest crisis level are at the forefront in the implementation of the following aims 1 by the end of 2017 agencies in the field of groundwater management should be established 2 sustainability plans for these basins should be developed by 2020 3 all aquifers should reach sustainability by 2040 and achieve increasing groundwater levels if possible 4 if water agencies in some areas face problems in planning and implementing these measures the department of water resources shall intervene as the reference organization the department of water resource of california has outlined a general framework for a sustainability plan to be developed by groundwater sustainability agencies according to which the plan should be formulated for the purpose of groundwater management and utilization in such a way that there are no undesirable effects during implementation and long term groundwater exploitation possible undesirable consequences include severe groundwater depletion ground subsidence loss of groundwater quality depletion of surface water saline water intrusion in coastal aquifers and depletion of strategic reserves cwf 2014 california legislative information 2014 smith and abhold 2015 girard 2016 wef 2016 moir et al 2018 rogers 2016 in california participatory management is part of the sgma to ensure the participation of local people in the development of this law the california water foundation formed a stakeholder council to provide recommendations for achieving sustainable groundwater management the council is made up of representatives of farmers water agencies and environmentalists the creation of such an advisory body within the groundwater management system enables problems to be identified as accurately and efficiently as possible this dialogue does not seek final agreement on solutions rather it focuses on identifying and understanding the full range of stakeholder opinions concerns and ideas participants provide their criticisms and recommendations based on their personal experience and expertise without formal organization and with flexibility and openness in discussions cwf 2014 hanak and jezdimirovic 2016 research in california found that information about social norms related to water scarcity is more effective than providing information on how to save water fielding and hornsey 2016 seyranian et al 2015 the biggest problem with public information efforts about water scarcity problems is the lack of immediate obvious consequences for local communities because of the easy uninterrupted access to water resources therefore one efficient approach is to use animated and live action films to illustrate social norms caused by water scarcity 3 2 sustainable water management plan in india india has about 16 of the world s population about 2 45 of the world s total land area and about 4 of the world s fresh water the average annual volume of rainfall is 4000 billion cubic meters of which only about 1869 billion cubic meters are available of this latter volume only 1123 billion cubic meters are used 690 billion cubic meters of surface water and 433 billion cubic meters of groundwater suhag 2016 india is one of the largest users of groundwater resources in the world experience has shown that groundwater management faces many challenges in this country groundwater is the main source of agricultural water supply in india currently accounting for about 80 of the agricultural water in addition groundwater is also important as a source of drinking water with approximately 90 of the rural water supply coming from groundwater resources kulkarni and shankar 2010 jha and sinha 2009 kulkarni et al 2009 according to the groundwater management committee report in 2004 about 28 of india s blocks nationally recognized administrative units were in semi critical critical or over critical condition in terms of groundwater development compared to only 4 in 1995 the rapid change in status between 1995 and 2004 should be considered a warning for the future planning commission 2007 india has recently made significant efforts in the field of sustainable groundwater management by utilizing multidimensional management which includes vegetation management groundwater resource management urban area management education and health management in 1970 the ministry of water resources enacted a series of laws to protect groundwater resources and regulate water use these laws were revised in 1972 1996 and 2005 suhag 2016 and included mandatory registration for water well owners the need to obtain permits to drill new wells and limits on the depth of wells in addition to creating safeguards to the groundwater supply of drinking water the requirements of the environmental protection act of 1986 includes measures to review groundwater potentials on a scientific basis regarding current water quality adjust the exploitation of groundwater resources so that no further extraction over recharge occurs integrate and coordinate surface and groundwater management and prevent excessive groundwater extraction near the coast to prevent seawater intrusion in 2000 plans and projects under the urban water supply program were implemented in india the projects explored various factors that have reduced water resources in india and outlined several ways to achieve sustainable management the factors that have reduced water resources in india include 1 competitive demand for groundwater for irrigation and industrial use 2 overexploitation of groundwater resources without considering recharge conditions 3 low energy prices for agricultural and industrial uses 4 lack of groundwater management and scientific research 5 misconceptions about water resources as a free and ever lasting commodity and 6 lack of sustainability laws to prevent unsustainable use rwsp 2000 the project proposes the following methods for achieving sustainable resources 1 considering water as an economic resource not as a free commodity 2 the need to ensure local community participation in planning developing and implementing a water supply plan to achieve sustainability 3 enforcing payment and legal penalties for water consumption control especially in stressed areas 4 gradually eliminating all industry and agricultural water supply subsidies 5 raising awareness of the need for water conservation and encouraging self centric conservation of water resources through education systems and communication programs 6 regular groundwater monitoring 7 providing alternative water supplies in critical areas 8 restoring traditional water extraction and consumption systems 9 rainwater storage to cover a range of household uses and 10 attention to basin level development and management and promoting the protection of forests to help increase groundwater recharge rwsp 2000 successful water resource management practices in india are including tailoring strategies for sustainable water resource management to different climates and water conditions areas with different hydrogeological characteristics and diverse customs and local traditions rather than implementing a single strategy energy tariffs on agricultural and industrial uses and pricing have be increased by establishing a water regulatory agency in each state and also by enforcing payment and penalties to improve consumption control especially in stressed areas traditional water extraction and consumption systems restored forest conservation promoted to help increase groundwater recharge training programs developed for farmers to increase public understanding of groundwater resources and encourage local actors to participate in agricultural planning among the main potential achievements of this project are improved cropping patterns increased groundwater levels and economic benefits due to better management of agricultural plans and groundwater resources hamilton 2012 perveen et al 2012 changing the top down management approach to local management has made it possible for india to undertake the creation of local institutions and has yielded valuable expertise in this field in this country government organizations with the help of non governmental local agencies have established farmers associations and some local institutes and this cooperation has improved groundwater management hamilton 2012 3 3 sustainable water management plan in spain spain is the most arid country in the european union especially in its central and eastern areas and thus faces significant problems in relation to water use and management currently groundwater provides between 15 and 20 of all water used in the country although it may approach 100 in some peninsular areas and island regions hernández mora et al 2007 average aquifer recharge in spain has been estimated at about 30 000 mm3 year or about 30 of the total water resources available in the country ministerio de medio ambiente 2000 groundwater use in spain has increased from 2000 million cubic meters in 1960 6500 million cubic meters in 2000 mma 2000 however due to differences in climate geology population density and the relative importance of agriculture groundwater use rates vary widely across spain molinero et al 2011 following implementation of the wfd a report titled baseline description was submitted to the european union by spanish water authorities ministerio de medio ambiente 2006 lopez geta 2007 according to the report 699 aquifers have been recognized in spain taking into account qualitative and quantitative aspects a total of 259 37 aquifers were categorized in the danger status according to wfd environmental objectives 89 aquifers due to quantitative data and the rest due to qualitative conditions 184 26 were reported to be in a safe state in good environmental condition and 256 37 were awaiting further evaluation to determine their environmental conditions insufficient information was available to determine the exact status of these aquifers hernandez mora et al 2007 molinero et al 2011 water resource management in spain is carried out by river basin agencies these organizations managed by the central government started operating in the late 1920s and represent a major breakthrough in water management in the country the 1985 spanish water act declared groundwater as a public domain resource management in each basin was assigned to the river basin agencies restrictions apply to users in both public and private property regimes and no new pumping permits can be granted in overexploited basins the river basin agencies are charged with developing a management plan and determining the amount of withdrawal for each consumer in every basin in 2000 after 15 years of implementation of this act the spanish ministry of environment reported that the status of groundwater resources remained poor and that the formal declaration of catchments as overexploited with consequent limitations on withdrawal had not significantly improved the groundwater situation the report noted that out of the 500 000 wells in spain only 25 were officially registered and licensed in addition the report indicated that a major challenge was the drilling of unauthorized wells and the inability of river basin agencies to control and prevent the increase in the number of wells the report identified the root of the problem by stating that river basin agencies have failed to attract public participation in groundwater management due to the existence of top down management policies and the imposition of decisions on farmers in 2004 the spanish ministry of the environment following on from the development of a groundwater management reform plan held a public consultation to identify major shortcomings and needs in groundwater management six public meetings were held and were attended by university professors stakeholder representatives river basin agencies and research institutes in this public consultation a plan was proposed to promote and strengthen the role of groundwater user associations as management direction bodies in other words instead of the river basin agencies the user associations would become responsible for the task of planning decision making operation and evaluation in each basin the project is thus an effort to change the spanish government s approach from centralized management to participatory management hernández mora et al 2010 molinero et al 2011 esteban and dinar 2013 4 comparative analysis of grsmp and alternative groundwater resource management in this section according to comparative analysis with successful plans in other countries and based on domestic experience challenges of the groundwater resources sustainability management plan implementation in iran are presented and practical solutions suggested to improve the grsmp implementation in iran within the framework of four main strategies and sub strategies organizational and management structure data management and information updating human resource management and measures to attract local support and water supply through financial management flowchart that presented in fig 3 is showing the schematic representation of comparative analysis processes in this part the solutions for improving grsmp in iran are also summarized in table 2 this table shows from which countries the suggestions are modeled on 4 1 organizational structure management 4 1 1 the high burden of tasks and duties at first glance one of the major drawbacks of the grsmp in iran is the considerable number of projects foreseen according to the well known 80 20 law also known as pareto s law a well studied principle in management quality 80 of the achievements come from 20 of the efforts accordingly focusing 80 of the time and energy on the 20 that really matters is likely to be an efficient way to arrive at an intelligent solution for a problem biham et al 2004 a review of the list of sustainability projects in iran shows an overwhelming number and variety of areas ranging from police and emergency measures to educational and cultural activities as well as technical measures such as implementing artificial recharge and improving the groundwater monitoring network which can divert the focus of the project manager from the main aim it might have been better to prioritize the implementation of the 15 projects noted above in section 2 1 with more weight and priority being given to the main projects depending on local conditions and the possibility of fund allocation 4 1 2 lack of participatory management regarding participatory management community involvement goes far beyond consumption management community support and oversight are essential to rebuild successful governance and groundwater management groundwater management in iran has been centralized from the top down in this approach decisions are made centrally and then transferred to the lower levels and the relationships between levels are completely vertical in this structure water beneficiaries are required to execute programs developed at the highest levels although they do not themselves have a role in decision making or planning this lack of involvement by stakeholders in key processes has not only made them reluctant to participate in the implementation of government programs to protect groundwater resources but has also fomented confrontation with government officials in some cases there is evidence that in almost all cases sealing an unauthorized well despite a court order and the presence of law enforcement officers results in conflict the california groundwater sustainability act is a notable example of participatory local management implementation where the frameworks and constraints are well defined and there is flexibility to consider the specific conditions of each basin in addition in spain after about 20 years of centralized management experiences and high costs it was concluded that effective groundwater management would not be possible without public participation and that public participation would not be achieved through top down management rules esteban and dinar 2013 also in groundwater sustainability plan in india in 2000 and 2005 mentioned that main way to achieve sustainable management is to ensure local community participation in planning developing and implementing a water supply plan to achieve sustainability another challenge in the formulation of projects within the grsmp in iran is the lack of consideration of the private sector s and stakeholders inputs and concerns projects have been formulated by experts and government officials and a governance perspective can be perceived in all areas based on the procedures proposed here for optimal water governance water conservation guidelines and measures should be based on the will of the people to ensure sustainable support for program execution therefore the projects should be evaluated surveyed revised and amended by water users as a way to favor acceptance and compliance while as mentioned in section 3 in spain and california this style of local participation has been applied and they received useful management mechanisms with this consulting system 4 1 3 the definition of a nationwide general management system according to california s sustainability act and management style in india groundwater management should be designed for the specific conditions and needs of each basin even within a basin management goals can change according to different conditions wef 2016 however in iran the same rules for sustainable groundwater resources have been put in place nationwide despite the fact that climatic conditions vary widely over different areas of this very large country 4 1 4 incomplete implementation of the grsmp in iran for all 15 sustainability projects in iran one study area as a pilot was required initially and if a thorough evaluation determined that the pilot was successful the project was to be implemented for other aquifers for a full evaluation of the sustainability plan it is necessary to have all 15 projects implemented together in a pilot in which case the status of the aquifer and the effectiveness of the projects after implementation will be assessed however only one or two projects are currently running in each of the pilots selected by the water resources management department which can only be evaluated separately if sustainability is not achieved it would be justifiable to reconsider full implementation of all plans it may even be possible to implement some of these projects in numerical models and use them to check the results rather than investing considerable amounts of money in pilot aquifers 4 1 5 non normative targeting the definition of short medium and long term goals has been encumbered by inappropriate timing defining a reasonable time horizon is essential in all current and foreseeable situations climate change population growth groundwater level fluctuations and environmental goals are important for efforts to update groundwater management plans in other words programs should not be considered as final all are highly dynamic and capable of modification the effects of overexploitation for several decades require a considerable amount of time to overturn and achieve equilibrium as one example of the time needed compensate for the damage to aquifers in iran the cumulative overdraft of groundwater resources is about 120 billion cubic meters and if we could reduce withdrawal to about 6 billion cubic meters annually it would take us almost 20 years to reach 120 billion cubic meters to stabilize the situation as another example renewable groundwater natural recharge in iran is about 30 billion cubic meters annually and if we divide 120 by 30 4 years of groundwater recharge without any abstraction from aquifers would be needed to compensate for 120 billion cubic meters however implementation of the second example is impossible given that aquifer abstraction cannot realistically be halted an additional concern is the unrealistically short timeframe of only 6 years to stop the negative trend in groundwater levels and storage also after 20 years of grsmp involvement in aquifer restoration 4 1 6 failure to consider requirements and barriers barriers and the consequences of delays are not considered in project implementation planning norms prior to defining projects and goals requires an awareness of structural administrative and judicial requirements in addition legal and social barriers should be considered including unemployment and lack of alternative occupational opportunities for unauthorized users stakeholders reluctance to participate in water resource conservation plans and a lack of social capital institutional and structural constraints are another potential issue that can interfere with duties or undermine authority and the undeniable influence of outside decision making authorities must also be considered moreover technical constraints in for example the field of optimum water use technologies along with political and international factors such as sanctions present further challenges if these barriers are not anticipated in the plan its goals will not be met therefore further implementation of grsmp in iran should identify possible constraints and delays so that planning can be modified accordingly in addition the root causes of the problems need to be analyzed and appropriate solutions considered before the plan and project are formulated however these procedures are not observed in preparing sustainability projects in iran 4 1 7 inadequate prioritization of projects implementation prioritizing project implementation is of great importance for example participatory project management which was not costly to implement has been suspended and the more expensive project to install meters and close unauthorized wells has been given priority in all mentioned countries the first priority for reaching water sustainability is focusing on the potential of local people in addition to the cost issue it is imperative that compulsory measures such as well sealing and meter installation be incorporated in participatory management awareness raising and governance improvement projects the issue of participatory management is clearly fading in importance sealing unauthorized wells should be prioritized over the meter installation project because the consumption from unauthorized wells is not measured and abstraction from these wells is continuing without any limitation 4 1 8 contradictions among rules one of the problems with implementation of the sustainability plan in iran is the inconsistency in the rules governing the installation of meters for authorized wells according to article 12 of the law on the fair distribution of water the operator should pay for the well meter yet the fifth plan of development indicates that the cost should paid by the government the sixth plan states that the cost should be borne by the operator although the facilities are provided at no cost the government s budget for 2018 states that the cost is to be borne by the operator but says nothing about the cost of facilities these contradictions will cause distrust among the users the cost of installing well meters in california is shared between farmers and the government 4 1 9 neglecting the need for adaptive management adaptive management has thus far been neglected in iran in areas of high water demand for agricultural use the hydrogeological and socioeconomic environment of a given aquifer usually determines the form of management and can limit the management options also because groundwater systems are constantly evolving and there is significant uncertainty and sometimes rapid change the adaptive approach to groundwater resource management would seem most appropriate 4 1 10 neglecting integrated water resource management failure to apply integrated water resource management strategies is another drawback of current efforts in iran to define sustainability in a given catchment addressing surface water resources and groundwater independently can lead to miscalculation of the amount of water resources that can be exploited therefore the sustainability of a specific catchment should be determined by considering a suite of factors including surface water groundwater environmental needs and water body quality in order to estimate the sustainable discharge or programmable sustainable water resources for a given basin 4 2 data management 4 2 1 neglecting water quality sustainability all projects to date emphasize quantitative sustainability and disregard qualitative sustainability of groundwater resources the sustainability plan objectives are designed with a view to reservoir deficit compensation and quantitative sustainability while qualitative sustainability has not been considered to be effective a sustainable management plan should include multidimensional parameters such as vegetation management groundwater management urban area management education and health management in addition to quantitative sustainability social economic environmental and political sustainability also need to be addressed 4 2 2 incompatibility between plans and policies in iran some elements of the aquifer sustainability plan are incompatible with food self sufficiency policies water based employment and livelihood problems have arisen after changes in agricultural productivity criteria to deal with this problem production per hectare should be replaced by production per unit of consumable water 4 3 human resource management 4 3 1 lack of transparency the documentation in this massive program regarding steps to ensure transparency in project implementation for the public is scarce moreover the evaluation of past performance is inadequate accurate consistent information is unavailable for stakeholders or institutions that are expected to collaborate in activities for sustainability management this is another shortcoming given that the results need to be analyzed documented and disseminated to different levels of society there is a slim boundary between not knowing the risks for groundwater sustainability and honestly defending the benefits of exploitation on one hand and blatant corruption and disregard for known negative consequences on the other the most effective way to deal with this is to help raise awareness of the constraints and vulnerabilities among all water users and to improve transparency of the information through free access to data and information on wells and on the status of groundwater resources and their quality the confidential nature of some water resource information and its inaccessibility to the general public are among the problems that preclude the assessment of the overall status of groundwater resource sustainability at the national level in iran 4 3 2 lack of cooperation between different organizations a final barrier is the lack of cooperation and support from the ministry of agriculture jihad although this government project was designed as a complement to the groundwater sustainability plan unfortunately some aspects of the jihad have created impediments to sustainability efforts for example the ministry of agriculture has not shown strong performance in encouraging farmers to change to low water crops due to the lack of market demand for these crops 4 4 others 4 4 1 development of a modern irrigation network without reducing the groundwater discharge capacity another issue is the development of a modern irrigation network without reducing the groundwater discharge capacity which needs to be considered in the light of local cropping patterns in most areas the project has not reduced the amount of water discharge because farmers maintain the water discharge level they have expanded their land use and changed cropping patterns to increase yields so the implementation of this plan has thus far not helped to save the country s water resources 5 conclusions in this study we trace the challenges of the grsmp in iran first by identifying the regulations relevant to the sustainability of groundwater resources in this country then by identifying weaknesses in previous and current projects and their implementation by comparing existing laws to those in developed and developing countries finally a number of suggestions are offered to address these weaknesses and move forward what is clear is that until now the management of water resources by the ministry of energy without stakeholder involvement and without considering the potential limitations to groundwater resource recharge has created prerequisites for overexploitation with negative implications for aquifers around the country only a participatory management approach based on awareness and transparency between government agencies and stakeholders can create a stimulus for better water resource management therefore it is recommended that the ministry of energy and water management authorities in the country define and put in place an effective mechanism to implement this approach it should be noted that the preparation and implementation of participatory plans will require cooperation oversight and executive support from the relevant government departments and agencies this approach will have two important consequences 1 gaining the trust and support of water users in the implementation of the groundwater sustainability plan and 2 empirical identification by water users of potential problems of the plans and implementation of the necessary improvements at each evaluation stage practical solutions to improve the country s water resource management through a sustainability plan can be developed in four main strategies 1 organizational structure management can be optimized through the establishment of an advisory system to review the sustainability plan development of participatory and local management implementation of integrated and adaptive management and reform of the administrative structure and management of traditional groundwater exploitation systems 2 information management can be strengthened by defining the amount of groundwater abstraction according to 6 criteria decline in groundwater quality and quantity ground subsidence surface water depletion saline water intrusion and strategic reserves decline and by documenting all measures and sharing all existing information 3 human resource management can be improved by creating voluntary water reduction goals recruiting empowered staff in different sectors and increasing public awareness 4 financial management can be optimized through water pricing examining virtual water issues and rainwater storage focusing on water loss from old infrastructures modernizing agricultural irrigation systems and prioritizing the implementation of sustainability projects in study areas based on their critical priority declaration of competing interest the authors

11976,less costly bio sorbent jute fibre ntjf treated by naoh is used to inspect the removal of an azo dye reactive red 195 face centered response surface methodology rsm was successfully implemented to improve the performance measure under specified operating experimental domain in order to remove the dye rr 195 dissolved in aqueous solution face centered ccd of rsm based experimental design have been adopted to obtain the limited sets of experimental trials to ensure better experimentation towards optimum performance characteristics to obtain most favourable condition in order to remove dye and to obtain maximum adsorption capacity qmax four operating parameters were considered as jute dose 10 mg l 18 mg l ph 3 11 rpm 100 150 200 and temperature 3033 k 303 k and 313 k whereas highest capacity of adsorption qmax of the jute is considered as performance measure during the case of dye removal the results depict that the jute dose and temperature have a great influence on the adsorption capacity it was revealed that the action of adsorption was entropy driven following pseudo second order rate kinetics endothermic in nature sorption occurring is mainly physical adsorption and the langmuir isotherm model is best suited model for the sorption data further the effectiveness of process variables and their interpretation were investigated using anova in correlation with a second order quadratic model the optimized processing conditions were observed to be ph 7 047 temperature 299 572 k jute dose 14 905 g l and rpm 154 929 the experimental qmax 32 21 mg g and the predicted qmax 31 153 mg g are observed to be good fit within the selected experimental domain threshold with a desirability of 0 96 showing excellent accuracy of the experimentation processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorption reactive red 195 rsm activation energy adsorption kinetics 1 introduction dyes are complex chemical compounds which when come in contact with most of the substance can get easily attached to them and imparts colour like they do for cloths and fabrics moreover the industries dealing with textile alone needs 10 000 tonnes of dye of per year worldwide of which 100 tonne of dyes are allowed to discharge in water bodies on a yearly basis agarwal et al 2008 due to their complex bonding structure they are hard to break and thus possess serious environmental and health hazard issues and apart from other effects some dyes are found to possess carcinogenic characteristics ahmad 2009 based upon the source of material dyes are subdivided into two categories as synthetic dyes and natural dyes roots berk berries leaves wood etc plant sources are used to derive majority of vegetable dyes which are known as the natural dyes which are readily biodegradable and possess less or no harm to the environment ahmed 2009 on the other hand almost any colour we see today is from synthetic dyes synthetic dye is everywhere and in everything aksakal and ucun 2010 the main reason for using synthetic dyes are that they are economical to produce easily applicable in fabrics and other materials most of the industries mainly associated with the textile industries ali et al 2010 uses azo dyes effluents from textile industries can possess substantial amount of dye concentration the environmental and simultaneous health hazard issues arising of dye released from textile industries are becoming a subject of scientific investigation thereby subsequent environmental legislations are getting imposed to control the release of dyes especially azo based dye directly in the free flowing water bodies based upon technique researchers have employed several methods for the effective elimination of dye from solutions of wastewater some of the techniques include biological treatments oxidation ultrasound irradiation coagulation flocculation photocatalysis ozonation and membrane separation chatterjee et al 2012 chen and zhang 2014 chiang 2008 cho and zoh 2007 chong et al 2009 chowdhury et al 2011 chowdhury and saha 2010 among all of these the most environment friendly and most effective material that can be used for adsorption is activated carbon and it has the capacity to remove almost entire amount of dye from the aqueous solution but activated carbon has its own limitation such as initial high cost of production complexities in regeneration after exhaustion decrement in removal efficiency after regeneration reddy and yun 2016 crini et al 2007 so that now a day s researchers are putting lot of emphasis on use of low cost bio sorbents which are economical biodegradable and easily available to meet the purpose of adsorption freundlich 1906 ganguly and chanda 1994 gupta et al 2013 ho and mckay 1999 one such bio sorbent jute of low cost has been considered in this case to remove reactive red 195 dye using adsorption process jute is one of the agricultural product which is abundant in india and is an important crop in indian sub continent of the total production of jute in the world around 85 of the jute is produced in the ganges delta india bangladesh and some parts of china principal components of jute fibre are cellulose hemicellulose lignin and other hydro carbons possessing low molecular weight ibrahim et al 2010 these constituents have hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups and these are the responsible agents for which adsorption of dye takes place onto the adsorbent in aqueous solution previously researchers successfully used surface modified low cost bio sorbent in order to remove dye kansal et al 2007 kapdan and ozturk 2005 koch et al 2002 so recently the focus is also onto surface modification of adsorbent to use it efficiently instead of activated carbon in removing harmful dyes from waste water the surface modifications are to enhance the fractions of the influential functional groups like hydroxyl carboxyl sulphate carboxylate phosphate groups on the adsorbent surface lagergren 1898 the topic of different methods that are considered to use in order to remove dyes researchers are not limited to use of experimental models only there are several mathematical models and software s which are in use to analyse and find out the optimum conditions required for the desired output as necessary there are several works already being done in the relevant area such as to use rsm to improve the process variables to remove dye by the use of a novel adsorbent langmuir 1916 rsm is employed to remove methylene blue dye using cheap adsorbent for the regression analysis and optimization for the removal of colour of aqueous dye solution by using a novel adsorbent liang et al 2010 liu and liu 2008 statistical designs and surface plots are applied application of rsm to improve the process of removal of azo dye by the process of oxalate catalysed photoelectro fenton by the use of carbon nanotube ptfe cathode optimization and modelling for photocatalytic degradation of azo dye reactive red using rsm based on the central composite design malik and saha 2003 munagapati and kim 2016a the approach of rsm can better predicts the impact of process variables on performance characteristics as well as it can be considered as a better option for optimization munagapati and kim 2016b therefore the face centered central composite design ccd of rsm is employed for the experimental design this particular work is confronted to investigate the maximum sorption capacity qmax of naoh treated jute fibre to remove reactive red 195 by with the help of mathematical model and examine the process parameters effects and their performance criteria by employing response surface methodology also the quantitative mathematical models are used to examine the effects of temperature ph jute dose and rpm on the adsorption capacity by using rsm approach mustafa et al 2014 2 materials and method jute is a multi constituent and multicellular fibrous material containing high percentage of cellulose apart from large portion of α cellulose 60 other two major chemical components available in jute are hemi cellulose 23 and lignin 14 and traces of fat and wax researchers suggested that there is formation of ester linkage between parts of hemi cellulose and lignin which are linked chemically by the hydroxyl groups of lignin and those of carboxyl groups of hemi cellulose namasivayam and sureshkumar 2006 the existence of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the peripheral area of adsorbent is the principal reason for the dye adsorption process from aqueous solution in the present analysis the adsorbent is pre treated with naoh in which the mostly used chemical treatment for surface modification of cellulose based material is alkali treatment to enhance adsorption properties ndazi et al 2007 the breaking of covalent bond between the component of lignocellulose is also done by treating the jute fibre with solution of aqueous sodium hydroxide naoh by hydrolysis of de polymerising lignin and hemicellulose the treatment results in a change in stiffness accessibility crystallinity pore structure unit cell structure and orientation of fibrils panswad and wongchaisuwan 1986 by substantially influencing the molecular super molecular and morphological properties of cellulose naoh treatment also helps to improve some of the properties of cellulose such as reactivity capacity of natural ion exchange and structural durability etc some of the functional groups those are chemically reactive such as oh are also identified by treating with naoh which removes waxes as well as natural fats from the surface of cellulose fibre ravikumar et al 2007 earlier studies have revealed that rice husk treated with naoh rich in cellulose compound is found to be effective as an adsorbent to remove azo dyes ravikumar et al 2005 from aqueous solutions since in jute fibres the cellulose and hemicellulose components are also present in huge amount and reactive red 195 is essentially an azo dye so in this study it was tried to check the feasibility of using ntjf to eliminate reactive red 195 from aqueous solution fig 1 depicts the cellulose structure and the cellulose hydrogen bond system naturally dried jute were obtained from market and made into sizes of approx 1 mm and distilled washed and again dried at 60 c the obtained sample then treated with 0 01 m naoh at 27 c for 4 h the resulting sample then distilled washed to remove excess chemicals present in fibre if any and ph for the sample was brought to 7 0 by the use of 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m hcl then kept in container for 24 h after drying at 100 c the final resulting sample which is naoh treated jute fibre ntjf was considered as the adsorbent an azo dye reactive red 195 having a strong though apparently noncovalent affinity to cellulose fibres having molecular formula c31h19cln7na5o21s6 was considered as the adsorbate the dye used is of analar grade and was obtained from himedia to start the experimentation a solution of stock dye 1000 mg l ph 7 0 was made using doubly distilled water molecular structure of rr 195 is given in fig 2 2 1 capacity of adsorption and percentage removal in this particular study the main target was to determine the maximum capacity of sorption q max of rr 195 using naoh treated jute fibre the quantity of maximum dye that was adsorbed per unit adsorbent mg dye per g adsorbent was found out as per the mass balance on the concentration of dye using eq 1 1 q m a x c i c f m v where q max maximum adsorption capacity mg g c i initial concentration of dye in solution mg l c f final concentration of dye in solution mg l v volume of solution l m adsorbent weight g the percentage of dye that was removed was found out using the following equation 2 percentage removal 100 2 2 adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherm studies are the basic operations which are required to obtain the relation of adsorption between the adsorbent and the adsorbate isotherms not only check the favourability of adsorption but also reveal information regarding homogenous or heterogeneous nature of interconnection between the adsorbent and the adsorbate in the present analysis the feasibility of the process of adsorption of rr 195 dye onto the ntjf was checked by the use of two basic non linear form of isotherm equations namely langmuir 1916 and freundlich 1906 isotherm models 3 langmuir isotherm model q e q m b c e 1 b c e where q e the value of adsorbed dye at equilibrium concentration mg g q m maximum capacity of monolayer adsorption it is independent of temperature b constant of langmuir adsorption constant related to energy it is temperature dependant l mg c e dye concentration in the solution at equilibrium mg l the nature of langmuir isotherm can be predicted depending upon the suitability of adsorption linear or unsuitable depending on the unitless constant separation factor value rl webi and chakravort 1974 given by equation no 4 value of rl reveals the nature of isotherm whether the process type of adsorption is favourable r l 1 unfavourable r l 1 linear r l 1 or irreversible r l 0 4 r l 1 1 b c 0 where c 0 initial adsorbate dye concentration in the solution mg l an empirical equation freundlich 1906 the freundlich isotherm equation which shows the diverseness of the surface of adsorbent during adsorption is been analysed in the present study 5 freundlich q e k f c e 1 n where k f and 1 n are freundlich constant characteristics of the system c e dye concentration of the solution at equilibrium mg l q e capacity of adsorption at equilibrium concentration mg g k f and n denotes the capacity of adsorption and intensity of adsorption the nature of reaction is endothermic if the value of k f increases with the rise in temperature it will be exothermic process if the value of k f decreases with an increase in temperature the other freundlich constant 1 n suggests the adsorption type when the case is 0 1 n 1 then the sorption process is said to be favourable when it is so that 1 n 1 then the adsorption situation will be irreversible and finally when it is 1 n 1 then the sorption is not favourable chen and zhang 2014 2 3 modelling of adsorption kinetic time depending experimental results were next utilized to know about the sorption system kinetic parameters the rate constant and optimum sorption capacity at various temperatures ranges was found out by using pseudo first order lagergren 1898 kinetic models and pseudo second order ho and mckay 1999 kinetic models 6 pseudo first order q t q 1 1 exp k 1 t 7 pseudo second order q t q 2 2 k 2 t 1 q 2 k 2 t the above kinetic models have a limit when they are associated with finding the diffusion mechanism of the sorption process so a diffusion model was employed to find the rate controlling steps 8 intra particle diffusion q t k i t 0 5 arrhenius equation was employed to find out the activation energy ea for the process of adsorption of rr 195 onto ntjf the equation for the same is listed below 9 ln k ln a e a r t after plotting a graph of ln k vs 1 t activation energy ea can be found out from the slope of the graph of the same where t temperature in kelvin k either rate constant of pseudo first order of r the rate constant opseudo second order which again rely on the rate of adsorption favoured in the kinetic reaction activation energy reveals about the nature physical or chemical of adsorption some of the thermodynamic parameters like δg gibbs free energy change δ h enthalpy change δ s entropy change were investigated to check the temperature suitability of the adsorption endothermic or exothermic nature of the sorption process and also to verify that the adsorption is enthalpy or entropy driven the investigations were done by using the equations given below 10 δ g rt ln kad 11 k a d c 0 c e c e n 12 δ g δ h t δ s the values of δ h and δ s were determined from the graph of δg and t where c o is the initial dye concentration of solution and ce is the equilibrium dye concentration of solution kad is the rate constant of adsorption process at equilibrium the n value is found by rate kinetic analysis by observing which rate model the observed data best fit 2 4 batch experimental procedure at first a solution of stock dye of 1000 mg l was made from that solutions with concentrations 50 100 150 and 200 mg l were made which were considered for the overall analysis for the present study the aim was to fix a dye concentration say 50 mg l and to find maximum sorption capacity qmax as a function of the following input process parameters which are ph jute dose temperature and rotational speed rpm adsorption analysis was done batch wise to analyse the removal of rr 195 with the help of variation in the aforementioned process parameters let us elaborate the experimentation regarding the influence of change in ph onto final outcome qmax the ph range taken for the analysis was 3 11 at first 200 ml of dye solution having 50 mg l concentration is taken where the initial ph was calibrated to 3 0 initial jute dose 10 g l initial temperature 293 k and the rotary shaker was adjusted at 100 rpm temperatures were controlled using rotary incubator next the solution was allowed to agitate and samples were collected to analyse concentration of sample solution after each 5 min interval after 5 min 10 min 15 min and so on upto 180 min adsorption was no more time dependent after agitation of 120 min equilibrium time the dye concentrations were measured from absorbance values obtained using uv vis spectroscopy the data s were then used to calculate the maximum amount of dye adsorbed qmax mg g other process parameters being constant similar kind of experiments were carried out for other ph values likewise once the study of ph variation was over then other parameters were studied set wise by varying the parameter whose effect was to be determined and keeping other variables constant to study other parameters their ranges were considered as jute dose range 10 18 g l temperature range 293 303 and 323 k and rotational speed rpm as 100 150 and 200 respectively for different set of solutions separate ph values were kept in the range 0f 3 11 using 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh experiments were conducted in order to check for adsorption of rr 195 by the container walls in the absence of jute no degradation was found there or adsorption of rr 195 by container walls duplicate tests were conducted and mean values were considered same set of experiments were done for all possible combinations of all the process variables 3 results and discussion time decay curve represent the removal of dye from aqueous solution as a contact time function it is measured by observing the reduction in concentration of dye by its removal using adsorbent from the solution over a period of time fig 3 shows the time decay curve to remove reactive red 195 by the use of naoh treated jute fibre as the adsorbent using an initial dye concentration of 50 mg l jute dose 14 g l ph 7 0 rpm 150 and temperature 303 k in adsorption equilibrium time is said to be achieved when beyond a particular time point there will not be any further significant adsorption of dye onto the adsorbent or in other words adsorption of dye no more remain a time dependent phenomenon which generally can be observed from the time decay curve curve shows that for the first 30 min the adsorption rate of the adsorbate adsorbent interaction is rapid after that the adsorption rate drastically reduces the quick rate of removal of dye at the beginning stages is assigned to the adsorption site availability as the time increases the adsorbate adsorbent interaction also increases thereby leading to the adsorption sites saturation because of more and more adsorption of dye molecules onto the sites leading to decrease in quantity of adsorption sites and subsequent decrease in sorption for the given study equilibrium time was obtained at 120 min after which the adsorption process does not remain time dependent similar kind of study was undertaken by ahmed at el ahmed 2009 3 1 surface morphology of ntjf the surface property of naoh treated jute fibre and also on rr 195 adsorbed naoh treated jute fibres were done by the use of scanning electron microscope analysis using sem model jsm 6360 jeol working conditions were as resolution 3 nm was there in the secondary electron mode and at a distance of 8 mm and voltage of acceleration 0f 30 kv accelerating voltage from 1kv 30kv in 1 kv step from the sem images shown below in fig 4 it can be seen that fig 4 a shows the image of only naoh treated jute fibre and in fig 4 b it can be seen that there are lot of particles of reactive red 195 which are got attached on the jute fibre surface treated with naoh both the figures are of 1 μm resolution to characterize and identify functional groups ftir is an effective technique the ftir spectra confirm the impact of functional groups on the process of adsorption of rr 195 onto the adsorbent cell surfaces the studies for ftir were done at saif bombay india the instrument used for the study was having following details make bruker germany model 3000 hyperion microscope with vertex 80 ftir system the ftir spectra of virgin ntjf and reactive red 195 rr 195 adsorbed ntjf are described in fig 5 because of the bounded hydroxyl or amine groups the broad and strong band was at 3444 63 cm 1 the highest value was found at 2918 12 cm 1 and it was observed due to the ch asymmetric stretching the highest value at 1740 78 cm 1 was assigned to the carboxyl group stretching vibration asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration of co groups were assigned by the bands at 1633 41 cm 1 1507 43 cm 1 and 1461 05 cm 1 the c n stretching band was found at 1375 40 cm 1 c o stretching of alcohols and carboxylic acids was assigned by the band at 1020 51 cm 1 after the adsorption of rr 195 for rr 195 loaded ntjf the symmetrical stretching vibration bands of hydroxyl or amine groups were changed from 3444 63 cm 1 to 3443 98 cm 1 the carboxyl groups stretching band was shifted from 1740 78 to 1740 70 cm 1 the stretching bands at 1633 41 1507 43 and 1461 05 cm 1 were also shifted to 1633 68 1507 55 and 1460 92 cm 1 respectively the c o peak at 1020 51 cm 1 were shifted to 1020 31 cm 1 respectively the result analysis of ftir spectra as frequency shifts shows that the above mentioned functional groups are the prime reason which causes the binding of rr 195 to the surface of the ntjf in the present study the results were verified with the help of two nonlinear adsorption isotherms namely langmuir and freundlich isotherm studies from the plot of the graph of qe vs ce from fig 6 it has observed that the method of adsorption better fits to langmuir isotherm which suggests that there is monolayer adsorption of the rr 195 dyes on the surface of ntjf several isotherm parameters are shown in table 1 fig 5 shows the adsorption isotherm studies at the temperature 303 k for the study of sorption kinetics the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were analysed to study and compare with experimental results to analyse the rate constants and to obtain the equilibrium capacity of adsorption at various temperature the slopes and the intercepts of the plots of log q e q t versus t figure not mentioned gave the rate constants k 1 and q e of the pseudo first order the results of correlation coefficients r 2 found for pseudo first order comparable studies of theoretical and experimental equilibrium of pseudo first order kinetic model sorption capacities show that is a considerable variation between this kinetic model and theoretical studies similar studies were also conducted for theoretical data sans pseudo second order kinetic model and fig 7 shows that pseudo second order model fits well with the theoretical data s compared to the other kinetic model to remove rr 195 onto ntjf 3 2 activation energy and thermodynamic parameters activation energy ea for the method was determined from arrhenius equation eqn no 9 by drawing the arrhenius plot of rr 195 adsorption onto ntjf it is found out to obtain the sorption nature taking place in the process and it thus holds a significant role in determining if the adsorption taking place is a type physical adsorption or chemical adsorption as low ea value 40 kj mol shows physical adsorption and higher ea value 40 kj mol indicate chemical adsorption in this p study the adsorption rate was better suited as per the second order rate constant kinetics so the plot was done by taking ln k k pseudo second order rate constant values in y axis and 1 t time inverse in kelvin in x axis ea was obtained from the slope of the linear graph which is obtained as 15 12 kj mol from the result we can conclude that the following process is predominantly governed by physical adsorption by ahmed 2009 fig 8 shows the arrhenius plot for the determination of ea one of the thermodynamics parameters change in gibb s free energy δg was determined using the values of equilibrium rate constant kad and other two parameters entropy δs and enthalpy δh were obtained from the intercepts of the graph of δg vs time t along with the plot the parameters were found out using equation no 10 11 and 12 the values of δg for the temperature values of 293 k 303 k and 313 k were found out as 6 2 7 61 and 9 38 kj mol respectively decrease in the value of change in gibb s free energy with an increase in temperature indicates that the process of adsorption was suitable at slightly high temperature the increase in capacity of sorption with an increase in temperature also suggests for the increase in sorbent particles kinetic energy positive value of δs 0 1551 kj mol k shows a rise in the randomness at the interface of solid solution and entropy driven positive value of δh 23 22 kj mol suggests that endothermic reaction is employed in the process vadiveloo et al 2009 vankar 2000 zhou et al 2015 the nature of adsorption process is found out by the value of δh in general physical adsorption occurs if the δh value is in between the range of 8 25 kj mol and it is said to be a chemical adsorption process if the value is in the range of 80 200 kj mol in this study by observing the δh value it is revealed that the nature of adsorption is physical which justifies the study of activation energy the plot for δg vs t is shown in fig 9 table 2 shows the different thermodynamic parameters 3 3 adsorption studies by employing response surface methodology experimentation was done batch wise to find the value of maximum adsorption capacity qmax as a function of ph temperature k jute dose g l and rotational speed rpm qmax were found out once at a time by changing any one of the process parameters and keeping others process parameters as constant likewise qmax values were found out 30 times by carrying out 30 different set of process parameter combinations which were later used to find the most desirable condition using response surface methodology for optimizing and modelling the response characteristics which includes quantitative independent variables are obtained by response surface methodology rsm which is a combination of statistical and mathematical technique a regression model also known as polynomial quadratic model of order two as shown in eq 13 explains the system quality characteristic the software design expert 11 0 gives an approximation of the regression model coefficient 13 y c 0 i 1 n c i x n i 1 n d i x i 2 ε the experimental design of the present study was mainly based on face cantered central composite second order design ccd technique the ccd full factorial design with all factors combination at two levels high 1 and low 1 are considered which comprises of eight star points and six central point s coded level 0 correlates to an α value of 1 the face centered ccd consists of 30 trial experiments at 4 process variables the suitable range and both coded and actual value of process parameters are shown in table 3 table 4 shows the coded form of the experimental design layout adopted in this analysis the model fit summary prescribed that the quadratic model of second order has significance in the statistical analysis of qmax the result analyses for quadratic model are given in anova in table 5 the importance of the model is shown by the model f value the probability of f value being higher than f value for the models term are less than 0 05 i e α 0 05 or 95 confidence which means that the model developed should be significant statistically and it is mandatory as it denotes that the model terms effect on the performance characteristics kansal et al 2007 when the value of multiple co efficient of regression r2 becomes unity the response models fits better with actual data the deviation becomes very less between the actual values and predicted values fig 10 shows that the graph between the actual value and predicted values of the response qmax proves the degree of proximity we can say that the errors are normally distributed as maximum of the values are close to a straight the value of the adequate precision ap in this case is above 3 ap gives a comparison of the predicted value span at the design point to the mean prediction error which represents adequate model discrimination the developed model proposes greater value of the coefficients of determination r2 as well as adequate precision ap the values obtained were as follows r2 0 96 and ap 20 907 for qmax consequently the developed quadratic mathematical model can influence significantly on fitting and predicting the results of observation and also the lack of fit test is found to be insignificant the insignificant factors are removed to get shifted to the fitted quadratic response surface models by the backward elimination process the lack of fit test is found to be insignificant as the insignificant quadratic model terms are removed eq 14 given below shows that the response surface equations absolute quadratic models by the use of backward elimination process the model thus obtained can be used for navigation purpose of design space as the ratio of ap gives an adequate signal the ultimate response surface equation for qmax maximum adsorption capacity 14 qmax 0 10 0 065 a 0 17 b 0 019 c 0 026 ab 0 020 bc 0 15 b 2 fig 11 depicts the ph influences the percentage of dye removal ph play as a principal influential factor for dye removal onto adsorbent in an aqueous solution the ionization dissociation as well as properties of the adsorbent surface of the adsorbate molecule freundlich 1906 is greatly influenced by ph subsequently there is change in adsorption process depending on the change in surface properties of both the parties that are in consideration it was noticed that the qmax increases with an increase in ph the reason behind that is at low ph value the functional groups that exists on the adsorbent surface undergoes protonation due to this phenomenon absorbent surface gets positively charged which is followed by decrease in dye ions adsorption because of electrostatic repulsion and on the increment of ph of the dye solution there is increment in the process of adsorption due to eventual deprotonation of the adsorbent functional groups and therefore enhances the electrostatic attraction between the dye cations and negatively charged sites on the adsorbent it is very important parameter which acts as a variable in finding out the adsorption rate capacity of adsorbate on the adsorbent to determine the adsorption rate at various jute dose concentrations jute adsorbent dose was taken in the range of 10 18 g l it has been noticed that there is a rise in the adsorption and subsequent dye removal as the jute dose increases this increasing rate of dye removal rate with a higher dose of jute could be due to increase in surface area of adsorbent resulting in a increase in number of adsorption sites available for adsorption of adsorbates onto adsorbent saeed et al 2010 the same phenomenon was noticed when the jute dose was raised from 10 to 14 905 g l further increase in dose of jute dose decreases the rate of adsorption the decrease in the rate of adsorption with an increase in jute dose at constant volume of solution and constant dye concentration may be attributed to particulate interaction like aggregation which results in adsorption site saturation particulate interaction will cause in a decrease in available adsorption sites due to the fall in total surface area of the adsorbent and an increase in diffusional path length crini et al 2007 a result for the jute dose effects on removal of dye percentage is depicted in fig 12 as observed in fig 13 the adsorption rate is higher at lower temperature and vis a versa higher temperature causes weakening of bonds between adsorbate dye molecules and adsorbent binding site chowdhury et al 2011 chowdhury and saha 2010 this may be reason that adsorption phenomenon is better suited at lower temperatures moreover at a higher temperature the observed pattern of decreasing dye removal indicates that the process of adsorption is kinetically controlled and the same is justified from the experimental analysis rotational speed rpm has a pivotal role in finding out the adsorption rate of an adsorbate onto the adsorbent if the rpm rate will be too less then both the adsorbate and adsorbent molecules will follow sedimentation and not suspension at low rpm there are chances that both the dye and jute fibres will settle on the bottom of the conical flask used for the rotary purpose it is very important that both the parties remain in suspension so that there will be suitable interaction between them and hence occurrence of adsorption yagub et al 2012 on the other hand if the rotational speed becomes too high then also the chances of adsorption diminishes as high rotational speed of the solution will decrease the capacity of dye particles to be settled at the adsorption sites of the adsorbent rather high rpm rate will keep the dye particles floating in the solution not allowing it to settle the results are given in fig 14 moreover fig 15 a b and c depicts the approximated response surface plot for qmax in relation to the process parameters of solution ph jute dose temperature and rpm 3 4 desirability based multi response optimization the goals and ranges of process variables viz ph temperature jute dose and rotational speed rpm and the response characteristics viz qmax is given in table 6 the goal of rsm approach is to obtain a set of optimal processing conditions those will help to achieve all the goals 1 0 desirability value is not obligatory because of the reason that the value is entirely reliant on how intently the upper and lower limits are found to be set relative to the real optimum optimal solution consisting of 30 sets is acquired for the specific design space constraints for qmax using statistical design expert software 11 0 the set of parametric conditions having the maximum value of desirability is preferred as optimal processing condition for the performance characteristics that is desired taweel 2009 taweel and gouda 2010 the optimal parametric condition having greater desirability function is shown in table 7 once the optimal set of the input parameters is chosen the ultimate measure is the identification and verification of the enhancement of the response characteristics by the use of the optimal level of the processing parameters confirmation test was carried out at the above optimal setting of process parameter for ph temperature jute dose and rotational speed rpm to verify and compare with optimal value of response characteristics the error percentage obtained for experimental validation of the generated response models with optimal setting of process parameter at the time of experimentation in given in table 8 the observation reveals that the calculated error is small as depicted in table 8 the desirability function for performance characteristics using the graph of ramp function and bar graph illustrates in fig 16 and fig 17 respectively rahman et al 2018 each dot on the ramp shows the parameter settings or prediction of response for performance characteristic the elevation of the dot reveals the amount of desirability of that response between the goal or the high value or between the target or the high value a linear ramp function is created as the value of each weight factor is equal to one dey and pandey 2018a bar graph determines the function of overall desirability of the quality characteristics based on the proximity of the response towards goal the value of desirability varies from 0 to 1 the bar graph illustrates the suitability of each process variable to the design criterion desirability value near to one are considered good keeping the process parameters in range and maximum response characteristics qmax 3d desirability graph were drawn the distribution of desirability function for desired response of qmax inconsonance with temperature and jute dose has shown in fig 18 it can be seen that the value of overall desirability is less at higher pulse current and pulse on time region the region for optimal desirability was placed near the top most area of the plot which shows the overall desirability value greater than 0 961 that slowly decreased while moving to the right side and backwards hence the elucidated desirability value of 0 961 illustrates the proximity of the response towards target dey et al 2017 niraj et al 2018 dey and pandey 2018b 3 5 adsorption mechanism one of the interesting task in any study of adsorption is to understand the mechanism of adsorption to do the same it is important to understand two key points 1 the adsorbate structure and 2 to know the functional groups present in an adsorbent responsible for adsorption in the present study of rr 195 it is revealed that the dye contains amino groups which are responsible for formation of hydrogen bond with the exposed hydroxyl groups present in ntjf the results obtained from sem and ftir study suggests and justifies that naoh treatment of jute fibre changes the surface morphology results in a decrease in silica content and an increase in the crystallinity of the cellulose fraction the same has also been discussed elaborately in section 2 1 of this article this change in surface characteristics of treated jute fibre will probably favour chemical reaction between the hydroxyl exposed adsorbent and dye ions and favour mechanical bonding due to more linking of dye ions towards the modified and suitable adsorbent molecular structure su et al 2013 as discussed in section 5 1 during the first 30 min there was a very rapid rate of adsorption for all the cases thereafter gradually slowed down and eventually the equilibrium time reached at 120 min suggests that there was mainly intra particle diffusion supported by film diffusion the sorption was maximum at around ph of 7 0 jute dose and rpm played a vital role in determining sorption capacity based on the findings the following adsorption mechanism may be listed as transfer of rr 195 dye from the entire solution to the jute fibre surface diffusion of dye particles through boundary layer from aqueous solution to the adsorbent surface successful adsorption of dye molecules on the surface jute fibres probably due to formation of hydrogen bond between amino groups of dye and the exposed hydroxyl group present in jute fibres the same has been depicted in fig 20 fig 19 shows a general mass transport step in adsorption 4 conclusions in this study removal of rr 195 dye was successfully carried out using naoh treated jute fibre as an adsorbent use of input process parameters ph temperature jute dose and rpm were successfully investigated for designing the output of maximum adsorption capacity by the use of composite design face centered central response surface methodology by attending 30 experimental trials with repetition of three in each of the process parameters at three different levels modelling results reveals that neutral ph low to moderate temperature moderate to high jute dose and moderate rpm will be crucial for optimum adsorption capacity the obtained predicted value of r2 for qmax as 0 96 justifies the same which reflects the models adequacy the jute dose and rpm are the two main significant factors that affected the outcome of qmax rate of adsorption increased with an increase in jute dose and at moderate rpm the impact of each process parameters and the reasoning s for the same are discussed in the relevant sections of the paper the combination of optimum parameter setting for qmax obtained are ph 7 047 temperature 299 572

11976,less costly bio sorbent jute fibre ntjf treated by naoh is used to inspect the removal of an azo dye reactive red 195 face centered response surface methodology rsm was successfully implemented to improve the performance measure under specified operating experimental domain in order to remove the dye rr 195 dissolved in aqueous solution face centered ccd of rsm based experimental design have been adopted to obtain the limited sets of experimental trials to ensure better experimentation towards optimum performance characteristics to obtain most favourable condition in order to remove dye and to obtain maximum adsorption capacity qmax four operating parameters were considered as jute dose 10 mg l 18 mg l ph 3 11 rpm 100 150 200 and temperature 3033 k 303 k and 313 k whereas highest capacity of adsorption qmax of the jute is considered as performance measure during the case of dye removal the results depict that the jute dose and temperature have a great influence on the adsorption capacity it was revealed that the action of adsorption was entropy driven following pseudo second order rate kinetics endothermic in nature sorption occurring is mainly physical adsorption and the langmuir isotherm model is best suited model for the sorption data further the effectiveness of process variables and their interpretation were investigated using anova in correlation with a

predicted qmax 31 153 mg g are observed to be good fit within the selected experimental domain threshold with a desirability of 0 96 showing excellent accuracy of the experimentation processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorption reactive red 195 rsm activation energy adsorption kinetics 1 introduction dyes are complex chemical compounds which when come in contact with most of the substance can get easily attached to them and imparts colour like they do for cloths and fabrics moreover the industries dealing with textile alone needs 10 000 tonnes of dye of per year worldwide of which 100 tonne of dyes are allowed to discharge in water bodies on a yearly basis agarwal et al 2008 due to their complex bonding structure they are hard to break and thus possess serious environmental and health hazard issues and apart from other effects some dyes are found to possess carcinogenic characteristics ahmad 2009 based upon the source of material dyes are subdivided into two categories as synthetic dyes and natural dyes roots berk berries leaves wood etc plant sources are used to derive majority of vegetable dyes which are known as the natural dyes which are readily biodegradable and possess less or no harm to the environment ahmed 2009 on the other hand almost any colour we see today is from synthetic dyes synthetic dye is everywhere and in everything aksakal and ucun 2010 the main reason for using synthetic dyes are that they are economical to produce easily applicable in fabrics and other materials most of the industries mainly associated with the textile industries ali et al 2010 uses azo dyes effluents from textile industries can possess substantial amount of dye concentration the environmental and simultaneous health hazard issues arising of dye released from textile industries are becoming a subject of scientific investigation thereby subsequent environmental legislations are getting imposed to control the release of dyes especially azo based dye directly in the free flowing water bodies based upon technique researchers have employed several methods for the effective elimination of dye from solutions of wastewater some of the techniques include biological treatments oxidation ultrasound irradiation coagulation flocculation photocatalysis ozonation and membrane separation chatterjee et al 2012 chen and zhang 2014 chiang 2008 cho and zoh 2007 chong et al 2009 chowdhury et al 2011 chowdhury and saha 2010 among all of these the most environment friendly and most effective material that can be used for adsorption is activated carbon and it has the capacity to remove almost entire amount of dye from the aqueous solution but activated carbon has its own limitation such as initial high cost of production complexities in regeneration after exhaustion decrement in removal efficiency after regeneration reddy and yun 2016 crini et al 2007 so that now a day s researchers are putting lot of emphasis on use of low cost bio sorbents which are economical biodegradable and easily available to meet the purpose of adsorption freundlich 1906 ganguly and chanda 1994 gupta et al 2013 ho and mckay 1999 one such bio sorbent jute of low cost has been considered in this case to remove reactive red 195 dye using adsorption process jute is one of the agricultural product which is abundant in india and is an important crop in indian sub continent of the total production of jute in the world around 85 of the jute is produced in the ganges delta india bangladesh and some parts of china principal components of jute fibre are cellulose hemicellulose lignin and other hydro carbons possessing low molecular weight ibrahim et al 2010 these constituents have hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups and these are the responsible agents for which adsorption of dye takes place onto the adsorbent in aqueous solution previously researchers successfully used surface modified low cost bio sorbent in order to remove dye kansal et al 2007 kapdan and ozturk 2005 koch et al 2002 so recently the focus is also onto surface modification of adsorbent to use it efficiently instead of activated carbon in removing harmful dyes from waste water the surface modifications are to enhance the fractions of the influential functional groups like hydroxyl carboxyl sulphate carboxylate phosphate groups on the adsorbent surface lagergren 1898 the topic of different methods that are considered to use in order to remove dyes researchers are not limited to use of experimental models only there are several mathematical models and software s which are in use to analyse and find out the optimum conditions required for the desired output as necessary there are several works already being done in the relevant area such as to use rsm to improve the process variables to remove dye by the use of a novel adsorbent langmuir 1916 rsm is employed to remove methylene blue dye using cheap adsorbent for the regression analysis and optimization for the removal of colour of aqueous dye solution by using a novel adsorbent liang et al 2010 liu and liu 2008 statistical designs and surface plots are applied application of rsm to improve the process of removal of azo dye by the process of oxalate catalysed photoelectro fenton by the use of carbon nanotube ptfe cathode optimization and modelling for photocatalytic degradation of azo dye reactive red using rsm based on the central composite design malik and saha 2003 munagapati and kim 2016a the approach of rsm can better predicts the impact of process variables on performance characteristics as well as it can be considered as a better option for optimization munagapati and kim 2016b therefore the face centered central composite design ccd of rsm is employed for the experimental design this particular work is confronted to investigate the maximum sorption capacity qmax of naoh treated jute fibre to remove reactive red 195 by with the help of mathematical model and examine the process parameters effects and their performance criteria by employing response surface methodology also the quantitative mathematical models are used to examine the effects of temperature ph jute dose and rpm on the adsorption capacity by using rsm approach mustafa et al 2014 2 materials and method jute is a multi constituent and multicellular fibrous material containing high percentage of cellulose apart from large portion of α cellulose 60 other two major chemical components available in jute are hemi cellulose 23 and lignin 14 and traces of fat and wax researchers suggested that there is formation of ester linkage between parts of hemi cellulose and lignin which are linked chemically by the hydroxyl groups of lignin and those of carboxyl groups of hemi cellulose namasivayam and sureshkumar 2006 the existence of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the peripheral area of adsorbent is the principal reason for the dye adsorption process from aqueous solution in the present analysis the adsorbent is pre treated with naoh in which the mostly used chemical treatment for surface modification of cellulose based material is alkali treatment to enhance adsorption properties ndazi et al 2007 the breaking of covalent bond between the component of lignocellulose is also done by treating the jute fibre with solution of aqueous sodium hydroxide naoh by hydrolysis of de polymerising lignin and hemicellulose the treatment results in a change in stiffness accessibility crystallinity pore structure unit cell structure and orientation of fibrils panswad and wongchaisuwan 1986 by substantially influencing the molecular super molecular and morphological properties of cellulose naoh treatment also helps to improve some of the properties of cellulose such as reactivity capacity of natural ion exchange and structural durability etc some of the functional groups those are chemically reactive such as oh are also identified by treating with naoh which removes waxes as well as natural fats from the surface of cellulose fibre ravikumar et al 2007 earlier studies have revealed that rice husk treated with naoh rich in cellulose compound is found to be effective as an adsorbent to remove azo dyes ravikumar et al 2005 from aqueous solutions since in jute fibres the cellulose and hemicellulose components are also present in huge amount and reactive red 195 is essentially an azo dye so in this study it was tried to check the feasibility of using ntjf to eliminate reactive red 195 from aqueous solution fig 1 depicts the cellulose structure and the cellulose hydrogen bond system naturally dried jute were obtained from market and made into sizes of approx 1 mm and distilled washed and again dried at 60 c the obtained sample then treated with 0 01 m naoh at 27 c for 4 h the resulting sample then distilled washed to remove excess chemicals present in fibre if any and ph for the sample was brought to 7 0 by the use of 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m hcl then kept in container for 24 h after drying at 100 c the final resulting sample which is naoh treated jute fibre ntjf was considered as the adsorbent an azo dye reactive red 195 having a strong though apparently noncovalent affinity to cellulose fibres having molecular formula c31h19cln7na5o21s6 was considered as the adsorbate the dye used is of analar grade and was obtained from himedia to start the experimentation a solution of stock dye 1000 mg l ph 7 0 was made using doubly distilled water molecular structure of rr 195 is given in fig 2 2 1 capacity of adsorption and percentage removal in this particular study the main target was to determine the maximum capacity of sorption q max of rr 195 using naoh treated jute fibre the quantity of maximum dye that was adsorbed per unit adsorbent mg dye per g adsorbent was found out as per the mass balance on the concentration of dye using eq 1 1 q m a x c i c f m v where q max maximum adsorption capacity mg g c i initial concentration of dye in solution mg l c f final concentration of dye in solution mg l v volume of solution l m adsorbent weight g the percentage of dye that was removed was found out using the following equation 2 percentage removal 100 2 2 adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherm studies are the basic operations which are required to obtain the relation of adsorption between the adsorbent and the adsorbate isotherms not only check the favourability of adsorption but also reveal information regarding homogenous or heterogeneous nature of interconnection between the adsorbent and the adsorbate in the present analysis the feasibility of the process of adsorption of rr 195 dye onto the ntjf was checked by the use of two basic non linear form of isotherm equations namely langmuir 1916 and freundlich 1906 isotherm models 3 langmuir isotherm model q e q m b c e 1 b c e where q e the value of adsorbed dye at equilibrium concentration mg g q m maximum capacity of monolayer adsorption it is independent of temperature b constant of langmuir adsorption constant related to energy it is temperature dependant l mg c e dye concentration in the solution at equilibrium mg l the nature of langmuir isotherm can be predicted depending upon the suitability of adsorption linear or unsuitable depending on the unitless constant separation factor value rl webi and chakravort 1974 given by equation no 4 value of rl reveals the nature of isotherm whether the process type of adsorption is favourable r l 1 unfavourable r l 1 linear r l 1 or irreversible r l 0 4 r l 1 1 b c 0 where c 0 initial adsorbate dye concentration in the solution mg l an empirical equation freundlich 1906 the freundlich isotherm equation which shows the diverseness of the surface of adsorbent during adsorption is been analysed in the present study 5 freundlich q e k f c e 1 n where k f and 1 n are freundlich constant characteristics of the system c e dye concentration of the solution at equilibrium mg l q e capacity of adsorption at equilibrium concentration mg g k f and n denotes the capacity of adsorption and intensity of adsorption the nature of reaction is endothermic if the value of k f increases with the rise in temperature it will be exothermic process if the value of k f decreases with an increase in temperature the other freundlich constant 1 n suggests the adsorption type when the case is 0 1 n 1 then the sorption process is said to be favourable when it is so that 1 n 1 then the adsorption situation will be irreversible and finally when it is 1 n 1 then the sorption is not favourable chen and zhang 2014 2 3 modelling of adsorption kinetic time depending experimental results were next utilized to know about the sorption system kinetic parameters the rate constant and optimum sorption capacity at various temperatures ranges was found out by using pseudo first order lagergren 1898 kinetic models and pseudo second order ho and mckay 1999 kinetic models 6 pseudo first order q t q 1 1 exp k 1 t 7 pseudo second order q t q 2 2 k 2 t 1 q 2 k 2 t the above kinetic models have a limit when they are associated with finding the diffusion mechanism of the sorption process so a diffusion model was employed to find the rate controlling steps 8 intra particle diffusion q t k i t 0 5 arrhenius equation was employed to find out the activation energy ea for the process of adsorption of rr 195 onto ntjf the equation for the same is listed below 9 ln k ln a e a r t after plotting a graph of ln k vs 1 t activation energy ea can be found out from the slope of the graph of the same where t temperature in kelvin k either rate constant of pseudo first order of r the rate constant opseudo second order which again rely on the rate of adsorption favoured in the kinetic reaction activation energy reveals about the nature physical or chemical of adsorption some of the thermodynamic parameters like δg gibbs free energy change δ h enthalpy change δ s entropy change were investigated to check the temperature suitability of the adsorption endothermic or exothermic nature of the sorption process and also to verify that the adsorption is enthalpy or entropy driven the investigations were done by using the equations given below 10 δ g rt ln kad 11 k a d c 0 c e c e n 12 δ g δ h t δ s the values of δ h and δ s were determined from the graph of δg and t where c o is the initial dye concentration of solution and ce is the equilibrium dye concentration of solution kad is the rate constant of adsorption process at equilibrium the n value is found by rate kinetic analysis by observing which rate model the observed data best fit 2 4 batch experimental procedure at first a solution of stock dye of 1000 mg l was made from that solutions with concentrations 50 100 150 and 200 mg l were made which were considered for the overall analysis for the present study the aim was to fix a dye concentration say 50 mg l and to find maximum sorption capacity qmax as a function of the following input process parameters which are ph jute dose temperature and rotational speed rpm adsorption analysis was done batch wise to analyse the removal of rr 195 with the help of variation in the aforementioned process parameters let us elaborate the experimentation regarding the influence of change in ph onto final outcome qmax the ph range taken for the analysis was 3 11 at first 200 ml of dye solution having 50 mg l concentration is taken where the initial ph was calibrated to 3 0 initial jute dose 10 g l initial temperature 293 k and the rotary shaker was adjusted at 100 rpm temperatures were controlled using rotary incubator next the solution was allowed to agitate and samples were collected to analyse concentration of sample solution after each 5 min interval after 5 min 10 min 15 min and so on upto 180 min adsorption was no more time dependent after agitation of 120 min equilibrium time the dye concentrations were measured from absorbance values obtained using uv vis spectroscopy the data s were then used to calculate the maximum amount of dye adsorbed qmax mg g other process parameters being constant similar kind of experiments were carried out for other ph values likewise once the study of ph variation was over then other parameters were studied set wise by varying the parameter whose effect was to be determined and keeping other variables constant to study other parameters their ranges were considered as jute dose range 10 18 g l temperature range 293 303 and 323 k and rotational speed rpm as 100 150 and 200 respectively for different set of solutions separate ph values were kept in the range 0f 3 11 using 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh experiments were conducted in order to check for adsorption of rr 195 by the container walls in the absence of jute no degradation was found there or adsorption of rr 195 by container walls duplicate tests were conducted and mean values were considered same set of experiments were done for all possible combinations of all the process variables 3 results and discussion time decay curve represent the removal of dye from aqueous solution as a contact time function it is measured by observing the reduction in concentration of dye by its removal using adsorbent from the solution over a period of time fig 3 shows the time decay curve to remove reactive red 195 by the use of naoh treated jute fibre as the adsorbent using an initial dye concentration of 50 mg l jute dose 14 g l ph 7 0 rpm 150 and temperature 303 k in adsorption equilibrium time is said to be achieved when beyond a particular time point there will not be any further significant adsorption of dye onto the adsorbent or in other words adsorption of dye no more remain a time dependent phenomenon which generally can be observed from the time decay curve curve shows that for the first 30 min the adsorption rate of the adsorbate adsorbent interaction is rapid after that the adsorption rate drastically reduces the quick rate of removal of dye at the beginning stages is assigned to the adsorption site availability as the time increases the adsorbate adsorbent interaction also increases thereby leading to the adsorption sites saturation because of more and more adsorption of dye molecules onto the sites leading to decrease in quantity of adsorption sites and subsequent decrease in sorption for the given study equilibrium time was obtained at 120 min after which the adsorption process does not remain time dependent similar kind of study was undertaken by ahmed at el ahmed 2009 3 1 surface morphology of ntjf the surface property of naoh treated jute fibre and also on rr 195 adsorbed naoh treated jute fibres were done by the use of scanning electron microscope analysis using sem model jsm 6360 jeol working conditions were as resolution 3 nm was there in the secondary electron mode and at a distance of 8 mm and voltage of acceleration 0f 30 kv accelerating voltage from 1kv 30kv in 1 kv step from the sem images shown below in fig 4 it can be seen that fig 4 a shows the image of only naoh treated jute fibre and in fig 4 b it can be seen that there are lot of particles of reactive red 195 which are got attached on the jute fibre surface treated with naoh both the figures are of 1 μm resolution to characterize and identify functional groups ftir is an effective technique the ftir spectra confirm the impact of functional groups on the process of adsorption of rr 195 onto the adsorbent cell surfaces the studies for ftir were done at saif bombay india the instrument used for the study was having following details make bruker germany model 3000 hyperion microscope with vertex 80 ftir system the ftir spectra of virgin ntjf and reactive red 195 rr 195 adsorbed ntjf are described in fig 5 because of the bounded hydroxyl or amine groups the broad and strong band was at 3444 63 cm 1 the highest value was found at 2918 12 cm 1 and it was observed due to the ch asymmetric stretching the highest value at 1740 78 cm 1 was assigned to the carboxyl group stretching vibration asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration of co groups were assigned by the bands at 1633 41 cm 1 1507 43 cm 1 and 1461 05 cm 1 the c n stretching band was found at 1375 40 cm 1 c o stretching of alcohols and carboxylic acids was assigned by the band at 1020 51 cm 1 after the adsorption of rr 195 for rr 195 loaded ntjf the symmetrical stretching vibration bands of hydroxyl or amine groups were changed from 3444 63 cm 1 to 3443 98 cm 1 the carboxyl groups stretching band was shifted from 1740 78 to 1740 70 cm 1 the stretching bands at 1633 41 1507 43 and 1461 05 cm 1 were also shifted to 1633 68 1507 55 and 1460 92 cm 1 respectively the c o peak at 1020 51 cm 1 were shifted to 1020 31 cm 1 respectively the result analysis of ftir spectra as frequency shifts shows that the above mentioned functional groups are the prime reason which causes the binding of rr 195 to the surface of the ntjf in the present study the results were verified with the help of two nonlinear adsorption isotherms namely langmuir and freundlich isotherm studies from the plot of the graph of qe vs ce from fig 6 it has observed that the method of adsorption better fits to langmuir isotherm which suggests that there is monolayer adsorption of the rr 195 dyes on the surface of ntjf several isotherm parameters are shown in table 1 fig 5 shows the adsorption isotherm studies at the temperature 303 k for the study of sorption kinetics the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were analysed to study and compare with experimental results to analyse the rate constants and to obtain the equilibrium capacity of adsorption at various temperature the slopes and the intercepts of the plots of log q e q t versus t figure not mentioned gave the rate constants k 1 and q e of the pseudo first order the results of correlation coefficients r 2 found for pseudo first order comparable studies of theoretical and experimental equilibrium of pseudo first order kinetic model sorption capacities show that is a considerable variation between this kinetic model and theoretical studies similar studies were also conducted for theoretical data sans pseudo second order kinetic model and fig 7 shows that pseudo second order model fits well with the theoretical data s compared to the other kinetic model to remove rr 195 onto ntjf 3 2 activation energy and thermodynamic parameters activation energy ea for the method was determined from arrhenius equation eqn no 9 by drawing the arrhenius plot of rr 195 adsorption onto ntjf it is found out to obtain the sorption nature taking place in the process and it thus holds a significant role in determining if the adsorption taking place is a type physical adsorption or chemical adsorption as low ea value 40 kj mol shows physical adsorption and higher ea value 40 kj mol indicate chemical adsorption in this p study the adsorption rate was better suited as per the second order rate constant kinetics so the plot was done by taking ln k k pseudo second order rate constant values in y axis and 1 t time inverse in kelvin in x axis ea was obtained from the slope of the linear graph which is obtained as 15 12 kj mol from the result we can conclude that the following process is predominantly governed by physical adsorption by ahmed 2009 fig 8 shows the arrhenius plot for the determination of ea one of the thermodynamics parameters change in gibb s free energy δg was determined using the values of equilibrium rate constant kad and other two parameters entropy δs and enthalpy δh were obtained from the intercepts of the graph of δg vs time t along with the plot the parameters were found out using equation no 10 11 and 12 the values of δg for the temperature values of 293 k 303 k and 313 k were found out as 6 2 7 61 and 9 38 kj mol respectively decrease in the value of change in gibb s free energy with an increase in temperature indicates that the process of adsorption was suitable at slightly high temperature the increase in capacity of sorption with an increase in temperature also suggests for the increase in sorbent particles kinetic energy positive value of δs 0 1551 kj mol k shows a rise in the randomness at the interface of solid solution and entropy driven positive value of δh 23 22 kj mol suggests that endothermic reaction is employed in the process vadiveloo et al 2009 vankar 2000 zhou et al 2015 the nature of adsorption process is found out by the value of δh in general physical adsorption occurs if the δh value is in between the range of 8 25 kj mol and it is said to be a chemical adsorption process if the value is in the range of 80 200 kj mol in this study by observing the δh value it is revealed that the nature of adsorption is physical which justifies the study of activation energy the plot for δg vs t is shown in fig 9 table 2 shows the different thermodynamic parameters 3 3 adsorption studies by employing response surface methodology experimentation was done batch wise to find the value of maximum adsorption capacity qmax as a function of ph temperature k jute dose g l and rotational speed rpm qmax were found out once at a time by changing any one of the process parameters and keeping others process parameters as constant likewise qmax values were found out 30 times by carrying out 30 different set of process parameter combinations which were later used to find the most desirable condition using response surface methodology for optimizing and modelling the response characteristics which includes quantitative independent variables are obtained by response surface methodology rsm which is a combination of statistical and mathematical technique a regression model also known as polynomial quadratic model of order two as shown in eq 13 explains the system quality characteristic the software design expert 11 0 gives an approximation of the regression model coefficient 13 y c 0 i 1 n c i x n i 1 n d i x i 2 ε the experimental design of the present study was mainly based on face cantered central composite second order design ccd technique the ccd full factorial design with all factors combination at two levels high 1 and low 1 are considered which comprises of eight star points and six central point s coded level 0 correlates to an α value of 1 the face centered ccd consists of 30 trial experiments at 4 process variables the suitable range and both coded and actual value of process parameters are shown in table 3 table 4 shows the coded form of the experimental design layout adopted in this analysis the model fit summary prescribed that the quadratic model of second order has significance in the statistical analysis of qmax the result analyses for quadratic model are given in anova in table 5 the importance of the model is shown by the model f value the probability of f value being higher than f value for the models term are less than 0 05 i e α 0 05 or 95 confidence which means that the model developed should be significant statistically and it is mandatory as it denotes that the model terms effect on the performance characteristics kansal et al 2007 when the value of multiple co efficient of regression r2 becomes unity the response models fits better with actual data the deviation becomes very less between the actual values and predicted values fig 10 shows that the graph between the actual value and predicted values of the response qmax proves the degree of proximity we can say that the errors are normally distributed as maximum of the values are close to a straight the value of the adequate precision ap in this case is above 3 ap gives a comparison of the predicted value span at the design point to the mean prediction error which represents adequate model discrimination the developed model proposes greater value of the coefficients of determination r2 as well as adequate precision ap the values obtained were as follows r2 0 96 and ap 20 907 for qmax consequently the developed quadratic mathematical model can influence significantly on fitting and predicting the results of observation and also the lack of fit test is found to be insignificant the insignificant factors are removed to get shifted to the fitted quadratic response surface models by the backward elimination process the lack of fit test is found to be insignificant as the insignificant quadratic model terms are removed eq 14 given below shows that the response surface equations absolute quadratic models by the use of backward elimination process the model thus obtained can be used for navigation purpose of design space as the ratio of ap gives an adequate signal the ultimate response surface equation for qmax maximum adsorption capacity 14 qmax 0 10 0 065 a 0 17 b 0 019 c 0 026 ab 0 020 bc 0 15 b 2 fig 11 depicts the ph influences the percentage of dye removal ph play as a principal influential factor for dye removal onto adsorbent in an aqueous solution the ionization dissociation as well as properties of the adsorbent surface of the adsorbate molecule freundlich 1906 is greatly influenced by ph subsequently there is change in adsorption process depending on the change in surface properties of both the parties that are in consideration it was noticed that the qmax increases with an increase in ph the reason behind that is at low ph value the functional groups that exists on the adsorbent surface undergoes protonation due to this phenomenon absorbent surface gets positively charged which is followed by decrease in dye ions adsorption because of electrostatic repulsion and on the increment of ph of the dye solution there is increment in the process of adsorption due to eventual deprotonation of the adsorbent functional groups and therefore enhances the electrostatic attraction between the dye cations and negatively charged sites on the adsorbent it is very important parameter which acts as a variable in finding out the adsorption rate capacity of adsorbate on the adsorbent to determine the adsorption rate at various jute dose concentrations jute adsorbent dose was taken in the range of 10 18 g l it has been noticed that there is a rise in the adsorption and subsequent dye removal as the jute dose increases this increasing rate of dye removal rate with a higher dose of jute could be due to increase in surface area of adsorbent resulting in a increase in number of adsorption sites available for adsorption of adsorbates onto adsorbent saeed et al 2010 the same phenomenon was noticed when the jute dose was raised from 10 to 14 905 g l further increase in dose of jute dose decreases the rate of adsorption the decrease in the rate of adsorption with an increase in jute dose at constant volume of solution and constant dye concentration may be attributed to particulate interaction like aggregation which results in adsorption site saturation particulate interaction will cause in a decrease in available adsorption sites due to the fall in total surface area of the adsorbent and an increase in diffusional path length crini et al 2007 a result for the jute dose effects on removal of dye percentage is depicted in fig 12 as observed in fig 13 the adsorption rate is higher at lower temperature and vis a versa higher temperature causes weakening of bonds between adsorbate dye molecules and adsorbent binding site chowdhury et al 2011 chowdhury and saha 2010 this may be reason that adsorption phenomenon is better suited at lower temperatures moreover at a higher temperature the observed pattern of decreasing dye removal indicates that the process of adsorption is kinetically controlled and the same is justified from the experimental analysis rotational speed rpm has a pivotal role in finding out the adsorption rate of an adsorbate onto the adsorbent if the rpm rate will be too less then both the adsorbate and adsorbent molecules will follow sedimentation and not suspension at low rpm there are chances that both the dye and jute fibres will settle on the bottom of the conical flask used for the rotary purpose it is very important that both the parties remain in suspension so that there will be suitable interaction between them and hence occurrence of adsorption yagub et al 2012 on the other hand if the rotational speed becomes too high then also the chances of adsorption diminishes as high rotational speed of the solution will decrease the capacity of dye particles to be settled at the adsorption sites of the adsorbent rather high rpm rate will keep the dye particles floating in the solution not allowing it to settle the results are given in fig 14 moreover fig 15 a b and c depicts the approximated response surface plot for qmax in relation to the process parameters of solution ph jute dose temperature and rpm 3 4 desirability based multi response optimization the goals and ranges of process variables viz ph temperature jute dose and rotational speed rpm and the response characteristics viz qmax is given in table 6 the goal of rsm approach is to obtain a set of optimal processing conditions those will help to achieve all the goals 1 0 desirability value is not obligatory because of the reason that the value is entirely reliant on how intently the upper and lower limits are found to be set relative to the real optimum optimal solution consisting of 30 sets is acquired for the specific design space constraints for qmax using statistical design expert software 11 0 the set of parametric conditions having the maximum value of desirability is preferred as optimal processing condition for the performance characteristics that is desired taweel 2009 taweel and gouda 2010 the optimal parametric condition having greater desirability function is shown in table 7 once the optimal set of the input parameters is chosen the ultimate measure is the identification and verification of the enhancement of the response characteristics by the use of the optimal level of the processing parameters confirmation test was carried out at the above optimal setting of process parameter for ph temperature jute dose and rotational speed rpm to verify and compare with optimal value of response characteristics the error percentage obtained for experimental validation of the generated response models with optimal setting of process parameter at the time of experimentation in given in table 8 the observation reveals that the calculated error is small as depicted in table 8 the desirability function for performance characteristics using the graph of ramp function and bar graph illustrates in fig 16 and fig 17 respectively rahman et al 2018 each dot on the ramp shows the parameter settings or prediction of response for performance characteristic the elevation of the dot reveals the amount of desirability of that response between the goal or the high value or between the target or the high value a linear ramp function is created as the value of each weight factor is equal to one dey and pandey 2018a bar graph determines the function of overall desirability of the quality characteristics based on the proximity of the response towards goal the value of desirability varies from 0 to 1 the bar graph illustrates the suitability of each process variable to the design criterion desirability value near to one are considered good keeping the process parameters in range and maximum response characteristics qmax 3d desirability graph were drawn the distribution of desirability function for desired response of qmax inconsonance with temperature and jute dose has shown in fig 18 it can be seen that the value of overall desirability is less at higher pulse current and pulse on time region the region for optimal desirability was placed near the top most area of the plot which shows the overall desirability value greater than 0 961 that slowly decreased while moving to the right side and backwards hence the elucidated desirability value of 0 961 illustrates the proximity of the response towards target dey et al 2017 niraj et al 2018 dey and pandey 2018b 3 5 adsorption mechanism one of the interesting task in any study of adsorption is to understand the mechanism of adsorption to do the same it is important to understand two key points 1 the adsorbate structure and 2 to know the functional groups present in an adsorbent responsible for adsorption in the present study of rr 195 it is revealed that the dye contains amino groups which are responsible for formation of hydrogen bond with the exposed hydroxyl groups present in ntjf the results obtained from sem and ftir study suggests and justifies that naoh treatment of jute fibre changes the surface morphology results in a decrease in silica content and an increase in the crystallinity of the cellulose fraction the same has also been discussed elaborately in section 2 1 of this article this change in surface characteristics of treated jute fibre will probably favour chemical reaction between the hydroxyl exposed adsorbent and dye ions and favour mechanical bonding due to more linking of dye ions towards the modified and suitable adsorbent molecular structure su et al 2013 as discussed in section 5 1 during the first 30 min there was a very rapid rate of adsorption for all the cases thereafter gradually slowed down and eventually the equilibrium time reached at 120 min suggests that there was mainly intra particle diffusion supported by film diffusion the sorption was maximum at around ph of 7 0 jute dose and rpm played a vital role in determining sorption capacity based on the findings the following adsorption mechanism may be listed as transfer of rr 195 dye from the entire solution to the jute fibre surface diffusion of dye particles through boundary layer from aqueous solution to the adsorbent surface successful adsorption of dye molecules on the surface jute fibres probably due to formation of hydrogen bond between amino groups of dye and the exposed hydroxyl group present in jute fibres the same has been depicted in fig 20 fig 19 shows a general mass transport step in adsorption 4 conclusions in this study removal of rr 195 dye was successfully carried out using naoh treated jute fibre as an adsorbent use of input process parameters ph temperature jute dose and rpm were successfully investigated for designing the output of maximum adsorption capacity by the use of composite design face centered central response surface methodology by attending 30 experimental trials with repetition of three in each of the process parameters at three different levels modelling results reveals that neutral ph low to moderate temperature moderate to high jute dose and moderate rpm will be crucial for optimum adsorption capacity the obtained predicted value of r2 for qmax as 0 96 justifies the same which reflects the models adequacy the jute dose and rpm are the two main significant factors that affected the outcome of qmax rate of adsorption increased with an increase in jute dose and at moderate rpm the impact of each process parameters and the reasoning s for the same are discussed in the relevant sections of the paper the combination of optimum parameter setting for qmax obtained are ph 7 047 temperature 299 572 0k jute dose 14 905 gm l and rotational speed 154 929 rpm for maximizing the qmax the agreeable error percentage of 3 39 between the predicted and observed values for qmax confirm precision of the

adsorption was found to fit well with the langmuir isotherm the kinetics adsorption behavior go along with the pseudo second order model thermodynamic parameters δg 0 and δh 61 27 kj mol 1 indicate that the adsorption process is spontaneous and exothermic the density functional theory dft calculation was also used to investigate the effect of ac pore size on binding efficiency to pb2 dft calculations revealed that the 0 44 nm micropore ac model has a higher adsorption efficiency than that of the 0 71 nm micropore ac and graphene models due to the stronger ion dipole interaction and suitable pore size for pb2 binding graphical abstract image 1 keywords lead adsorption dft binding energy desorption 1 introduction contamination of soil and water by pb2 released from many industrial activities leads to severe problems in humans it is well known that free pb2 and its compounds can cause lead poisoning mouni et al 2011 noticeably many attempts have been made to remove pb2 from ground and waste water aguayo villarreal et al 2017 lemraski and sharafinia 2016 siddiqui and ahmad 2017 precipitation bhatluri et al 2015 ion exchange peristyy et al 2016 and activated carbon adsorption nieto márquez et al 2017 pap et al 2016 van thuan et al 2017 methods have been applied utilization of activated carbon ac derived from biomass and agricultural wastes as a potential absorbent for heavy metal removal from metal contaminated mediums is of great interest kuroki et al 2019 tan et al 2017 tao et al 2015 this is due to the fact that the derived ac has high porosity and adsorption capacity moreover preparation of ac is cheap and not complicated furthermore reuse and recycle of biomass and agricultural wastes to prepare the derived ac can also reduce wastes from factories and agricultural activities various studies of adsorption of heavy metal ions onto ac have been improved and many types of the derived ac have been proposed for the removal of heavy metal ions ahmad and haseeb 2015 adebisi and alaba 2017 kırbıyık et al 2017 it was revealed that adsorption capacity of ac depends on many factors among them type of the precursor used for ac preparation is the main factor lemraski and sharafinia 2016 among biomass and agricultural wastes mangosteen garcinia mangostana peel mp is one of the best alternative for low cost materials of ac preparation this is because mp has high carbon content and low volatile compounds ahmad and alrozi 2010 in the last few year mangosteen peel activated carbon mpac has been prepared and applied for removal organic dyes zein et al 2010 mangosteen the queen of fruits abundantly available in the south of thailand so that a large amount of mp waste should be transformed to be a value added product in this study mpac was prepared and applied as an adsorbent to remove pb2 from aqueous solution the properties of mangosteen peel charcoal mpc and mpac were analyzed using various experimental techniques such as scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and brunauer emmett teller bet for the study of pb2 adsorption onto mpac the batch experiment was applied to determine effects of adsorbent dosage contact time ph concentration of pb2 and temperature on adsorption activity of mpac the equlibrium kinetics and thermodynamics adsorption of pb2 onto mpac from aqueous solution were also studied additionally structures and adsorption energy of mpac pb2 complexes were imitated using a computational technique the model of mpac was simplified as models of defected graphene sheet in which the 1 carbon and 2 carbon atoms were removed from graphene sheets to perform two size of micropore of mpac models the effect of pore size of defect graphene sheets on pb2 ion adsorption was calculated using dft calculation 2 experimental techniques 2 1 preparation of mpac an amount of mp was taken from chulabhorn district nakhon si thammarat thailand before producing activated carbon mp was first cleaned with tap water and dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h then it was crushed to a particle size of 0 5 1 0 mm subsequently mp was carbonized in a furnace carbolite cwf13 23 at 700 c on a heating rate of 10 c min for 70 min after the first carbonization step the obtained product of mp char was labeled as mpc the mpc was impregnated with zncl2 in a 1 1 mass ratio and activated in a furnace at 600 c for 2 h then the obtained final product was labeled as mpac the mpac was repeatedly washed until its filtrate was neutral the mpac was dried in an oven at 105 c for 3 h to remove moisture production conditions of the activated carbon samples such as impregnation ratio and carbonization temperature which produced the optimum bet specific surface area value the percent yield and pore volume of adsorbents were chosen from the literature ahmad and alrozi 2010 chen et al 2011 foo and hameed 2012 2 2 characterization of mpc and mpac adsorbents the obtained adsorbents were characterized by several techniques the approximate properties of mpc and mpac were analyzed the functional groups of mpc and mpac were analyzed by attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir in the scanning range of 4000 650 cm 1 the sem oxford merlin compact in conjunction with eds oxford aztec was applied for surface morphology and elemental analysis of mpc and mpac adsorbents moreover bet surface area total pore volume and pore diameter distribution of mpc and mpac were measured by nitrogen adsorption isotherm using a micrometrics surface area analyzer micromeritics asap 2010 2 3 phpzc and acidity basicity of mpac surface surface acidity and basicity of mpac was determined using the ph titration technique the initial and final ph of mpac surface in a nacl solution were adjusted ph with naoh and hcl and it was determined using a ph meter ph 720 boehm 1994 plot between initial ph and δph of the solution intersected at the point which is called phpzc chaudhry et al 2016 2 4 batch adsorption experiment the effects of absorbent dosage ph of pb2 solution contact time and initial concentration of pb2 solution on pb2 adsorption capacity of mpac from the aqueous solution were studied and optimized 2 4 1 effects of adsorbent dosage the mpac was soaked in 150 ml of 50 mg l 1 of pb2 solution ph 7 for 180 min at 30 c in a shaker bath at 240 rpm to find out the optimum amount of mpac on pb2 adsorption the weight of mpac was varied in a range of 0 10 0 50 g the initial and final concentrations of pb2 were analyzed by atomic adsorption spectrophotometer aas perkin analyst 700 the percentage of pb2 removed from the solution pb2 removal was calculated using the following equation 1 1 p b 2 r e m o v a l c 0 c e c 0 100 where c 0 and c e are the initial and equilibrium concentrations mg l 1 of pb2 the adsorption capacity at equilibrium q e in mg g 1 of pb2 was calculated using the following equation 2 2 q e c 0 c e w v where w and v are mass of mpac g and volume of the solution l respectively 2 4 2 effects of ph of pb2 solution the effect of ph on the adsorption capacity was observed at a ph level that ranged from 2 0 to 12 0 the ph values of solutions were adjusted using naoh 0 1 mol l 1 and hcl 0 1 mol l 1 solutions the results were obtained using minimum of replicate experiments for each ph value in each ph the mpac 0 10 g in 150 ml of 50 mg l 1 of pb2 solution at 30 c in a shaker bath at 240 rpm for 360 min were carried out the initial and final concentrations of pb2 were analyzed 2 4 3 effects of initial concentration of pb2 solution two sets of tests were done in the same way for the study of topic 2 4 2 except the ph of pb2 solution was assigned to be 5 and 7 in each set the initial concentration of pb2 solutions were varied from 10 to 100 mg l 1 2 4 4 effects of contact time two sets of tests were done in the same way of the study of topic 2 4 3 except the initial concentration of pb2 solution was set at 50 mg l 1 and contact time were assigned to be varied from 0 to 360 min 2 4 5 effects of temperature two sets of tests were done in the same way of the study of topic 2 4 4 except the contact time of pb2 solution was set at 180 min and temperatures were assigned to be varied from 30 to 50 c 2 5 computational method for adsorption of pb2 ion on mpac for finding adsorption energy between pb2 ion and adsorbent model the 4 4 six ring aromatic model structure of graphene gp was used as a simplified gp model this is because it is the most stable model based on the shokuhi rad and pouralijan foukolaei shokuhi rad and pouralijan foukolaei 2015 and rattanapan et al rattanaphan et al 2020 studies the pore size of the mpac model was set as micropore according to the experimental result obtained from the bet technique the two structures of mpac were prepared by removing one and two carbon atoms from the gp model they were then optimized to obtain pore volume of 0 44 and 0 71 nm for one and two carbon atoms removed structures respectively the graphene model structures 4 4 gp 0 44 nm mpac and 0 71 nm mpac were taken for the calculations the complex structures were modeled by placing pb2 ion at the center and perpendicular to the optimized graphene structure as shown in fig 1 the complex structures were fully optimized by using b3lyp calculation at the 6 31g d level of theory an effective core potential ecp basis set lanl2dz was used for pb2 ion the binding energies for optimized pb2 adsorbent complex models were then calculated using b3lyp m06 and wb97x d3 methods at 6 31g d level of theory for oxygen carbon and hydrogen atoms while lanl2dz and def2 svp basis sets were used for pb2 ion the binding energies were corrected by basis set superposition error bsse using the counterpoise correction cp all calculations were performed using the orca package neese 2012 the binding energy e bind between the optimized adsorbed pb2 ion and the adsorbent models gp 0 44 nm mpac and 0 71 nm mpac is defined as eq 3 3 ebind ecpx eadsorbent epb 2 where the e cpx is total energy of the complex adsorbed adsorbent e adsorbent the total energy of adsorbent model and e pb 2 the total energy of pb2 ion 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of adsorbent 3 1 1 element and surface characteristics analyses the carbon content can affect the suitability of raw materials high carbon content and low other values such as moisture and volatile matter indicate a good quality of adsorbents liu et al 2010 the results of element analysis of mpc and mpac is displayed in table 1 the eds results revealed that the carbon content of mpac is higher than that of the mpc this means that zncl2 activator treatment process for mpac preparation is applicable hence causing to increase graphitization after the zncl2 activation along with carbonization whereas the other element content k s and cl of mpc and mpac were not significantly different while the oxygen content of mpac was dominantly decreased due to the removal of the volatile compound after zncl2 activation along with carbonization the eds results of this study were supported by ahmad ma et al study ahmad and alrozi 2010 a scanning electron microscope sem is used to study the surface characteristics and morphological features of the adsorbents sem photographs of mpc and mpac were observed for visualizing their surface structures the mpc surface fig 2 shows a fairly smooth surface with few cracks and voids the mpac surface had more porous structures formed than that of the mpc sample from the results it can be concluded that the material impregnated with zncl2 after carbonization enhanced the porous structure more than that of the material produced only by using carbonization generally the adsorption capacity is related to the specific surface area and pore volume of the adsorbents the pore volume affects the size while the surface area affects the amount of adsorbed molecules gao et al 2017 the bet method was used to investigate the porous structural parameters of adsorbents the bet surface area sbet m2 g 1 the microsurface area smicr m2 g 1 the mesosurface area smeso m2 g 1 the total pore volume vt cm3 g 1 the micropore volume vmicr cm3 g 1 the mesopore volume vmeso cm3 g 1 and average pore diameter nm of mpc and mpac are listed in table 2 the bet surface area of mpac and mpc were 423 99 m2 g 1 and 45 31 m2 g 1 while the pore volume of mpac and mpc were 0 22 cm3 g 1 and 0 02 cm3 g 1 respectively the average pore diameter of mpc slightly larger than that of mpac sample nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms for mpc and mpac are also considered and plotted in fig 3a the adsorption desorption isotherm of mpac is similar to type i and iv isotherms indicating structure between a microporous and a mesoporous brunauer et al 1938 the micropore of mpac was about 59 09 of the total pore volume with a well developed porous structure gundogdu et al 2013 foo and hameed 2012 noticeably all porous structural parameters of mpac were higher than those of mpc these results imply that the surface modification of mpc via a thermal chemical process used in this study was effective 3 1 2 ftir analysis and phzpc of the adsorbents the ftir spectra of mp precursor and mpac are displayed in fig 3 b it was observed that the spectra of mp raw material and mpac had a significantly different in appearance for mp which was not subjected to heat treatment contains especially volatile compounds with functional groups such as hydroxyls phenols esters and ethers from agricultural residues composed of cellulose hemicelluloses and lignin zielke et al 1996 the wide absorbance band centered at ca 3255 cm 1 correspond to o h stretching of hydroxyl groups gaikwad and balomajumder 2017 the weak band at about 2911 cm 1 and the weak to medium band at 1344 cm 1 could be ascribed to the asymmetric c h stretching and c h bending respectively of methylene and methyl groups the very broadband at 2100 cm 1 correspond to cc cm 1 stretching of alkyne groups the strong peak at 1690 and 1505 cm 1 could be attributed to the stretching vibration of cc and co in organic matter kongnoo et al 2016 the strong band at 1027 cm 1 is ascribed to stretching vibration of c n and c o stretching vibrations some spectra of mpac such as o h c h cc and co became weaker than that of mp precursor however after zncl2 activation the band at 2100 cm 1 and 1920 that are ascribed to cc and c n cm 1 vibrations are more intense than that of mp gurten et al 2012 in like manner with the absorption band in the range of 1300 900 cm 1 region is ascribed to c n and c o stretching kongnoo et al 2016 this result indicated that the volatile compounds of organic matter of mp decomposed and the graphitization of mpac increased after the zncl2 activation along with carbonization the phzpc of a solid sample is the ph at which the charge on the surface of the solid is zero chaudhry et al 2016 as shown in fig 2c the p phzpc of mpac is equal to 6 the surface of the mpac become negative and positive charges when the ph less than 6 and more than 6 respectively therefore knowledge of this value helps to guide the discussion on adsorption results this means that in an acidic solution the negative charges of the mpac surface make it bind tightly with pb2 ions due to the electrostatic interaction the experimental results obtained from the elemental analysis ftir spectrum porous structure parameters and sem image of mpac prepared in this study as described above indicated that mpac is suitable to use as an adsorbent 3 2 adsorption of pb2 by mpac adsorbent results of the study of the effects of adsorbent dosage ph of pb2 solution initial concentration of pb2 solution and contact time on pb2 adsorption by mpac adsorbent are displayed in fig 4 a d respectively 3 2 1 influence of adsorbent dosage the adsorbent dosage is an important parameter in adsorption studies because it determines the capacity of adsorbents for a given initial concentration fig 4a presents the effect of the adsorbent dosage on the adsorption of the pb2 by varying the amount of mpac from 0 1 to 0 5 g at fixed time of 180 min ph value of 7 temperature of 30 c and initial concentration of 20 mg l 1 it was observed that the amount of pb2 adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbent q decreased when increasing the adsorbent dose while the removal percentage of pb2 by mpac slightly increased this can be attributed to increase in total adsorbent surface area and availability of more adsorption sites by increasing adsorbent dosage jribi et al 2017 ghasemi et al 2015 further increments of mpac adsorbent did not have much of an affect for pb2 removal due to the limited availability of pb2 adsorbate around the adsorbent jribi et al 2017 this suggests that using 0 1 g of mpac can yield a high value of q and pb2 removal 3 2 2 influence of initial ph the removal of pb2 from an aqueous solution is dependent on ph fig 4b the adsorption experiments were conducted in the initial ph range of 2 12 the maximum adsorption capacity of mpac was obtained at ph 5 there was a slight decrease in the adsorption when the ph of pb2 solution was increased to 7 the adsorption of pb2 at ph 2 was low and this could be due to competition of h or h3o ions in the medium at low ph both metal ions and h or h3o ions reacted with the mpac surface lemraski and sharafinia 2016 saeed et al 2005 which led to the decrease in the adsorption yield of mpac surface and pb2 however as the ph increased the adsorption capacity also increased until a ph value around of 6 as the effect of the acidic solution was reduced at higher ph values the adsorption capacity was slightly decreased may be due to the precipitation of metal hydroxides huang et al 2014 mouni et al 2011 wang et al 2010 under neutral conditions mpac displayed very high pb2 adsorption efficiency thus at ph values of 5 and 7 were used as the optimum ph value throughout the tests 3 2 3 influence of initial concentration the initial concentration of pb2 in the aqueous solution one of the affecting parameters for adsorption was investigated using a range of 10 20 30 40 50 80 and 100 mg l 1 of pb2 ion solution see fig 4c for both ph 5 and ph 7 the adsorption capacities increased with an increase in the initial concentration from 10 to 50 mg l 1 but it remained constant when the initial concentration was from 50 to 100 mg l 1 at low initial solution concentration the surface area and the availability of adsorption sites were relatively high so the pb2 ions were easily adsorbed and removed at higher initial solution concentration the total available adsorption sites are limited resulting decrease in the adsorption capacity of pb2 ions noticeably the pb2 solution at ph 5 gave the better adsorption capacity than that of ph 7 it is known that lead species in water solution could be present in the forms of pb2 pb oh pb oh 2 and pb oh 3 at different ph values deliyanni et al 2012 it is expected that the predominant species at ph 5 was pb2 deliyanni et al 2012 so that there was an attractive the force between the adsorbent and the adsorbate 3 2 4 influence of contact time in this work the effect of contact time was studied using a function of time in the range of 5 360 min at a constant adsorbent dose of 0 1 g l 1 and pb2 solutions at ph of 5 and 7 the amount of pb2 adsorbed by the mpac was determined with initial concentrations of pb2 20 mg l 1 the effect of contact time on the adsorption capacity of mpac is depicted in fig 4d it is obviously seen that there was a rapid uptake of pb2 within the first 30 min for both pb2 solutions at ph of 5 and 7 this fast uptake is due to the abundance of free binding sites as illustrated in fig 4d the apparent adsorption equilibrium was usually established within 180 min and no significant change in the amount of pb2 adsorbed after 360 min equilibrium was due to the saturation of the active site and slow pore diffusion at which time further adsorption could not take place huang et al 2014 semerjian 2010 consequently the contact time was set to 180 min in the following experiments to ensure adsorption equilibrium 3 3 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms provide information about the capacity of the adsorbent and the nature of solute sorbent interaction moreover the isotherm constant values are essential to predict the maximum adsorption capacity describe the affinity and surface properties of the adsorbent in the present work the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich isotherms were used to analyze the experimental equilibrium data all plots of isotherms are displayed in fig 5 the langmuir model is based on the assumption that there is monolayer coverage of adsorbate on a homogenous adsorbent surface langmuir 1918 the langmuir isotherm equation is expressed as equation 4 in table 3 in this equation qm represents the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of adsorbent mg g 1 and kl represents the langmuir adsorption constant l mg 1 the langmuir isotherm plot and their parameters of pb2 adsorption onto mpac adsorbent are shown in fig 5a and table 3 respectively the applicability of isotherm equation is compared on the basis of correlation coefficients r2 the best fit of the experimental data was obtained by the langmuir isotherm fig 5a indicating that the adsorption of pb2 onto the mpac adsorbent was monolayer adsorption the calculated qm values 126 58 mg g 1 at ph 5 and 81 97 mg g 1 at ph 7 of pb2 sorption on mpac were near to the experimental qm values 130 51 mg g 1 at ph 5 and 85 37 mg g 1 at ph 7 moreover the magnitudes of qm for pb2 adsorption onto mpac obtained from the langmuir model process at ph 5 126 58 mg g 1 was higher than that of ph 7 81 97 mg g 1 which indicates that the adsorption significantly depended on the ph of the pb2 solution in which the highest value occurred in a acidic solution the kl parameter was equilibrium constant that visualizes the affinity of the solute toward the adsorbent surface furthermore dimensionless constant called separation factor rl is commonly used to predict whether an adsorption system is favorable or unfavorable the value of rl indicated the adsorption process to be irreversible rl 0 favorable 0 rl 1 linear rl 1 or unfavorable rl 1 the langmuir isotherm separation factor is described as equation 5 in table 3 the separation factors rl were 0 1375 and 0 1347 for ph 5 and ph 7 systems respectively which indicated that the adsorption process was a favorable phenomenon the freundlich isotherm model expresses the heterogeneity of the adsorbent material and the multi layer coverage of the adsorbate freundlich 1906 the freundlich isotherm equation is expressed as equation 6 in table 3 in this equation kf and n are the freundlich constants relating to the adsorption amount and adsorption intensity of the adsorbent respectively the higher value of kf indicates higher adsorption capacity and higher value of n indicates the stronger adsorption bond between the adsorbate and the adsorbent lemraski and sharafinia 2016 wang et al 2010 the freundlich isotherm plot and their parameters of pb2 adsorption onto mpac adsorbent are shown in fig 5b and table 3 respectively considering the r2 value in table 3 it can be clearly seen that the freundlich model fared 0 8541 0 8496 in the experimental data indicating that mpac has a low degree of heterogeneity on the surface in addition the temkin isotherm that is based on the assumption that the heat of adsorption is due to adsorbate adsorbent interactions temkin and pyzhev 1940 was also studied this isotherm is applicable for chemical adsorption on solid adsorbents and liquid adsorbates the linearized mathematical form of isotherm is described as equation 7 in table 3 in this equation kt is the temkin equilibrium isotherm constant l g 1 and b1 is the constant related to the heat of adsorption in exothermic and endothermic adsorption reactions the value of b1 is higher and lower than unity values of kt and b1 were calculated from the plot of qe and ln ce the temkin isotherm plot and their parameters of pb2 adsorption onto mpac adsorbent are shown in fig 4c and table 3 respectively according to r2 values of this plot 0 8682 ph 5 and 0 8730 ph 7 temkin isotherm didn t fit to the experimental data well by linear analysis the reported values of b1 in table 3 indicated that the adsorption of pb2 onto the mpac was an exothermic process moreover the dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm dubinin and radushkevich 1947 that was used for understanding the type of bonding between pb2 and mpac i e physical or chemical was also considered d r isotherm polanyi potential and the mean free energy of adsorption are presented as equations 8 10 in table 3 the kd is a constant which is related to the mean free energy of adsorption per mole of the adsorbate mol2 j 2 and ε is the polanyi potential that is logarithmic function of adsorbate concentration the mean free energy of adsorption e is defined as the free energy change which required when 1 mol of ions is transferred from solution to solid surfaces the value of e can be calculated from kd value when the value of e falls between 8 and 16 kj mol 1 it signifies a chemical ion exchange chemical adsorption is indicated by e values range from 20 to 40 kj mol 1 chaudhry et al 2016 foo and hameed 2012 the d r isotherm plot and their parameters of pb2 adsorption onto mpac adsorbent are shown in fig 5d and table 3 the value of e obtained from ph 5 was 14 16 kj mol 1 indicating that the adsorption process was a chemical ion exchange process while the value of e obtained from ph 7 was 3 77 kj mol 1 which indicates that the adsorption process was actually a physical adsorption process from this result it can be concluded that the adsorption free energy obviously depended on the ph of the solution the adsorption capacities of pb2 ions on to different types of adsorbents are shown in table 4 a comparison of the reported results clearly shows that the capacity of mangosteen peel activated carbon to remove pb2 ions from contaminated water is generally high efficient clearly confirming the capacity of the mpac for metal removal in practical applications 3 4 adsorption kinetics several kinetic models have been proposed to understand the behavior of adsorbents and to study the mechanisms of the adsorption firstly the adsorption rate of the sorbent was analyzed using the pseudo first order rate equation in linear form which is given as follows equation 11 11 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t while the pseudo second order model eq 12 is based on the assumption of chemisorptions of the adsorbate on the adsorbent 12 1 q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k1 min 1 and k2 g mg 1 min 1 are rate constant of pseudo first order and pseudo second order adsorption respectively the kinetic mechanism data were also analyzed using the intra particle diffusion and film diffusion the intra particle diffusion model describes adsorption processes based on sorbate diffuses toward adsorbent as depicted by eq 13 13 q t k d i f t 0 5 c the liquid film diffusion model was further analyzed to investigate whether boundary played a role during the adsorption hameed and daud 2008 the mathematical form of liquid film diffusion model is presented as the following equation 14 14 ln 1 f k f d t where k dif and kfd are the intra particle diffusion and film diffusion rate constant respectively while f qt qe is the fractional attainment of equilibrium the experimental kinetic data were plotted according to the indicated models and it is shown in fig 6 in addition table 5 summarizes the rate constant theoretical and experimental values of qe and r2 values the dramatic difference between the experimental qe exp and theoretical qe qe cal values from first order model indicates that the adsorption of pb2 ions onto mpac does not follow first order kinetics the pseudo second order is suitable to describe the experimental data considering the best correlation with experimental results straighten for the plot fig 6b moreover there was no significant different between the experimental and theoritical qe values when compare with the pseudo first order fig 6a this confirms that in the adsorption process concentrations of both adsorbate pb2 and adsorbent mpac are involved in rate determining step which may be a chemisorption the ph of solution can influence the sorption efficiency by affecting the sorbent surface charge and the interactions between the adsorbate and the adsorbent adsorption efficiency is higher in acidic solutions than those in neutral conditions implying that it makes pb2 more accessible to the inner pores generally the mechanism model is the rate limiting step when the y intercept of the plot passes through the origin and the value of c is near to zero from the intra particle diffusion plotted in fig 6c the liner segment did not pass through the origin so intra particle diffusion was not the rate controlling step wu et al 2009 weber and morris 1976 the film diffusion plotted and their parameters are displayed in fig 6d and table 5 as it is shown in table 5 the y intercept values obtained from the film diffusion plot were near to zero 0 3704 ph 5 and 0 6067 ph 7 suggesting that the film diffusion as a rate determining factor in the adsorption process therefore the film surrounding the pb2 is expected to be thick and it offer resistance during migration of solute ions from liquid phase to the solid mpac surface boyd et al 1974 chaudhry et al 2016 3 5 adsorption thermodynamic beside the adsorption kinetics and equilibrium isotherms studies the adsorption thermodynamic parameters i e gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs are very important parameters to predict and identify the adsorption process huang et al 2014 lemraski and sharafinia 2016 taraba and bulavová 2018 the δh and δs parameters were calculated using the van t hoff equation atkins and de paula 2006 as following equation 15 15 ln k δ h r t δ s r where k is qe ce r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and t is the temperature k then the δg parameter was calculated using the following equation 16 16 δ g δ h t δ s the effect of temperature on sorption of pb2 in the aqueous solution was investigated using a range of 30 40 and 50 c the result shown that the removal efficiency of pb2 decreased when the temperature increased from 30 c to 50 c indicating that the adsorption process was an exothermic one the calculated thermodynamic parameters are listed in table 6 the negative gibbs free energy δg values confirm the spontaneous nature and feasibility of the adsorption process the δg value was found to become less negative with an increase in temperature which indicates that the adsorption process is more favorable towards lower temperatures hence the temperature of 303 k was found to be the more energy favorable for the adsorption of pb2 onto the mpac adsorbent the standard entropy δs and enthalpy change δh for adsorption can be calculated from the slope and intercept of lnq e c e vs 1 t by using the van t hoff plot eq 15 the negative values of δh reflect the exothermic nature and suggest that the adsorption might be physical adsorption and chemical adsorption for ph 7 and ph 5 respectively the δs value was 0 0796 kj mol 1 k 1 and the negative value indicated a decrease in the degree of freedom or disorder of the adsorbed species or showed the affinity of mpac for pb2 in the aqueous solution chaudhry et al 2016 largitte et al 2016 from the results it can be concluded that different ph has a significant effect on the adsorption capacity of pb2 onto mpac 3 6 desorption behavior of pb2 from mpac regeneration of adsorbents for further cycles is important from the economic perspective desorption of pb2 from the mpac was evaluated using hydrochloric acid hcl due to its low cost and high removal efficiency as reported in the literature donbebe et al 2005 in the first desorption cycle the regeneration yield was more than 91 69 and 95 82 for ph 5 and ph 7 respectively when using 0 1 g of mpac and 300 mg l 1 of pb2 concentration within 120 min the removal decreased after the third cycle 60 suggesting the saturation of the desorbent solution to overcome the problem one possibility may be to increase the concentration of the hcl agent 3 7 computational studies for pb2 ion adsorption the intermolecular interaction of gp pb2 0 4 nm mpac pb2 and 0 71 nm mpac pb2 complexes were determined by using dft calculation their geometries were fully optimized by using b3lyp 6 31g d lanl2dz level of theory for comparison three different methods b3lyp m06 and wb97x d3 and basis sets 6 31g d lanl2dz 6 31g d sdd and 6 31g d def2svp were then used for the single point energy calculation of all optimized complex structures the binding energies calculated from the total energies of complex graphene and pb2 for all systems are summarized in table 7 the values that include counterpoise correction are summarized in the parenthesis as seen in table 7 the binding energies obtained from three methods b3lyp m06 and wb97x d3 show the same trend of energies the energy different among for different methods and basis sets are in the range of 7 showing that the choice of method has moderate effect the counterpoise correction is found to be within only 2 for all levels of calculation for the gp pb2 complex the adsorption energies were 440 26 to 483 85 kj mol 1 the high value of adsorption energy showed that the gp pb2 system was in the ion induced dipole forces suggesting that gp was not suitable for pb2 adsorption the adsorption energies of the 0 71 nm mpac model with pb2 ion were 501 23 to 543 55 kj mol 1 indicating that the 0 71 nm mpac model led to higher adsorption efficiency than that of gp model the adsorption of the pb2 ion on the micropore volume of the 0 71mpac model depends on ion dipole interactions between the pb2 ion and carbon atoms at the micropore volume of the 0 71mpac model in addition the 0 71mpac model has a slightly polar structure which facilitates adsorbing the induced pb2 ion that is higher than that of the non polar gp model the adsorption energies of the 0 44 nm mpac model with pb2 ion were 557 88 to 628 63 kj mol 1 indicating the 0 44 nm mpac model led to a higher adsorption than that of the 0 71 nm mpac and gp model this is owning to stronger ion induced dipole interactions between the pb2 ion and the polar carbon on the surface of the 0 44 nm mpac in addition smaller micropore on the surface of the 0 44 nm mpac than that of 0 71 nm mpac led to a more probability of pb2 ion well fit on the 0 44 nm mpac model from the calculation results it can be concluded that both of mpac models led to a better adsorption than that of gp model suggesting that the carbon atoms at micropore of the mpac form ion dipole interactions between the pb2 ion in addition the smaller micropore on the surface of the 0 44 nm mpac led to a better adsorption than that of the 0 71 nm mpac model owning to stronger ion dipole interaction and more probability of pb2 ion fit well on the 0 44 nm mpac model than that of 0 71 nm mpac model the dft results agree well with the experimental results in which the adsorption of pb2 ion on the mpac was highly dependent on the surface area and the micropore size it provides the specific active sites for adsorbing divalent pb atom on the surface in addition the significantly stronger interaction energies of pb2 ion for mpac adsorbent model shows that the mpac pb2 systems were in the chemisorption region these finding well supports the removals of pb2 from aqueous solution system in which the experimental δh value was 61 27 kj mol 1 indicating that the mpac pb2 system led to the chemisorption and affinity of mpac for pb2 in the aqueous solution moreover the results from molecular modeling can be used to understand the system at the molecular level suggesting the development of suitable porous activated carbon material to have a better adsorption for pb2 ions 4 conclusions the maximum adsorption capacity at equilibrium qe of pb2 was 130 51 mg g 1 when ph initial concentration contact time temperature of pb2 solution and the dose of mpac were 5 50 mg l 1 180 min 30 c and 0 1 g respectively the best fit of the experimental data was obtained by the langmuir isotherm indicating the homogeneity of the mpac and monolayer coverage of pb2 onto the mpac adsorbent for the research on adsorption kinetics the pso was proved to be a better model to interpret the adsorption process of pb2 implying that the adsorption was controlled by chemisorption the negative δg values confirm the spontaneous nature and feasibility of the adsorption process the adsorption process was more favorable towards a lower temperature the different ph values had a significant effect on the adsorption capacity of pb2 onto the mpac the δh value were 61 27 and 27 22 kj mol 1 when ph of solutions were ph 5 and ph 7 respectively desorption of pb2 from the mpac was more than 91 69 and 95 82 for ph 5 and ph 7 respectively the result from the dft calculations show that both mpac models have better adsorption than that of gp model indicating the carbon atoms at micropore of the mpac to form ion dipole interactions with the pb2 ions in addition the smaller micropore on the surface of the 0 44 nm mpac has even better adsorption than that of the 0 71 nm mpac model owning to stronger ion dipole interactions and more probability of pb2 ion to fit on the 0 44 nm mpac structure the finding results of the high spontaneous adsorption capability and more probability of pb2 fit well on the 0 44 nm mpac model confirms that the mpac could be successfully used as an excellent adsorbent in water purification declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

11977,heavy metal ion such as lead ii ion pb2 contamination of drinking and waste water is a serious and ongoing problem among available technologies adsorption is here presented as an effective technology the aims of this work were to investigate the adsorption capacity kinetic isotherm thermodynamic and adsorption energy of pb2 by activated carbon ac prepared from mangosteen peel mpac maximum pb2 adsorption equal 130 mg g 1 was achieved when using pb2 concentration of 50 mg l 1 adsorbent dose of 0 67 mg ml 1 ph of 5 contact time of 180 min and temperature of 30 c the isotherm adsorption was found to fit well with the langmuir isotherm the kinetics adsorption behavior go along with the pseudo second order model thermodynamic parameters δg 0 and δh 61 27 kj mol 1 indicate that the adsorption process is spontaneous and exothermic the density functional theory dft calculation was also used to investigate the effect of ac pore size on binding efficiency to pb2 dft calculations revealed that the 0 44 nm micropore ac model has a higher adsorption efficiency than that of the 0 71 nm micropore ac and graphene models due to the stronger ion dipole interaction and suitable pore size for pb2 binding graphical abstract image 1 keywords lead adsorption dft binding energy desorption 1 introduction contamination of soil and water by pb2 released from many industrial activities leads to severe problems in humans it is well known that free pb2 and its compounds can cause lead poisoning mouni et al 2011 noticeably many attempts have been made to remove pb2 from ground and waste water aguayo villarreal et al 2017 lemraski and sharafinia 2016 siddiqui and ahmad 2017 precipitation bhatluri et al 2015 ion exchange peristyy et al 2016 and activated carbon adsorption nieto márquez et al 2017 pap et al 2016 van thuan et al 2017 methods have been applied utilization of activated carbon ac derived from biomass and agricultural wastes as a potential absorbent for heavy metal removal from metal contaminated mediums is of great interest kuroki et al 2019 tan et al 2017 tao et al 2015 this is due to the fact that the derived ac has high porosity and adsorption capacity moreover preparation of ac is cheap and not complicated furthermore reuse and recycle of biomass and agricultural wastes to prepare the derived ac can also reduce wastes from factories and agricultural activities various studies of adsorption of heavy metal ions onto ac have been improved and many types of the derived ac have been proposed for the removal of heavy metal ions ahmad and haseeb 2015 adebisi and alaba 2017 kırbıyık et al 2017 it was revealed that adsorption capacity of ac depends on many factors among them type of the precursor used for ac preparation is the main factor lemraski and sharafinia 2016 among biomass and agricultural wastes mangosteen garcinia mangostana peel mp is one of the best alternative for low cost materials of ac preparation this is because mp has high carbon content and low volatile compounds ahmad and alrozi 2010 in the last few year mangosteen peel activated carbon mpac has been prepared and applied for removal organic dyes zein et al 2010 mangosteen the queen of fruits abundantly available in the south of thailand so that a large amount of mp waste should be transformed to be a value added product in this study mpac was prepared and applied as an adsorbent to remove pb2 from aqueous solution the properties of mangosteen peel charcoal mpc and mpac were analyzed using various experimental techniques such as scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and brunauer emmett teller bet for the study of pb2 adsorption onto mpac the batch experiment was applied to determine effects of adsorbent dosage contact time ph concentration of pb2 and temperature on adsorption activity of mpac the equlibrium kinetics and thermodynamics adsorption of pb2 onto mpac from aqueous solution were also studied additionally structures and adsorption energy of mpac pb2 complexes were imitated using a computational technique the model of mpac was simplified as models of defected graphene sheet in which the 1 carbon and 2 carbon atoms were removed from graphene sheets to perform two size of micropore of mpac models the effect of pore size of defect graphene sheets on pb2 ion adsorption was calculated using dft calculation 2 experimental techniques 2 1 preparation of mpac an amount of mp was taken from chulabhorn district nakhon si thammarat thailand before producing activated carbon mp was first cleaned with tap water and dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h then it was crushed to a particle size of 0 5 1 0 mm subsequently mp was carbonized in a furnace carbolite cwf13 23 at 700 c on a heating rate of 10 c min for 70 min after the first carbonization step the obtained product of mp char was labeled as mpc the mpc was impregnated with zncl2 in a 1 1 mass ratio and activated in a furnace at 600 c for 2 h then the obtained final product was labeled as mpac the mpac was repeatedly washed until its filtrate was neutral the mpac was dried in an oven at 105 c for 3 h to remove moisture production conditions of the activated carbon samples such as impregnation ratio and carbonization temperature which produced the optimum bet specific surface area value the percent yield and pore volume of adsorbents were chosen from the literature ahmad and alrozi 2010 chen et al 2011 foo and hameed 2012 2 2 characterization of mpc and mpac adsorbents the obtained adsorbents were characterized by several techniques the approximate properties of mpc and mpac were analyzed the functional groups of mpc and mpac were analyzed by attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir in the scanning range of 4000 650 cm 1 the sem oxford merlin compact in conjunction with eds oxford aztec was applied for surface morphology and elemental analysis of mpc and mpac adsorbents moreover bet surface area total pore volume and pore diameter distribution of mpc and mpac were measured by nitrogen adsorption isotherm using a micrometrics surface area analyzer micromeritics asap 2010 2 3 phpzc and acidity basicity of mpac surface surface acidity and basicity of mpac was determined using the ph titration technique the initial and final ph of mpac surface in a nacl solution were adjusted ph with naoh and hcl and it was determined using a ph meter ph 720 boehm 1994 plot between initial ph and δph of the solution intersected at the point which is called phpzc chaudhry et al 2016 2 4 batch adsorption experiment the effects of absorbent dosage ph of pb2 solution contact time and initial concentration of pb2 solution on pb2 adsorption capacity of mpac from the aqueous solution were studied and optimized 2 4 1 effects of adsorbent dosage the mpac was soaked in 150 ml of 50 mg l 1 of pb2 solution ph 7 for 180 min at 30 c in a shaker bath at 240 rpm to find out the optimum amount of mpac on pb2 adsorption the weight of mpac was varied in a range of 0 10 0 50 g the initial and final concentrations of pb2 were analyzed by atomic adsorption spectrophotometer aas perkin analyst 700 the percentage of pb2 removed from the solution pb2 removal was calculated using the following equation 1 1 p b 2 r e m o v a l c 0 c e c 0 100 where c 0 and c e are the initial and equilibrium concentrations mg l 1 of pb2 the adsorption capacity at equilibrium q e in mg g 1 of pb2 was calculated using the following equation 2 2 q e c 0 c e w v where w and v are mass of mpac g and volume of the solution l respectively 2 4 2 effects of ph of pb2 solution the effect of ph on the adsorption capacity was observed at a ph level that ranged from 2 0 to 12 0 the ph values of solutions were adjusted using naoh 0 1 mol l 1 and hcl 0 1 mol l 1 solutions the results were obtained using minimum of replicate experiments for each ph value in each ph the mpac 0 10 g in 150 ml of 50 mg l 1 of pb2 solution at 30 c in a shaker bath at 240 rpm for 360 min were carried out the initial and final concentrations of pb2 were analyzed 2 4 3 effects of initial concentration of pb2 solution two sets of tests were done in the same way for the study of topic 2 4 2 except the ph of pb2 solution was assigned to be 5 and 7 in each set the initial concentration of pb2 solutions were varied from 10 to 100 mg l 1 2 4 4 effects of contact time two sets of tests were done in the same way of the study of topic 2 4 3 except the initial concentration of pb2 solution was set at 50 mg l 1 and contact time were assigned to be varied from 0 to 360 min 2 4 5 effects of temperature two sets of tests were done in the same way of the study of topic 2 4 4 except the contact time of pb2 solution was set at 180 min and temperatures were assigned to be varied from 30 to 50 c 2 5 computational method for adsorption of pb2 ion on mpac for finding adsorption energy between pb2 ion and adsorbent model the 4 4 six ring aromatic model structure of graphene gp was used as a simplified gp model this is because it is the most stable model based on the shokuhi rad and pouralijan foukolaei shokuhi rad and pouralijan foukolaei 2015 and rattanapan et al rattanaphan et al 2020 studies the pore size of the mpac model was set as micropore according to the experimental result obtained from the bet technique the two structures of mpac were prepared by removing one and two carbon atoms from the gp model they were then optimized to obtain pore volume of 0 44 and 0 71 nm for one and two carbon atoms removed structures respectively the graphene model structures 4 4 gp 0 44 nm mpac and 0 71 nm mpac were taken for the calculations the complex structures were modeled by placing pb2 ion at the center and perpendicular to the optimized graphene structure as shown in fig 1 the complex structures were fully optimized by using b3lyp calculation at the 6 31g d level of theory an effective core potential ecp basis set lanl2dz was used for pb2 ion the binding energies for optimized pb2 adsorbent complex models were then calculated using b3lyp m06 and wb97x d3 methods at 6 31g d level of theory for oxygen carbon and hydrogen atoms while lanl2dz and def2 svp basis sets were used for pb2 ion the binding energies were corrected by basis set superposition error bsse using the counterpoise correction cp all calculations were performed using the orca package neese 2012 the binding energy e bind between the optimized adsorbed pb2 ion and the adsorbent models gp 0 44 nm mpac and 0 71 nm mpac is defined as eq 3 3 ebind ecpx eadsorbent epb 2 where the e cpx is total energy of the complex adsorbed adsorbent e adsorbent the total energy of adsorbent model and e pb 2 the total energy of pb2 ion 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of adsorbent 3 1 1 element and surface characteristics analyses the carbon content can affect the suitability of raw materials high carbon content and low other values such as moisture and volatile matter indicate a good quality of adsorbents liu et al 2010 the results of element analysis of mpc and mpac is displayed in table 1 the eds results revealed that the carbon content of mpac is higher than that of the mpc this means that zncl2 activator treatment process for mpac preparation is applicable hence causing to increase graphitization after the zncl2 activation along with carbonization whereas the other element content k s and cl of mpc and mpac were not significantly different while the oxygen content of mpac was dominantly decreased due to the removal of the volatile compound after zncl2 activation along with carbonization the eds results of this study were supported by ahmad ma et al study ahmad and alrozi 2010 a scanning electron microscope sem is used to study the surface characteristics and morphological features of the adsorbents sem photographs of mpc and mpac were observed for visualizing their surface structures the mpc surface fig 2 shows a fairly smooth surface with few cracks and voids the mpac surface had more porous structures formed than that of the mpc sample from the results it can be concluded that the material impregnated with zncl2 after carbonization enhanced the porous structure more than that of the material produced only by using carbonization generally the adsorption capacity is related to the specific surface area and pore volume of the adsorbents the pore volume affects the size while the surface area affects the amount of adsorbed molecules gao et al 2017 the bet method was used to investigate the porous structural parameters of adsorbents the bet surface area sbet m2 g 1 the microsurface area smicr m2 g 1 the mesosurface area smeso m2 g 1 the total pore volume vt cm3 g 1 the micropore volume vmicr cm3 g 1 the mesopore volume vmeso cm3 g 1 and average pore diameter nm of mpc and mpac are listed in table 2 the bet surface area of mpac and mpc were 423 99 m2 g 1 and 45 31 m2 g 1 while the pore volume of mpac and mpc were 0 22 cm3 g 1 and 0 02 cm3 g 1 respectively the average pore diameter of mpc slightly larger than that of mpac sample nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms for mpc and mpac are also considered and plotted in fig 3a the adsorption desorption isotherm of mpac is similar to type i and iv isotherms indicating structure between a microporous and a mesoporous brunauer et al 1938 the micropore of mpac was about 59 09 of the total pore volume with a well developed porous structure gundogdu et al 2013 foo and hameed 2012 noticeably all porous structural parameters of mpac were higher than those of mpc these results imply that the surface modification of mpc via a thermal chemical process used in this study was effective 3 1 2 ftir analysis and phzpc of the adsorbents the ftir spectra of mp precursor and mpac are displayed in fig 3 b it was observed that the spectra of mp raw material and mpac had a significantly different in appearance for mp which was not subjected to heat treatment contains especially volatile compounds with functional groups such as hydroxyls phenols esters and ethers from agricultural residues composed of cellulose hemicelluloses and lignin zielke et al 1996 the wide absorbance band centered at ca 3255 cm 1 correspond to o h stretching of hydroxyl groups gaikwad and balomajumder 2017 the weak band at about 2911 cm 1 and the weak to medium band at 1344 cm 1 could be ascribed to the asymmetric c h stretching and c h bending respectively of methylene and methyl groups the very broadband at 2100 cm 1 correspond to cc cm 1 stretching of alkyne groups the strong peak at 1690 and 1505 cm 1 could be attributed to the stretching vibration of cc and co in organic matter kongnoo et al 2016 the strong band at 1027 cm 1 is ascribed to stretching vibration of c n and c o stretching vibrations some spectra of mpac such as o h c h cc and co became weaker than that of mp precursor however after zncl2 activation the band at 2100 cm 1 and 1920 that are ascribed to cc and c n cm 1 vibrations are more intense than that of mp gurten et al 2012 in like manner with the absorption band in the range of 1300 900 cm 1 region is ascribed to c n and c o stretching kongnoo et al 2016 this result indicated that the volatile compounds of organic matter of mp decomposed and the graphitization of mpac increased after the zncl2 activation along with carbonization the phzpc of a solid sample is the ph at which the charge on the surface of the solid is zero chaudhry et al 2016 as shown in fig 2c the p phzpc of mpac is equal to 6 the surface of the mpac become negative and positive charges when the ph less than 6 and more than 6 respectively therefore knowledge of this value helps to guide the discussion on adsorption results this means that in an acidic solution the negative charges of the mpac surface make it bind tightly with pb2 ions due to the electrostatic interaction the experimental results obtained from the elemental analysis ftir spectrum porous structure parameters and sem image of mpac prepared in this study as described above indicated that mpac is suitable to use as an adsorbent 3 2 adsorption of pb2 by mpac adsorbent results of the study of the effects of adsorbent dosage ph of pb2 solution initial concentration of pb2 solution and contact time on pb2 adsorption by mpac adsorbent are displayed in fig 4 a d respectively 3 2 1 influence of adsorbent dosage the adsorbent dosage is an important parameter in adsorption studies because it determines the capacity of adsorbents for a given initial concentration fig 4a presents the effect of the adsorbent dosage on the adsorption of the pb2 by varying the amount of mpac from 0 1 to 0 5 g at fixed time of 180 min ph value of 7 temperature of 30 c and initial concentration of 20 mg l 1 it was observed that the amount of pb2 adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbent q decreased when increasing the adsorbent dose while the removal percentage of pb2 by mpac slightly increased this can be attributed to increase in total adsorbent surface area and availability of more adsorption sites by increasing adsorbent dosage jribi et al 2017 ghasemi et al 2015 further increments of mpac adsorbent did not have much of an affect for pb2 removal due to the limited availability of pb2 adsorbate around the adsorbent jribi et al 2017 this suggests that using 0 1 g of mpac can yield a high value of q and pb2 removal 3 2 2 influence of initial ph the removal of pb2 from an aqueous solution is dependent on ph fig 4b the adsorption experiments were conducted in the initial ph range of 2 12 the maximum adsorption capacity of mpac was obtained at ph 5 there was a slight decrease in the adsorption when the ph of pb2 solution was increased to 7 the adsorption of pb2 at ph 2 was low and this could be due to competition of h or h3o ions in the medium at low ph both metal ions and h or h3o ions reacted with the mpac surface lemraski and sharafinia 2016 saeed et al 2005 which led to the decrease in the adsorption yield of mpac surface and pb2 however as the ph increased the adsorption capacity also increased until a ph value around of 6 as the effect of the acidic solution was reduced at higher ph values the adsorption capacity was slightly decreased may be due to the precipitation of metal hydroxides huang et al 2014 mouni et al 2011 wang et al 2010 under neutral conditions mpac displayed very high pb2 adsorption efficiency thus at ph values of 5 and 7 were used as the optimum ph value throughout the tests 3 2 3 influence of initial concentration the initial concentration of pb2 in the aqueous solution one of the affecting parameters for adsorption was investigated using a range of 10 20 30 40 50 80 and 100 mg l 1 of pb2 ion solution see fig 4c for both ph 5 and ph 7 the adsorption capacities increased with an increase in the initial concentration from 10 to 50 mg l 1 but it remained constant when the initial concentration was from 50 to 100 mg l 1 at low initial solution concentration the surface area and the availability of adsorption sites were relatively high so the pb2 ions were easily adsorbed and removed at higher initial solution concentration the total available adsorption sites are limited resulting decrease in the adsorption capacity of pb2 ions noticeably the pb2 solution at ph 5 gave the better adsorption capacity than that of ph 7 it is known that lead species in water solution could be present in the forms of pb2 pb oh pb oh 2 and pb oh 3 at different ph values deliyanni et al 2012 it is expected that the predominant species at ph 5 was pb2 deliyanni et al 2012 so that there was an attractive the force between the adsorbent and the adsorbate 3 2 4 influence of contact time in this work the effect of contact time was studied using a function of time in the range of 5 360 min at a constant adsorbent dose of 0 1 g l 1 and pb2 solutions at ph of 5 and 7 the amount of pb2 adsorbed by the mpac was determined with initial concentrations of pb2 20 mg l 1 the effect of contact time on the adsorption capacity of mpac is depicted in fig 4d it is obviously seen that there was a rapid uptake of pb2 within the first 30 min for both pb2 solutions at ph of 5 and 7 this fast uptake is due to the abundance of free binding sites as illustrated in fig 4d the apparent adsorption equilibrium was usually established within 180 min and no significant change in the amount of pb2 adsorbed after 360 min equilibrium was due to the saturation of the active site and slow pore diffusion at which time further adsorption could not take place huang et al 2014 semerjian 2010 consequently the contact time was set to 180 min in the following experiments to ensure adsorption equilibrium 3 3 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms provide information about the capacity of the adsorbent and the nature of solute sorbent interaction moreover the isotherm constant values are essential to predict the maximum adsorption capacity describe the affinity and surface properties of the adsorbent in the present work the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich isotherms were used to analyze the experimental equilibrium data all plots of isotherms are displayed in fig 5 the langmuir model is based on the assumption that there is monolayer coverage of adsorbate on a homogenous adsorbent surface langmuir 1918 the langmuir isotherm equation is expressed as equation 4 in table 3 in this equation qm represents the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of adsorbent mg g 1 and kl represents the langmuir adsorption constant l mg 1 the langmuir isotherm plot and their parameters of pb2 adsorption onto mpac adsorbent are shown in fig 5a and table 3 respectively the applicability of isotherm equation is compared on the basis of correlation coefficients r2 the best fit of the experimental data was obtained by the langmuir isotherm fig 5a indicating that the adsorption of pb2 onto the mpac adsorbent was monolayer adsorption the calculated qm values 126 58 mg g 1 at ph 5 and 81 97 mg g 1 at ph 7 of pb2 sorption on mpac were near to the experimental qm values 130 51 mg g 1 at ph 5 and 85 37 mg g 1 at ph 7 moreover the magnitudes of qm for pb2 adsorption onto mpac obtained from the langmuir model process at ph 5 126 58 mg g 1 was higher than that of ph 7 81 97 mg g 1 which indicates that the adsorption significantly depended on the ph of the pb2 solution in which the highest value occurred in a acidic solution the kl parameter was equilibrium constant that visualizes the affinity of the solute toward the adsorbent surface furthermore dimensionless constant called separation factor rl is commonly used to predict whether an adsorption system is favorable or unfavorable the value of rl indicated the adsorption process to be irreversible rl 0 favorable 0 rl 1 linear rl 1 or unfavorable rl 1 the langmuir isotherm separation factor is described as equation 5 in table 3 the separation factors rl were 0 1375 and 0 1347 for ph 5 and ph 7 systems respectively which indicated that the adsorption process was a favorable phenomenon the freundlich isotherm model expresses the heterogeneity of the adsorbent material and the multi layer coverage of the adsorbate freundlich 1906 the freundlich isotherm equation is expressed as equation 6 in table 3 in this equation kf and n are the freundlich constants relating to the adsorption amount and adsorption intensity of the adsorbent respectively the higher value of kf indicates higher adsorption capacity and higher value of n indicates the stronger adsorption bond between the adsorbate and the adsorbent lemraski and sharafinia 2016 wang et al 2010 the freundlich isotherm plot and their parameters of pb2 adsorption onto mpac adsorbent are shown in fig 5b and table 3 respectively considering the r2 value in table 3 it can be clearly seen that the freundlich model fared 0 8541 0 8496 in the experimental data indicating that mpac has a low degree of heterogeneity on the surface in addition the temkin isotherm that is based on the assumption that the heat of adsorption is due to adsorbate adsorbent interactions temkin and pyzhev 1940 was also studied this isotherm is applicable for chemical adsorption on solid adsorbents and liquid adsorbates the linearized mathematical form of isotherm is described as equation 7 in table 3 in this equation kt is the temkin equilibrium isotherm constant l g 1 and b1 is the constant related to the heat of adsorption in exothermic and endothermic adsorption reactions the value of b1 is higher and lower than unity values of kt and b1 were calculated from the plot of qe and ln ce the temkin isotherm plot and their parameters of pb2 adsorption onto mpac adsorbent are shown in fig 4c and table 3 respectively according to r2 values of this plot 0 8682 ph 5 and 0 8730 ph 7 temkin isotherm didn t fit to the experimental data well by linear analysis the reported values of b1 in table 3 indicated that the adsorption of pb2 onto the mpac was an exothermic process moreover the dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm dubinin and radushkevich 1947 that was used for understanding the type of bonding between pb2 and mpac i e physical or chemical was also considered d r isotherm polanyi potential and the mean free energy of adsorption are presented as equations 8 10 in table 3 the kd is a constant which is related to the mean free energy of adsorption per mole of the adsorbate mol2 j 2 and ε is the polanyi potential that is logarithmic function of adsorbate concentration the mean free energy of adsorption e is defined as the free energy change which required when 1 mol of ions is transferred from solution to solid surfaces the value of e can be calculated from kd value when the value of e falls between 8 and 16 kj mol 1 it signifies a chemical ion exchange chemical adsorption is indicated by e values range from 20 to 40 kj mol 1 chaudhry et al 2016 foo and hameed 2012 the d r isotherm plot and their parameters of pb2 adsorption onto mpac adsorbent are shown in fig 5d and table 3 the value of e obtained from ph 5 was 14 16 kj mol 1 indicating that the adsorption process was a chemical ion exchange process while the value of e obtained from ph 7 was 3 77 kj mol 1 which indicates that the adsorption process was actually a physical adsorption process from this result it can be concluded that the adsorption free energy obviously depended on the ph of the solution the adsorption capacities of pb2 ions on to different types of adsorbents are shown in table 4 a comparison of the reported results clearly shows that the capacity of mangosteen peel activated carbon to remove pb2 ions from contaminated water is generally high efficient clearly confirming the capacity of the mpac for metal removal in practical applications 3 4 adsorption kinetics several kinetic models have been proposed to understand the behavior of adsorbents and to study the mechanisms of the adsorption firstly the adsorption rate of the sorbent was analyzed using the pseudo first order rate equation in linear form which is given as follows equation 11 11 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t while the pseudo second order model eq 12 is based on the assumption of chemisorptions of the adsorbate on the adsorbent 12 1 q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k1 min 1 and k2 g mg 1 min 1 are rate constant of pseudo first order and pseudo second order adsorption respectively the kinetic mechanism data were also analyzed using the intra particle diffusion and film diffusion the intra particle diffusion model describes adsorption processes based on sorbate diffuses toward adsorbent as depicted by eq 13 13 q t k d i f t 0 5 c the liquid film diffusion model was further analyzed to investigate whether boundary played a role during the adsorption hameed and daud 2008 the mathematical form of liquid film diffusion model is presented as the following equation 14 14 ln 1 f k f d t where k dif and kfd are the intra particle diffusion and film diffusion rate constant respectively while f qt qe is the fractional attainment of equilibrium the experimental kinetic data were plotted according to the indicated models and it is shown in fig 6 in addition table 5 summarizes the rate constant theoretical and experimental values of qe and r2 values the dramatic difference between the experimental qe exp and theoretical qe qe cal values from first order model indicates that the adsorption of pb2 ions onto mpac does not follow first order kinetics the pseudo second order is suitable to describe the experimental data considering the best correlation with experimental results straighten for the plot fig 6b moreover there was no significant different between the experimental and theoritical qe values when compare with the pseudo first order fig 6a this confirms that in the adsorption process concentrations of both adsorbate pb2 and adsorbent mpac are involved in rate determining step which may be a chemisorption the ph of solution can influence the sorption efficiency by affecting the sorbent surface charge and the interactions between the adsorbate and the adsorbent adsorption efficiency is higher in acidic solutions than those in neutral conditions implying that it makes pb2 more accessible to the inner pores generally the mechanism model is the rate limiting step when the y intercept of the plot passes through the origin and the value of c is near to zero from the intra particle diffusion plotted in fig 6c the liner segment did not pass through the origin so intra particle diffusion was not the rate controlling step wu et al 2009 weber and morris 1976 the film diffusion plotted and their parameters are displayed in fig 6d and table 5 as it is shown in table 5 the y intercept values obtained from the film diffusion plot were near to zero 0 3704 ph 5 and 0 6067 ph 7 suggesting that the film diffusion as a rate determining factor in the adsorption process therefore the film surrounding the pb2 is expected to be thick and it offer resistance during migration of solute ions from liquid phase to the solid mpac surface boyd et al 1974 chaudhry et al 2016 3 5 adsorption thermodynamic beside the adsorption kinetics and equilibrium isotherms studies the adsorption thermodynamic parameters i e gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs are very important parameters to predict and identify the adsorption process huang et al 2014 lemraski and sharafinia 2016 taraba and bulavová 2018 the δh and δs parameters were calculated using the van t hoff equation atkins and de paula 2006 as following equation 15 15 ln k δ h r t δ s r where k is qe ce r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and t is the temperature k then the δg parameter was calculated using the following equation 16 16 δ g δ h t δ s the effect of temperature on sorption of pb2 in the aqueous solution was investigated using a range of 30 40 and 50 c the result shown that the removal efficiency of pb2 decreased when the temperature increased from 30 c to 50 c indicating that the adsorption process was an exothermic one the calculated thermodynamic parameters are listed in table 6 the negative gibbs free energy δg values confirm the spontaneous nature and feasibility of the adsorption process the δg value was found to become less negative with an increase in temperature which indicates that the adsorption process is more favorable towards lower temperatures hence the temperature of 303 k was found to be the more energy favorable for the adsorption of pb2 onto the mpac adsorbent the standard entropy δs and enthalpy change δh for adsorption can be calculated from the slope and intercept of lnq e c e vs 1 t by using the van t hoff plot eq 15 the negative values of δh reflect the exothermic nature and suggest that the adsorption might be physical adsorption and chemical adsorption for ph 7 and ph 5 respectively the δs value was 0 0796 kj mol 1 k 1 and the negative value indicated a decrease in the degree of freedom or disorder of the adsorbed species or showed the affinity of mpac for pb2 in the aqueous solution chaudhry et al 2016 largitte et al 2016 from the results it can be concluded that different ph has a significant effect on the adsorption capacity of pb2 onto mpac 3 6 desorption behavior of pb2 from mpac regeneration of adsorbents for further cycles is important from the economic perspective desorption of pb2 from the mpac was evaluated using hydrochloric acid hcl due to its low cost and high removal efficiency as reported in the literature donbebe et al 2005 in the first desorption cycle the regeneration yield was more than 91 69 and 95 82 for ph 5 and ph 7 respectively when using 0 1 g of mpac and 300 mg l 1 of pb2 concentration within 120 min the removal decreased after the third cycle 60 suggesting the saturation of the desorbent solution to overcome the problem one possibility may be to increase the concentration of the hcl agent 3 7 computational studies for pb2 ion adsorption the intermolecular interaction of gp pb2 0 4 nm mpac pb2 and 0 71 nm mpac pb2 complexes were determined by using dft calculation their geometries were fully optimized by using b3lyp 6 31g d lanl2dz level of theory for comparison three different methods b3lyp m06 and wb97x d3 and basis sets 6 31g d lanl2dz 6 31g d sdd and 6 31g d def2svp were then used for the single point energy calculation of all optimized complex structures the binding energies calculated from the total energies of complex graphene and pb2 for all systems are summarized in table 7 the values that include counterpoise correction are summarized in the parenthesis as seen in table 7 the binding energies obtained from three methods b3lyp m06 and wb97x d3 show the same trend of energies the energy different among for different methods and basis sets are in the range of 7 showing that the choice of method has moderate effect the counterpoise correction is found to be within only 2 for all levels of calculation for the gp pb2 complex the adsorption energies were 440 26 to 483 85 kj mol 1 the high value of adsorption energy showed that the gp pb2 system was in the ion induced dipole forces suggesting that gp was not suitable for pb2 adsorption the adsorption energies of the 0 71 nm mpac model with pb2 ion were 501 23 to 543 55 kj mol 1 indicating that the 0 71 nm mpac model led to higher adsorption efficiency than that of gp model the adsorption of the pb2 ion on the micropore volume of the 0 71mpac model depends on ion dipole interactions between the pb2 ion and carbon atoms at the micropore volume of the 0 71mpac model in addition the 0 71mpac model has a slightly polar structure which facilitates adsorbing the induced pb2 ion that is higher than that of the non polar gp model the adsorption energies of the 0 44 nm mpac model with pb2 ion were 557 88 to 628 63 kj mol 1 indicating the 0 44 nm mpac model led to a higher adsorption than that of the 0 71 nm mpac and gp model this is owning to stronger ion induced dipole interactions between the pb2 ion and the polar carbon on the surface of the 0 44 nm mpac in addition smaller micropore on the surface of the 0 44 nm mpac than that of 0 71 nm mpac led to a more probability of pb2 ion well fit on the 0 44 nm mpac model from the calculation results it can be concluded that both of mpac models led to a better adsorption than that of gp model suggesting that the carbon atoms at micropore of the mpac form ion dipole interactions between the pb2 ion in addition the smaller micropore on the surface of the 0 44 nm mpac led to a better adsorption than that of the 0 71 nm mpac model owning to stronger ion dipole interaction and more probability of pb2 ion fit well on the 0 44 nm mpac model than that of 0 71 nm mpac model the dft results agree well with the experimental results in which the adsorption of pb2 ion on the mpac was highly dependent on the surface area and the micropore size it provides the specific active sites for adsorbing divalent pb atom on the surface in addition the significantly stronger interaction energies of pb2 ion for mpac adsorbent model shows that the mpac pb2 systems were in the chemisorption region these finding well supports the removals of pb2 from aqueous solution system in which the experimental δh value was 61 27 kj mol 1 indicating that the mpac pb2 system led to the chemisorption and affinity of mpac for pb2 in the aqueous solution moreover the results from molecular modeling can be used to understand the system at the molecular level suggesting the development of suitable porous activated carbon material to have a better adsorption for pb2 ions 4 conclusions the maximum adsorption capacity at equilibrium qe of pb2 was 130 51 mg g 1 when ph initial concentration contact time temperature of pb2 solution and the dose of mpac were 5 50 mg l 1 180 min 30 c and 0 1 g respectively the best fit of the experimental data was obtained by the langmuir isotherm indicating the homogeneity of the mpac and monolayer coverage of pb2 onto the mpac adsorbent for the research on adsorption kinetics the pso was proved to be a better model to interpret the adsorption process of pb2 implying that the adsorption was controlled by chemisorption the negative δg values confirm the spontaneous nature and feasibility of the adsorption process the adsorption process was more favorable towards a lower temperature the different ph values had a significant effect on the adsorption capacity of pb2 onto the mpac the δh value were 61 27 and 27 22 kj mol 1 when ph of solutions were ph 5 and ph 7 respectively desorption of pb2 from the mpac was more than 91 69 and 95 82 for ph 5 and ph 7 respectively the result from the dft calculations show that both mpac models have better adsorption than that of gp model indicating the carbon atoms at micropore of the mpac to form ion dipole interactions with the pb2 ions in addition the smaller micropore on the surface of the 0 44 nm mpac has even better adsorption than that of the 0 71 nm mpac model owning to stronger ion dipole interactions and more probability of pb2 ion to fit on the 0 44 nm mpac structure the finding results of the high spontaneous adsorption capability and more probability of pb2 fit well on the 0 44 nm mpac model confirms that the mpac could be successfully used as an excellent adsorbent in water purification declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

11978,mining of gold in the welkom and virginia areas of the free state province in south africa has produced numerous gold mine tailings which contain a variety of contaminants the extent of contamination of groundwater in the area was studied by measuring several water quality indicators at eight sampling sites and within three zones the overall contamination of groundwater was quantified by computing a drinking water quality index wqi the results revealed that majority of the groundwater in the welkom and virginia areas is unsuitable for drinking as confirmed by high wqis at only three sites was the water samples suitable for drinking one site revealed water to be of very poor quality while the remainder 40 of the sites indicated water to be of poor quality the high indicator microbiological counts also affirmed the poor quality of the groundwater faecal coliform bacterial counts were 100 non compliant to drinking water quality limits when compared to the world health organization and south african national standard on drinking water 241 while e coli counts exceeded both the drinking water quality limits at 50 of the sampling sites of the potential harmful elements analysed pb and fe were found to be at toxic levels for pb 40 of the water samples exceeded the drinking water quality limits while 63 of water samples were non compliant for fe this result exposes the poor quality of the groundwater in the welkom and virginia areas which poses a serious threat to the health of the local people as groundwater is their primary source of drinking water this research highlights the urgent need for mitigation measures to be introduced by the local authorities to improve the quality of the groundwater in the study area graphical abstract image 1 keywords contamination gold mine tailing microorganism potential harmful element water quality index water quality 1 introduction over the past century mining has been the backbone of south africa s economy gold mining brought about widespread employment wealth and contributed to the development of several sectors in the south african economy durand 2012 these sectors include the development of infrastructure and the establishment of manufacturing and service industries durand 2012 the rapid growing gold mining industry brought south africa to the forefront as one of the most industrialised countries in africa the mining of gold ore from the earth s crust and its processing produces large quantities of waste by products lottermoser 2010 kossoff et al 2014 in most instances a larger proportion of the gold ores extracted end up as waste material kossoff et al 2014 the mining waste by products are collected and accumulated in tailings on the surface of the earth in the vicinity of the gold mines gold mine tailings contain several different types of contaminants some of these contaminants originate from the gold containing ore while others are added to the tailings during the chemical separation of gold from its ore lottermoser 2010 kossoff et al 2014 contaminants that originate from the gold containing ore include the mineral pyrite iron disulfide which is an acid producing rock as well as chemicals which are described as potentially harmful elements phes such as mercury hg arsenic as cadmium cd and lead pb ngure et al 2014 mercury and cyanide cn can also be added to mine tailings during the chemical processing of gold ores nkuba et al 2019 gold containing ores also contain small quantities of other phes described as micro elements which include cobalt co copper cu chromium cr nickel ni iron fe manganese mn molybdenum mo selenium se and zinc zn abdul wahab and marikar 2012 these contaminants from gold mine tailings as well as mining activities have caused environmental pollution and impact the health of humans living in the vicinity of such mining activities wahl et al 2013 wu et al 2014 the contaminants in gold mine tailings are dispersed into the environment by wind rainwater runoff and surface water flow when rainwater percolates through gold mine tailings sulfur bearing pyrite reacts with water and air to form sulfuric acid and ferrous sulfate hansen 2015 kinna 2016 the acid effluent further dissolves phes into ground or surface water bodies and soils in the area hansen 2015 kinna 2016 wind blows dust and particulate matter containing contaminants from gold mine tailings over long distances which eventually settle on soil water bodies and plant leaves within the vicinity of the gold mine tailings castillo et al 2013 stovern et al 2016 humans and other living organisms at higher levels of the food chain are at risk if they consume contaminated water and plants contaminated with the non biodegradable phes islam et

health organization who as human carcinogens of major public health concern kamunda et al 2016 ingestion of these phes even at trace levels may be lethal tchounwou et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 welkom and virginia are the major gold mining towns in the lejweleputswa district municipality and of the mathjabeng local municipality mlm area in the free state province of south africa welkom and virginia are surrounded by some of the largest gold fields in the free state with mining of gold being the dominant economic activity in the area gold mining in this area has produced numerous gold mine tailings which may contain a variety of different contaminants kamunda et al 2016 such contaminants may cause extensive pollution to soils and surface water in the area orimoloye ololade 2020a 2020b in addition the contaminants from the gold mine tailings may also leach into groundwater keesstra et al 2012 thereby causing the contamination of this water source which is often used as a drinking water source in the area extensive agricultural activities such as food crop cultivation and livestock farming are also performed in the welkom and virginia area food crop farms in the area mainly grow commercial maize corn in extensive fields the local people who work on these farms live in small farming communities in the area and they do not have any portable water supply groundwater abstraction from boreholes is the only source of water for drinking and domestic purposes in the area additionally these groundwater sources do not receive any form of treatment before drinking which makes it a source that may have been exposed to harmful contaminants the aim of this study was to investigate the extent of contamination of the groundwater by contaminants from gold mine tailings at eight sampling sites in and around the welkom and virginia area several indicators of contamination were used in this study to quantify the pollution condition of the groundwater sources these indicators included physical and microbiological water quality properties as well as potential harmful elements phes in water an overall level of the contamination of the different water samples was also determined by calculating a drinking water quality index wqi using the different water quality measurements 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is in and around the welkom and virginia area of matjhabeng local municipality mlm in the lejweleputswa district municipality the welkom and virginia areas are situated in the north eastern part of the free state province about 250 km south of johannesburg and 140 km north east of bloemfontein the province s capital fig 1 the study area is characterised by a warm temperate summer rainfall climate with an annual average precipitation of 530 mm while the winters are dry green door environmental 2013 high summer temperatures are prevalent with average monthly temperatures of 17 oc in the summer and 5 oc in the winter 2 2 criteria for selection of zones and sampling sites three zones were selected in the welkom and virginia area to study the extent of pollution of groundwater as well as to confirm if mine tailings were the dominant source of contamination in the area within these three zones eight groundwater sampling sites were identified from which groundwater contamination was examined the three zones were selected based on distances from the mine tailings and mines other anthropogenic activities such as industries and agricultural activities in the area and the prevailing wind direction in the area zone 1 contained sampling sites f1 and f2 and the zone was positioned on the western side of welkom about 5 km from where mining is practiced in the welkom and virginia area this mining area contains numerous gold mine tailings therefore the area was described as the highly dense mine tailing area zone 2 was positioned about 5 7 km beyond the highly dense mine tailing area occupying the western side of virginia as well as the south southwest border of the highly dense mine tailing area the third zone zone 3 did not contain mine tailings or mining activities but these sites were located approximately 7 km 10 km east of the highly dense mine tailing area sampling sites in zone 1 and zone 2 were situated in the downstream direction of the prevailing wind in the welkom area whereas the control sites in zone 3 were positioned in the upstream direction of the prevailing wind in the area 2 3 collection of water samples water samples were collected according to the procedure in the sampling guide of the water research commission of south africa wrc 2017 water samples were collected from the eight groundwater sampling sites that were identified in the three zones in june of 2018 which is the winter season in the study area at each sampling site a water sample was collected from a borehole tap and then used for the measurement of turbidity water ph temperature electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do water samples were also collected for the measurement of phes and the presence of indicator microorganisms in the water in this study the number of faecal coliform bacteria was counted to indicate the total bacterial load in the drinking water as well as the number of escherichia coli e coli to determine the degree of pollution of water from faecal matter who 2018 for the measurement of the water quality properties on site water samples were collected in a 100 ml beaker from the borehole tap while for the measurement of phes water samples were collected in a 1 l bottle prior to the collection of a water sample destined for the measurement of the presence of the indicator microorganisms the borehole tap was flamed then opened and allowed to run for at least 3 min after which a water sample was collected in sterile 100 ml sampling bottle all sample bottles destined for the measurement of phes and microorganisms were clearly labelled with site number time and date of collection and then placed in a cooler box containing ice these sample bottles were then transported to the water laboratory at the central university of technology bloemfontein free state cut where the water samples were kept at 4 oc in the refrigerator until analysis 3 measurement of physical and microbial water quality properties the water ph temperature ec and do of the water samples were measured at each of the eight groundwater sampling sites while the microbiological properties were measured in the laboratory at a sampling site turbidity was measured with a calibrated battery operated hach 2100q turbidity meter following the standard analytical procedures of the instrument the water ph temperature ec and do of the water samples were measured using a battery operated hach hqd hand held meter according to the analytical procedures of the instrument the number of faecal coliform bacteria and number of e coli were counted using the colilert 18 quanti tray method iso 9308 2 2012 according to the manufacturer s specifications colilert quanti tray idexx laboratories inc united states colilert 18 powder was poured into each water sample in the bottle which was then shaken for a few minutes until the powder had dissolved once the colilert 18 powder had dissolved the solution was poured into the 97 well colilert 18 quanti traytm2000 tray which was heat sealed and incubated at 37 c for 20 h in natural light the wells would appear yellow if faecal coliform bacteria were present in contrast if e coli were present in the water sample the wells would fluoresce blue when placed under uv light kinzelman et al 2005 the number of colony forming units cfu of faecal coliform bacteria and e coli present in 100 ml of water was determined using the quanti tray 2000 most probable number mpn table 3 1 measurement of potential harmful elements the twelve phes as cd pb co cr cu fe ni se zn ca and mg were measured using the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes the measurements were performed at the school of chemistry and physics university of kwa zulu natal westville campus prior to elemental analysis the water samples were digested using open vessel digestion in nitric acid hno3 the procedure that was followed for the measurements of the phes as well as the digestion procedures for the water samples were according to kisten et al 2015 digests were filtered through whatman no 1 filter papers into 25 ml volumetric flasks diluted to the mark with double distilled water and then stored in polyethylene bottles for analysis for quality control purposes three digests were performed for each water sample to validate the digestion method for each phe measured in this study a standard was also prepared to establish the accuracy and precision of the test method 3 2 measurement of overall groundwater quality the drinking water quality of the groundwater samples was determined by computing a water quality index wqi proposed by rakotondrabe et al 2017 using the physical and chemical measurements of the groundwater samples the drinking wqi proposed by rakotondrabe et al 2017 was most appropriate for use to compute the wqi in this study based upon the fact that it only allowed for single set of measurement and it was also relatively easy to compute a wqi integrates measurements of different water quality properties into a single value that describes the overall quality of the water at a particular sampling site kannel et al 2007 nikoo et al 2011 to compute the wqi three physical water quality properties and the measurements of five phes were selected based on their impact to water quality and human health rakotondrabe et al 2017 the three physical water quality properties were turbidity ph and ec the five phes cu fe pb ca and mg were selected because their concentrations were above the instrument detection limit at more than 50 of the sampling sites three main factors were computed in the determination of a wqi for a particular sampling site relative weight wi quality rating qi and sub index of the ith property sii according to the procedure of rakotondrabe et al 2017 for the calculation of w i weights ranging between 1 and 5 were assigned to each water quality property based on the impact of each property on water quality as well as the harm that each of the water quality property may cause to human health for example a weight of two was assigned to a water quality property that may not have significant effect on water quality as well as human health but a weight of five was assigned when a water quality property can cause severe contamination to water and cause critical health implications to humans table 1 w i was computed according to the equation below 1 w i w i i 1 n w i where w i is the relative weight w i is weight of each property n is the number of properties for the calculation of q i the concentration of each water quality property was divided by its limit according to the south african national standard on drinking water sans 241 2015 as the standard contained most of the water quality properties that were used in computing the wqi but for ca and mg which did not have limits in sans 241 the who 2018 drinking water limit was used more so where the limit in sans 241 and who was a range the middle number was used sans 241 2015 who 2018 2 q i c i s i 100 where q i is quality rating c i is concentration of each water quality property and si is the drinking water quality standard for each water quality property the product of the relative weights and the quality rating obtained for each water quality property is denoted by si i 3 s i i w i q i where si i is the sub index of the ith property w i is the relative weights and q i represents the quality rating with the three factors in place the drinking wqi was then calculated in the following manner 4 w q i i 1 n s i the calculated wqis were interpreted according to five categories rakotondrabe et al 2017 water with a wqi value 50 was classified as excellent water with a value ranging from 50 to 100 as good water with a value ranging from 100 to 200 as poor water with a value ranging from 200 to 300 as very poor water and water with a value 300 as extremely poor water 3 3 statistical analysis the statistical package for social sciences spss version 23 was used to analyse the data summary statistics were calculated for the physical water quality measurements which included means and standard deviations for all the physical properties and all the phes the percentage compliance to the sans 241 2015 and the who 2018 standards were also calculated 3 4 quality assurance and quality control quality assurance procedures were applied to ensure that the results were reliable all instruments were calibrated before measurement double distilled water was used throughout the study to clean glassware and the reagents that were used were of analytical grade reagent blank determinations were used to correct the instrument readings for validation of the analytical procedure standard reference materials crms white clover bcr 402 obtained from the community bureau of reference of the commission of the european communities was used all samples were analysed in triplicate n 3 and to validate the digestion method standards were also prepared 4 results 4 1 physical and microbiological properties measurements were recorded for the five physical properties and the two microbiological properties of groundwater samples collected at the eight sampling sites during the winter season of the seven water quality properties only ph and do demonstrated 100 compliance when compared to the who 2018 and sans 241 2015 drinking water quality limits table 2 in contrast the faecal coliform bacterial counts of the eight water samples were all non compliant when compared to both the who 2018 and sans 241 2015 drinking water quality limits on the other hand the e coli counts exceeded both the drinking water quality limits at half of the sampling sites which is of great concern as the water is used for drinking purposes 4 2 potential harmful elements of the 12 phes studied cd co cr ni se and zn were not detected in the water samples due to levels being below the instrument detection limit arsenic was only detected in the groundwater sample collected at site f5 the level of arsenic in this groundwater sample exceeded the limits of both the who 2018 and sans 241 2015 drinking water quality limits table 3 but for cu and mg the concentrations of all the measurements which were detected were within the specified limits in contrast the groundwater measurements of fe were non compliant to both the who and the sans 241 drinking water limits for 63 of the groundwater samples on the other hand for pd all the groundwater samples in which pb was detected exceeded the specified limits calcium was detectable in all the groundwater samples of which 63 of the samples exceeded the specified limits 4 3 overall groundwater quality the wqi values for drinking water was computed for the groundwater samples collected at the eight sampling sites to evaluate the overall drinking water quality of the water at each of the sampling site the wqi values indicated that the drinking water quality of the groundwater was classified as good at only three of the sampling sites table 4 the drinking water quality of the groundwater at the remainder of the sampling sites were poor or very poor when the different zones were considered no explicit pattern could be established however the groundwater of one of the sampling sites in zone 1 had the worst quality water f2 this site is located approximately 5 km from the highly dense mine tailing area in contrast the groundwater collected at sampling site f8 which lies the furthest from the mine tailing area at about 7 km 10 km had the best quality water of all the groundwater samples the overall trend of the contamination of the different indicators of groundwater quality were assessed for the groundwater samples at the eight sampling sites within the three zones this assessment considered the quality of the various indicators of pollution that exceeded the limits in this study overall there was no obvious trend that could be discerned for the level of contamination for the eight sampling sites as well as for the three zones table 5 5 discussion several indicators were measured to ascertain the extent of groundwater contamination by gold mine tailings in the welkom and virginia area of the matjabeng local municipality the results revealed that several of the contaminants that were found in the groundwater samples could have originated from the gold mine tailings in the vicinity when considering the quality of the groundwater samples from the different sampling sites for the different zones the expectation that water samples from sampling sites beyond the mine tailings would present with lower levels of contamination was not met a possible explanation could be that mine tailings and the mining activities in the welkom and virginia area may not be the only source of contamination to the groundwater in the area other sources of contamination in the area may include natural sources such as the weathering of parent materials as well as anthropogenic sources such as industries motor vehicles fossil fuel combustion agricultural activities and waste water treatment plant wwtp effluents masindi and mued 2018 sun et al 2019 vareda et al 2019 the wqi which describes the overall water quality as a single value classified the groundwater quality as poor for majority of the sampling sites rakotondrabe et al 2017 this is of major concern as the groundwater abstracted from the eight boreholes are used for domestic purposes which includes drinking water the poor water quality due to the high faecal coliform bacterial count as well as the high e coli count could impact on the health of the people since the groundwater is the only available domestic water source the high faecal coliform bacterial count may cause diarrhoea particularly in children whilst abnormal levels of e coli in the water may cause gastrointestinal diseases such as cholera typhoid fever and dysentery fakhr et al 2016 mahmud et al 2019 groundwater samples also presented with relatively high concentrations of phes in particular the concentrations of fe pb and ca in most of the water samples exceeded the prescribed limits indicating the potential for metal toxicities due to these metals these metals are typical contaminants associated with gold ores from mining activities and gold mine tailings which could be the sources of contamination tutu et al 2008 jaishankar et al 2014 when borehole water containing high levels of fe is used as drinking water this could result in the production of hydrogen free radicals which attack dna resulting in cellular damage mutation and malignant transformations which in turn causes a series of diseases jaishankar et al 2014 lead on the other hand is known to cause brain liver and kidney damage in children as well as nerve damage in adults khan 2011 jaishankar et al 2014 abushady et al 2017 moreover an increased intake of pb can result in miscarriages in pregnant women as well as damage of testis in males khan 2011 6 conclusion the findings indicate that the quality of the groundwater at majority of the sampling sites in the welkom and virginia areas were not suitable for drinking this outcome was highlighted by the high levels of faecal coliform e coli and phes particularly fe and pb in the groundwater and was confirmed by the wqi values that indicated the overall drinking water quality of the water therefore remediation measures need to be implemented by local authorities to improve the quality of the groundwater in the area this will prevent further deterioration to both the water quality and the potential effect that the water may have on human health based on the evidence and magnitude of contamination these results laid the foundation for further research in which the extent of contamination of the groundwater in the welkom and virginia area could also be studied for the summer season to be able to determine the seasonal variations in the level of contamination of the

11978,mining of gold in the welkom and virginia areas of the free state province in south africa has produced numerous gold mine tailings which contain a variety of contaminants the extent of contamination of groundwater in the area was studied by measuring several water quality indicators at eight sampling sites and within three zones the overall contamination of groundwater was quantified by computing a drinking water quality index wqi the results revealed that majority of the groundwater in the welkom and virginia areas is unsuitable for drinking as confirmed by high wqis at only three sites was the water samples suitable for drinking one site revealed water to be of very poor quality while the remainder 40 of the sites indicated water to be of poor quality the high indicator microbiological counts also affirmed the poor quality of the groundwater faecal coliform bacterial counts were 100 non compliant to drinking water quality limits when compared to the world health organization and south african national standard on drinking water 241 while e coli counts exceeded both the drinking water quality limits at 50 of the sampling sites of the potential harmful elements analysed pb and fe were found to be at toxic levels for pb 40 of the water samples exceeded the drinking water quality limits while 63 of water samples were non compliant for fe this result exposes the poor quality of the groundwater in the welkom and virginia areas which poses a serious threat to the health of the local people as groundwater is their primary source of drinking water this research highlights the urgent need for mitigation measures to be introduced by the local authorities to improve the quality of the groundwater in the study area graphical abstract image 1 keywords contamination gold mine tailing microorganism potential harmful element water quality index water quality 1 introduction over the past century mining has been the backbone of south africa s economy gold mining brought about widespread employment wealth and contributed to the development of several sectors in the south african economy durand 2012 these sectors include the development of infrastructure and the establishment of manufacturing and service industries durand 2012 the rapid growing gold mining industry brought south africa to the forefront as one of the most industrialised countries in africa the mining of gold ore from the earth s crust and its processing produces large quantities of waste by products lottermoser 2010 kossoff et al 2014 in most instances a larger proportion of the gold ores extracted end up as waste material kossoff et al 2014 the mining waste by products are collected and accumulated in tailings on the surface of the earth in the vicinity of the gold mines gold mine tailings contain several different types of contaminants some of these contaminants originate from the gold containing ore while others are added to the tailings during the chemical separation of gold from its ore lottermoser 2010 kossoff et al 2014 contaminants that originate from the gold containing ore include the mineral pyrite iron disulfide which is an acid producing rock as well as chemicals which are described as potentially harmful elements phes such as mercury hg arsenic as cadmium cd and lead pb ngure et al 2014 mercury and cyanide cn can also be added to mine tailings during the chemical processing of gold ores nkuba et al 2019 gold containing ores also contain small quantities of other phes described as micro elements which include cobalt co copper cu chromium cr nickel ni iron fe manganese mn molybdenum mo selenium se and zinc zn abdul wahab and marikar 2012 these contaminants from gold mine tailings as well as mining activities have caused environmental pollution and impact the health of humans living in the vicinity of such mining activities wahl et al 2013 wu et al 2014 the contaminants in gold mine tailings are dispersed into the environment by wind rainwater runoff and surface water flow when rainwater percolates through gold mine tailings sulfur bearing pyrite reacts with water and air to form sulfuric acid and ferrous sulfate hansen 2015 kinna 2016 the acid effluent further dissolves phes into ground or surface water bodies and soils in the area hansen 2015 kinna 2016 wind blows dust and particulate matter containing contaminants from gold mine tailings over long distances which eventually settle on soil water bodies and plant leaves within the vicinity of the gold mine tailings castillo et al 2013 stovern et al 2016 humans and other living organisms at higher levels of the food chain are at risk if they consume contaminated water and plants contaminated with the non biodegradable phes islam et al 2015 shaheen et al 2016 accumulation of phes in tissues of humans above tolerable upper intake levels may have severe health effects in particular cd hg pb and as have been described by the world health organization who as human carcinogens of major public health concern kamunda et al 2016 ingestion of these phes even at trace levels may be lethal tchounwou et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 welkom and virginia are the major gold mining towns in the lejweleputswa district municipality and of the mathjabeng local municipality mlm area in the free state province of south africa welkom and virginia are surrounded by some of the largest gold fields in the free state with mining of gold being the dominant economic activity in the area gold mining in this area has produced numerous gold mine tailings which may contain a variety of different contaminants kamunda et al 2016 such contaminants may cause extensive pollution to soils and surface water in the area orimoloye ololade 2020a 2020b in addition the contaminants from the gold mine tailings may also leach into groundwater keesstra et al 2012 thereby causing the contamination of this water source which is often used as a drinking water source in the area extensive agricultural activities such as food crop cultivation and livestock farming are also performed in the welkom and virginia area food crop farms in the area mainly grow commercial maize corn in extensive fields the local people who work on these farms live in small farming communities in the area and they do not have any portable water supply groundwater abstraction from boreholes is the only source of water for drinking and domestic purposes in the area additionally these groundwater sources do not receive any form of treatment before drinking which makes it a source that may have been exposed to harmful contaminants the aim of this study was to investigate the extent of contamination of the groundwater by contaminants from gold mine tailings at eight sampling sites in and around the welkom and virginia area several indicators of contamination were used in this study to quantify the pollution condition of the groundwater sources these indicators included physical and microbiological water quality properties as well as potential harmful elements phes in water an overall level of the contamination of the different water samples was also determined by calculating a drinking water quality index wqi using the different water quality measurements 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is in and around the welkom and virginia area of matjhabeng local municipality mlm in the lejweleputswa district municipality the welkom and virginia areas are situated in the north eastern part of the free state province about 250 km south of johannesburg and 140 km north east of bloemfontein the province s capital fig 1 the study area is characterised by a warm temperate summer rainfall climate with an annual average precipitation of 530 mm while the winters are dry green door environmental 2013 high summer temperatures are prevalent with average monthly temperatures of 17 oc in the summer and 5 oc in the winter 2 2 criteria for selection of zones and sampling sites three zones were selected in the welkom and virginia area to study the extent of pollution of groundwater as well as to confirm if mine tailings were the dominant source of contamination in the area within these three zones eight groundwater sampling sites were identified from which groundwater contamination was examined the three zones were selected based on distances from the mine tailings and mines other anthropogenic activities such as industries and agricultural activities in the area and the prevailing wind direction in the area zone 1 contained sampling sites f1 and f2 and the zone was positioned on the western side of welkom about 5 km from where mining is practiced in the welkom and virginia area this mining area contains numerous gold mine tailings therefore the area was described as the highly dense mine tailing area zone 2 was positioned about 5 7 km beyond the highly dense mine tailing area occupying the western side of virginia as well as the south southwest border of the highly dense mine tailing area the third zone zone 3 did not contain mine tailings or mining activities but these sites were located approximately 7 km 10 km east of the highly dense mine tailing area sampling sites in zone 1 and zone 2 were situated in the downstream direction of the prevailing wind in the welkom area whereas the control sites in zone 3 were positioned in the upstream direction of the prevailing wind in the area 2 3 collection of water samples water samples were collected according to the procedure in the sampling guide of the water research commission of south africa wrc 2017 water samples were collected from the eight groundwater sampling sites that were identified in the three zones in june of 2018 which is the winter season in the study area at each sampling site a water sample was collected from a borehole tap and then used for the measurement of turbidity water ph temperature electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do water samples were also collected for the measurement of phes and the presence of indicator microorganisms in the water in this study the number of faecal coliform bacteria was counted to indicate the total bacterial load in the drinking water as well as the number of escherichia coli e coli to determine the degree of pollution of water from faecal matter who 2018 for the measurement of the water quality properties on site water samples were collected in a 100 ml beaker from the borehole tap while for the measurement of phes water samples were collected in a 1 l bottle prior to the collection of a water sample destined for the measurement of the presence of the indicator microorganisms the borehole tap was flamed then opened and allowed to run for at least 3 min after which a water sample was collected in sterile 100 ml sampling bottle all sample bottles destined for the measurement of phes and microorganisms were clearly labelled with site number time and date of collection and then placed in a cooler box containing ice these sample bottles were then transported to the water laboratory at the central university of technology bloemfontein free state cut where the water samples were kept at 4 oc in the refrigerator until analysis 3 measurement of physical and microbial water quality properties the water ph temperature ec and do of the water samples were measured at each of the eight groundwater sampling sites while the microbiological properties were measured in the laboratory at a sampling site turbidity was measured with a calibrated battery operated hach 2100q turbidity meter following the standard analytical procedures of the instrument the water ph temperature ec and do of the water samples were measured using a battery operated hach hqd hand held meter according to the analytical procedures of the instrument the number of faecal coliform bacteria and number of e coli were counted using the colilert 18 quanti tray method iso 9308 2 2012 according to the manufacturer s specifications colilert quanti tray idexx laboratories inc united states colilert 18 powder was poured into each water sample in the bottle which was then shaken for a few minutes until the powder had dissolved once the colilert 18 powder had dissolved the solution was poured into the 97 well colilert 18 quanti traytm2000 tray which was heat sealed and incubated at 37 c for 20 h in natural light the wells would appear yellow if faecal coliform bacteria were present in contrast if e coli were present in the water sample the wells would fluoresce blue when placed under uv light kinzelman et al 2005 the number of colony forming units cfu of faecal coliform bacteria and e coli present in 100 ml of water was determined using the quanti tray 2000 most probable number mpn table 3 1 measurement of potential harmful elements the twelve phes as cd pb co cr cu fe ni se zn ca and mg were measured using the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes the measurements were performed at the school of chemistry and physics university of kwa zulu natal westville campus prior to elemental analysis the water samples were digested using open vessel digestion in nitric acid hno3 the procedure that was followed for the measurements of the phes as well as the digestion procedures for the water samples were according to kisten et al 2015 digests were filtered through whatman no 1 filter papers into 25 ml volumetric flasks diluted to the mark with double distilled water and then stored in polyethylene bottles for analysis for quality control purposes three digests were performed for each water sample to validate the digestion method for each phe measured in this study a standard was also prepared to establish the accuracy and precision of the test method 3 2 measurement of overall groundwater quality the drinking water quality of the groundwater samples was determined by computing a water quality index wqi proposed by rakotondrabe et al 2017 using the physical and chemical measurements of the groundwater samples the drinking wqi proposed by rakotondrabe et al 2017 was most appropriate for use to compute the wqi in this study based upon the fact that it only allowed for single set of measurement and it was also relatively easy to compute a wqi integrates measurements of different water quality properties into a single value that describes the overall quality of the water at a particular sampling site kannel et al 2007 nikoo et al 2011 to compute the wqi three physical water quality properties and the measurements of five phes were selected based on their impact to water quality and human health rakotondrabe et al 2017 the three physical water quality properties were turbidity ph and ec the five phes cu fe pb ca and mg were selected because their concentrations were above the instrument detection limit at more than 50 of the sampling sites three main factors were computed in the determination of a wqi for a particular sampling site relative weight wi quality rating qi and sub index of the ith property sii according to the procedure of rakotondrabe et al 2017 for the calculation of w i weights ranging between 1 and 5 were assigned to each water quality property based on the impact of each property on water quality as well as the harm that each of the water quality property may cause to human health for example a weight of two was assigned to a water quality property that may not have significant effect on water quality as well as human health but a weight of five was assigned when a water quality property can cause severe contamination to water and cause critical health implications to humans table 1 w i was computed according to the equation below 1 w i w i i 1 n w i where w i is the relative weight w i is weight of each property n is the number of properties for the calculation of q i the concentration of each water quality property was divided by its limit according to the south african national standard on drinking water sans 241 2015 as the standard contained most of the water quality properties that were used in computing the wqi but for ca and mg which did not have limits in sans 241 the who 2018 drinking water limit was used more so where the limit in sans 241 and who was a range the middle number was used sans 241 2015 who 2018 2 q i c i s i 100 where q i is quality rating c i is concentration of each water quality property and si is the drinking water quality standard for each water quality property the product of the relative weights and the quality rating obtained for each water quality property is denoted by si i 3 s i i w i q i where si i is the sub index of the ith property w i is the relative weights and q i represents the quality rating with the three factors in place the drinking wqi was then calculated in the following manner 4 w q i i 1 n s i the calculated wqis were interpreted according to five categories rakotondrabe et al 2017 water with a wqi value 50 was classified as excellent water with a value ranging from 50 to 100 as good water with a value ranging from 100 to 200 as poor water with a value ranging from 200 to 300 as very poor water and water with a value 300 as extremely poor water 3 3 statistical analysis the statistical package for social sciences spss version 23 was used to analyse the data summary statistics were calculated for the physical water quality measurements which included means and standard deviations for all the physical properties and all the phes the

11979,currently the water pollution is an important issue in bangladesh as well as in the world the sylhet city in bangladesh is suffering from lack of structured sewerage and drainage systems with somehow improper management of solid wastes consequently such wastes are discharged into the nearby surma river through different sources responsible for degrading the quality of water thus this study focuses on exploring the present water quality of surma river applying the hydrochemical multivariate statistical methods and also with the help of the water quality index wqi analysis also recognize the potential pollution sources of water in the study area the outcomes show that the average values of some components such as ph dissolved oxygen do iron total dissolved solid tds and total solid ts are found within the standard limit whereas the biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solid tss carbon di oxide co2 and turbidity are found higher than the standard limit the pearson correlation coefficients reflect some strong positive associations with moderate to negative correlation suggesting the heterogeneous sources and pathways of the contaminants and ions the highest factor loading values recorded against tds do bod cod ph and turbidity suggests them as a key environmental contaminants the wqi value suggests that the poor water quality exist in the river particularly the middle stream of the river is much polluted as this area largely covered by the sylhet city corporation scc this study recommends that there should be a strong management plan with monitoring cell for maintaining the water environment in the scc area graphical abstract image 1 keywords surma river water quality hydrochemistry water quality index potential sources of pollution 1 introduction the surma basin sub basin of the bangal basin is the constituent part of the most north eastern corner of bangladesh at least eight million habitants rely directly or indirectly on surma basin water for their livelihood and other purposes the water from the river is also being used as the raw water in water treatment plant in topkhana area which is located under scc area ahmed et al 2010 however most of the rivers closed to the big cities in bangladesh have been polluted in the last 20 25 years due to various reasons hossain 2003 amin and baquee 2005 recently the human activities and industrial effluents have been act as a major threat to water quality of surma river the quality of water may be altered due to anthropogenic activities municipal solid waste msw disposal sites agricultural activities and industrial effluents that are disposing with or without proper treatment juahir et al 2011 howladar 2012 moreover qadir et al 2010 and hossain et al 2010 amnestied domestic and industrial sewage as one of the main culprit for river water pollution as mentioned by alam et al 2007 the quality of the surma river water is deteriorated by the surface run off from agricultural land and the improper disposal of municipal solid waste the generation of municipal solid waste in sylhet in 2005 was about 180 200 tons per day and the amount is increasing day by day amin and baquee 2005 besides the generation of the hazardous hospital s wastes is also increasing and the liquid part of this waste is joining to the sewerage system the sewerage network of the city includes many small canals connected with some natural hilly channels which fall into this river also the poor people dispose their excreta into the river the surma river is one of the rivers which keep a set of importance for its adjacent area however the river water is getting contaminated at various point sources as well as non point sources of pollution ahmed 2014 it was revealed that the water quality of the charas is very far from the standards and thus this polluted water is polluting surma river water to a great extent ahmed et al 2010 the assessment of the water quality of surma river and its impacts on the residents of the sylhet city corporation have been studied considering seven water quality parameters taken from four stations by begum and hasan 2019 even so a number of studies have been conducted on the water quality of the surmariver in the scc area iqbal et al 2005 alam et al 2007 2010 chowdhury and mohammad 2006 islam et al 2010 rahman et al 2013 ahmed 2014 and so on which are comprehensively based on the hydro chemical analysis of water therefore given the importance in achieving water safety of the area this study performs an in depth investigation determining the present status of the quality of the surma river water with the help of hydrochemical multivariate statistical and wqi again the qualitative analysis of water quality

study area the sylhet district lies within latitudes 24 36 n to 25 11 n and longitudes 91 38 e to 89 30 e it is situated in the north eastern part of bangladesh it has some high topography like khasi and jaintia hills of the plio miocene age these hills are divided the sylhet region into 4 geographic regions among them the alluvial plain is primarily formed by the surma and khushiyarariver which merges with meghna river to the south the origin of surma river is from the slopes of the hills of shilong and meghalaya where the barak river forms the noticeable catchment it flows west and southwest to the sylhet town after that it flows northwest towards sunamganj town as it is well known that surma river mitigates demand of freshwater in the scc area but currently it is alarmingly polluted because of lack of effective monitoring and management the entire extent of the surma river is about 900 km 2 methodology 2 1 water sampling and laboratory analysis water sampling sites were selected arbitrarily the samples were collected from different locations of the river like the connected channel points scc area and different market s discharging points in the river and other important areas all the samples were collected in plastic bottle before sample collection all bottles are washed with dilute acid followed by distilled water after collecting the samples are covered with carbon paper to protect from the sunlight for field preservation then these bottles are tagged properly by masking tape by following the standards rules of apha american public health association 1998 all collected samples are tested within 24 h except bod as it is tested after 5 days later for measuring water quality parameters the instruments are used shown in table 1 in fact the collected samples from the field have been considered as primary resources of the research then their tests have been performed in the laboratory the instruments have been used in analysis can measure the values up to micro levels maintaining standard precision and detection limits consequently all of the tested data have been preserved for further processing analyzing and others the base map from

principal component analysis factor analysis pca fa principal component analysis is a powerful technique to explain the variance of a large set of inter correlated variables and transform them into a smaller set of independent uncorrelated variables bu et al 2009 factor analysis fa generally helps to reduce and simplify the outcome from the pca 2 5 water quality index wqi wqi method is a powerful tool that enables easy communication of the quality of water to the public especially for the policy makers it is an unambiguous tool that enables the integration of the water parameters which are

the surma river is the most potential source of water for different purposes of sylhet division the water quality of surma river is frequently deteriorating for last few decades there are various reasons behind this problem like growing human activities direct disposal of industrial and municipal waste figs 2 5 lack of proper drainage facilities and poor structure of natural canals local name chara in the area as a result itis receiving the surface runoff from adjoining urban catchments consequently the bod cod tss iron and turbidity are increasing and hence decreasing the alkalinity in the river according to who when the quantity of alkalinity is 3 54 ppm it fits for various diseases from this study the average alkalinity is found 37 189 ppm which belongs within this category in the case of higher bod tss and cod the consumption of oxygen from water increases with temperature in the study area this may be the cause to fall the dissolved oxygen level of the area however bod tss and cod value exceed the standard limit which is the distressing sign for water quality of the surmariver the turbidity value of surma river varied between 171 ntu to 180 ntu in the downstream region almost all stations the turbidity value is very high which means that the water of the area is much turbid the higher conductivity reflects the presence of more heavy metals in water the lowest value of ec is 129 95 μs cm 1 at kanaighat and highest value is 174 75 μs cm 1 at fish market station the standards value of conductivity as guided by department of environment doe of govt of bangladesh is ranges from 800 to 1000 μs cm 1 for fishing water and 2250 μs cm 1 for irrigational water suggests that the conductivity value of the river water is far below from these standards according to this study the average ph value of water is 7 3 which belong to the doe standard range 6 5 8 5 hence the quality of the water is good for irrigation and domestic uses who 2011 howladar et al 2013 the hardness values are in acceptable limit according to who 300 mg l 1 bangladesh standard 200 500 mg l 1 and isi 300 mg l 1 the iron of all sources fluctuated from 0 089 mg l 1 to 0 429 mg l 1 it is observed that the value of iron is higher at downstream portion than upper and middle part of the stream portion at the upper part of the stream portion the iron value is lower than middle and the downstream portion of the river the dissolved oxygen is an important water quality parameter and has special significance for aquatic organisms in natural water the do level of surma river has found in a fluctuate rate at selected stations where most of the stations do value lies in 6 mg l 1 in the upper stream carbon dioxide value is increasing gradually whereas towards the middle stream co2 values ranges between 14 5 mg l 1to 27 5 mg l 1 which exceeds the standard limit of water the concentration of chloride ranges from 1 mg l 1 to 9 mg l 1 which lies within the permissible limit who 2011 howladar et al 2014 moreover the different contaminants discharge including sewage effluents are increasing day by day which reduce the quality of potable water 3 2 the statistics ofthe qualitative parameters of surma river water the descriptive statistics concerning the quality of surmariverwater from 25 stations are presented in table 3 the maximum minimum mean the standard deviation skewness and kurtosis are computed for all parameters from table 3 it is clear that the standard deviation value range varies considerably for different parameters the skewness values of tss bod turbidity and hardness are positively skewed or right side skewed at the upper stream case and the negatively skewed parameters such as tds ts do and ec these parameters are left side skewed and their values are high at downstream part of the river in the studied area the tss skewness 2 006 and kurtosis 6 172 bod skewness 1 544 and kurtosis 1 453 turbidity skewness 1 718 and kurtosis 2 686 and hardness skewness 1 190 and kurtosis 2 034 so these parameters skewness and kurtosis can be considered as an extreme case table 3 shows that the kurtosis values are platykurtic 3 for all of the parameters except tss kurtosis value 6 18 which is leptokurtic as its value exceeds 3 in case of standard deviations the slight deviations are observed for the parameters of ts and ec from its mean value 3 3 correlation matrix the correlation matrix of physico chemical parameters of water in the study area are presented in table 4 it shows the correlation among different variables and the degree of correlation based on the magnitude of pearson s coefficient of correlation table 5 tabulates the relationship between pairs according to their degree of correlation the magnitudes of coefficient from 0 70 to 1 0 0 50 0 70 and below 0 50 have been classified as strong moderate and weak correlation respectively the positive correlation means that when one parameter is increasing then another parameter also increasing along with that parameter negative correlation means that when one parameter value is increasing then another parameter value is decreasing and their source characteristics are not homogenous it reflects that the strong positive correlation between ec chloride 0 715 chlorides are one of the most common elements of the universe which may exists in water in the form of nacl kcl cacl2 and so on the average concentration of the chloride ion is about 4 46 mg l 1 on the other hand the value of the electrical conductivity in the water samples are found far below the prescribed limit as mentioned in previous section therefore the availability of the metal ions which might be present as salts with chloride is mainly responsible for electrical conductivity hence the correlation is logically significant on the contrary there have strong negative correlation among do ec 0 704 and do co2 0 701 from table 4 it is seen that ec iron chloride co2 are negatively correlated with do however table 5 shows that there have moderate positive correlations between different pairs such as ts tds 0 587 ts tss 0 538 ts ec 0 505 tss ec 0 590 cod co2 0 534 turbidity iron 0 636 ec iron 0 591 ec co2 0 661 iron cl 0 636 similarly some parameters show moderate negative correlation between different pairs such as do iron 0 645 and do chloride 0 522 it is interesting to note that in this study there is no significance correlation between ph hardness bod and other parameters 3 4 factor analysis and water pollution sources factor analysis fa relates to principal component analysis in water quality evaluation studies where various parameters are analyzed for particular causes leading to a change in the water quality manly 1994 helena et al 2000 howladar and rahman 2016 reghunath et al 2002 yidana 2010 inorder to evaluate the most significant parameters for the quality of water the factor analysis have been carried out upon 14 variables for 25 samples from surmariverwater an eigenvalue gives a measure of the significance of the factor eigenvalues of 1 0 or greater are considered significant shrestha and kazama 2007 howladar et al 2017a liu et al 2003 howladar 2017 the eigenvalue of total variance cumulative eigenvalue and cumulative variance are presented in table 6 five factors are obtained for the study area with total variance 78 818 when eigenvalues greater than 1 table 6 shows that each five factors eigenvalues have greater than 1 the eigenvalues and total variance of factor 1 is 4 25 and 30 35 respectively indicates the significant value among all factors table 7 shows that factor 1 has strong positive loading in do with value of 0 82 besides the strong negative loading have been observed in the case of iron 0 77 chloride 0 763 and conductivity 0 899 the factor 1 has also moderate negative loadings for some components like tss ts and co2 which values are 0 559 0 508 and 0 704 table 7 respectively the tss ts and conductivity are commonly associated with discharge from urban areas involving erosion of road edges due to surface runoff the strong negative loading of iron and chloride are associated with industrial wastes sewage pollution and soil erosion the strong negative loading of carbon dioxide comes from the degradation of organic compound factor 1 has only one strong loading with do with produced as a waste product of photosynthesis from phytoplankton algae and other aquatic plant factor 2 represents 15 09 of total variance table 6 and has the moderate positive loading for cod and turbidity also have the negative moderate loading on ts and ph this factor represents nonpoint source of pollution which generally related to agricultural activities surface runoff from precipitation and organic pollution it also reflects the strong influence of anthropogenic activities in the area especially from the domestic waste and industrial waste howladar et al 2017b the plot of factor 1 vs factor 2 and factor 1 vs factor3 respectively withtheir level of relationship to each other have shown in figs 6 and 7 the factor 3 is dominated by moderate negative and positive loading on turbidity bod and cod 0 635 0 625 0 528 respectively however it has explained 12 93 of total variance turbidity represents non point source of pollution which can be related to agricultural activities and surface runoff from precipitation besides bod and cod reflect strong influence of anthropogenic activities in the scc area the factor 4 accounts for 11 05 of total variance it has strong positive loading on tds 0 877 and moderate positive loading on ts 0 556 replicates the point source pollution nonpoint source pollution as well as erosional effect factor 5 stands for 9 48 of the total variance it has moderate positive loading on ph 0 569 and moderate negative loading on alkalinity 0 629 the alkalinity is linked with common sources of natural processes of dissolution of soil constituents mainly calcium carbonates nevertheless the ph is related to leaching of carbonate compounds from the soil it increases the ph as well as the alkalinity of water in fact the alkaline condition helps to grow the algae and others consequently changes the water appearance to a greener color and quality this factor signifies the contribution of nonpoint pollution and the physic chemistry of the river application of wqi to implicate the water quality of surma river the average values of twelve physicochemical parameters are used for computing the water quality index in the study area the wqi has been estimated for different parameters such as ph ec tss tds hardness alkalinity do bod cod turbidity iron and cl chloride ion for twenty five sampling sites in this study the computed wqi values ranges from 88 48 to 300 however based on the wqi value the water can be categorized into five types which are from excellent water to unsuitable proper treatment required before use suggested by ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 the computed water classes and percentages of the area are shown in fig 8 this illustration reflects that the water of the river falls in different classes most of the water found poor water quality which percentage is about 72 whereas the rest 16 and 12 of water sampling stations exhibit good and very poor water quality respectively the lowest wqi value has been recorded at station 4 indicating the low level of contamination table 8 this station categorized as class 2 in very goodwater quality other 3 stations such as 1 3 and 24 are categorized as good quality water in the area from this table 8 it has been observed that stations 1 3 and 4 are situated at the upstream area of the river besides the station 24 located at downstream area shows good water quality hence these results imply low contamination of water in the area compared to the other sampling areas the very good and good water quality stations have been labeled by yellow color shown in fig 9 the higher value of wqi has been observed at stations 11 17 and 18 table 8 these stations belong to the quality class 4 consequently categorized as very poor quality water this scenario illustrates the high level of contamination table 8 as these areas received various pollutants from different sources like surface runoff animal and human wastes drainage system discharge into river domestic pollutants local market rice mill pollutants and so on the other stations are classified as category 3 actually 18 stations out of 25 stations are categorized in poor water quality these stations are situated in upstream middle stream and downstream part of the river the middle stream portion of the sampling stations of the river shows more poor water quality the another stations as the sampling locations are located in the scc area which is densely populated and busiest area than others another reason is also found that natural charas are directly discharge into the river water most remarkable 2 charas such as namely goalichara and mongolichara are located at station 15 and station 17 respectively also there are many charas have been found along the boundary of sylhet city corporation the station 14 15 17 20 and 21 are much closed to the boundary charas fig 9 the water quality in this area shows poor quality moreover some charas are also found at some selected stations such as stations 4 8 11 and 12 in the upper stream region from table 9 it has been observed that almost all the parameters of water are below the standard limit only do cod and turbidity values are above the standard limit moreover it is observed that the wqi value of surmariver is 152 017 which can be classified as poor water quality behind this condition some parameters like turbidity cod and iron are poorly responsible based onqnwn values finally this study has been plotted the quality of water on base map fig 10 and strongly recommends the proper treatments of the river water before its different uses 4 conclusions and recommendations 4 1 conclusions being concerned about estimating the present status of the water quality of surma river 25 water samples from different stations had been analyzed in the laboratory following the methods proposed by american public health association apha 1998 for assessing 14 water quality parameters such as do bod cod alkalinity water ph conductivity turbidity ts tss tds hardness iron chloride and co2 the physicochemical analysis shows that most of the water samples were with exceeded amount of bod cod turbidity tss and co2 beyond the standard limit correlation matrix analysis shows a strong positive correlation among ts tds ts tss ts ec tss ec co2 cod turbidity iron ec iron ec chloride iron chloride and ec co2 and strong negative correlation different pairs such as do ec 0 704 do iron 0 645 do chloride 0 522 do co2 0 701 factor analysis reveals that 78 8 of the total variance can be explained by considering five factors the plotting of factor 1 vs factor 2 and factor 1 vs factor 3 show that the pollution sources of the analyzed variables are almost similar the analysis and observation suggest that the river water quality is primarily influenced by industrial wastes sewage pollution surface runoff organic compound and agricultural activities the water quality index wqi analysis has identified that most of the water samples are in poor quality these may be the cumulative results of the discharge containing different types of pollutants like sewage garbage disposal hospital wastes etc from different natural charas and drainage system which are directly connected to the river as a result water of surmariver is getting alarmingly polluted day by day 4 2 recommendations it s well known to all that water pollution cannot be completely stopped but it can be prevented from pollution by taking some necessary steps such as making people aware of the water pollution problem through electronic media like radio television social media e g facebook twitter etc identify polluter by engaging the monitoring committee and should be punished by paying large amount of money or any other accountable punishment the disposal of municipal solid waste to the sewerage system should be monitored strictly and anybody who are doing such unwise and thoughtless tasks hospital wastes that may contain several harmful materials should not be disposed here and there or as the methods adopted for general municipal solid waste industries should be installed water treatment plant to remove contaminants from their effluents and wastewater before being disposed to streams industrial polluters must be taken under law to pay due to the compensation of additional cost for the treatment of the water body that is contaminated by them city corporation area must install sewage treatment plants for cleaning up the sewage before discharges the illegal buildings and deployment of the structures towards the river should be destroyed and the rampant flow of the river water must be ensured the government city corporation should engageda strong authority to monitor water quality of the river with necessary legal measures against the indiscriminate discharge of waste sewage and effluents for future management of the water environment of the surmariver declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

11979,currently the water pollution is an important issue in bangladesh as well as in the world the sylhet city in bangladesh is suffering from lack of structured sewerage and drainage systems with somehow improper management of solid wastes consequently such wastes are discharged into the nearby surma river through different sources responsible for degrading the quality of water thus this study focuses on exploring the present water quality of surma river applying the hydrochemical multivariate statistical methods and also with the help of the water quality index wqi analysis also recognize the potential pollution sources of water in the study area the outcomes show that the average values of some components such as ph dissolved oxygen do iron total dissolved solid tds and total solid ts are found within the standard limit whereas the biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solid tss carbon di oxide co2 and turbidity are found higher than the standard limit the pearson correlation coefficients reflect some strong positive associations with moderate to negative correlation suggesting the heterogeneous sources and pathways of the contaminants and ions the highest factor loading values recorded against tds do bod cod ph and turbidity suggests them as a key environmental contaminants the wqi value suggests that the poor water quality exist in the river particularly the middle stream of the river is much polluted as this area largely covered by the sylhet city corporation scc this study recommends that there should be a strong management plan with monitoring cell for maintaining the water environment in the scc area graphical abstract image 1 keywords surma river water quality hydrochemistry water quality index potential sources of pollution 1 introduction the surma basin sub basin of the bangal basin is the constituent part of the most north eastern corner of bangladesh at least eight million habitants rely directly or indirectly on surma basin water for their livelihood and other purposes the water from the river is also being used as the raw water in water treatment plant in topkhana area which is located under scc area ahmed et al 2010 however most of the rivers closed to the big cities in bangladesh have been polluted in the last 20 25 years due to various reasons hossain 2003 amin and baquee 2005 recently the human activities and industrial effluents have been act as a major threat to water quality of surma river the quality of water may be altered due to anthropogenic activities municipal solid waste msw disposal sites agricultural activities and industrial effluents that are disposing with or without proper treatment juahir et al 2011 howladar 2012 moreover qadir et al 2010 and hossain et al 2010 amnestied domestic and industrial sewage as one of the main culprit for river water pollution as mentioned by alam et al 2007 the quality of the surma river water is deteriorated by the surface run off from agricultural land and the improper disposal of municipal solid waste the generation of municipal solid waste in sylhet in 2005 was about 180 200 tons per day and the amount is increasing day by day amin and baquee 2005 besides the generation of the hazardous hospital s wastes is also increasing and the liquid part of this waste is joining to the sewerage system the sewerage network of the city includes many small canals connected with some natural hilly channels which fall into this river also the poor people dispose their excreta into the river the surma river is one of the rivers which keep a set of importance for its adjacent area however the river water is getting contaminated at various point sources as well as non point sources of pollution ahmed 2014 it was revealed that the water quality of the charas is very far from the standards and thus this polluted water is polluting surma river water to a great extent ahmed et al 2010 the assessment of the water quality of surma river and its impacts on the residents of the sylhet city corporation have been studied considering seven water quality parameters taken from four stations by begum and hasan 2019 even so a number of studies have been conducted on the water quality of the surmariver in the scc area iqbal et al 2005 alam et al 2007 2010 chowdhury and mohammad 2006 islam et al 2010 rahman et al 2013 ahmed 2014 and so on which are comprehensively based on the hydro chemical analysis of water therefore given the importance in achieving water safety of the area this study performs an in depth investigation determining the present status of the quality of the surma river water with the help of hydrochemical multivariate statistical and wqi again the qualitative analysis of water quality with their possible impacts has been discussed and the necessary management plan has been proposed for promoting sustainable water utilization in the area 1 1 brief outline about the geography of the

the surma river is the most potential source of water for different purposes of sylhet division the water quality of surma river is frequently deteriorating for last few decades there are various reasons behind this problem like growing human activities direct disposal of industrial and municipal waste figs 2 5 lack of proper drainage facilities and poor structure of natural canals local name

their values are high at downstream part of the river in the studied area the tss skewness 2 006 and kurtosis 6 172 bod skewness 1 544 and kurtosis 1 453 turbidity skewness 1 718 and kurtosis 2 686 and hardness skewness 1 190 and kurtosis 2 034 so these parameters skewness and kurtosis can be considered as an extreme case table 3 shows that the kurtosis values are platykurtic 3 for all of the parameters except tss kurtosis value 6 18 which is leptokurtic as its value exceeds 3 in case of standard deviations the slight deviations are observed for the parameters of ts and ec from its mean value 3 3 correlation matrix the correlation matrix of physico chemical parameters of water in the study area are presented in table 4 it shows the correlation among different variables and the degree of correlation based on the magnitude of pearson s coefficient of correlation table 5 tabulates the relationship between pairs according to their degree of correlation the magnitudes of coefficient from 0 70 to 1 0 0 50 0 70 and below 0 50 have been classified as strong moderate and weak correlation respectively the positive correlation means that when one parameter is increasing then another parameter also increasing along with that parameter negative correlation means that when one parameter value is increasing then another parameter value is decreasing and their source characteristics are not homogenous it reflects that the strong positive correlation between ec chloride 0 715 chlorides are one of the most common elements of the universe which may exists in water in the form of nacl kcl cacl2 and so on the average concentration of the chloride ion is about 4 46 mg l 1 on the other hand the value of the electrical conductivity in the water samples are found far below the prescribed limit as mentioned in previous section therefore the availability of the metal ions which might be present as salts with chloride is mainly responsible for electrical conductivity hence the correlation is logically significant on the contrary there have strong negative correlation among do ec 0 704 and do co2 0 701 from table 4 it is seen that ec iron chloride co2 are negatively correlated with do however table 5 shows that there have moderate positive correlations between different pairs such as ts tds 0 587 ts tss 0 538 ts ec 0 505 tss ec 0 590 cod co2 0 534 turbidity iron 0 636 ec iron 0 591 ec co2 0 661 iron cl 0 636 similarly some parameters show moderate negative correlation between different pairs such as do iron 0 645 and do chloride 0 522 it is interesting to note that in this study there is no significance correlation between ph hardness bod and other parameters 3 4 factor analysis and water pollution sources factor analysis fa relates to principal component analysis in water quality evaluation studies where various parameters are analyzed for particular causes leading to a change in the water quality manly 1994 helena et al 2000 howladar and rahman 2016 reghunath et al 2002 yidana 2010 inorder to evaluate the most significant parameters for the quality of water the factor analysis have been carried out upon 14 variables for 25 samples from surmariverwater an eigenvalue gives a measure of the significance of the factor eigenvalues of 1 0 or greater are considered significant shrestha and kazama 2007 howladar et al 2017a liu et al 2003 howladar 2017 the eigenvalue of total variance cumulative eigenvalue and cumulative variance are presented in table 6 five factors are obtained for the study area with total variance 78 818 when eigenvalues greater than 1 table 6 shows that each five factors eigenvalues have greater than 1 the eigenvalues and total variance of factor 1 is 4 25 and 30 35 respectively indicates the significant value among all factors table 7 shows that factor 1 has strong positive loading in do with value of 0 82 besides the strong negative loading have been observed in the case of iron 0 77 chloride 0 763 and conductivity 0 899 the factor 1 has also moderate negative loadings for some components like tss ts and co2 which values are 0 559 0 508 and 0 704 table 7 respectively the tss ts and conductivity are commonly associated with discharge from urban areas involving erosion of road edges due to surface runoff the strong negative loading of iron and chloride are associated with industrial wastes sewage pollution and soil erosion the strong negative loading of carbon dioxide comes from the degradation of organic compound factor 1 has only one strong loading with do with produced as a waste product of photosynthesis from phytoplankton algae and other aquatic plant factor 2 represents 15 09 of total variance table 6 and has the moderate positive loading for cod and turbidity also have the negative moderate loading on ts and ph this factor represents nonpoint source of pollution which generally related to agricultural activities surface runoff from precipitation and organic pollution it also reflects the strong influence of anthropogenic activities in the area especially from the domestic waste and industrial waste howladar et al 2017b the plot of factor 1 vs factor 2 and factor 1 vs factor3 respectively withtheir level of relationship to each other have shown in figs 6 and 7 the factor 3 is dominated by moderate negative and positive loading on turbidity bod and cod 0 635 0 625 0 528 respectively however it has explained 12 93 of total variance turbidity represents non point source of pollution which can be related to agricultural activities and surface runoff from precipitation besides bod and cod reflect strong influence of anthropogenic activities in the scc area the factor 4 accounts for 11 05 of total variance it has strong positive loading on tds 0 877 and moderate positive loading on ts 0 556 replicates the point source pollution nonpoint source pollution as well as erosional effect factor 5 stands for 9 48 of the total variance it has moderate positive loading on ph 0 569 and moderate negative loading on alkalinity 0 629 the alkalinity is linked with common sources of natural processes of dissolution of soil constituents mainly calcium carbonates nevertheless the ph is related to leaching of carbonate compounds from the soil it increases the ph as well as the alkalinity of water in fact the alkaline condition helps to grow the algae and others consequently changes the water appearance to a greener color and quality this factor signifies the contribution of nonpoint pollution and the physic chemistry of the river application of wqi to implicate the water quality of surma river the average values of twelve physicochemical parameters are used for computing the water quality index in the study area the wqi has been estimated for different parameters such as ph ec tss tds hardness alkalinity do bod cod turbidity iron and cl chloride ion for twenty five sampling sites in this study the computed wqi values ranges from 88 48 to 300 however based on the wqi value the water can be categorized into five types which are from excellent water to unsuitable proper treatment required before use suggested by ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 the computed water classes and percentages of the area are shown in fig 8 this illustration reflects that the water of the river falls in different classes most of the water found poor water quality which percentage is about 72 whereas the rest 16 and 12 of water sampling stations exhibit good and very poor water quality respectively the lowest wqi value has been recorded at station 4 indicating the low level of contamination table 8 this station categorized as class 2 in very goodwater quality other 3 stations such as 1 3 and 24 are categorized as good quality water in the area from this table 8 it has been observed that stations 1 3 and 4 are situated at the upstream area of the river besides the station 24 located at downstream area shows good water quality hence these results imply low contamination of water in the area compared to the other sampling areas the very good and good water quality stations have been labeled by yellow color shown in fig 9 the higher value of wqi has been observed at stations 11 17 and 18 table 8 these stations belong to the quality class 4 consequently categorized as very poor quality water this scenario illustrates the high level of contamination table 8 as these areas received various pollutants from different sources like surface runoff animal and human wastes drainage system discharge into river domestic pollutants local market rice mill pollutants and so on the other stations are classified as category 3 actually 18 stations out of 25 stations are categorized in poor water quality these stations are situated in upstream middle stream and downstream part of the river the middle stream portion of the sampling stations of the river shows more poor water quality the another stations as the sampling locations are located in the scc area which is densely populated and busiest area than others another reason is also found that natural charas are directly discharge into the river water most remarkable 2 charas such as namely goalichara and mongolichara are located at station 15 and station 17 respectively also there are many charas have been found along the boundary of sylhet city corporation the station 14 15 17 20 and 21 are much closed to the boundary charas fig 9 the water quality in this area shows poor quality moreover some charas are also found at some selected stations such as stations 4 8 11 and 12 in the upper stream region from table 9 it has been observed that almost all the parameters of water are below the standard limit only do cod and turbidity values are above the standard limit moreover it is observed that the wqi value of surmariver is 152 017 which can be classified as poor water quality behind this condition some parameters like turbidity cod and iron are poorly responsible based onqnwn values finally this study has been plotted the quality of water on base map fig 10 and strongly recommends the proper treatments of the river water before its different uses 4 conclusions and recommendations 4 1 conclusions being concerned about estimating the present status of the water quality of surma river 25 water samples from different stations had been analyzed in the laboratory following the methods proposed by american public health association apha 1998 for assessing 14 water quality parameters such as do bod cod alkalinity water ph conductivity turbidity ts tss tds hardness iron chloride and co2 the physicochemical analysis shows that most of the water samples were with exceeded amount of bod cod turbidity tss and co2 beyond the standard limit correlation matrix analysis shows a strong positive correlation among ts tds ts tss ts ec tss ec co2 cod turbidity iron ec iron ec chloride iron chloride and ec co2 and strong negative correlation different pairs such as do ec 0 704 do iron 0 645 do chloride 0 522 do co2 0 701 factor analysis reveals that 78 8 of the total variance can be explained by considering five factors the plotting of factor 1 vs factor 2 and factor 1 vs factor 3 show that the pollution sources of the analyzed variables are almost similar the analysis and observation suggest that the river water quality is primarily influenced by industrial wastes sewage pollution surface runoff organic compound and agricultural activities the water quality index wqi analysis has identified that most of the water samples are in poor quality these may be the cumulative results of the discharge containing different types of pollutants like sewage garbage disposal hospital wastes etc from different natural charas and drainage system which are directly connected to the river as a result water of surmariver is getting alarmingly polluted day by day 4 2 recommendations it s well known to all that water pollution cannot be completely stopped but it can be prevented from pollution by taking some necessary steps such as making people aware of the water pollution problem through electronic media like radio television social media e g facebook twitter etc identify polluter by engaging the monitoring committee and should be punished by paying large amount of money or any other accountable punishment the disposal of municipal solid waste to the sewerage system should be monitored strictly and anybody who are doing such unwise and thoughtless tasks hospital wastes that may contain several harmful materials should not be disposed here and there or as the methods adopted for general municipal solid waste industries should be installed water treatment plant to remove contaminants from their effluents and wastewater before being disposed to streams industrial polluters must be taken under law to pay due to the compensation of additional cost for the treatment of the water body that is contaminated by them city corporation area must install sewage treatment plants for cleaning up the sewage before discharges the illegal buildings and deployment of the structures towards the river should be destroyed and the rampant flow of the river water must be ensured the government city corporation should engageda strong authority to monitor water quality of the river with necessary legal measures against the indiscriminate discharge of waste sewage and effluents for future management of the water environment of the surmariver declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
