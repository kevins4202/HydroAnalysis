reduction in continuous negative pressure and stable water supply npi relative to intermittent positive pressure water supply di maize root dry matter accumulation and root shoot ratio in npi was 20 22 34 15 and lower than di respectively yield was 44 10 higher than di and superoxide anion malonic dialdehyde osmotic adjustment substance content and antioxidant enzyme activity was reduced next we applied liquid chromatography mass spectrometry gas chromatography mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance to perform non targeted metabolomics analysis with the aim of elucidating the physiological basis of root redundant growth restriction results revealed presence of 33 different metabolites in npi belonging to different categories including organic acids and their derivatives nucleosides nucleotides and their corresponding analogues lipids and lipid like molecules as well as organic oxygen compounds moreover all these were enriched in 44 metabolic pathways relative to di notably metabolic pathways biosynthesis of secondary metabolites starch and sucrose metabolism plant hormones biosynthesis and biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites might restrict maize roots

di this might inhibit root redundant growth in summary continuous negative pressure and stable water supply inhibited maize root redundant growth restriction by suppressing sugar metabolism and protein synthesis via genetic information transmission keywords growth maize roots metabolomics negative pressure water supply northeast china data availability all raw data are in the support material compression package 1 introduction different types of abiotic stresses such as salinity and drought which can alter a plant s physiological and biochemical traits gene expression pattern proteomic profile and yield are considered the two main plant stressors in the world jamshidi et al 2018 2019a 2019b 2020a 2020b maryam et al 2019 in recent years climate change has worsened worldwide leading to frequent occurrence of droughts and a surge in global surface temperature khan et al 2021 limited irrigation water is a key constraint to agricultural production piotr et al 2019 sandhu and irmak 2019 thus development of effective water saving irrigation technologies is imperative to addressing shortages in water for agriculture development of the negative pressure technology based on crop initiate drawing water cidw theory in the past 2 decades has attracted numerous research interest long et al 2020 negative pressure irrigation system npi induces root growth at the water supply point and keeps the distance within effective moisture range long et al 2020 thereby coordinating root water extraction and npi water supply this water supply mode has been shown to guarantee stable and continuous soil water supply li et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 which is significantly different from the intermittent soil water supply in conventional irrigation zhang 2020 the plants root system not only facilitates moisture and nutrient uptake but is also an important part of plant response to soil moisture changes zhang et al 2009 chen et al 2018 temporal soil moisture varies widely with irrigation methods wang et al 2020 thereby generating different impacts on plant root growth and physiology hu et al 2009 chen et al 2018 previous studies have shown that although moderate drought promotes plant root growth it significantly reduces the number of lateral roots faucon et al 2017 in fact prolonged drought and waterlogging have been shown to limit growth of plant roots and reduce accumulation of dry matter bisbis et al 2018 wang et al 2019 under insufficient irrigation conditions plant root distribution is limited to moist areas a phenomenon that significantly reduces their growth ma et al 2019 2020 to date the status of plant roots growth under stable and continuous water supply by npi remains unclear notably maize is more sensitive to changes in soil water content and its root growth is greatly affected by various irrigation methods zhang et al 2021 therefore unraveling the mechanisms underlying growth physiology and metabolism of maize roots under various temporal variations in soil water supply has important theoretical significance in elucidating the interaction between plant roots and soil moisture temporal variations in soil moisture significantly impact plant root growth and metabolism harb et al 2010 notably reduced soil water content has been implicated in drought stress thereby promoting root growth and enhancing the root shoot ratio additionally proline soluble sugars glutamate polyols and glycine betaine metabolites accumulate in large quantities to improve drought resistance sun et al 2015 2016 previous studies have identified that different metabolic pathways that reduce soil water content and induce expression of the citric acid cycle glycolysis sugar synthesis carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in wheat javier et al 2015 guo et al 2018 notably soluble carbohydrates amino acids amines and polyols represent the main differential metabolites in maize that sense lack of soil moisture sun et al 2016 liu et al 2020 in rice excessive soil water content was found to significantly impact carbon metabolism thereby causing insufficient plant energy and restricting growth xiong et al 2019a 2019b since npi stabilizes the soil moisture content and maintains an unsaturated state it can continuously supply water based on crops requirement which is markedly different from drought and waterlogging sun et al 2016 shengping et al 2021 although zhang et al 2021a applied transcriptome analysis to identify the key genes affecting root growth under negative pressure irrigation their findings had several limitations for example not all up regulated genes can lead to an increase in metabolites and proteins steven et al 1999 while not all metabolites or proteins do affect corn root growth sumner et al 2003 differential metabolite expression has been shown to reveal the physiological mechanism that inhibits redundant growth of maize roots a perspective that is significantly different from up regulation and down regulation of genes identified via transcriptomics huang 2013 mitchell et al 2014 previous studies have shown that metabolic changes can more effectively reflect the physiological mechanism underlying continuous negative pressure water supply to limit root redundant growth than gene expression analysis wei et al 2020 michael et al 2015 to the best of our knowledge no research has described metabolic profiles in the maize root in response to continuous negative pressure water supply metabolomics is an important tool for analyzing plant responses to various environmental stresses benevenuto et al 2017 xiong et al 2019a 2019b for example tang et al 2017 used metabolic profiling based on mass spectrometry to identify numerous metabolites in maize thereby unraveling the underlying mechanisms of root response to negative pressure irrigation in the present study we hypothesized that stable and continuous water supply could be limiting redundant growth of maize roots in relation to regulation of synthesis of functional metabolites via genetic information transmission therefore we applied non targeted metabolomics analysis to elucidate the physiological mechanism underlying response of maize to stable and continuous water supply subsequently we analyzed the role of different metabolites from the maize root system under this condition and identified the key metabolites that limit redundant growth collectively our results revealed the effect of stable and continuous water supply on the maize root growth as well as the underlying metabolic and physiological mechanism that limit redundant growth of crop roots under this water supply method 2 materials and methods 2 1 test materials all experiments were performed in 2020 under a rainproof shed at heilongjiang bayi agricultural

variability of soil water content wang et al 2020 and soil moisture is critical to crop development and yield yang et al 2020 drip irrigation causes the soil water content to alternate between dry and wet cycles during the growing season while negative pressure continuous and stable water supply maintains a relatively stable soil moisture content zhang et al 2021a the effect of soil water content time variation on maize root system growth is highly distinct xiang et al 2021 negative pressure irrigation systems can provide continuous and uninterrupted water supply dependent on plant water intake while also maintaining a relatively stable soil moisture content throughout the growing season long et al 2020 shengping et al 2021 in the present study we elucidated the underlying metabolic and physiological mechanism of npi treatment under negative pressure continuous and stable water supply on the reduction of redundant growth of maize roots the results revealed significantly reduced dry matter accumulation in maize root systems similar results in 2018 and 2019 table s2 which subsequently restricted the redundant growth of the root system this effect was completely different from that reported in conventional irrigation on root growth dawid et al 2019 sun et al 2016 although npi inhibited root redundant growth dry matter accumulation in the shoots and yield significantly increased reducing the root shoot ratio relative to di wang and guan 2013 wang et al 2020 when compared to previous reports this study discovered that despite the different measurement times the results of npi inhibiting maize roots redundant growth were consistent zhang et al 2021b believed that this is due to npi creating favorable growing conditions for maize wang and guan 2013 because redundant root growth is discouraged it reduced photosynthetic product consumption and it is beneficial above ground for acquiring more photosynthetic products therefore above ground growth was promoted and the root to shoot ratio was decreased shang et al 2019 this indicates that a steady and stable water supply under negative pressure increases the transfer of photosynthetic products to grains hence reducing ineffective photosynthetic product consumption in the root system water stress can result in the accumulation of high levels of superoxide anion in the plant resulting in membrane lipid peroxidation and an increase in mda content alireza et al 2020 also it was specified that mda can be considered as an index for the lipid peroxidation and tolerance in different plants under various types of abiotic stresses such as salinity and drought jamshidi et al 2019b 2020c our results showed that npi treatment resulted in significantly lower superoxide anion and mda content in roots than di treatment indicating that the continuous and stable water supply conditions created by the negative pressure irrigation system did not cause water stress in maize roots peroxidase pod polyphenol oxidase ppo ascorbate peroxidase apx are all important antioxidants that contribute to the reduction of reactive oxygen species ros and their activities increase significantly under conditions of water stress ashraf 2009 johnson et al 2003 results of the present study found that npi treatment significantly decreased the activity of three antioxidant enzymes in maize compared to di treatment which was associated with a significant drop in the superoxide anion concentration of the roots following npi treatment proline is an important small molecule in plant response to water stress and has been shown to play a crucial role in ros removal and protection of membrane integrity shilpi and narendra 2005 additionally previous research has demonstrated that when plants are stressed by water their soluble protein soluble sugar and proline content significantly increase and these changes can be used as indicators of water stress in plants farooq et al 2009 in the present study maize treated with npi had considerably lower proline soluble protein and soluble sugar concentrations than maize treated with di showing that the maize root system was not subjected to water stress maize roots are always in a stable and suitable soil moisture content controlled by npi which may explain why growth is restricted and reduced dry matter accumulation zhang et al 2021b this test has a source of inaccuracy due to temperature variations high temperatures can disrupt the negative pressure control system which can result in an increase in water supply by npi when high temperatures are encountered in subsequent research the npi equipment can be shaded or sprayed to keep it cool to the best of our knowledge this is the first metabolomics study reporting differential metabolite expression in maize roots following experimentally negative pressure continuous and stable water supply by npi changes in all small molecule metabolites at the root tip were detected using a liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer lc ms gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and these were then subsequently identified using bioinformatics analysis the pathway analysis of differentially expressed metabolites revealed the physiological functions of the identified metabolites whereas metabolomics analysis established underlying physiological mechanisms of negative pressure continuous and stable water supply in limiting root growth it is important to reveal the interaction mechanism between soil moisture and plant roots kegg enrichment analysis of metabolites showed that metabolic pathways and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites pathway enriched more differential metabolites support material 3 suggesting that the two pathways may be closely related to limiting maize roots redundant growth there were four up regulated metabolites in metabolic pathways including glutamic acid l glutamine glutamine zeatin and their accumulation was up regulated by 4 62 4 13 4 26 4 06 times respectively there were 8 down regulated metabolites including flavin mononucleotide sucrose adenine deoxyguanosine isoleucine 2 deoxyadenosine trehalose citraconic acid and their accumulation was down regulated by 0 25 0 28 0 21 0 23 0 004 0 05 0 34 and 0 21 times respectively in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites pathway there were 2 up regulation metabolites including glutamic acid and zeatin accumulation up regulate by 4 62 and 4 04 times there were 5 down regulation metabolites including flavin mononucleotide isoleucine trehalose z farnesol ajmaline and its accumulation down regulate by 0 25 0 004 0 34 0 21 and 0 17 times respectively by combining the previous transcriptome research results zhang et al 2021a 2021b these metabolites may be closely related to the suppression of the maize root system s redundant growth sugar is a source of energy for plants and can act as a signaling molecule during their growth previous research has established that variations in the amount of free sugar in maize roots regulate the expression of growth regulating genes gibson 2005 sridevi et al 2020 additionally sucrose and trehalose whose final metabolic product is glucose are important intermediate metabolites in starch and sucrose metabolism notably earlier research has established that glucose sucrose and trehalose modulate plant growth saraí et al 2021 sridevi et al 2020 with trehalose accumulation found to be positively correlated with plant growth paweł et al 2014 the resulted indicated that trehalose levels were revealed significantly downregulated which may have inhibited maize roots redundant growth sucrose and trehalose deficiency may also promote the expression of genes that inhibit root growth sridevi et al 2020 reducing the accumulation of dry matter in roots under negative pressure continuous and stable water supply therefore trehalose may be a key metabolite regulating maize roots response to negative pressure continuous and stable water supply flavin mononucleotide participates in electron transfer during plant respiration it is involved in atp generation and serves as a signaling molecule for plants to detect changes in their external environment patrick et al 2020 flavin mononucleotide is involved in the synthesis of plant auxin during the plant growth and development process mitsuhiro and takatoshi 2006 has a significant effect on cell division and elongation and plays an important role in regulating plant growth and development sun et al 2009 according to the findings of this study flavin mononucleotide accumulation was significantly down regulated possibly due to decreased atp production and inadequate energy for root growth judy 2009 simultaneously auxin synthesis is reduced cell division and cell elongation are inhibited and root growth is inhibited sun et al 2009 citraconic acids involved in the energy generating process of the tca cycle its accumulation significantly reduces the efficiency of the plant s energy metabolism which is detrimental to plant growth zhang et al 2016 citraconic acid accumulation in the maize root system is significantly reduced under negative pressure continuous water supply conditions this could be because the maize root energy production process is inhibited resulting in insufficient energy for corn growth and significantly reduced root dry matter accumulation increased amino acid content is thought to be the result of suppressed plant protein synthesis or decomposition indeed earlier research has established that reduced protein synthesis impairs normal plant growth good and zaplachinski 1994 joshi et al 2010 the present study revealed significant upregulation of various amino acids and their derivatives including glutamic acid aspartate glutamine beta alanyl l lysine and l methionine in the maize root system probably due to reduced root protein synthesis which may significantly contribute to root growth inhibition glutamine is the primary nitrogen fixing molecule in plants increasing its relative accumulation is conducive to the maize above ground growth and it can significantly reduce maize root biomass and depth growth svennerstam et al 2007 l glutamine has been shown to significantly inhibit redundant root system growth and improve the root system s absorption and transport ability hassan et al 2020 this is related to the strengthening of root transporters which is consistent with the findings of transcriptomics studies zhang et al 2021a because l glutamine is involved in the digestion of nh4 to generate amino acids its relative accumulation can promote the accumulation of amino acids in the root system thereby inhibiting root growth xun et al 2020 isoleucine maintains a relative balance with l methionine and threonine through threonine deaminase and methionine c lyase notably low isoleucine levels have been implicated in suppressed plant growth joshi et al 2010 low isoleucine content which would have an inhibitory effect on various metabolic processes using isoleucine such as tissue repair and nitrogen metabolism li et al 2020 continued protein synthesis under isoleucine deficiency would ultimately result in a metabolic disorder and impair plant growth li et al 2020 our results indicate that negative pressure continuous and stable water supply significantly downregulated isoleucine levels in comparison to di treatment thereby affecting the synthesis of root protein leading to insufficient protein quantity required for root growth it has been shown to drastically impair maize root growth li et al 2020 glutamic acid as a signal molecule that regulates plant growth has the most obvious impact on root growth and development zhang et al 2017 almost all amino acids have been found to impede plant root growth however glutamic acid has been demonstrated to make plant root cells more susceptible to programmed cell death bonner et al 1996 the arabidopsis thaliana studies results show that the reason why glutamic acid significantly inhibits root growth is to inhibit the division of root tip meristems hence inhibiting root growth liu et al 2006 while glutamic acid s inhibitory effect on root growth is genetically determined changes in the external environment act as triggers for its accumulation brian 2014 the negative pressure continuous and stable water supply increased glutamic acid accumulation in the corn root system which is a significant reason for the maize root system s growth inhibition zeatin is synthesized primarily in the root system and an appropriate amount of zeatin promotes cell division and shoot initiation previous research has established a negative correlation between zeatin content and root growth with high zeatin levels inhibiting root growth zhang et al 2019 zeatin is a group of cytokinins comprised of cis zeatin and trans zeatin and the trans zeatin is cis zeatin isomers or other highly active cytokinins martin et al 2015 although zeatin is closely related to plant growth and development its effects on plant roots and buds are significantly different jan et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 trans zeatin is a highly active cytokinin increasing its relative accumulation promotes plant shoot growth and inhibits root growth hallmark et al 2020 werner et al 2001 the present study discovered that relative trans zeatin levels increased 4 05 times which may have contributed to maize root redundant growth inhibition cytokinin biosynthesis is the prenylation of adenine nucleotides martin et al 2015 cytokinin is degraded by oxidase dehydrogenase into adenine and the equivalent side chain aldehyde the concentration of these two molecules in plant tissues is inversely associated jan et al 2007 it is well established that active cytokinins suppress root growth stenlid 2006 in this study the adenine relative accumulation was down regulated whereas zeatin was significantly up regulated thereby inhibiting the growth of corn roots hallmark et al 2020 furthermore 2 deoxyadenosine is involved in the transmission of cell genetic information protein and atp synthesis as well as sugar metabolism xiong et al 2019a deoxyguanosine is a physiological compound that can impede the mitotic process and exert a significant inhibitory effect on plant cell division brulfert et al 1974 2 deoxyadenosine causes spindles dysfunction at the end of mitosis and finally inhibits the progress of cell division becerra and carmona 1983 2 deoxyadenosine accumulation downregulation will also reduce atp enzyme activity it may suppress the synthesis of proteins and carbohydrates inhibit energy metabolism blocks cytokinesis by hindering vesicle coalescence directly thus limiting root growth becerra and carmona 1983 good and zaplachinski 1994 high concentration of z farnesol is toxic to plant cells but its effect on plant growth and development is still unclear fitzpatrick et al 2011 the results of this study indicate that under negative pressure continuous and stable water supply the relative accumulation of z farnesol was significantly down regulated implying that it may be associated with the inhibition of corn root growth ajmaline is a tryptophan derived secondary metabolite tzin and galili 2010 it consists primarily of indole alkaloids which are biosynthesized from the aromatic acid tryptophan eashan et al 2020 ajmaline has important medicinal value and its accumulation will have a profound effect on the physiological functioning of animals and plants ruben and carlos 1974 ajmaline inhibits the electron transfer mechanism in plant energy metabolism thereby affecting the synthesis and transport of plant atp and inhibiting plant energy metabolism michael et al 1994 ruben and carlos 1974 ajmaline accumulates in the root system due to its high downregulation which may result in insufficient energy for root growth hence limiting root growth eliel et al 2009 in addition it was downregulated implying that tryptophan biosynthesis was suppressed which may have an effect on auxin synthesis and suppress maize root growth parviz et al 2018 in this study the low level of ajmaline accumulation in the root system may be one of the reasons for the inhibition of maize root system growth lipids and lipid like molecules play a role in signal transduction during plants response to environmental stimuli jiang et al 2009 adaptive responses to varying soil water content include changes in the expression of these signaling molecules xiong et al 2019b our findings indicated that linoleic acid and colnelenic acid levels were significantly decreased during maize root system adaptation to the stable soil water content environment in addition pyrimidine metabolism is directly linked to plant energy metabolism yang et al 2010 whereas overexpression of cytidine a small molecule inhibitor may inhibit pyrimidine metabolism thereby reducing energy availability for root growth and significantly reducing dry matter accumulation additionally we found significant upregulation of quinic acid naphthalene and cis 5 8 11 14 eicosatetraenoic acid in plants treated with npi versus di implying a probable relationship with root system inhibition or a decreased root shoot ratio although the main pathway for auxin synthesis is unknown wright et al 1991 tryptophan is directly engaged in auxin synthesis pollmann et al 2002 suggesting that tryptophan may reduce root redundant growth by inhibiting auxin synthesis in summary the physiological mechanism underlying root growth restriction under stable soil water content comprises regulation of hormones sugar metabolism and protein synthesis through genetic information transmission this study implies that by regulating the maize physiological metabolic process negative pressure continuous water supply can affect the accumulation of specific metabolites inhibiting root redundant growth and facilitating photosynthetic products distribution into the grain increasing the yield zhang and zhang 2000 in the future we will investigate the key metabolites that regulate plant root growth under different water supply pressures including persistent drought conditions through an in depth exploration of the plants physiological mechanisms underlying negative pressure continuous water supply in plants we will analyze the negative pressure continuous water supply to increase crop yield potential from the perspective of soil nutrients microbial communities and plant nutrition zhang et al 2021a this will provide theoretical support for establishing scientific water management measures in crop cultivation as well as lay the foundation for the development of non traditional water saving irrigation practices zhang et al 2021b 5 conclusion in comparison to intermittent positive pressure water supply negative pressure continuous and stable water supply limits maize root redundant growth and reduces the root shoot ratio notably when compared to di npi treatment significantly suppresses antioxidant enzyme activity and reduces superoxide anion mda and osmotic adjustment substances in maize roots but does not cause water stress non targeted metabolomics analysis revealed that npi induces differential metabolite expression which is enriched in metabolic pathways biosynthesis of secondary metabolites biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites biosynthesis of plant hormones abc transporters biosynthesis of amino acids and purine metabolism these metabolic pathways were found to be associated with the inhibition of redundant root growth additionally negative pressure continuous and stable water supply significantly upregulated the relative accumulation of glutamic acid glutamine quinic acid and zeatin while significantly decreasing the relative accumulation of pyroglutamic acid isoleucine sucrose 2 deoxyadenosine and ajmaline compared to di treatment the relative accumulation of these metabolites may affect the transmission of genetic information in maize roots as well as sugar metabolism hormone synthesis signal transduction and protein synthesis thereby suppressing their redundant growth the underlying physiological mechanism behind the effect of negative pressure continuous and stable water supply on redundant root growth restriction in maize is regulated by trehalose 2 deoxyadenosine isoleucine and ajmaline funding the study was supported by the national key research and development program of china 2018yfe0112300

9645,metabolomics analysis was used to elucidate the mechanism underlying response of the maize root system to continuous negative pressure and stable water supply results showed a significant reduction in continuous negative pressure and stable water supply npi relative to intermittent positive pressure water supply di maize root dry matter accumulation and root shoot ratio in npi was 20 22 34 15 and lower than di respectively yield was 44 10 higher than di and superoxide anion malonic dialdehyde osmotic adjustment substance content and antioxidant enzyme activity was reduced next we applied liquid chromatography mass spectrometry gas chromatography mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance to perform non targeted metabolomics analysis with the aim of elucidating the physiological basis of root redundant growth restriction results revealed presence of 33 different metabolites in npi belonging to different categories including organic acids and their derivatives nucleosides nucleotides and their corresponding analogues lipids and lipid like molecules as well as organic oxygen compounds moreover all these were enriched in 44 metabolic pathways relative to di notably metabolic pathways biosynthesis of secondary metabolites starch and sucrose metabolism plant hormones biosynthesis and biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites might restrict maize roots growth in npi was trehalose 2 deoxyadenosine isoleucine and ajmaline were 0 34 0 05 0 004 and 0 17 fold lower than di whereas glutamic acid glutamine and zeatin were 4 62 4 26 4 06 times higher than di this might inhibit root redundant growth in summary continuous negative pressure and stable water supply inhibited maize root redundant growth restriction by suppressing sugar metabolism and protein synthesis via genetic information transmission keywords growth maize roots metabolomics negative pressure water supply northeast china data availability all raw data are in the support material compression package 1 introduction different types of abiotic stresses such as salinity and drought which can alter a plant s physiological and biochemical traits gene expression pattern proteomic profile and yield are considered the two main plant stressors in the world jamshidi et al 2018 2019a 2019b 2020a 2020b maryam et al 2019 in recent years climate change has worsened worldwide leading to frequent occurrence of droughts and a surge in global surface temperature khan et al 2021 limited irrigation water is a key constraint to agricultural production piotr et al 2019 sandhu and irmak 2019 thus development of effective water saving irrigation technologies is imperative to addressing shortages in water for agriculture development of the negative pressure technology based on crop initiate drawing water cidw theory in the past 2 decades has attracted numerous research interest long et al 2020 negative pressure irrigation system npi induces root growth at the water supply point and keeps the distance within effective moisture range long et al 2020 thereby coordinating root water extraction and npi water supply this water supply mode has been shown to guarantee stable and continuous soil water supply li et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 which is significantly different from the intermittent soil water supply in conventional irrigation zhang 2020 the plants root system not only facilitates moisture and nutrient uptake but is also an important part of plant response to soil moisture changes zhang et al 2009 chen et al 2018 temporal soil moisture varies widely with irrigation methods wang et al 2020 thereby generating different impacts on plant root growth and physiology hu et al 2009 chen et al 2018 previous studies have shown that although moderate drought promotes plant root growth it significantly reduces the number of lateral roots faucon et al 2017 in fact prolonged drought and waterlogging have been shown to limit growth of plant roots and reduce accumulation of dry matter bisbis et al 2018 wang et al 2019 under insufficient irrigation conditions plant root distribution is limited to moist areas a phenomenon that significantly reduces their growth ma et al 2019 2020 to date the status of plant roots growth under stable and continuous water supply by npi remains unclear notably maize is more sensitive to changes in soil water content and its root growth is greatly affected by various irrigation methods zhang et al 2021 therefore unraveling the mechanisms underlying growth physiology and metabolism of maize roots under various temporal variations in soil water supply has important theoretical significance in elucidating the interaction between plant roots and soil moisture temporal variations in soil moisture significantly impact plant root growth and metabolism harb et al 2010 notably reduced soil water content has been implicated in drought stress thereby promoting root growth and enhancing the root shoot ratio additionally proline soluble sugars glutamate polyols and glycine betaine metabolites accumulate in large quantities to improve drought resistance sun et al 2015 2016 previous studies have identified that different metabolic pathways that reduce soil water content and induce expression of the citric acid cycle glycolysis sugar synthesis carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in wheat javier et al 2015 guo et al 2018 notably soluble carbohydrates amino acids amines and polyols represent the main differential metabolites in maize that sense lack of soil moisture sun et al 2016 liu et al 2020 in rice excessive soil water content was found to significantly impact carbon metabolism thereby causing insufficient plant energy and restricting growth xiong et al 2019a 2019b since npi stabilizes the soil moisture content and maintains an unsaturated state it can continuously supply water based on crops requirement which is markedly different from drought and waterlogging sun et al 2016 shengping et al 2021 although zhang et al 2021a applied transcriptome analysis to identify the key genes affecting root growth under negative pressure irrigation their findings had several limitations for example not all up regulated genes can lead to an increase in metabolites and proteins steven et al 1999 while not all metabolites or proteins do affect corn root growth sumner et al 2003 differential metabolite expression has been shown to reveal the physiological mechanism that inhibits redundant growth of maize roots a perspective that is significantly different from up regulation and down regulation of genes identified via transcriptomics huang 2013 mitchell et al 2014 previous studies have shown that metabolic changes can more effectively reflect the physiological mechanism underlying continuous negative pressure water supply to limit root redundant growth than gene expression analysis wei et al 2020 michael et al 2015 to the best of our knowledge no research has described metabolic profiles in the maize root in response to continuous negative pressure water supply metabolomics is an important tool for analyzing plant responses to various environmental stresses benevenuto et al 2017 xiong et al 2019a 2019b for example tang et al 2017 used metabolic profiling based on mass spectrometry to identify numerous metabolites in maize thereby unraveling the underlying mechanisms of root response to negative pressure irrigation in the present study we hypothesized that stable and continuous water supply could be limiting redundant growth of maize roots in relation to regulation of synthesis of functional metabolites via genetic information transmission therefore we applied non targeted metabolomics analysis to elucidate the physiological mechanism underlying response of maize to stable and continuous water supply subsequently we analyzed the role of different metabolites from the maize root system under this condition and identified the key metabolites that limit redundant growth collectively our results revealed the effect of stable and continuous water supply on the maize root growth as well as the underlying metabolic and physiological mechanism that limit redundant growth of crop roots under this water supply method 2 materials and methods 2 1 test materials all experiments were performed in 2020 under a rainproof shed at heilongjiang bayi agricultural

changes in soil moisture content from 50 to 100 fc was completed in two hours the second group namely npi comprised continuous negative pressure and stable water supply treatment here the negative pressure irrigation system was used to continuously and stably supply water according to the demand of maize growth and development xiao et al 2015 wang et al 2016 li et al 2017 water supply pressure was set to 5 kpa long et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 the equipment for the npi system was designed and patented by the chinese academy of agricultural sciences patent for invention zl201110093923 2 and

the 4 cm long root tip was used for determination of physiological indicators while the 1 cm long one was used as a candidate sample for extraction of metabolites all samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen for 30 min then immediately transferred to a freezer 80 to until determination of physiological index three maize plants were selected for each treatment whereas the remaining roots and aboveground parts were heated at 105 c for 30 min then dried to a constant weight at 70 c on the 31st day dry matter content was obtained by weighing electronic balance then water content in the root

significantly reduced dry matter content in maize roots and root to shoot ratio on the 31st day relative to di intermittent positive pressure water supply mode table 2 specifically maize under npi had a root dry matter accumulation that was 20 23 lower than di on the other hand maize under npi recorded 21 66 and 44 10 fold higher above ground dry matter accumulation and yield respectively than those under di notably the root shoot ratio in npi was 34 54 lower than di indicating that continuous negative pressure and stable water supply significantly restricts maize root redundant growth 2018 and 2019 results in table s2 3 2 superoxide anion mda content pod ppo and apx activity npi mediated a significant reduction in superoxide anion and mda contents in maize roots relative to di table 3 these results indicated that continuous negative pressure and stable water supply treatment neither caused water stress in the maize root system nor accumulation of superoxide anion and mda notably maize under npi showed significantly lower pod and ppo activities than those under di treatment between days 31 97 of exposure to continuous negative pressure and stable water supply treatment table 3 conversely maize under npi treatment recorded significantly lower apx activity than those under di between days 31 and 63 while apx activity was 1 1 lower in plants under npi treatment than those under di one at day 97 although the difference was not statistically significant 3 3 proline soluble protein and soluble sugar contents maize under npi treatment had significantly lower proline content than those under di treatment between days 31 97 indicating that continuous negative pressure and stable water supply may have significantly impacted its accumulation during the entire test period table 3 in addition maize under npi treatment exhibited lower soluble protein content than one between the 31st to 63rd day although the difference between both treatments was not statistically significant on the 97th day in addition maize under npi treatment recorded significantly lower soluble sugar content than those under di treatment between days 31 43 while the difference was not statistically significant between days 63 97 3 4 metabolomic profiles 3 4 1 differential metabolic ion screening spectrometry profiling revealed 6878 and 8238 ions based on positive and negative modes respectively in maize roots under npi treatment compared to those under di support material 1 univariate analysis of fold changes and t test used to identify differences in metabolic ions using fc 2

differentially expressed ions of which 735 and 704 were upregulated and downregulated respectively were identified in the negative ion mode fig 3a moreover 2534 metabolic ions were found to have accumulated in the root system of maize under npi which was significantly higher than that in di support material 2 npi vs di 3 4 2 principal component analysis pca of metabolite profiles pca results used to evaluate repeatability and stability of lc ms metabolite profiles stratified the metabolites into 2 irrigation treatments fig 3 b the first principal component pc1 was dominated by metabolites from both irrigation methods and explained 56 43 of the total variation in roots while the second pc2 explained 11 98 of variation in roots total for both 68 41 these reflected the difference between npi and di treatment overall these data indicated that stable soil moisture content significantly affected metabolites accumulation 3 4 3 metabolite identification and kegg annotation classification a total of 211 metabolites were identified across 2534 differentially expressed ions notably a total of 135 and 76 metabolites were upregulated and downregulated in npi relative to di fig 4 the upregulated metabolites fc 2 included 2 furancarboxylic acid naphthalene aspartate l glutamine shikimic acid leu gly valyl alanine quinic acid 4 4 methylenedianiline leu ala jasmonic acid 13 oxo 9 11 tridecadienoic acid 3 4 methylenesebacic acid and val asp downregulated metabolites fc 0 5 included calcein am succinic acid 3 methylbenzaldehyde citraconic acid adenine 2 2 thienyl furan 3 coumaric acid 4 hydroxyhippuric acid d pantothenic acid and pentadecanoic acid kegg annotation showed that the identified metabolites fall under 3 kegg categories namely environmental information processing genetic information processing and metabolism environmental information processing had 2 kegg subcategories membrane transport and signal transduction fig 5 and fig 6 genetic information processing only had the translation subcategory whereas metabolism comprised 11 kegg subcategories including amino acid metabolism biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites carbohydrate metabolism chemical structure transformation maps energy metabolism global and overview maps lipid metabolism metabolism of cofactors and vitamins metabolism of other amino acids metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides and nucleotide metabolism the global and overview maps were the most enriched in differential metabolites followed by amino acid metabolism and chemical structure transformation maps annotation of the identified metabolites resulted in 58 metabolic pathways support material 3 the enriched metabolites high to low in the top 36 metabolic pathways are shown in fig 6 metabolic pathways enriched in 5 kinds of metabolites included metabolic pathways biosynthesis of secondary metabolites biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites biosynthesis of plant hormones abc transporters biosynthesis of amino acids and pure metabolism these metabolic pathways may be important in the response of the maize root system to soil water stabilization these factors may contribute significantly to the maize root system s adaptation to a negative pressure continuous and stable water supply environment 3 4 4 analysis of enriched metabolites in important metabolic pathways metabolites enriched in the same metabolic pathway may perform the same or comparable biological functions in roots in response to stabilized soil water content the present study identified 26 differential metabolites in metabolic pathways including l glutamate succinate l aspartate flavin mononucleotide l glutamine l methionine sucrose adenine phosphatidylcholine arachidonate deoxyguanosine zeatin guanosine l isoleucine cytidine shikimate sphingomyelin deoxyadenosine phenylacetaldehyde naphthalene alpha alpha trehalose linoleate 2 methylmaleate 3 methylbenzaldehyde and jasmonic acid total the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites was enriched for 16 differential metabolites l glutamate succinate l aspartate flavin mononucleotide l methionine phosphatidylcholine zeatin l isoleucine shikimate alpha alpha trehalose 2z 6e farnesol ajmaline jasmonic acid traumatic acid colnelenic acid pheophorbide a the biosynthesis of ten differential plant secondary metabolites in plants including l glutamate succinate l aspartate l glutamine l methionine zeatin l isoleucine shikimate linoleate and jasmonic acid abc transporter pathway was enriched for 6 differential metabolites including l glutamate l aspartate l glutamine sucrose l isoleucine and alpha alpha trehalose additionally the amino acid biosynthesis pathway was enriched in 6 distinct metabolites l glutamate l aspartate l glutamine l methionine l isoleucine and shikimate whereas the purine metabolism pathway was enriched in 6 different metabolites l glutamine adenine deoxyguanosine guanosine deoxyadenosine and 3 5 cyclic gmp support material 3 each metabolite is involved in multiple metabolic pathways glutamic acid for example is involved in 20 metabolic pathways aspartate in 21 isoleucine in 12 glutamine in 11 and l methionine in 9 this suggests that these metabolites perform a variety of biological functions during the adaptation of roots to negative pressure continuous and stable water supply 3 4 5 differentially accumulated metabolites under negative pressure continuous and stable water supply results from univariate analysis and t test based on fold change fc criteria revealed 33 differentially expressed metabolites across 44 kegg metabolic pathways table 4 supporting material 3 these differentially expressed metabolites were divided into the following 8 categories organic acids and derivatives including 8 types glutamic acid beta alanyl l lysine aspartate glutamine l methionine pyroglutamic acid succinic acid and isoleucine organic oxygen compounds comprising 6 types quinic acid zeatin shikimic acid sucrose adenine and trehalose nucleosides nucleotides and analogues comprising 6 types deoxyguanosine cytidine 2 deoxyadenosine cyclic gmp flavin mononucleotide and guanosine benzenoids comprising 3 types phenylacetaldehyde naphthalene and 3 methylbenzaldehyde lipids and lipid like molecules including 7 types eicosatetraenoic acid jasmonic acid traumatic acid z farnesol linoleic acid citraconic acid and colnelenic acid alkaloids and their derivatives comprising 2 types trigonelline and ajmaline phenylpropanoids and polyketides including 2 types 3 coumaric acid and keracyanin and others category with only one pheophorbide a there were 17 upregulated metabolites and 16 downregulated metabolites among the 33 differently accumulated metabolites the upregulated metabolites fc 4 included l glutamate glutamine quinic acid and zeatin and were enriched in plant hormone signal transduction starch and sucrose metabolism and nitrogen metabolism downregulated metabolites fc 0 35 included pyroglutamic acid sucrose adenine trehalose 2 deoxyadenosine cyclic gmp flavin mononucleotide z farnesol citraconic acid and ajmaline furthermore these metabolites were found to be enriched in the starch and sucrose metabolism alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and the secondary metabolites biosynthesis pathway 4 discussion different irrigation methods have varying effects on the time variability of soil water content wang et al 2020 and soil moisture is critical to crop development and yield yang et al 2020 drip irrigation causes the soil water content to alternate between dry and wet cycles during the growing season while negative pressure continuous and stable water supply maintains a relatively stable soil moisture content zhang et al 2021a the effect of soil water content time variation on maize root system growth is highly distinct xiang et al 2021 negative pressure irrigation systems can provide continuous and uninterrupted water supply dependent on plant water intake while also maintaining a relatively stable soil moisture content throughout the growing season long et al 2020 shengping et al 2021 in the present study we elucidated the underlying metabolic and physiological mechanism of npi treatment under negative pressure continuous and stable water supply on the reduction of redundant growth of maize roots the results revealed significantly reduced dry matter accumulation in maize root systems similar results in 2018 and 2019 table s2 which subsequently restricted the redundant growth of the root system this effect was completely different from that reported in conventional irrigation on root growth dawid et al 2019 sun et al 2016 although npi inhibited root redundant growth dry matter accumulation in the shoots and yield significantly increased reducing the root shoot ratio relative to di wang and guan 2013 wang et al 2020 when compared to previous reports this study discovered that despite the different measurement times the results of npi inhibiting maize roots redundant growth were consistent zhang et al 2021b believed that this is due to npi creating favorable growing conditions for maize wang and guan 2013 because redundant root growth is discouraged it reduced photosynthetic product consumption and it is beneficial above ground for acquiring more photosynthetic products therefore above ground growth was promoted and the root to shoot ratio was decreased shang et al 2019 this indicates that a steady and stable water supply under negative pressure increases the transfer of photosynthetic products to grains hence reducing ineffective photosynthetic product consumption in the root system water stress can result in the accumulation of high levels of superoxide anion in the plant resulting in membrane lipid peroxidation and an increase in mda content alireza et al 2020 also it was specified that mda can be considered as an index for the lipid peroxidation and tolerance in different plants under various types of abiotic stresses such as salinity and drought jamshidi et al 2019b 2020c our results showed that npi treatment resulted in significantly lower superoxide anion and mda content in roots than di treatment indicating that the continuous and stable water supply conditions created by the negative pressure irrigation system did not cause water stress in maize roots peroxidase pod polyphenol oxidase ppo ascorbate peroxidase apx are all important antioxidants that contribute to the reduction of reactive oxygen species ros and their activities increase significantly under conditions of water stress ashraf 2009 johnson et al 2003 results of the present study found that npi treatment significantly decreased the activity of three antioxidant enzymes in maize compared to di treatment which was associated with a significant drop in the superoxide anion concentration of the roots following npi treatment proline is an important small molecule in plant response to water stress and has been shown to play a crucial role in ros removal and protection of membrane integrity shilpi and narendra 2005 additionally previous research has demonstrated that when plants are stressed by water their soluble protein soluble sugar and proline content significantly increase and these changes can be used as indicators of water stress in plants farooq et al 2009 in the present study maize treated with npi had considerably lower proline soluble protein and soluble sugar concentrations than maize treated with di showing that the maize root system was not subjected to water stress maize roots are always in a stable and suitable soil moisture content controlled by npi which may explain why growth is restricted and reduced dry matter accumulation zhang et al 2021b this test has a source of inaccuracy due to temperature variations high temperatures can disrupt the negative pressure control system which can result in an increase in water supply by npi when high temperatures are encountered in subsequent research the npi equipment can be shaded or sprayed to keep it cool to the best of our knowledge this is the first metabolomics study reporting differential metabolite expression in maize roots following experimentally negative pressure continuous and stable water supply by npi changes in all small molecule metabolites at the root tip were detected using a liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer lc ms gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and these were then subsequently identified using bioinformatics analysis the pathway analysis of differentially expressed metabolites revealed the physiological functions of the identified metabolites whereas metabolomics analysis established underlying physiological mechanisms of negative pressure continuous and stable water supply in limiting root growth it is important to reveal the interaction mechanism between soil moisture and plant roots kegg enrichment analysis of metabolites showed that metabolic pathways and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites pathway enriched more differential metabolites support material 3 suggesting that the two pathways may be closely related to limiting maize roots redundant growth there were four up regulated metabolites in metabolic pathways including glutamic acid l glutamine glutamine zeatin and their accumulation was up regulated by 4 62 4 13 4 26 4 06 times respectively there were 8 down regulated metabolites including flavin mononucleotide sucrose adenine deoxyguanosine isoleucine 2 deoxyadenosine trehalose citraconic acid and their accumulation was down regulated by 0 25 0 28 0 21 0 23 0 004 0 05 0 34 and 0 21 times respectively in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites pathway there were 2 up regulation metabolites including glutamic acid and zeatin accumulation up regulate by 4 62 and 4 04 times there were 5 down regulation metabolites including flavin mononucleotide isoleucine trehalose z farnesol ajmaline and its accumulation down regulate by 0 25 0 004 0 34 0 21 and 0 17 times respectively by combining the previous transcriptome research results zhang et al 2021a 2021b these metabolites may be closely related to the suppression of the maize root system s redundant growth sugar is a source of energy for plants and can act as a signaling molecule during their growth previous research has established that variations in the amount of free sugar in maize roots regulate the expression of growth regulating genes gibson 2005 sridevi et al 2020 additionally sucrose and trehalose whose final metabolic product is glucose are important intermediate metabolites in starch and sucrose metabolism notably earlier research has established that glucose sucrose and trehalose modulate plant growth saraí et al 2021 sridevi et al 2020 with trehalose accumulation found to be positively correlated with plant growth paweł et al 2014 the resulted indicated that trehalose levels were revealed significantly downregulated which may have inhibited maize roots redundant growth sucrose and trehalose deficiency may also promote the expression of genes that inhibit root growth sridevi et al 2020 reducing the accumulation of dry matter in roots under negative pressure continuous and stable water supply therefore trehalose may be a key metabolite regulating maize roots response to negative pressure continuous and stable water supply flavin mononucleotide participates in electron transfer during plant respiration it is involved in atp generation and serves as a signaling molecule for plants to detect changes in their external environment patrick et al 2020 flavin mononucleotide is involved in the synthesis of plant auxin during the plant growth and development process mitsuhiro and takatoshi 2006 has a significant effect on cell division and elongation and plays an important role in regulating plant growth and development sun et al 2009 according to the findings of this study flavin mononucleotide accumulation was significantly down regulated possibly due to decreased atp production and inadequate energy for root growth judy 2009 simultaneously auxin synthesis is reduced cell division and cell elongation are inhibited and root growth is inhibited sun et al 2009 citraconic acids involved in the energy generating process of the tca cycle its accumulation significantly reduces the efficiency of the plant s energy metabolism which is detrimental to plant growth zhang et al 2016 citraconic acid accumulation in the maize root system is significantly reduced under negative pressure continuous water supply conditions this could be because the maize root energy production process is inhibited resulting in insufficient energy for corn growth and significantly reduced root dry matter accumulation increased amino acid content is thought to be the result of suppressed plant protein synthesis or decomposition indeed earlier research has established that reduced protein synthesis impairs normal plant growth good and zaplachinski 1994 joshi et al 2010 the present study revealed significant upregulation of various amino acids and their derivatives including glutamic acid aspartate glutamine beta alanyl l lysine and l methionine in the maize root system probably due to reduced root protein synthesis which may significantly contribute to root growth inhibition glutamine is the primary nitrogen fixing molecule in plants increasing its relative accumulation is conducive to the maize above ground growth and it can significantly reduce maize root biomass and depth growth svennerstam et al 2007 l glutamine has been shown to significantly inhibit redundant root system growth and improve the root system s absorption and transport ability hassan et al 2020 this is related to the strengthening of root transporters which is consistent with the findings of transcriptomics studies zhang et al 2021a because l glutamine is involved in the digestion of nh4 to generate amino acids its relative accumulation can promote the accumulation of amino acids in the root system thereby inhibiting root growth xun et al 2020 isoleucine maintains a relative balance with l methionine and threonine through threonine deaminase and methionine c lyase notably low isoleucine levels have been implicated in suppressed plant growth joshi et al 2010 low isoleucine content which would have an inhibitory effect on various metabolic processes using isoleucine such as tissue repair and nitrogen metabolism li et al 2020 continued protein synthesis under isoleucine deficiency would ultimately result in a metabolic disorder and impair plant growth li et al 2020 our results indicate that negative pressure continuous and stable water supply significantly downregulated isoleucine levels in comparison to di treatment thereby affecting the synthesis of root protein leading to insufficient protein quantity required for root growth it has been shown to drastically impair maize root growth li et al 2020 glutamic acid as a signal molecule that regulates plant growth has the most obvious impact on root growth and development zhang et al 2017 almost all amino acids have been found to impede plant root growth however glutamic acid has been demonstrated to make plant root cells more susceptible to programmed cell death bonner et al 1996 the arabidopsis thaliana studies results show that the reason why glutamic acid significantly inhibits root growth is to inhibit the division of root tip meristems hence inhibiting root growth liu et al 2006 while glutamic acid s inhibitory effect on root growth is genetically determined changes in the external environment act as triggers for its accumulation brian 2014 the negative pressure continuous and stable water supply increased glutamic acid accumulation in the corn root system which is a significant reason for the maize root system s growth inhibition zeatin is synthesized primarily in the root system and an appropriate amount of zeatin promotes cell division and shoot initiation previous research has established a negative correlation between zeatin content and root growth with high zeatin levels inhibiting root growth zhang et al 2019 zeatin is a group of cytokinins comprised of cis zeatin and trans zeatin and the trans zeatin is cis zeatin isomers or other highly active cytokinins martin et al 2015 although zeatin is closely related to plant growth and development its effects on plant roots and buds are significantly different jan et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 trans zeatin is a highly active cytokinin increasing its relative accumulation promotes plant shoot growth and inhibits root growth hallmark et al 2020 werner et al 2001 the present study discovered that relative trans zeatin levels increased 4 05 times which may have contributed to maize root redundant growth inhibition cytokinin biosynthesis is the prenylation of adenine nucleotides martin et al 2015 cytokinin is degraded by oxidase dehydrogenase into adenine and the equivalent side chain aldehyde the concentration of these two molecules in plant tissues is inversely associated jan et al 2007 it is well established that active cytokinins suppress root growth stenlid 2006 in this study the adenine relative accumulation was down regulated whereas zeatin was significantly up regulated thereby inhibiting the growth of corn roots hallmark et al 2020 furthermore 2 deoxyadenosine is involved in the transmission of cell genetic information protein and atp synthesis as well as sugar metabolism xiong et al 2019a deoxyguanosine is a physiological compound that can impede the mitotic process and exert a significant inhibitory effect on plant cell division brulfert et al 1974 2 deoxyadenosine causes spindles dysfunction at the end of mitosis and finally inhibits the progress of cell division becerra and carmona 1983 2 deoxyadenosine accumulation downregulation will also reduce atp enzyme activity it may suppress the synthesis of proteins and carbohydrates inhibit energy metabolism blocks cytokinesis by hindering vesicle coalescence directly thus limiting root growth becerra and carmona 1983 good and zaplachinski 1994 high concentration of z farnesol is toxic to plant cells but its effect on plant growth and development is still unclear fitzpatrick et al 2011 the results of this study indicate that under negative pressure continuous and stable water supply the relative accumulation of z farnesol was significantly down regulated implying that it may be associated with the inhibition of corn root growth ajmaline is a tryptophan derived secondary metabolite tzin and galili 2010 it consists primarily of indole alkaloids which are biosynthesized from the aromatic acid tryptophan eashan et al 2020 ajmaline has important medicinal value and its accumulation will have a profound effect on the physiological functioning of animals and plants ruben and carlos 1974 ajmaline inhibits the electron transfer mechanism in plant energy metabolism thereby affecting the synthesis and transport of plant atp and inhibiting plant energy metabolism michael et al 1994 ruben and carlos 1974 ajmaline accumulates in the root system due to its high downregulation which may result in insufficient energy for root growth hence limiting root growth eliel et al 2009 in addition it was downregulated implying that tryptophan biosynthesis was suppressed which may have an effect on auxin synthesis and suppress maize root growth parviz et al 2018 in this study the low level of ajmaline accumulation in the root system may be one of the reasons for the inhibition of maize root system growth lipids and lipid like molecules play a role in signal transduction during plants response to environmental stimuli jiang et al 2009 adaptive responses to varying soil water content include changes in the expression of these signaling molecules xiong et al 2019b our findings indicated that linoleic acid and colnelenic acid levels were significantly decreased during maize root system adaptation to the stable soil water content environment in addition pyrimidine metabolism is directly linked to plant energy metabolism yang et al 2010 whereas overexpression of cytidine a small molecule inhibitor may inhibit pyrimidine metabolism thereby reducing energy availability for root growth and significantly reducing dry matter accumulation additionally we found significant upregulation of quinic acid naphthalene and cis 5 8 11 14 eicosatetraenoic acid in plants treated with npi versus di implying a probable relationship with root system inhibition or a decreased root shoot ratio although the main pathway for auxin synthesis is unknown wright et al 1991 tryptophan is directly engaged in auxin synthesis pollmann et al 2002 suggesting that tryptophan may reduce root redundant growth by inhibiting auxin synthesis in summary the physiological mechanism underlying root growth restriction under stable soil water content comprises regulation of hormones sugar metabolism and protein synthesis through genetic information transmission this study implies that by regulating the maize physiological metabolic process negative pressure continuous water supply can affect the accumulation of specific metabolites inhibiting root redundant growth and facilitating photosynthetic products distribution into the grain increasing the yield zhang and zhang 2000 in the future we will investigate the key metabolites that regulate plant root growth under different water supply pressures including persistent drought conditions through an in depth exploration of the plants physiological mechanisms underlying negative pressure continuous water supply in plants we will analyze the negative pressure continuous water supply to increase crop yield potential from the perspective of soil nutrients microbial communities and plant nutrition zhang et al 2021a this will provide theoretical support for establishing scientific water management measures in crop cultivation as well as lay the foundation for the development of non traditional water saving irrigation practices zhang et al 2021b 5 conclusion in comparison to intermittent positive pressure water supply negative pressure continuous and stable water supply limits maize root redundant growth and reduces the root shoot ratio notably when compared to di npi treatment significantly suppresses antioxidant enzyme activity and reduces superoxide anion mda and osmotic adjustment substances in maize roots but does not cause water stress non targeted metabolomics analysis revealed that npi induces differential metabolite expression which is enriched in metabolic pathways biosynthesis of secondary metabolites biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites biosynthesis of plant hormones abc transporters biosynthesis of amino acids and purine metabolism these metabolic pathways were found to be associated with the inhibition of redundant root growth additionally negative pressure continuous and stable water supply significantly upregulated the relative accumulation of glutamic acid glutamine quinic acid and zeatin while significantly decreasing the relative accumulation of pyroglutamic acid isoleucine sucrose 2 deoxyadenosine and ajmaline compared to di treatment the relative accumulation of these metabolites may affect the transmission of genetic information in maize roots as well as sugar metabolism hormone synthesis signal transduction and protein synthesis thereby suppressing their redundant growth the underlying physiological mechanism behind the effect of negative pressure continuous and stable water supply on redundant root growth restriction in maize is regulated by trehalose 2 deoxyadenosine isoleucine and ajmaline funding the study was supported by the national key research and development program of china 2018yfe0112300

9646,soil properties and microbial diversity are markedly enhanced by the long term effects of organic fertilizers however the short term impacts of inorganic and organic fertilizers vary in different agroecosystems especially when combined with different irrigation conditions here we examined the influence of different fertilizer types npk mineral fertilizer npkm mineral fertilizer plus organic

on the soil properties and bacterial communities at the wheat harvest stage of a one year rice wheat rotation system rwrs in the rice zone along the yellow river of china our results revealed that the irrigation mode had a stronger impact on the soil properties and bacterial community than the fertilizer regime although most indicators did not differ significantly probably owing to the short duration of the trial several low abundance bacteria were recognized to be strongly p 0 05 influenced by different irrigation and fertilizer regimes in the rwrs using lefse analysis but no definite trends were observed among the treatments a co occurrence network uncovered the modular clustering patterns of bacteria which were significantly correlated with the available phosphorus content and some soil enzyme activities moreover the denitrification nitrite respiration and sulfur respiration capacities of soil microbes were significantly improved in the mineral fertilizer combined with the alternate wetting and moderate drying treatment in addition the wheat yield did not significantly p 0 05 decrease after water saving irrigation regime during the previous rice season further research is warranted to elucidate the long term effects of partial substitution of chemical nitrogen with organic nitrogen and water saving irrigation regimes on an rwrs keywords water saving irrigation organic fertilizer soil biochemical characteristics subsequent effect 1 introduction in recent years rice and wheat production has continuously increased mostly owing to the increased use of fertilizers among these nitrogen n inputs have been pivotal contributors to increasing plant nutrition achieving high crop yields and providing food for the growing global population robertson and vitousek 2009 farmers generally prefer chemical n fertilizer especially in high intensity agricultural regions owing to the lack of rapid and short term benefits of organic amendments on crop yields and soil chemical properties pimentel et al 2005 khaliq et al 2006 indeed the average grain yield per unit area increased by 98 in china from 1977 to 2005 accompanied by a 271 increase in synthetic n fertilizer use ju et al 2009 however the heavy use of inorganic fertilizers has negatively impacted the environment including soil degradation freshwater pollution biodiversity loss and climate change which pose increased health risks to humans and animals dusenbury et al 2008 foley et al 2011 edwards et al 2015 furthermore the loss of soil microbial diversity may impair key ecosystem functions and has thus become a global concern chen et al 2020 previous studies have observed that soil bacterial richness and diversity are markedly increased by organic fertilizers compared with inorganic or no fertilizer francioli et al 2016 schmid et al 2018 thus multiple nutrient management practices partially or substantially replace chemical fertilizers with organic amendments such as manure compost straw and biochar zhao et al 2016 additionally the long term repeated application of organic manure has been reported mediate biological and soil ecosystem processes involved in the sequestration of soil organic carbon soc thereby improving soil quality and microbial diversity for example the combined application of inorganic fertilizer and manure has been shown to significantly enhance the biodiversity of bacterial and fungal communities in cropped soils geisseler and scow 2014 guo et al 2018 moreover different soil microbial communities perform specific functions for example firmicutes and proteobacteria are abundant in carbon rich soil and able to degrade complex organic compounds francioli et al 2016 whereas some specific taxa are involved in soil nutrient transformation ikoyi et al 2020 therefore from a long term perspective partial substitution of chemical fertilization with organic fertilization can not only improve soil quality by increasing the total amount of soil nutrients such as soil organic matter total nitrogen and total phosphorus but can also increase available soil nutrients alkali nitrogen available phosphorus available potassium content qaswar et al 2020 liu et al 2021 organic fertilizer directly correlates with enzymes activities which can improve the living environment for microorganisms thereby enhancing the performance and sustainability of agroecosystems igalavithana et al 2017 samuel et al 2018 however in the short term it remains unknown whether organic fertilizer substitution in crops last season will affect the structure and function of the soil microbial community in crops next season moreover freshwater for sustainable agricultural irrigation is becoming increasingly scarce owing to population growth increasing urban and industrial development pollution and resource depletion belder et al 2005 bouman 2007 steffen et al 2015 these challenges will be aggravated in the future as global food demand must increase by 70 110 to sustain the forecasted population of 9 billion by 2050 alexandratos 2009 tilman et al 2011 rice production will be particularly challenged as it consumes approximately 40 of global freshwater resources in only 18 of the total planting area dawe et al 2005 lampayan et al 2015 fao 2017 however these concerns may be addressed by changing water irrigation management practices alternate wetting and drying awd has gradually become a popular water saving irrigation technique in rice production compared with that using conventional irrigation regimes such as continuous flooding awd can reduce water consumption by 33 throughout the rice life cycle moreover the intensity and frequency of awd cycles can regulate both microbial physiology and soil physical processes thereby affecting the mineralization and immobilization of soil nutrients and their bioavailability wang et al 2016 additionally awd can promote the growth of rice roots reduce ineffective tilling optimize population quality promote material transfer to grain and increase yield hao et al 2009 yang and zhang 2010 chu et al 2016 indeed the reported rice yield in response to optimized irrigation management ranged from 27 to 8 lampayan et al 2015 however the extent of irrigation water reduction varies depending on the environment soil and management system fertilizer and irrigation regimes therefore further studies investigating optimal awd patterns with specific fertilizer regimes and incidental factors affecting soil nutrient supply will be of great significance to guaranteeing production while reducing irrigation water consumption the rice wheat rotation system rwrs is an important planting pattern used to provide a stable food source worldwide kumari et al 2011 including sustainable agricultural production in china the separately effects of fertilizer and irrigation treatment on the wheat or rice season have been examined he et al 2020 dai et al 2021 however the impacts of different management regimes during the rice season on wheat yield soil nutrients physicochemical indexes and soil microbial communities known as legacy effects in the subsequent wheat season remain unclear in crop rotation based on the above observations the aim of the current study was to determine the short term influence of awd with different fertilizer regimes on i soil physical and chemical properties and ii soil microbial community structure and function in the wheat season in the rwrs considering the faster release of nutrients from inorganic fertilizer than from organic material we hypothesized that i irrigation mode would have a larger effect on soil indices than fertilizer regime ii different degrees of awd plus mineral fertilizer alone would have a stronger impact on the soil properties and bacterial community than any degree of awd plus mineral fertilizer plus organic fertilizer or mineral fertilizer plus straw 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the

chao1 ace shannon and simpson indices were calculated using qiime version 1 9 2 software kemp and aller 2004 boxplots based on the alpha diversity indices soil properties and employed extracellular enzyme activity eeas were created using r version 4 0 2 software and differences among soils with different treatments were analyzed using tukey s honest significant difference hsd test variations in the bacterial community composition of soils with different treatments were evaluated by principal coordinate analysis pcoa using the vegan package in r the mean abundances of dominant bacterial phyla in all soil samples and variations in the relative abundance of dominant bacterial genera among different treatments were exhibited by bar plot and bubble chart respectively using the ggplot2 package in r circular visualization of the abundance of dominant bacterial taxa at the phylum level was performed using circos software krzywinski et al 2009 linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse was used to identify significantly different abundances of microorganisms among soils with different treatments segata et al 2011 differences in the relative abundances of bacteria at the phylum and class levels as well as the ecological functions of soil bacterial communities were also analyzed using tukey s hsd test furthermore to decipher the distribution patterns of the soil bacterial communities co occurrence network analysis was performed using cytoscape version 3 3 0 software faust and raes 2016 with the conet plug in faust and raes 2012 pairwise correlations were determined using pearson and spearman correlations mutual information and bray curtis and kullback leibler dissimilarity tests only asvs detected in more than three samples were included in correlation

occurrence networks langfelder and horvath 2007 the mantel test was used to examine relationships among major network modules and soil properties eeas and bacterial community functions to assess the importance of network interactions to ecological functions in the rwrs 3 results 3 1 soil properties and extracellular enzyme activities the results indicated that neither the irrigation mode nor the fertilizer regime significantly p 0 05 fig 1a affected most soil properties in the short term including soc ph an nn ak and tds contents however the contents in the s npk s nm s nws treatments were higher than that in the control and other treatments p 0 05 moreover the irrigation mode significantly p 0 05 affected ap content which was higher in the all treatments compared to control but the difference was not significant except for in the s nws treatment the activities of extracellular enzymes including lap α glu β glu β x β s c1 ap and alp were significantly p 0 05 affected by the irrigation mode fig 1b table s1 moreover under each irrigation mode the fertilizer regime did not significantly affect enzyme activities specifically compared with the control lap activity was significantly p 0 05 increased in the m npk and m nws treatments α glu activity was significantly p 0 05 increased in the m nws and s npk treatments β glu activity was significantly p 0 05 increased in the m nm and s npk treatments β x and ap activities displayed a similar pattern and they were both significantly p 0 05 increased in the m nws treatment β s c1 activity was significantly p 0 05 increased in the m nm and m nws treatments and alp activity was significantly p 0 05 increased in the m nm treatment 3 2 diversity of soil bacterial communities chao1 ace shannon and simpson indices were calculated to characterize the alpha diversity of the soil bacterial communities the results indicated that neither the fertilizer regime nor the irrigation mode affected bacterial alpha diversity fig 2a based on pcoa pc1 and pc2 explained 15 and 10 of the community variance respectively additionally neither the fertilizer regime nor the irrigation mode significantly affected bacterial community structure fig 2b with respect to the composition of the soil bacterial community proteobacteria 38 01 was the most abundant phylum in the wheat planting soil followed by acidobacteria 13 50 bacteroidetes 12 77 chloroflexi 7 45 gemmatimonadetes 4 78 verrucomicrobia 4 67 actinobacteria 4 65 planctomycetes 3 16 nitrospirae 2 24 firmicutes 1 84 and other bacterial phyla 6 91 fig 3a b anova analysis indicated that the abundances of three bacteria tm7 op11 and ws6 differed significantly p 0 05 among the treatments although these were not major phyla specifically the abundance of tm7 and op11 were significantly p 0 05 increased in the s nm treatment the abundance of op11 was significantly p 0 05 decreased in the m npk treatment group and the abundances of op11 and ws6 were significantly p 0 05 decreased in the s npk treatment fig s1 at the class level the abundances of chthonomonadetes and tm7 1 differed significantly p 0 05 among the treatments fig s2 the abundance of chthonomonadetes was significantly p 0 05 increased in the m npk treatment but was decreased in the m nm and m nws treatments comparatively the abundance of tm7 1 was significantly p 0 05 increased in the m nm and s nm treatments but did not differ significantly among the other treatments and the control the abundance distribution of classes was generally consistent across the different treatments which was similar to the distribution of phyla and the abundances of the majority of classes did not differ significantly among the treatments fig 3c to identify specialized bacterial communities in the samples we employed lefse to analyze the microbial community data at the genus level displaying the information in a cladogram fig 4a with lda scores 2 confirmed by lefse fig 4b in the control treatment the genus catellatospora and anaerobic bacterium b110 were significantly enriched in the m npk treatment the class chthonomonadetes genus akiw659 family desulfovibrionaceae and genus desulfovibrio were enriched in the m nm treatment the order 34p16 and genera methylotenera shd 231 and shd 14 were enriched in the m nws treatment the family exiguobacteraceae and genera anabaena demequina and clostridium were enriched in the s npk treatment the orders c114 and n1423wl and families legionellaceae and ellin5301 were enriched in the s nm treatment the class tm7 1 and genus halobacillus were enriched in the s nws treatment the genus phyllobacterium and order b07 wmsp1 were enriched 3 3 network analysis co occurrence network analysis was performed to identify potential interactions between microbes in wheat soil fig 5a the main bacteria in soil samples from all treatments formed seven clustering modules m1 to m7 among which four were main clustering modules but no hub was identified fig s3 the relationships among modules enzyme activities and soil properties were determined using pearson correlation coefficients fig 5b lap α glu β x β s c1 and ap activities were significantly p 0 05 positively correlated with module m4 and ap activity was positively correlated with module m7 in contrast α glu activity was significantly p 0 05 negatively correlated with modules m3 and m6 and β x activity was significantly p 0 05 negatively correlated with module m1 3 4 predicted function profiles and their relationship with network modules to summarize the potential contributions of irrigation mode and fertilizer regime on soil bacterial function the functional profiles of bacterial communities were predicted using faprotax software and significant differences among all treatments were determined by anova compared with those in the control the denitrification nitrite respiration and sulfur respiration capacities of soil microbes were significantly p 0 05 improved in the m nm treatment fig 6a furthermore potential sulfate and sulfite respiration functions were negatively related to module m6 whereas nitrate nitrite and nitrous oxide denitrification as well as nitrite respiration were negatively related to module m5 fig 6b p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 legacy effects of fertilizers and irrigation on soil physicochemical properties among the measured soil physicochemical indicators including som ph an nn tn ap ak and tdscontent was affected significantly ap content shownincreased with all fertilizer regimes in both awmod and awsd groups whereas tn content only significantly increased in the awsd group compared with those in the control the lower absorption by plants with lower aboveground biomass and grain yield with any fertilizer treatment under awsd fig s4 was likely owing to the unsaturated soil which caused root sensitization and affected nutrient uptake kumar et al 2017 lap and ap activities and the heterogeneity of the field soil in addition the som content demonstrated only a minor increase with organic amendment except for straw return treatment under awmod however our results were incompatible with previous reports of the long term effects of organic amendment in which organic amendment reportedly improves the som content and the degree of improvement is based on the quantity of organic matter added lou et al 2011 tian et al 2015 dai et al 2021 moreover short term two year three year organic amendment also reportedly increases the som content in rice wheat rotation zhu et al 2014 2015 chen et al 2017 therefore we inferred that a plausible explanation for our result might be i the test period one year was too short thus the gross cumulative effect of organic matter addition on som content was not reflected as these changes occur slowly and are relatively small compared with the vast background of soc gong et al 2009 ii organic amendment increased soil respiration by promoting both heterotrophic and root respiration and increased consumption of organic materials yan et al 2021 and iii many other factors influenced the results such as fertilizer type soil texture climate and recent management practices beziat et al 2009 davis et al 2010 wang et al 2015 4 2 legacy effects of fertilizers and irrigation on soil enzyme activities changes in soil nutrient content which are critical drivers of the biogeochemical cycling of carbon nitrogen and phosphorous are closely related to various eeas furthermore the activity of extracellular enzymes secreted by soil microorganisms is mediated by soil moisture cui and caldwell 1997 guo et al 2018 in the current study the activities of lap α glu β glu β x β s c1 ap and alp were increased to a certain degree in the awmod and awsd groups with all fertilizer regimes compared with those in the control however there was almost no difference in eeas with any fertilizer regime under the same irrigation mode indicating that the irrigation mode had a stronger influence on soil eea than the fertilizer regime thus awmod and awsd can be used to comprehensively improve the soil environment in terms of available nutrients and eeas fig 1a and b similarly a previous study reported that different rotations in a paddy upland rotation system strongly govern the soil microbiome rather than fertilizer use hou et al 2018 the irrigation regime applied in paddy fields during the previous rice season especially reciprocal ﬂooding and drying cycles i e alternating anaerobic aerobic phases changed the soil physical properties as well as c and n cycles presumably explained by the increase in soil bacterial diversity barnard et al 2013 hou et al 2018 which directly affected eea in the network analysis in the current study module 4 was significantly positively correlated with lap α glu β x β s c1 and ap activities and the microbial community was mainly composed of proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes and acidobacteria which are closely associated with the nutrient cycle thus the current phenomena indicate that the legacy effects induced by irrigation in the past rice season are reduced by a unified irrigation regime in the wheat season it is also likely that the results reflect the hidden mechanisms of soil resilience in the rice season which were influenced by fertilizer morillas et al 2015 francaviglia et al 2017 luo et al 2019 however whether these legacy effects would be accumulated in long term localization experiments and whether the weather has a beneficial long term impact on rwrs require continuous related research in future studies metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics analyses might provide direct evidence supporting the current findings by tracing the origin of key enzymes back to their taxonomic groups 4 3 legacy effects of fertilizers and irrigation on the microbial community the composition of the soil microbial community is closely related to environmental factors and plays a significant role in nutrient cycling decomposition of organic matter fertility and crop health gaiero et al 2013 hu et al 2016 in the present study the bacterial communities across all treatment groups were dominated by proteobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi fig 3a which was consistent with previous reports of agricultural soil chen et al 2016 guo et al 2018 interestingly the α and β diversities of the soil bacterial communities did not differ among any of the treatment groups which may have been owing to the absence of significant changes in soil physicochemical properties that were closely related to the characteristics of the bacterial communities the similarities in microbial diversity may also have been related to similar stochastic processes of birth death migration speciation and finite diffusion which shaped similar microbial communities a previous study investigating three four year fertilizer management strategies in three different geographic regions reported that returning straw to soil slightly increases the abundance of bacteria in two regions chen et al 2017 but not the third region thus a clear difference from previous long term observational studies with organic fertilizer might be owing to profound changes in the diversity and composition of the soil microbial community jing et al 2015 vander bom et al 2018 overall the authors of the above study reported that soil texture and time of harvest might be two main factors affecting soil microorganisms bossio et al 1998 cookson et al 2008 in the current study the rda of the soil bacterial communities and soil properties indicated that the first two ordination axes explained 19 97 and 14 64 of the overall variance fig s5 tn was negatively related to the second axis ak was negatively related to the first axis and ph was positively related to the first axis a previous two month incubation study reported that two distinct microbial communities possess similar functional and taxonomical structures when colonizing the same soil but that the same microbial community evolves differently when incubated in different soils these findings support that microbial community composition may change mainly in response to variations in soil properties delmont et al 2014 these results imply that mineralization of som in organic amendment is a long term process and achieving the full effect of its nutritional potential on the soil microbial community is difficult in the short term although the microbial community composition in the wheat season shifted with soil moisture content due to irrigation modes applied in the previous rice season waldrop and firestone 2006 cruz martínez et al 2009 many microbial taxonomic groups also exhibited functional redundancy kuzyakov et al 2009 and their recovery to pre impact levels likely depends on the management practice moreover the number of stress events that can be sustained without significant impact on the soil microbial community remains uncertain therefore the legacy effects of irrigation during the rice season on the microbial community in the subsequent wheat season warrant further study 5 conclusion taken together the results of this study support our hypothesis that a moderate awd mode in the rwrs could provide effective water savings and might have a stronger impact on soil properties than the fertilizer regime in the short term and there was no significant effect on the bacterial community on the whole however some bacteria with low abundance in the soil microbial community were influenced by different irrigation and fertilizer regimes moreover the denitrification nitrite respiration and sulfur respiration capacities of soil microbes were significantly improved in the mineral fertilizer combined with the alternate wetting and moderate drying treatment in the future the long term effects of partial substitution of chemical nitrogen with organic nitrogen and water saving irrigation modes in the rwrs require study funding this work was supported by grants from the national natural science foundation of china project no 51809270 and the

9646,soil properties and microbial diversity are markedly enhanced by the long term effects of organic fertilizers however the short term impacts of inorganic and organic fertilizers vary in different agroecosystems especially when combined with different irrigation conditions here we examined the influence of different fertilizer types npk mineral fertilizer npkm mineral fertilizer plus organic fertilizer npkws mineral fertilizer plus straw combined with different irrigation regimes awmid shallow water layer awmod alternate wetting and moderate drying awsd alternate wetting and severe drying on the soil properties and bacterial communities at the wheat harvest stage of a one year rice wheat rotation system rwrs in the rice zone along the yellow river of china our results revealed that the irrigation mode had a stronger impact on the soil properties and bacterial community than the fertilizer regime although most indicators did not differ significantly probably owing to the short duration of the trial several low abundance bacteria were recognized to be strongly p 0 05 influenced by different irrigation and fertilizer regimes in the rwrs using lefse analysis but no definite trends were observed among the treatments a co occurrence network uncovered the modular clustering patterns of bacteria which were significantly correlated with the available phosphorus content and some soil enzyme activities moreover the denitrification nitrite respiration and sulfur respiration capacities of soil microbes were significantly improved in the mineral fertilizer combined with the alternate wetting and moderate drying treatment in addition the wheat yield did not significantly p 0 05 decrease after water saving irrigation regime during the previous rice season further research is warranted to elucidate the long term effects of partial substitution of chemical nitrogen with organic nitrogen and water saving irrigation regimes on an rwrs keywords water saving irrigation organic fertilizer soil biochemical characteristics subsequent effect 1 introduction in recent years rice and wheat production has continuously increased mostly owing to the increased use of fertilizers among these nitrogen n inputs have been pivotal contributors to increasing plant nutrition achieving high crop yields and providing food for the growing global population robertson and vitousek 2009 farmers generally prefer chemical n fertilizer especially in high intensity agricultural regions owing to the lack of rapid and short term benefits of organic amendments on crop yields and soil chemical properties pimentel et al 2005 khaliq et al 2006 indeed the average grain yield per unit area increased by 98 in china from 1977 to 2005 accompanied by a 271 increase in synthetic n fertilizer use ju et al 2009 however the heavy use of inorganic fertilizers has negatively impacted the environment including soil degradation freshwater pollution biodiversity loss and climate change which pose increased health risks to humans and animals dusenbury et al 2008 foley et al 2011 edwards et al 2015 furthermore the loss of soil microbial diversity may impair key ecosystem functions and has thus become a global concern chen et al 2020 previous studies have observed that soil bacterial richness and diversity are markedly increased by organic fertilizers compared with inorganic or no fertilizer francioli et al 2016 schmid et al 2018 thus multiple nutrient management practices partially or substantially replace chemical fertilizers with organic amendments such as manure compost straw and biochar zhao et al 2016 additionally the long term repeated application of organic manure has been reported mediate biological and soil ecosystem processes involved in the sequestration of soil organic carbon soc thereby improving soil quality and microbial diversity for example the combined application of inorganic fertilizer and manure has been shown to significantly enhance the biodiversity of bacterial and fungal communities in cropped soils geisseler and scow 2014 guo et al 2018 moreover different soil microbial communities perform specific functions for example firmicutes and proteobacteria are abundant in carbon rich soil and able to degrade complex organic compounds francioli et al 2016 whereas some specific taxa are involved in soil nutrient transformation ikoyi et al 2020 therefore from a long term perspective partial substitution of chemical fertilization with organic fertilization can not only improve soil quality by increasing the total amount of soil nutrients such as soil organic matter total nitrogen and total phosphorus but can also increase available soil nutrients alkali nitrogen available phosphorus available potassium content qaswar et al 2020 liu et al 2021 organic fertilizer directly correlates with enzymes activities which can improve the living environment for microorganisms thereby enhancing the performance and sustainability of agroecosystems igalavithana et al 2017 samuel et al 2018 however in the short term it remains unknown whether organic fertilizer substitution in crops last season will affect the structure and function of the soil microbial community in crops next season moreover freshwater for sustainable agricultural irrigation is becoming increasingly scarce owing to population growth increasing urban and industrial development pollution and resource depletion belder et al 2005 bouman 2007 steffen et al 2015 these challenges will be aggravated in the future as global food demand must increase by 70 110 to sustain the forecasted population of 9 billion by 2050 alexandratos 2009 tilman et al 2011 rice production will be particularly challenged as it consumes approximately 40 of global freshwater resources in only 18 of the total planting area dawe et al 2005 lampayan et al 2015 fao 2017 however these concerns may be addressed by changing water irrigation management practices alternate wetting and drying awd has gradually become a popular water saving irrigation technique in rice production compared with that using conventional irrigation regimes such as continuous flooding awd can reduce water consumption by 33 throughout the rice life cycle moreover the intensity and frequency of awd cycles can regulate both microbial physiology and soil physical processes thereby affecting the mineralization and immobilization of soil nutrients and their bioavailability wang et al 2016 additionally awd can promote the growth of rice roots reduce ineffective tilling optimize population quality promote material transfer to grain and increase yield hao et al 2009 yang and zhang 2010 chu et al 2016 indeed the reported rice yield in response to optimized irrigation management ranged from 27 to 8 lampayan et al 2015 however the extent of irrigation water reduction varies depending on the environment soil and management system fertilizer and irrigation regimes therefore further studies investigating optimal awd patterns with specific fertilizer regimes and incidental factors affecting soil nutrient supply will be of great significance to guaranteeing production while reducing irrigation water consumption the rice wheat rotation system rwrs is an important planting pattern used to provide a stable food source worldwide kumari et al 2011 including sustainable agricultural production in china the separately effects of fertilizer and irrigation treatment on the wheat or rice season have been examined he et al 2020 dai et al 2021 however the impacts of different management regimes during the rice season on wheat yield soil nutrients physicochemical indexes and soil microbial communities known as legacy effects in the subsequent wheat season remain unclear in crop rotation based on the above observations the aim of the current study was to determine the short term influence of awd with different fertilizer regimes on i soil physical and chemical properties and ii soil microbial community structure and function in the wheat season in the rwrs considering the faster release of nutrients from inorganic fertilizer than from organic material we hypothesized that i irrigation mode would have a larger effect on soil indices than fertilizer regime ii different degrees of awd plus mineral fertilizer alone would have a stronger impact on the soil properties and bacterial community than any degree of awd plus mineral fertilizer plus organic fertilizer or mineral fertilizer plus straw 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the

fertilizer regime significantly p 0 05 fig 1a affected most soil properties in the short term including soc ph an nn ak and tds contents however the contents in the s npk s nm s nws treatments were higher than that in the control and other treatments p 0 05 moreover the irrigation mode significantly p 0 05 affected ap content which was higher in the all treatments compared to control but the difference was not significant except for in the s nws treatment the activities of extracellular enzymes including lap α glu β glu β x β s c1 ap and alp were significantly p 0 05 affected by the irrigation mode fig 1b table s1 moreover under each irrigation mode the fertilizer regime did not significantly affect enzyme activities specifically compared with the control lap activity was significantly p 0 05 increased in the m npk and m nws treatments α glu activity was significantly p 0 05 increased in the m nws and s npk treatments β glu activity was significantly p 0 05 increased in the m nm and s npk treatments β x and ap activities displayed a similar pattern and they were both significantly p 0 05 increased in the m nws treatment β s c1 activity was significantly p 0 05 increased in the m nm and m nws treatments and alp activity was significantly p 0 05 increased in the m nm treatment 3 2 diversity of soil bacterial communities chao1 ace shannon and simpson indices were calculated to characterize the alpha diversity of the soil bacterial communities the results indicated that neither the fertilizer regime nor the irrigation mode affected bacterial alpha diversity fig 2a based on pcoa pc1 and pc2 explained 15 and 10 of the community variance respectively additionally neither the fertilizer regime nor the irrigation mode significantly affected bacterial community structure fig 2b with respect to the composition of the soil bacterial community proteobacteria 38 01 was the most abundant phylum in the wheat planting soil followed by acidobacteria 13 50 bacteroidetes 12 77 chloroflexi 7 45 gemmatimonadetes 4 78 verrucomicrobia 4 67 actinobacteria 4 65 planctomycetes 3 16 nitrospirae 2 24 firmicutes 1 84 and other bacterial phyla 6

abundance of chthonomonadetes was significantly p 0 05 increased in the m npk treatment but was decreased in the m nm and m nws treatments comparatively the abundance of tm7 1 was significantly p 0 05 increased in the m nm and s nm treatments but did not differ significantly among the other treatments and the control the abundance distribution of classes was generally consistent across the different treatments which was similar to the distribution of phyla and the abundances of the majority of classes did not differ significantly among the treatments fig 3c to identify specialized bacterial communities in the samples we employed lefse to analyze the microbial community data at the genus level displaying the information in a cladogram fig 4a with lda scores 2 confirmed by lefse fig 4b in the control treatment the genus catellatospora and anaerobic bacterium b110 were significantly enriched in the m npk treatment the class chthonomonadetes genus akiw659 family desulfovibrionaceae and genus desulfovibrio were enriched in the m nm treatment the order 34p16 and genera methylotenera shd 231 and shd 14 were enriched in the m nws treatment the family exiguobacteraceae and genera anabaena demequina and clostridium were enriched in the s npk treatment the orders c114 and n1423wl and families legionellaceae and ellin5301 were enriched in the s nm treatment the class tm7 1 and genus halobacillus were enriched in the s nws treatment the genus phyllobacterium and order b07 wmsp1 were enriched 3 3 network analysis co occurrence network analysis was performed to identify potential interactions between microbes in wheat soil fig 5a the main bacteria in soil samples from all treatments formed seven clustering modules m1 to m7 among which four were main clustering modules but no hub was identified fig s3 the relationships among modules enzyme activities and soil properties were determined using pearson correlation coefficients fig 5b lap α glu β x β s c1 and ap activities were significantly p 0 05 positively correlated with module m4 and ap activity was positively correlated with module m7 in contrast α glu activity was significantly p 0 05 negatively correlated with modules m3 and m6 and β x activity was significantly p 0 05 negatively correlated with module m1 3 4 predicted function profiles and their relationship with network modules to summarize the potential contributions of irrigation mode and fertilizer regime on soil bacterial function the functional profiles of bacterial communities were predicted using faprotax software and significant differences among all treatments were determined by anova compared with those in the control the denitrification nitrite respiration and sulfur respiration capacities of soil microbes were significantly p 0 05 improved in the m nm treatment fig 6a furthermore potential sulfate and sulfite respiration functions were negatively related to module m6 whereas nitrate nitrite and nitrous oxide denitrification as well as nitrite respiration were negatively related to module m5 fig 6b p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 legacy effects of fertilizers and irrigation on soil physicochemical properties among the measured soil physicochemical indicators including som ph an nn tn ap ak and tdscontent was affected significantly ap content shownincreased with all fertilizer regimes in both awmod and awsd groups whereas tn content only significantly increased in the awsd group compared with those in the control the lower absorption by plants with lower aboveground biomass and grain yield with any fertilizer treatment under awsd fig s4 was likely owing to the unsaturated soil which caused root sensitization and affected nutrient uptake kumar et al 2017 lap and ap activities and the heterogeneity of the field soil in addition the som content demonstrated only a minor increase with organic amendment except for straw return treatment under awmod however our results were incompatible with previous reports of the long term effects of organic amendment in which organic amendment reportedly improves the som content and the degree of improvement is based on the quantity of organic matter added lou et al 2011 tian et al 2015 dai et al 2021 moreover short term two year three year organic amendment also reportedly increases the som content in rice wheat rotation zhu et al 2014 2015 chen et al 2017 therefore we inferred that a plausible explanation for our result might be i the test period one year was too short thus the gross cumulative effect of organic matter addition on som content was not reflected as these changes occur slowly and are relatively small compared with the vast background of soc gong et al 2009 ii organic amendment increased soil respiration by promoting both heterotrophic and root respiration and increased consumption of organic materials yan et al 2021 and iii many other factors influenced the results such as fertilizer type soil texture climate and recent management practices beziat et al 2009 davis et al 2010 wang et al 2015 4 2 legacy effects of fertilizers and irrigation on soil enzyme activities changes in soil nutrient content which are critical drivers of the biogeochemical cycling of carbon nitrogen and phosphorous are closely related to various eeas furthermore the activity of extracellular enzymes secreted by soil microorganisms is mediated by soil moisture cui and caldwell 1997 guo et al 2018 in the current study the activities of lap α glu β glu β x β s c1 ap and alp were increased to a certain degree in the awmod and awsd groups with all fertilizer regimes compared with those in the control however there was almost no difference in eeas with any fertilizer regime under the same irrigation mode indicating that the irrigation mode had a stronger influence on soil eea than the fertilizer regime thus awmod and awsd can be used to comprehensively improve the soil environment in terms of available nutrients and eeas fig 1a and b similarly a previous study reported that different rotations in a paddy upland rotation system strongly govern the soil microbiome rather than fertilizer use hou et al 2018 the irrigation regime applied in paddy fields during the previous rice season especially reciprocal ﬂooding and drying cycles i e alternating anaerobic aerobic phases changed the soil physical properties as well as c and n cycles presumably explained by the increase in soil bacterial diversity barnard et al 2013 hou et al 2018 which directly affected eea in the network analysis in the current study module 4 was significantly positively correlated with lap α glu β x β s c1 and ap activities and the microbial community was mainly composed of proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes and acidobacteria which are closely associated with the nutrient cycle thus the current phenomena indicate that the legacy effects induced by irrigation in the past rice season are reduced by a unified irrigation regime in the wheat season it is also likely that the results reflect the hidden mechanisms of soil resilience in the rice season which were influenced by fertilizer morillas et al 2015 francaviglia et al 2017 luo et al 2019 however whether these legacy effects would be accumulated in long term localization experiments and whether the weather has a beneficial long term impact on rwrs require continuous related research in future studies metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics analyses might provide direct evidence supporting the current findings by tracing the origin of key enzymes back to their taxonomic groups 4 3 legacy effects of fertilizers and irrigation on the microbial community the composition of the soil microbial community is closely related to environmental factors and plays a significant role in nutrient cycling decomposition of organic matter fertility and crop health gaiero et al 2013 hu et al 2016 in the present study the bacterial communities across all treatment groups were dominated by proteobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi fig 3a which was consistent with previous reports of agricultural soil chen et al 2016 guo et al 2018 interestingly the α and β diversities of the soil bacterial communities did not differ among any of the treatment groups which may have been owing to the absence of significant changes in soil physicochemical properties that were closely related to the characteristics of the bacterial communities the similarities in microbial diversity may also have been related to similar stochastic processes of birth death migration speciation and finite diffusion which shaped similar microbial communities a previous study investigating three four year fertilizer management strategies in three different geographic regions reported that returning straw to soil slightly increases the abundance of bacteria in two regions chen et al 2017 but not the third region thus a clear difference from previous long term observational studies with organic fertilizer might be owing to profound changes in the diversity and composition of the soil microbial community jing et al 2015 vander bom et al 2018 overall the authors of the above study reported that soil texture and time of harvest might be two main factors affecting soil microorganisms bossio et al 1998 cookson et al 2008 in the current study the rda of the soil bacterial communities and soil properties indicated that the first two ordination axes explained 19 97 and 14 64 of the overall variance fig s5 tn was negatively related to the second axis ak was negatively related to the first axis and ph was positively related to the first axis a previous two month incubation study reported that two distinct microbial communities possess similar functional and taxonomical structures when colonizing the same soil but that the same microbial community evolves differently when incubated in different soils these findings support that microbial community composition may change mainly in response to variations in soil properties delmont et al 2014 these results imply that mineralization of som in organic amendment is a long term process and achieving the full effect of its nutritional potential on the soil microbial community is difficult in the short term although the microbial community composition in the wheat season shifted with soil moisture content due to irrigation modes applied in the previous rice season waldrop and firestone 2006 cruz martínez et al 2009 many microbial taxonomic groups also exhibited functional redundancy kuzyakov et al 2009 and their recovery to pre impact levels likely depends on the management practice moreover the number of stress events that can be sustained without significant impact on the soil microbial community remains uncertain therefore the legacy effects of irrigation during the rice season on the microbial community in the subsequent wheat season warrant further study 5 conclusion taken together the results of this study support our hypothesis that a moderate awd mode in the rwrs could provide effective water savings and might have a stronger impact on soil properties than the fertilizer regime in the short term and there was no significant effect on the bacterial community on the whole however some bacteria with low abundance in the soil microbial community were influenced by different irrigation and fertilizer regimes moreover the denitrification nitrite respiration and sulfur respiration capacities of soil microbes were significantly improved in the mineral fertilizer combined with the alternate wetting and moderate drying treatment in the future the long term effects of partial substitution of chemical nitrogen with organic nitrogen and water saving irrigation modes in the rwrs require study funding this work was supported by grants from the national natural science foundation of china project no 51809270 and the

9647,soil salinization and water shortage restrict the utilization of saline soil resources in the yellow river delta china yrd as such soil water and salt management are two methods for the saline soil reclamation in this area in this study a two year ﬁeld experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of compound control on the rules of water and salt movement in salt affected field and their effect on cotton yield which were combined by plastic ﬁlm mulch and buried wood fibre layer fm bl hydrus 2d was used to analyse their spatial and temporal change results showed that soil water at different observation positions were maintained above 0 15 cm3 cm 3 under film mulch which was higher than that in bare ground bg and the closer to the topsoil the greater difference between fm bl and bg especially in 2020 fm bl controlled soil water stress and improved water use efficiency during the whole growing season both in 2019 and 2020 fm bl invariably and signiﬁcantly controlled the salt content of the upper 60 cm depth which was lower than 2 00 g kg 1 during the whole growing season furthermore soil salt contents under film mulch in the upper 30 cm depths were significantly reduced for the high soil water contents thus soil salt content of 0 60 cm layer responded to the heavy rainfall events positively soil salinity decreased as a whole along with the process of rainfall under the effect of fm bl fm bl has a significant effect on crop growth and yield improvement the average yields were 1163 7 and 1301 7 kg ka 1 in 2019 and 2020 respectively therefore fm bl could be an efficient way for soil water conservation salt accumulation interruption and cotton yield increasing in the yrd keywords yellow river delta compound control soil water soil salt cotton yield hydrus 2d 1 introduction the yellow river delta yrd is influenced by dynamic interactions of bohai sea land climate and the yellow river ye et al 2004 and agricultural ecological system is one of the important study objects in this area dong et al 2008 studies indicated that the cultivated land increased rapidly along with the virgin soil being reclaimed was regards as the key driving forces liu et al 2010 however soil reclamation suffers from a high salt stress and water stress in this area zhu et al 2021a they are two important factors that restrain the crop yield in this area therefore soil water and salt managements are two important parts for the saline soil reclamation in the yrd soil water and salt management approaches aim to reduce evaporation from topsoil maintain soil salinity levels within acceptable crop tolerance and then improve crop growth and yield film mulch and buried layer are two important approaches to solve the soil evaporation and salt accumulation in the yrd and we have already confirmed their effect on soil water retention and salt reduction by pot incubation and soil column experiment respectively other studies also find film mulch s effect on water saving soil evaporation reduction and yield improvement in different areas with varying degrees dong et al 2009 agele et al 2010 li et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 the mechanism of film mulch system is that it can break the exchange of water and heat between soil and atmosphere which is worked like a water vapor barrier in the soil surface then the move upward of soil salt is moderated slightly which is caused by soil capillary action since soil evaporation was limited by film mulch study further showed that film mulch worked more effective on the soil water and salt of shallow soil depth bezborodov et al 2010 pang et al 2010 there are various mulch materials used in saline soil such as plastic film crop straw sand or gravel and plastic film is the most widely used in the yrd dong et al 2009 studies indicated that the effects of plastic mulching would also be affected by various factors such as mulching system climatic characteristics and irrigation stathakos et al 2006 dong et al 2008 agele et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 buried layer is another effective way to regulate salt accumulation it would inhibit the movement of salts from the deep soil and or shallow groundwater to the topsoil which was always used as a salt accumulation barrier numerous studies have demonstrated that buried straw layer can reduce salt accumulation in the root zone and improve desalting efficiency in saline soil zhao et al 2014 2016 long et al 2017 one study found that a sand layer can block the movement of salt ions especially sodion shi et al 2007 our recent studies further confirmed the positive effects of buried layer on the soil water and salt management it was found that buried wood fibre layer could control salt accumulation in surface soil in the yrd the continuity of capillary movement was broken when embedding the interlayer thus buried wood fibre layer changed soil hydraulic characteristic parameters with apparent improvements in values of saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil porosity which was caused by its fibre structures and broken particles of different sizes zhu et al 2021b studies have already confirmed the improvement on crop yields by film mulch especially in salt affected lands for soil water improvement and salt reduction stathakos et al 2006 uribe and contreras 2003 it was found that plastic mulch plus irrigation measures can improve the environment of sunlight and temperature among the crop rows which resulted in dry matter accumulation and enhanced the productivity dong et al 2018 in the yrd as a salt tolerant crop in fact cotton is one of the most important crops it was reported that cotton yield was improved under plastic mulching in the yrd and plastic mulching before seeding would contribute to the seedling establishment dong et al 2005 2009 thus film mulch could increase soil temperature control weed growth and shorten cotton growing period in this area dong et al 2008 buried layer could also increase crop yield for its effect on soil water distribution and salt leaching thus there was a positive effect on plant growth in the arid land area when buried straw layer was combined with film mulch zhao et al 2016 buried layer has a sustained effect on yield improvement for several years which was different with film mulch and at sowing the lower salt content in top soil layer under buried layer implies that the plants would have less salt stress at emergence and early growth period zhao et al 2014 currently plastic ﬁlm mulching and buried layer have been widely used to increase crop yield in saline soils however the research on buried layer in the yrd was few and on the primary stage especially in the field and the effect of wood fire was only confirmed by soil column experiment combining wood fibre layer burial with plastic ﬁlm mulching is rarely performed in saline soil in the yrd thus in our former study it was showed that a single measure as film mulch cannot always increase crop yield effectively for high soil salt content was found under the prolonged drought period there was a high risk of salt accumulation in surface soil which was caused by the soil capillary action especially when the long term drought or high soil salt stress occurred at the early stage of growth a single measure as buried layer caused a significant soil water decline which would result in soil water stress in the root zone based on the above mentioned factors we hypothesized that buried wood fibre layer and plastic plim mulching could supplement each other and enhance the yield of cotton therefore a two year ﬁeld trial was conducted to explore the effects of buried wood fibre layer plus film mulch on the saline soil reclamation in the yrd the dynamics of soil water and salinity and their improvement on cotton yield soil water and salt distribution was analyzed by hydrus 2d for its widespread application and successful operation in salt affected fields 2 materials and methods 2 1

two growing seasons 2019 2020 it is a warm temperate and continental monsoon climate the average annual precipitation and temperature are 560 mm and 12 9 c respectively and almost 74 of precipitation is concentrated from june to september han et al 2015 the annual average evaporation from the water surface is 1962 mm and the ratio of evaporation to precipitation is approximately 3 6 han et al 2018 large amounts of sand and sediment carried by the yellow river have produced alternating depositional layers of sand and clay nacl dominates the soil soluble salt and sandy loam with a high salt content is a significant soil type in this area detailed information is showed in table 1 2 2 field experiment the experimental area was abandoned for several years due to the poor soil water and high soil salt content it was irrigated with 2000 m3 ha 1 before sowing after 10 days of soaking residual water was drained by digging small trenches then flowed into deep ditch with a gutter drainage system which was around the experimental plots cotton is commonly planted in this region as a salt tolerant crop seeds were sown when the temperature of the top 5 cm surface soil layer was higher than 14 two rows of cotton were planted with a 30 cm spacing centred on 60 cm with a narrow 20 cm plant row spacing and without row plant spacing of 40 cm fertilization was applied under the plastic film at a rate of 100 kg n ha 1 a plastic film mulch system was applied to 60 cm of the cotton rows the layout of the reference with only film mulch treatment was failed with limited yield because seed germination was depressed from the high soil salt content during the early growth stage soil samples 0 15 15 30 30 40 40 60 cm depth were collected at approximately 20 day intervals during the growing season with a soil corer diameter 5 cm the soil water content at depths of 15 30 40 and 60 cm was measured by the stoving method soil salt concentrations were measured using oven drying method 2 3

soil profiles were classified as four layers according to soil characteristics and monitoring points initial soil water content and salt concentration of different layer was determined by oven drying method before cotton planting respectively 2 3 6 model parameters soil hydraulic parameters θs θr alpha n was optimized by the inverse solutions by using the measured data of 2019 the initial hydraulic parameters required in the model were measured or estimated from soil texture bulk density before mulch experimental design and hydraulic conductivity using the retc software schaap et al 2001 the calibrated parameters were shown in table 2 validation was performed using the observed data of 2020 without changing the calibrated parameters 2 3 7 model evaluation the root mean square

to 0 and the closer nse is to 1 the more accurate the simulations results showed that a good agreement was achieved between measured and simulated values and soil water simulation was better than soil salt table 3 2 4 statistical analysis the data were analysed using microsoft excel 2016 origin version 9 0 origin lab corporation ma usa was used to generate graphs 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil water the dynamics of soil water within 0 60 cm soil layer depth differed during the two growing seasons soil water content under fm bl was higher than that in bg fig 2 in 2019 soil water content experienced similar changes soil water at different soil layers and observation positions were maintained above different amounts they were 0 1597 0 1669 0 1546 0 2045 cm3 cm 3 under film mulch at 0 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 40 cm and 40 60 cm depth respectively and they were 0 1477 0 1595 0 1436 0 1963 cm3 cm 3 outside film mulch at 0 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 40 cm and 40 60 cm depth respectively soil under film mulch positions retained more water than outside film mulch during the whole growing period the first peak point occurred at 20 days after sowing soil water outside film mulch was more responsive than it under film mulch there was obviously increment under the effect of rainstorm about 60 days after sowing and fluctuations was continued about 30 days thereafter soil water decreased at later growth stages fig 2a d in 2020 soil water content fluctuated with rainfall especially the top 0 15 cm soil layer fig 2e soil under film mulch positions also retained more water than outside film mulch during the whole growing period except for a lower water content at 0 15 cm soil depth for several days soil water at different soil layers and observation positions were maintained above different amounts they were 0 1689 0 1741 0 1641 0 2140 cm3 cm 3 under film mulch at 0 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 40 cm and 40 60 cm depth respectively and they were 0 1602 0 1691 0 1564 0 2059 cm3 cm 3 outside film mulch at 0 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 40 cm and 40 60 cm depth respectively the significant increment of all soil layers and observation positions were occurred 60 days after sowing then soil water slightly fluctuated during the later growth stage which was also kept at a certain level 3 2 soil salt dynamic during growing season the variations in salt content within the 0 60 cm soil layer among treatments are shown in fig 3 there was a significant salt reduction under the effect of fm bl compared with bg in 2019 soil salt content fluctuations of under film mulch ufm were similar with that outside film mulch ofm especially 60 days after sowing thus the fluctuation range of salt content in 0 15 cm ufm were larger than ofm during the growing season ranging from 0 53 to 1 83 g kg 1 and 0 58 2 26 g kg 1 under and outside film mulch respectively fig 3a soil salt content fluctuations in 15 30 cm ufm was different with ofm there was an increment in 15 30 cm ufm during the former 60 days thereafter the fluctuation in 15 30 cm ufm was beginning to converge soil salt content fluctuations in 30 40 cm was similar with that in 15 30 cm compared to 15 30 cm and 30 40 cm layers there was an increment in 40 60 cm at 70 days after sowing the overall trend was that soil salt content was decreased during the growing season like the previous season soil salt content ufm firstly subdued rise in 2020 then the salinity was significantly decreased under the effect of intermittent rainfall form 47 days to 96 days after sowing soil salt content ufm was lower than ofm in 0 15 cm and 15 30 cm the difference was significant during the former several days thereafter the salinity ufm was higher than ofm in 0 40 cm since the salt was decreased especially during the period of significant rainfall overall after cotton harvest the salt content in 0 15 cm ufm reduced relative to the content at sowing they were 1 39 g kg 1 and 0 81 g kg 1 at sowing and harvest respectively and they were 1 88 g kg 1 and 0 66 g kg 1 at sowing and harvest in 0 15 cm ofm respectively and soil salt content was higher ufm in 15 30 cm than ofm at harvest they were 0 74 g kg 1and 0 64 g kg 1 respectively fluctuations ufm in 40 60 cm was different with other soil layers there were no significant differences in soil salinity between ufm and ofm during the period of significant rainfall 3 3 soil evaporation and root water uptake under fm bl the effect of plastic film mulch plus buried wood fibre layer on soil evaporation and root water uptake is shown in fig 4 compared to bg soil evaporation under film mulch reduced in 2019 and 2020 in general soil evaporation was increased with the temperature rise and light intensity shortly after sowing thereafter it was decreased slightly during the crop growth period thus there was a wide fluctuation of soil evaporation form 90 days to 110 days in 2019 during the whole growing season the maximum and minimum daily soil evaporation were 4 01 mm day 1 and 0 09 mm day 1 respectively the changes in root water uptake was slight in the former 40 days then it was rapidly increased with the plant root development however the root water uptake was suppressed during the rainstorm and the maximum and minimum daily root water uptake were 5 89 mm day 1 and 0 21 mm day 1 during the last period respectively in 2020 the changes of soil evaporation was similar with that in 2019 and the maximum and minimum daily soil evaporation were 3 80 mm day 1 and 0 22 mm day 1 respectively root water uptake was significantly increased after 60 days and the maximum and minimum daily root water uptake were 13 89 mm day 1 and 0 98 mm day 1 during the last period respectively 3 4 salt reduction in the soil layers under the effect of fm bl the effect of plastic film mulch plus buried wood fibre layer on salt reduction in different soil layers during the off seasons is shown in table 4 for each soil layer the salinity was significantly lower under fm bl than bg soil salt was significantly reduced after irrigation in 2019 it was showed that soil salts were reduced by 50 83 52 40 34 78 and 44 71 in 0 15 15 30 30 40 40 60 cm layer under fm bl however there was obviously increment in 0 15 cm with 31 09 under bg compared to bg the ssh in 0 15 15 30 30 40 40 60 cm layer under fm bl decreased by 70 22 73 15 83 03 and 92 20 respectively in contrast the value under bg increased moderately in the 0 15 cm soil layer there was also a positive effect on the salt regulation in 2020 ssi was significantly lower than bg and salt reductions were 50 71 28 38 33 20 and 18 02 in 0 15 15 30 30 40 40 60 cm soil layer under fm bl the ssh were also lower than that in bg thus the ssi in 2019 was lower than that in 2020 there was a salt accumulation in bg salt accumulation was significantly restrained under fm bl particularly in 0 15 cm soil layer 3 5 cotton traits and yields under the effect of fm bl the effect of plastic film mulch plus buried wood fibre layer on cotton traits and yield during the growing seasons are shown in fig 5 crop height showed a significant difference between 2019 and 2020 the highest heights were 92 25 and 156 48 cm in 2019 and 2020 respectively there was a significant growth since seedling stage until bud stage in 2020 and the apparent growth was occurred from bud stage to blossing and boll forming stages fig 5a however the leaf area index was similar during the earlier stage the difference was occurred since bud stage the highest leaf area indices were 3 02 and 4 51 in 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 5b these differences would reflect different yield in two growing seasons it was easily to find that the cotton yield was higher under fm bl than the average yield in shandong province thus in this study there was an improvement from 2019 to 2020 the yields were 1163 7 and 1301 7 kg ka 1 in 2019 and 2020 respectively fm bl exceeded the yields of shandong province by 0 49 and 1 70 in 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 5c which was conducted in heavy salt soils 4 discussion soil water and salt stress restrict crop growth soil water and salt managements are two important parts for the saline soil reclamation in the yellow river delta dong et al 2008 thus water management is the main way to modify salt stress in the root zone dong et al 2009 burying layer plus film mulch has a significant effect on soil water and salt distribution our studies found that film mulch is an effective way to reduce soil evaporation fig 4 similarly in the present study lots of studies about film mulch have confirmed its effect on soil evaporation reduction and soil water storage increment in many areas mahmood et al 2002 meulen et al 2006 anikwe et al 2007 aragüés et al 2014 dong et al 2018 2021 they found that film mulch has significant effects on water saving salt accumulation preventing in early period and it was also found that row covering with plastic film 30 d before sowing would contribute to the better productivity dong et al 2008 2009 numerous studies have also demonstrated that buried layer could reduce salt accumulation in the root zone and improve desalting efficiency zhao et al 2014 2016 li et al 2016 long et al 2017 our recent soil column study with soils from this experimental site further confirmed that the buried wood fibre layer reduced soil salt content of the topsoil by 29 38 however soil water content in the topsoil significantly decreased when there was a single buried layer treatment zhu et al 2021b in this study water saving effect of film mulch was always found in the 0 40 cm layer fig 2 although it was showed that soil water in the upper soil layer declined quickly when buried layer was used in plough layer zhu et al 2021a surface soil water content was improved under film mulch in this study for soil evaporation was limited under film mulch zhang et al 2018 rainfall was also contributed to the difference between field experiment and soil column experiment soil water content was always higher than 0 15 cm3 cm 3 in 2019 and 2020 in 2019 water saving effect was significant in the former 60 days moreover it was lasted for a whole growing season in 2020 soil water content was more stable in 2020 fig 2e h those characteristics were firstly caused by the film mulch soil water content was significantly improved under film mulch and then the proper precipitation was contributed to the different soil water fluctuations the soil water content difference between fm bl and bg in the last growing period was obviously reduced after the extreme rainfall events in 2019 fig 4 the significant difference between fm bl and bg was occurred for the limited discontinuous rainfall in 2020 figs 2e h 4 therefore film mulch was more effective in the limited precipitation conditions it could be concluded that film mulch responsible for the soil water retaining rainfall was an important source for soil water content in the yrd annual rainfall distribution determined soil water dynamic especially in the early crop growth period besides root water uptake in 2020 was significantly higher than that in 2019 especially 60 days after sowing fig 4 for film mulch and proper rainfall would reduce water loss by evaporation decrease salt accumulation maintain soil water content then promote crop growth and improve crop water use efficiency zhang et al 2018 proper precipitation may also contribute to the root water uptake in 2020 root water uptake was restrained for high soil water content during 2019 fig 2a d it may result in a waterlogging stress in 2019 which was caused by the extreme rainfall cotton is poorly adapted to waterlogged conditions bange et al 2004 since waterlogging caused significant reduction in root and leaf growth christianson et al 2010 soil salt control in the root zone is important for the saline soil reclamation the current study showed that surface soil salt content was controlled by film mulch plus buried wood fibre layer fig 3 compared to bg soil salt accumulation was significantly interrupted under the effect of buried layer plus film mulch climatic fluctuation of soil salt content was controlled since soil evaporation was reduced by fm bl but heavy rainfall also affected soil salt distribution especially in 2019 fig 3a d soil salt contents in the upper 30 cm depths were significantly reduced under fm bl especially under film mulch fig 3a b e f this could be explained by the higher soil water contents observed in the topsoil under film mulch than outside film mulch fig 2 which enhanced the salt leaching efficiency for ion exchange and absorption and dissolved salt increment was promoted under the effect of high soil water feng et al 2000 thus soil evaporation under film mulch was also lower than that outside film mulch thereby reducing the surface soil salt accumulation which was caused by soil capillary action zhu et al 2021a at depths 40 60 cm there was no significant difference in soil salinity between under film mulch and outside film mulch because the effects of buried layer and film mulch was weakened with the increase of soil depth zhao et al 2016 was also found that salt content of 0 40 cm soil layer was more sensitive to the water and salt managements fluctuations in salt content leveled off shortly after sowing mainly because the buried layer interrupted the salt accumulation in surface soil for the continuity of capillary movement was broken after embedding the interlayer surface soil salt reduction was significant when there was a wood fibre layer zhu et al 2021b it was aggravated for the site received an excessive rainfall during the growing season particularly in 2019 the plots had low salt contents down to 60 cm depth because of storm with 199 2 mm was received at 60 days after sowing thus different with the change of soil salt in bg results showed that soil salt content of 0 60 cm responded to the heavy rainfall events positively soil salinity decreased as a whole along with the process of rainfall under the effect of fm bl for buried layer retarded the ratio of water infiltration due to over burden weight compaction effect cao et al 2012 zhu et al 2021b these results showed that soil water and salt managements were response for the soil water conservation and salt accumulation interruption rainfall or irrigation was the main driver that contributed to the surface soil salt leaching and fm bl could improve desalting efficiency of 0 60 cm layer soil water improvement and soil salt reduction promoted cotton growth as indicated by the consistently higher crop height leaf area index and yield relative to bg and the average yield in shandong province fig 5 bare ground in fact was always faced with extremely low yield and accumulation of salt in the surface soil there was no meaningful yield data could be used to analysis and comparison so the average yield in shandong province was compared in the results even in 2019 when there was water logging during the growth period which may have a negative effect on crop growth it still produced acceptable yield which was higher than the shandong province fig 5c increment of yields could be attributed to the beneficial effects of fm bl fm bl also contributed to lower salt content during the whole growing season which benefited stand establishment and plant growth especially in the early stage of the growth figs 3 5 the cost of fm bl was higher than the conventional film mulch in the first year for the only one additional item of buried layer however it would worked at least three or more years on the soil salt control and yield improvement especially in the heavy salt soils which were not used by farmers or abandoned thus increase available land area over all fm bl could be an effective way for the soil reclamation and yield improvement in yrd 5 conclusion soil water improvement and soil salt control are two important objects for the saline soil reclamation in the yrd in this study the dynamic of soil water and salt in saline soil were analyzed by hydrus 2d which were affected by compound control compound control performed a significant effect on soil water conservation and salt control film mulch plus buried wood fibre layer increased the soil water holding capacity for soil evaporation was significantly reduced under fm bl the effect of film mulch on water saving effect was always found in the 0 40 cm layer and it was worked more obviously in the early growth stage fm bl treatment was more effective under the limited precipitation conditions burying wood fibre layer in the soil significantly reduced the surface soil salt content and alter salt distribution in the growing season salt accumulation was significantly interrupted by the effect of fm bl climatic fluctuation of soil salt was controlled since soil evaporation was reduced by fm bl heavy rainfall was obviously contributed to the soil salt distribution and reduce soil salinity in 0 60 cm layer fm bl effectively improved cotton yield in the heavy salt soil which was were not used by farmers or abandoned yields were higher than the average yield in shandong province during this two growing seasons therefore combining plastic mulching with wood fibre layer burial can be an effective field management practice for growing cotton in saline soils of

9647,soil salinization and water shortage restrict the utilization of saline soil resources in the yellow river delta china yrd as such soil water and salt management are two methods for the saline soil reclamation in this area in this study a two year ﬁeld experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of compound control on the rules of water and salt movement in salt affected field and their effect on cotton yield which were combined by plastic ﬁlm mulch and buried wood fibre layer fm bl hydrus 2d was used to analyse their spatial and temporal change results showed that soil water at different observation positions were maintained above 0 15 cm3 cm 3 under film mulch which was higher than that in bare ground bg and the closer to the topsoil the greater difference between fm bl and bg especially in 2020 fm bl controlled soil water stress and improved water use efficiency during the whole growing season both in 2019 and 2020 fm bl invariably and signiﬁcantly controlled the salt content of the upper 60 cm depth which was lower than 2 00 g kg 1 during the whole growing season furthermore soil salt contents under film mulch in the upper 30 cm depths were significantly reduced for the high soil water contents thus soil salt content of 0 60 cm layer responded to the heavy rainfall events positively soil salinity decreased as a whole along with the process of rainfall under the effect of fm bl fm bl has a significant effect on crop growth and yield improvement the average yields were 1163 7 and 1301 7 kg ka 1 in 2019 and 2020 respectively therefore fm bl could be an efficient way for soil water conservation salt accumulation interruption and cotton yield increasing in the yrd keywords yellow river delta compound control soil water soil salt cotton yield hydrus 2d 1 introduction the yellow river delta yrd is influenced by dynamic interactions of bohai sea land climate and the yellow river ye et al 2004 and agricultural ecological system is one of the important study objects in this area dong et al 2008 studies indicated that the cultivated land increased rapidly along with the virgin soil being reclaimed was regards as the key driving forces liu et al 2010 however soil reclamation suffers from a high salt stress and water stress in this area zhu et al 2021a they are two important factors that restrain the crop yield in this area therefore soil water and salt managements are two important parts for the saline soil reclamation in the yrd soil water and salt management approaches aim to reduce evaporation from topsoil maintain soil salinity levels within acceptable crop tolerance and then improve crop growth and yield film mulch and buried layer are two important approaches to solve the soil evaporation and salt accumulation in the yrd and we have already confirmed their effect on soil water retention and salt reduction by pot incubation and soil column experiment respectively other studies also find film mulch s effect on water saving soil evaporation reduction and yield improvement in different areas with varying degrees dong et al 2009 agele et al 2010 li et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 the mechanism of film mulch system is that it can break the exchange of water and heat between soil and atmosphere which is worked like a water vapor barrier in the soil surface then the move upward of soil salt is moderated slightly which is caused by soil capillary action since soil evaporation was limited by film mulch study further showed that film mulch worked more effective on the soil water and salt of shallow soil depth bezborodov et al 2010 pang et al 2010 there are various mulch materials used in saline soil such as plastic film crop straw sand or gravel and plastic film is the most widely used in the yrd dong et al 2009 studies indicated that the effects of plastic mulching would also be affected by various factors such as mulching system climatic characteristics and irrigation stathakos et al 2006 dong et al 2008 agele et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 buried layer is another effective way to regulate salt accumulation it would inhibit the movement of salts from the deep soil and or shallow groundwater to the topsoil which was always used as a salt accumulation barrier numerous studies have demonstrated that buried straw layer can reduce salt accumulation in the root zone and improve desalting efficiency in saline soil zhao et al 2014 2016 long et al 2017 one study found that a sand layer can block the movement of salt ions especially sodion shi et al 2007 our recent studies further confirmed the positive effects of buried layer on the soil water and salt management it was found that buried wood fibre layer could control salt accumulation in surface soil in the yrd the continuity of capillary movement was broken when embedding the interlayer thus buried wood fibre layer changed soil hydraulic characteristic parameters with apparent improvements in values of saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil porosity which was caused by its fibre structures and broken particles of different sizes zhu et al 2021b studies have already confirmed the improvement on crop yields by film mulch especially in salt affected lands for soil water improvement and salt reduction stathakos et al 2006 uribe and contreras 2003 it was found that plastic mulch plus irrigation measures can improve the environment of sunlight and temperature among the crop rows which resulted in dry matter accumulation and enhanced the productivity dong et al 2018 in the yrd as a salt tolerant crop in fact cotton is one of the most important crops it was reported that cotton yield was improved under plastic mulching in the yrd and plastic mulching before seeding would contribute to the seedling establishment dong et al 2005 2009 thus film mulch could increase soil temperature control weed growth and shorten cotton growing period in this area dong et al 2008 buried layer could also increase crop yield for its effect on soil water distribution and salt leaching thus there was a positive effect on plant growth in the arid land area when buried straw layer was combined with film mulch zhao et al 2016 buried layer has a sustained effect on yield improvement for several years which was different with film mulch and at sowing the lower salt content in top soil layer under buried layer implies that the plants would have less salt stress at emergence and early growth period zhao et al 2014 currently plastic ﬁlm mulching and buried layer have been widely used to increase crop yield in saline soils however the research on buried layer in the yrd was few and on the primary stage especially in the field and the effect of wood fire was only confirmed by soil column experiment combining wood fibre layer burial with plastic ﬁlm mulching is rarely performed in saline soil in the yrd thus in our former study it was showed that a single measure as film mulch cannot always increase crop yield effectively for high soil salt content was found under the prolonged drought period there was a high risk of salt accumulation in surface soil which was caused by the soil capillary action especially when the long term drought or high soil salt stress occurred at the early stage of growth a single measure as buried layer caused a significant soil water decline which would result in soil water stress in the root zone based on the above mentioned factors we hypothesized that buried wood fibre layer and plastic plim mulching could supplement each other and enhance the yield of cotton therefore a two year ﬁeld trial was conducted to explore the effects of buried wood fibre layer plus film mulch on the saline soil reclamation in the yrd the dynamics of soil water and salinity and their improvement on cotton yield soil water and salt distribution was analyzed by hydrus 2d for its widespread application and successful operation in salt affected fields 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site 2 1 1 study area and site characterization this study was conducted at the yrd ecological research station of coastal wetlands chinese academy of sciences china 37 45 n 118 59 e for two growing seasons 2019 2020 it is a warm temperate and continental monsoon climate the average annual precipitation and temperature are 560 mm and 12 9 c respectively and almost 74 of precipitation is concentrated from june to september han et al 2015 the annual average evaporation from the water surface is 1962 mm and the ratio of evaporation to precipitation is approximately 3 6 han et al 2018 large amounts of sand and sediment carried by the yellow river have produced alternating depositional layers of sand and clay nacl dominates the soil soluble salt and sandy loam with a high salt content is a significant soil type in this area detailed information is showed in table 1 2 2 field experiment the experimental area was abandoned for several years due to the poor soil water and high soil salt content it was irrigated with 2000 m3 ha 1 before sowing after 10 days of soaking residual water was drained by digging small trenches then flowed into deep ditch with a gutter drainage system which was around the experimental plots cotton is commonly planted in this region as a salt tolerant crop seeds were sown when the temperature of the top 5 cm surface soil layer was higher than 14 two rows of cotton were planted with a 30 cm spacing centred on 60 cm with a narrow 20 cm plant row spacing and without row plant spacing of 40 cm fertilization was applied under the plastic film at a rate of 100 kg n ha 1 a plastic film mulch system was applied to 60 cm of the cotton rows the layout of the reference with only film mulch treatment was failed with limited yield because seed germination was depressed from the high soil salt content during the early growth stage soil samples 0 15 15 30 30 40 40 60 cm depth were collected at approximately 20 day intervals during the growing season with a soil corer diameter 5 cm the soil water content at depths of 15 30 40 and 60 cm was measured by the stoving method soil salt concentrations were measured using oven drying method 2 3

soil profiles were classified as four layers according to soil characteristics and monitoring points initial soil water content and salt concentration of different layer was determined by oven drying method before cotton planting respectively 2 3 6 model parameters soil hydraulic parameters θs θr alpha n was optimized by the inverse solutions by using the measured data of 2019 the initial hydraulic parameters required in the model were measured or estimated from soil texture bulk density before mulch experimental design and hydraulic conductivity using the retc software schaap et al 2001 the calibrated parameters were shown in table 2 validation was performed using the observed data of 2020 without changing the calibrated parameters 2 3 7 model evaluation the root mean square

salt table 3 2 4 statistical analysis the data were analysed using microsoft excel 2016 origin version 9 0 origin lab corporation ma usa was used to generate graphs 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil water the dynamics of soil water within 0 60 cm soil layer depth differed during the two growing seasons soil water content under fm bl was higher than that in bg fig 2 in 2019 soil water content experienced similar changes soil water at different soil layers and observation positions were maintained above different amounts they were 0 1597 0 1669 0 1546 0 2045 cm3 cm 3 under film mulch at 0 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 40 cm and 40 60 cm depth respectively and they were 0 1477 0 1595 0 1436 0 1963 cm3 cm 3 outside film mulch at 0 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 40 cm and 40 60 cm depth respectively soil under film mulch positions retained more water than outside film mulch during the whole growing period the first peak point occurred at 20 days after sowing soil water outside film mulch was more responsive than it under film mulch there was obviously increment under the effect of rainstorm about 60 days after sowing and fluctuations was continued about 30 days thereafter soil water decreased at later growth stages fig 2a d in 2020 soil water content fluctuated with rainfall especially the top 0 15 cm soil layer fig 2e soil under film mulch positions also retained more water than outside film mulch during the whole growing period except for a lower water content at 0 15 cm soil depth for several days soil water at different soil layers and observation positions were maintained above different amounts they were 0 1689 0 1741 0 1641 0 2140 cm3 cm 3 under film mulch at 0 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 40 cm and 40 60 cm depth respectively and they were 0 1602 0 1691 0 1564 0 2059 cm3 cm 3 outside film mulch at 0 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 40 cm and 40 60 cm depth respectively the significant increment of all soil layers and observation positions were occurred 60 days after sowing then soil water slightly fluctuated during the later growth stage which was also kept at a certain level 3 2 soil salt dynamic during growing season the variations in salt content within the 0 60 cm soil layer among treatments are shown in fig 3 there was a significant salt reduction under the effect of fm bl compared with bg in 2019 soil salt content fluctuations of under film mulch ufm were similar with that outside film mulch ofm especially 60 days after sowing thus the fluctuation range of salt content in 0 15 cm ufm were larger than ofm during the growing season ranging from 0 53 to 1 83 g kg 1 and 0 58 2 26 g kg 1 under and outside film mulch respectively fig 3a soil salt content fluctuations in 15 30 cm ufm was different with ofm there was an increment in 15 30 cm ufm during the former 60 days thereafter the fluctuation in 15 30 cm ufm was beginning to converge soil salt content fluctuations in 30 40 cm was similar with that in 15 30 cm compared to 15 30 cm and 30 40 cm layers there was an increment in 40 60 cm at 70 days after sowing the overall trend was that soil salt content was decreased during the growing season like the previous season soil salt content ufm firstly subdued rise in 2020 then the salinity was significantly decreased under the effect of intermittent rainfall form 47 days to 96 days after sowing soil salt content ufm was lower than ofm in 0 15 cm and 15 30 cm the difference was significant during the former several days thereafter the salinity ufm was higher than ofm in 0 40 cm since the salt was decreased especially during the period of significant rainfall overall after cotton harvest the salt content in 0 15 cm ufm reduced relative to the content at sowing they were 1 39 g kg 1 and 0 81 g kg 1 at sowing and harvest respectively and they were 1 88 g kg 1 and 0 66 g kg 1 at sowing and harvest in 0 15 cm ofm respectively and soil salt content was higher ufm in 15 30 cm than ofm at harvest they were 0 74 g kg 1and 0 64 g kg 1 respectively fluctuations ufm in 40 60 cm was different with other soil layers there were no significant differences in soil salinity between ufm and ofm during the period of significant rainfall 3 3 soil evaporation and root water uptake under fm bl the effect of plastic film mulch plus buried wood fibre layer on soil evaporation and root water uptake is shown in fig 4 compared to bg soil evaporation under film mulch reduced in 2019 and 2020 in general soil evaporation was increased with the temperature rise and light intensity shortly after sowing thereafter it was decreased slightly during the crop growth period thus there was a wide fluctuation of soil evaporation form 90 days to 110 days in 2019 during the whole growing season the maximum and minimum daily soil evaporation were 4 01 mm day 1 and 0 09 mm day 1 respectively the changes in root water uptake was slight in the former 40 days then it was rapidly increased with the plant root development however the root water uptake was suppressed during the rainstorm and the maximum and minimum daily root water uptake were 5 89 mm day 1 and 0 21 mm day 1 during the last period respectively in 2020 the changes of soil evaporation was similar with that in 2019 and the maximum and minimum daily soil evaporation were 3 80 mm day 1 and 0 22 mm day 1 respectively root water uptake was significantly increased after 60 days and the maximum and minimum daily root water uptake were 13 89 mm day 1 and 0 98 mm day 1 during the last period respectively 3 4 salt reduction in the soil layers under the effect of fm bl the effect of plastic film mulch plus buried wood fibre layer on salt reduction in different soil layers during the off seasons is shown in table 4 for each soil layer the salinity was significantly lower under fm bl than bg soil salt was significantly reduced after irrigation in 2019 it was showed that soil salts were reduced by 50 83 52 40 34 78 and 44 71 in 0 15 15 30 30 40 40 60 cm layer under fm bl however there was obviously increment in 0 15 cm with 31 09 under bg compared to bg the ssh in 0 15 15 30 30 40 40 60 cm layer under fm bl decreased by 70 22 73 15 83 03 and 92 20 respectively in contrast the value under bg increased moderately in the 0 15 cm soil layer there was also a positive effect on the salt regulation in 2020 ssi was significantly lower than bg and salt reductions were 50 71 28 38 33 20 and 18 02 in 0 15 15 30 30 40 40 60 cm soil layer under fm bl the ssh were also lower than that in bg thus the ssi in 2019 was lower than that in 2020 there was a salt accumulation in bg salt accumulation was significantly restrained under fm bl particularly in 0 15 cm soil layer 3 5 cotton traits and yields under the effect of fm bl the effect of plastic film mulch plus buried wood fibre layer on cotton traits and yield during the growing seasons are shown in fig 5 crop height showed a significant difference between 2019 and 2020 the highest heights were 92 25 and 156 48 cm in 2019 and 2020 respectively there was a significant growth since seedling stage until bud stage in 2020 and the apparent growth was occurred from bud stage to blossing and boll forming stages fig 5a however the leaf area index was similar during the earlier stage the difference was occurred since bud stage the highest leaf area indices were 3 02 and 4 51 in 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 5b these differences would reflect different yield in two growing seasons it was easily to find that the cotton yield was higher under fm bl than the average yield in shandong province thus in this study there was an improvement from 2019 to 2020 the yields were 1163 7 and 1301 7 kg ka 1 in 2019 and 2020 respectively fm bl exceeded the yields of shandong province by 0 49 and 1 70 in 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 5c which was conducted in heavy salt soils 4 discussion soil water and salt stress restrict crop growth soil water and salt managements are two important parts for the saline soil reclamation in the yellow river delta dong et al 2008 thus water management is the main way to modify salt stress in the root zone dong et al 2009 burying layer plus film mulch has a significant effect on soil water and salt distribution our studies found that film mulch is an effective way to reduce soil evaporation fig 4 similarly in the present study lots of studies about film mulch have confirmed its effect on soil evaporation reduction and soil water storage increment in many areas mahmood et al 2002 meulen et al 2006 anikwe et al 2007 aragüés et al 2014 dong et al 2018 2021 they found that film mulch has significant effects on water saving salt accumulation preventing in early period and it was also found that row covering with plastic film 30 d before sowing would contribute to the better productivity dong et al 2008 2009 numerous studies have also demonstrated that buried layer could reduce salt accumulation in the root zone and improve desalting efficiency zhao et al 2014 2016 li et al 2016 long et al 2017 our recent soil column study with soils from this experimental site further confirmed that the buried wood fibre layer reduced soil salt content of the topsoil by 29 38 however soil water content in the topsoil significantly decreased when there was a single buried layer treatment zhu et al 2021b in this study water saving effect of film mulch was always found in the 0 40 cm layer fig 2 although it was showed that soil water in the upper soil layer declined quickly when buried layer was used in plough layer zhu et al 2021a surface soil water content was improved under film mulch in this study for soil evaporation was limited under film mulch zhang et al 2018 rainfall was also contributed to the difference between field experiment and soil column experiment soil water content was always higher than 0 15 cm3 cm 3 in 2019 and 2020 in 2019 water saving effect was significant in the former 60 days moreover it was lasted for a whole growing season in 2020 soil water content was more stable in 2020 fig 2e h those characteristics were firstly caused by the film mulch soil water content was significantly improved under film mulch and then the proper precipitation was contributed to the different soil water fluctuations the soil water content difference between fm bl and bg in the last growing period was obviously reduced after the extreme rainfall events in 2019 fig 4 the significant difference between fm bl and bg was occurred for the limited discontinuous rainfall in 2020 figs 2e h 4 therefore film mulch was more effective in the limited precipitation conditions it could be concluded that film mulch responsible for the soil water retaining rainfall was an important source for soil water content in the yrd annual rainfall distribution determined soil water dynamic especially in the early crop growth period besides root water uptake in 2020 was significantly higher than that in 2019 especially 60 days after sowing fig 4 for film mulch and proper rainfall would reduce water loss by evaporation decrease salt accumulation maintain soil water content then promote crop growth and improve crop water use efficiency zhang et al 2018 proper precipitation may also contribute to the root water uptake in 2020 root water uptake was restrained for high soil water content during 2019 fig 2a d it may result in a waterlogging stress in 2019 which was caused by the extreme rainfall cotton is poorly adapted to waterlogged conditions bange et al 2004 since waterlogging caused significant reduction in root and leaf growth christianson et al 2010 soil salt control in the root zone is important for the saline soil reclamation the current study showed that surface soil salt content was controlled by film mulch plus buried wood fibre layer fig 3 compared to bg soil salt accumulation was significantly interrupted under the effect of buried layer plus film mulch climatic fluctuation of soil salt content was controlled since soil evaporation was reduced by fm bl but heavy rainfall also affected soil salt distribution especially in 2019 fig 3a d soil salt contents in the upper 30 cm depths were significantly reduced under fm bl especially under film mulch fig 3a b e f this could be explained by the higher soil water contents observed in the topsoil under film mulch than outside film mulch fig 2 which enhanced the salt leaching efficiency for ion exchange and absorption and dissolved salt increment was promoted under the effect of high soil water feng et al 2000 thus soil evaporation under film mulch was also lower than that outside film mulch thereby reducing the surface soil salt accumulation which was caused by soil capillary action zhu et al 2021a at depths 40 60 cm there was no significant difference in soil salinity between under film mulch and outside film mulch because the effects of buried layer and film mulch was weakened with the increase of soil depth zhao et al 2016 was also found that salt content of 0 40 cm soil layer was more sensitive to the water and salt managements fluctuations in salt content leveled off shortly after sowing mainly because the buried layer interrupted the salt accumulation in surface soil for the continuity of capillary movement was broken after embedding the interlayer surface soil salt reduction was significant when there was a wood fibre layer zhu et al 2021b it was aggravated for the site received an excessive rainfall during the growing season particularly in 2019 the plots had low salt contents down to 60 cm depth because of storm with 199 2 mm was received at 60 days after sowing thus different with the change of soil salt in bg results showed that soil salt content of 0 60 cm responded to the heavy rainfall events positively soil salinity decreased as a whole along with the process of rainfall under the effect of fm bl for buried layer retarded the ratio of water infiltration due to over burden weight compaction effect cao et al 2012 zhu et al 2021b these results showed that soil water and salt managements were response for the soil water conservation and salt accumulation interruption rainfall or irrigation was the main driver that contributed to the surface soil salt leaching and fm bl could improve desalting efficiency of 0 60 cm layer soil water improvement and soil salt reduction promoted cotton growth as indicated by the consistently higher crop height leaf area index and yield relative to bg and the average yield in shandong province fig 5 bare ground in fact was always faced with extremely low yield and accumulation of salt in the surface soil there was no meaningful yield data could be used to analysis and comparison so the average yield in shandong province was compared in the results even in 2019 when there was water logging during the growth period which may have a negative effect on crop growth it still produced acceptable yield which was higher than the shandong province fig 5c increment of yields could be attributed to the beneficial effects of fm bl fm bl also contributed to lower salt content during the whole growing season which benefited stand establishment and plant growth especially in the early stage of the growth figs 3 5 the cost of fm bl was higher than the conventional film mulch in the first year for the only one additional item of buried layer however it would worked at least three or more years on the soil salt control and yield improvement especially in the heavy salt soils which were not used by farmers or abandoned thus increase available land area over all fm bl could be an effective way for the soil reclamation and yield improvement in yrd 5 conclusion soil water improvement and soil salt control are two important objects for the saline soil reclamation in the yrd in this study the dynamic of soil water and salt in saline soil were analyzed by hydrus 2d which were affected by compound control compound control performed a significant effect on soil water conservation and salt control film mulch plus buried wood fibre layer increased the soil water holding capacity for soil evaporation was significantly reduced under fm bl the effect of film mulch on water saving effect was always found in the 0 40 cm layer and it was worked more obviously in the early growth stage fm bl treatment was more effective under the limited precipitation conditions burying wood fibre layer in the soil significantly reduced the surface soil salt content and alter salt distribution in the growing season salt accumulation was significantly interrupted by the effect of fm bl climatic fluctuation of soil salt was controlled since soil evaporation was reduced by fm bl heavy rainfall was obviously contributed to the soil salt distribution and reduce soil salinity in 0 60 cm layer fm bl effectively improved cotton yield in the heavy salt soil which was were not used by farmers or abandoned yields were higher than the average yield in shandong province during this two growing seasons therefore combining plastic mulching with wood fibre layer burial can be an effective field management practice for growing cotton in saline soils of

popular winter november to march leafy vegetable grown extensively in the indo gangetic plains of eastern india with the productivity of 21500 kg ha 1 horticulturae statistics division 2015 this shallow rooted cool season crop is cultivated for its large leafy head however soil water availability and inadequate nutrient management strategies are the main constraint for growing profitable crops in this area in the winter season though the region receives high average annual rainfall 1400 mm of which 80 occurs within june to september rainfall during winter is erratic and meager therefore harvesting rainwater and its recycling with proper irrigation management are necessary for growing cabbage in the winter dry season again adopting adequate nutrient management strategies along with soil moisture conservation measures can improve soil ecological conditions and alleviate the damage to crops caused by water and nutrient shortages and uneven distribution of rainfall tiwari et al 2003 kar and kumar 2007 wang et al 2017 saha et al 2021 thus the productivity of cabbage can be improved with proper technological intervention and the adoption of the technology cabbage is a heavy feeder requiring a high rate of nutrition for growth and head yield and prone to nutrient deficiencies khan et al 2002 choudhary et al 2009 chatterjee et al 2012 manea 2017 the nutritional status of the young crop especially nitrogen can markedly affect the rate of development of leaf area chadha 2019 farmers of this area do not follow proper fertilizer management practices and use indiscriminate synthetic fertilizers particularly nitrogen in vegetable production to meet their expectations for higher productivity at the expense of overall soil health and fertilizer costs dasgupta et al 2017 excessive nitrogen may cause loosehead formation and internal decay chatterjee et al 2012 takahashi et al 2017 the demand for phosphorous increases during the head formation stage and potassium deficiency can result in marginal necrosis and retards head quality but in excess cause the head to be loose chatterjee et al 2012 takahashi et al 2017 chadha 2019 wu et al 2020 according to kar and kumar 2007 soil moisture conservation measures can alter water distribution between soil evaporation and plant transpiration and fertilization can increase the use of stored soil water and improve crop yield most of the research works in cabbage were done under drip and plastic mulch conditions barrett et al 2018 shinde et al 2021 takahashi et al 2017 tiwari et al 2003 wu et al 2020 the surface irrigation in the presence of the paddy straw mulch may increase the residence time of the conserved soil water that would help in the dissolution of nutrients paddy straw mulch modifies the micro climate and growing conditions of crops and is commonly used for vegetable crops to retain better moisture through reduced evaporation tiwari et al 2003 suppressing weeds enhancing

management in field crops as well as in vegetables kar and kumar 2007 patil et al 2013 rathod et al 2020 shinde et al 2021 verma et al 2017 most of the field studies on mulch has been focused on soil fertility and crop yield however the effect of straw and live mulches with different doses of npk under the surface irrigated condition on soil water use soil fertility and the production of cabbage are meager in this region since leaf expansion relates closely to water availability the cabbage production during winter november february depends on supplemental irrigation chadha 2019 and being a shallow rooted crop cabbage shows greater sensitivity to soil water stress takahashi et al 2017 saha et al 2021 the major concern of this experiment is the restoration of the fertile conditions of the soil with the rationalized use of water under mulch for the betterment of water productivity and partial factor productivity of applied fertilizers avoiding any soil moisture stress at critical growth stages researchers de pascale et al 2011 shinde et al 2021 tiwari et al 2003 zotarelli et al 2009 postulated that the drip irrigation method has proved its superiority over other conventional methods of irrigation for vegetables throughout the world in respect of water economy but the initial investment required for installing drip accessories is beyond the reach of small farmers of india narayanamoorthy et al 2018 rathod et al 2020 surface irrigation is the most common method for vegetable production by poor resource farmers of india with small land holdings the low pressure hand held sprinkler system with flexible hose pipe has proved to be an effective and efficient surface irrigation technology for small scale farmers and small farmers groups for conveying water efficiently to fields and crops smith et al 2014 rathod et al 2020 the field water balance method involves the change in soil water over time and is employed to measure total water use or actual crop evapotranspiration eta when lysimeters are not available beshir 2017 water use by cabbage is determined by micrometeorological variables nutrients and water availability especially at the stage of development knowledge of crop water requirements to compensate for the eta loss from the soil and its extrapolation through crop coefficient kc is an important practical consideration to improve cabbage water productivity in irrigated agriculture doorenbos and kassam 1979 since kc values vary with local climate and field scale management practices doorenbos and kassam 1979 brouwer and heibloem 1986 allen et al 1998 it can be used as an indicator to measure the effectiveness of a particular soil and water management through eta based irrigation practices it also provides precise water applications in those areas where high irrigation efficiencies are achieved by low energy precision application or subsurface drip irrigation chaterlán et al 2011 beshir 2017 yimam et al 2020 there is no information concerning actual kc at different stages of growth obtained from water balance with cabbage under humid subtropical conditions of eastern india hence considering three mulched

and afternoon for one week for the establishment of seedlings later irrigation water was applied five times at a 10 day interval surface water from sources like runnel a small and narrow channel of watercourse along the side of the ground filled by water during the rainy season july to october was available in the vicinity of the experimental area for irrigation low pressure narrow polyvinylchloride pvc pipe and flexible hose outlets fixed with a 1 hp pump were used for hand held sprinkler irrigation the same amount of water was applied in the same way for mulch and un mulched treatments the depth of irrigation water i mm for the 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 cropping seasons at different stages of cabbage table 3 was calculated based on the following equation 1 i θ fc θ i ρ b ρ

the amount of surface runoff mm δs the change in the soil water storage mm the effective precipitation mm in the crop growing season was estimated by the soil water balance sheet method following fao 1974 and bandyopadhyay and mallick 2003 the capillary rise was assumed nil because the groundwater table was deep 2 5 m during the observation periods no runoff was observed during the experiments due to low precipitation and flat topography deep drainage d beyond the root zone was calculated as the excess water above the storage capacity of soil after application of each event of irrigation or heavy rainfall from the soil water balance sheet method bandyopadhyay et al 2003 in this study no drainage water out of the root zone was observed as very little and scattered rainfall occurred during the cabbage growth periods 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 and the low pressure hand held sprinkler irrigation never attained more than storage capacity 100 mm of the experimental soil in the root zone the δs

harvesting ten cabbage heads per treatment plot taken randomly were cut and split longitudinally to measure the following parameters the diameter of the head mm was measured as the horizontal distance from one side to another side of the selected head and the thickness of the head mm was measured as the vertical distance from the lowermost level to the uppermost level of the head to determine the cabbage volume cm3 the circumference of the cabbage head was measured assuming a spherical shape of it and the compactness was calculated from the fresh weight g measured by a digital weighing balance per unit volume of cabbage the yield per unit plot kg plot 1 was recorded by weighing all compact cabbage heads excluding unfolded leaves marketable yield in each unit plot and was expressed in kg per

amount of npk applied 2 8 post harvest soil analyses to find out the existence of residual npk in soils five representative field moist samples were collected from each plot from the 0 40 cm soil depth with a bucket auger after harvesting of cabbage in each year and pooled to make a composite sample for each replication bulk samples were placed in plastic bags air dried at room temperature 28 air dried sub samples were crushed passed through a 2 0 mm sieve and used for the determination of chemical properties oxidizable soil organic carbon soc available n p2o5 and k2o were determined following sparks 1996 2 9 economic analysis through benefit cost ratio economic analysis of the field experiment was done by considering contemporary market prices of inputs labor and produce in

and n1 respectively both m2 and m3 as well as n1 and n2 contributed equivalent to the compaction of cabbage significantly highest diameter 168 5 and 169 6 mm thickness 167 2 and 173 0 mm and volume 2506 and 2556 cm3 of cabbage were recorded from the treatment combination of m3n3 for 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 cropping seasons respectively table 6 however the highest compactness 1 03 and 1 04 g cm 3

mulch nutrient doses and year individually and mulch nutrient doses had a significant effect on the marketable yield of cabbage and water productivity 3 5 crop coefficients of cabbage crop coefficient kc values of cabbage were obtained from eta of m1n3 treatment i e with maximum evapotranspiration divided by the reference et eto during 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 cropping seasons and are shown in fig 3 during the first stage of crop growth which covered the period from sowing through 20 days after sowing das kc values increased from 0 1 to 0 9 during the crop development stage 21 35 das kc values further increased from 0 9 to 1 3 the maximum value of kc was 1 5 during 50 55 das close to the head formation stage of cabbage during the mid season of crop growth starting from 36 to 70 das the

coefficients were 0 5 for initial 1 0 for crop development and 1 2 for mid season and 0 6 for maturity stages although the estimated kc value of initial was identical with fao tm3 brouwer and heibloem 1986 value however it showed 29 lower than fao 56 allen et al 1998 value during the crop development and mid season stages the estimated kc values were 33 and 14 higher than the values reported by fao tm3 the kc value at the last growth stage was 33 and 37 lower than fao tm3 and fao 56 values respectively 3 6 post harvest soil fertility the effect of mulch and nutrients on soil chemical properties viz soil organic carbon soc available n p2o5 and k2o after cabbage harvesting during 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 cropping seasons are presented in table 8 during the 2019 2020 cropping season the soil chemical property values showed significantly higher than the previous year soil organic carbon ranged from 4 58 to 5 94 and 4 86 6 36 g kg 1 under different treatment combinations whereas soil available n ranged from 119 8 to 189 8 and 127 8 203 6 kg ha 1 for the two consecutive years respectively available p2o5 and k2o for these years ranged from 24 5 to 42 8 and from 232 2 to 302 3 kg ha 1 live mulch m2 and straw mulch m3 increased 9 and 18 more soc 14 and 23 more available n 18 and 27 more available p2o5 and 10 and 18 more available k2o as compared to no mulch m1 treatment again n3 treatment increased 6 5 and 7 5 more soc 11 and 28 more available n 18 and 36 more available p2o5 and 5 and 10 more available k2o as compared with n2 and n1 treatments respectively on average m3n3 treatment combinations showed the highest values of soc 6 2 g kg 1 available n 196 7 kg ha 1 p2o5 42 8 kg ha 1 and k2o 302 3 kg ha 1 respectively table 8 the analysis of variance indicated that mulch nutrient doses year and the interaction among mulch and nutrient doses had a significant effect on residual soc available n p2o5 and k2o interaction of year mulch had a significant effect on available p2o5 and k2o and interaction of year nutrient showed a significant effect on available n and p2o5 nonetheless interactions among variables were significant for available n p2o5 and k2o the grain yield per unit fertilizer inputs described by the partial factor productivity of applied fertilizers pfpf ranged from 36 53 m1n3 to 67 80 m3n1 kg kg 1 under different treatment combinations fig 4 n1 registered a higher pfpf of 61 33 kg kg 1 as against n2 51 61 kg kg 1 and n3 42 03 kg kg 1 respectively the pfpf of straw mulch m3 was noticed to be relatively higher 56 80 kg kg 1 as compared with m2 51 37 kg kg 1 and m1 46 80 kg kg 1 respectively the treatment combination of m3n1found significantly higher pfpf 67 80 kg kg 1 followed by m2n1 59 37 kg kg 1 and m1n1 56 83 kg kg 1 respectively fig 4 although m3n3 treatment showed higher yield and wue but exerted a lower pfpf 46 71 kg kg 1 3 7 economic analysis the economic feasibility of mulching and different levels of fertilizer application were evaluated by conducting benefit cost analysis and it was presented in table 9 among mulching treatments paddy straw mulching m3 had 29 higher cultivation cost over no mulch in both years and 24 and 23 higher cultivation cost over live mulch in two years of cultivation respectively the results indicated that m3n3 required the highest cost of cultivation 1445 6 and 1578 9 usd ha 1 in both years however significantly the highest gross return was also encountered in m3n3 treatments in both years 2141 9 and 2318 5 usd ha 1 although m3 ensued significantly higher gross return 21 23 than m1 m2 had significantly the highest 27 higher over m1 net return for both years of cabbage cultivation 690 9 and 702 2 usd ha 1 thus significantly the highest benefit cost ratio bcr was observed table 9 in m2 treatments 1 537 and 1 498 in two years respectively for nutrient treatments 125 rdf treatment ensued significantly the highest gross and net return in the case of interaction treatments m3n3 had the highest gross return 2141 9 and 2318 5 usd ha 1 respectively but m2n3 had the highest net return 822 2 and 795 6 usd ha 1 respectively which ultimately reflected in terms of higher bcr 1 699 and 1 615 respectively in the studied two years 4 discussion 4 1 soil water storage soil water availability for crop growth was strongly related to soil physical conditions in this study cabbage plants under mulch treatments utilized maximum water due to higher water retention and low permeability of the surface soil table 2 creating a narrow suction gradient nonetheless higher soil water storage with straw mulch and living mulch at various stages of cabbage table 4 may be attributed to the improvement of soil properties lower soil evaporation and the cumulative effect of residue buildup nie et al 2007 tahir and marschner 2016 tian et al 2018 although the living mulch competes with cabbage for light moisture and nutrients by depleting a considerable amount of water resulting in a smaller amount of water storage than paddy straw mulch treatment especially during the head filling stage of cabbage a similar effect was observed by brainard et al 2004 4 2 soil water balance and actual evapotranspiration the actual evapotranspiration eta rate expresses the amount of water lost from the cabbage plot in units of water depth higher profile water change in m2 as compared with m3 may be due to collective evapotranspiration of clover and cabbage for moisture hooks and johnson 2004 the decrease in eta under paddy straw could be related to the existence of micro climate concerning evaporation loss by acting as a barrier between the soil and environment resulting in better soil water retention ability a total of 184 and 195 mm water was applied on cabbage in the form of irrigation water 170 and 165 mm and effective rainfall 14 and 30 mm during the 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 cropping seasons several researchers tiwari et al 2003 wahome et al 2009 kumar and sahu 2013 wu et al 2020 saha et al 2021 reported a wide range of depth of irrigation water of cabbage crops under different climatic conditions and geographic locations due to variety length of the growing season irrigation methods and intervals and types of mulching used the contribution of eta using live mulch as compared to no mulch was very low and probably due to cutting of live mulch and the covered area with succulent cutting tissues at the drying and decomposition highest eta under n3 as compared with n1 and n2 table 5 and figs 2b and 2d may be due to higher depletion of soil water to promote the vegetative growth and head development of cabbage especially at the transpiring area leaf area and dry matter and thus resulted in higher crop transpiration and eta by using the water balance method the mean highest measured seasonal eta of cabbage during both years amounts to 226 30 mm for m1n3 table 5 and the variation of eta depends on the straw loading live mulch density loading soil water content and the evaporative demand many researchers han et al 2015 beshir 2017 verma et al 2017 shinde et al 2021 showed that the magnitude of seasonal crop water use or eta of cabbage varied with the type of mulching polythene straw live mulch etc imposed irrigation amount and methods drip sprinkler or surface flooding during 2018 2019 the eta and eto rate was comparatively higher due to sunny warm weather fig 1 than the 2019 2020 cropping season with scattered cloudy weather and high relative humidity table 1 4 3 yield attributes and water use efficiency the improvement of yield attributes might be because the significantly higher soil moisture at the head filling stage of cabbage table 4 and the higher soil nutrient table 6 with straw incorporation promote crop transpiration many researchers meena and paliwal 2003 choudhary and choudhary 2005 chadha 2019 reported that an increase in cabbage parameters corresponded with an increase in levels of npk fertilizers in indian soils the greater effectiveness of straw mulch in increasing the growth components was attributed to suppressing weed growth maintaining optimum soil temperature and retarding moisture as well as nutrient depletion nonetheless the optimum water in the vicinity of the root zone throughout the crop growth stages reducing soil water stress and plant cell turgid pressure and enhanced the vegetative growth of the crop through increasing photosynthesis and efficient translocation of photosynthates towards the head kumar and sahu 2013 verma et al 2017 the yield of the cabbage varies greatly depending upon variety water availability soil fertility maturity group and season of cultivation cabbage prefers 12 27 c though it can tolerate a minimum temperature of 5 c chadha 2019 in this experiment the minimum and maximum atmospheric temperatures resided within the desirable range the yield increase in response to the higher dose of npk fertilizers n3 suggests that n supplied from the soil as well as from the living mulch did not fully meet the need of the crop application of a higher dose of npk fertilizers and paddy straw mulch m3n3 was largely a function of improved growth and subsequent increase in yield attributing characters the straw mulch extends the soil water residence times and helps in the dissolution and distribution of nutrients throughout the root zone wu et al 2020 this combined action may result in faster carbohydrate production and efficient transport of photosynthates to the head and thus leads to increase head diameter volume and yield agrawal et al 2018 a similar beneficial effect of mulches on the yield of cabbage was also reported by tiwari et al 2003 beshir 2017 and verma et al 2017 reduction of soil temperature by mulching at the head filling stage 51 50 dat may also be the reason for higher yield our finding of cabbage yield 25 695 kg ha 1 is in close agreement with 25 000 30 000 kg ha 1 savita et al 2014 in india from this type of early varieties in this study the living mulch egyptian clover was able to overtop the cabbage restricting light from reaching the crop canopy and causing a 10 yield reduction as compared to straw mulch interspecific competition for light water and nutrients between the living mulch and vegetable crops can limit the use of the system brainard et al 2004 kolota and adamczewska sowinska 2013 the low initial fertility status of the soil and the unavailability of mineralized n from the egyptian clover within the short growing period of cabbage may be the reason for the poor yield under m2 nonetheless clippings of the egyptian clover to cabbage row may also cause nitrogen immobilization as well as water loss yuvaraj et al 2020 thus moisture competition as well as the nutrient demand for cabbage could also be the dominant factors for yield reduction in this study the water productivity wp varies due to the variety used climatic conditions and soil management for the effective use of water ali and talukder 2008 chadha 2019 a higher amount of actual evapotranspiration eta under no mulch system may be primarily the cause of the lowest wp due to the complete utilization of water for proportional yield gain the application of straw mulch had the highest wp the combined application of n3m3 significantly produced the maximum wp 120 10 kg ha 1 mm 1 and this might be due to higher water and nutrient availability in the soil at low tension with less evaporation and drainage of water and nutrients as well as root proliferation in favorable soil conditions here mulch provides a better moisture nutrient interaction for metabolic activity of cabbage leading to an increase in the yield of the crop with the same application rate of water and nutrients than the without mulch treatments ali and talukder 2008 kumar and sahu 2013 4 4 crop coefficient of cabbage the crop coefficient represents a crop specific water use and it facilitates the estimation of irrigation water requirements beshir 2017 several researchers kadyampakeni 2013 beshir 2017 yimam et al 2020 used fao tm3 reported brouwer and heibloem 1986 kc values for initial development mid season and maturity as 0 45 0 75 1 05 and 0 90 for non stressed well managed crops in sub humid climates as compared to our values of 0 5 1 0 1 2 and 0 6 respectively chaterlán et al 2011 also determined kc values as 0 65 0 65 1 05 1 05 and 0 95 for initial development mid season and end season for cabbage again the most used fao 56 allen et al 1998 reported kc values of cabbage were 0 7 1 05 and 0 95 for initial mid season and end season respectively the lower kc value at the last growth stage kc end in this study indicated maturity while fao tm3 and fao 56 considered the kc values kc end before senescence starts allen et al 1998 the variation could be mainly due to experiments performed under advective conditions small plots or might be due to the canopy architecture of the variety used and its duration of growth the soil hydraulic properties retention and release and low frequency of irrigation water application considering shallow depth 40 cm of water content as well as differences in the radiation energy available at the soil were also the valuable reasons for changes in kc nonetheless the variations of kc could also be due to the procedure used to compute eto e pan vs fao pm and the non consideration of all water balance components to measure eta however the student s t test was applied to estimate the degree of closeness and it was confirmed that the average seasonal kc value of the studied cabbage 0 82 is close to the fao tm3 reported kc 0 79 value but significantly differed from fao 56 reported kc 0 90 hence this attempt is needed to experimentally verify the estimates locally 4 5 post harvest soil fertility retention of straw and n fertilizer application increased soil quality by enhancing the n supplying power of the soil malhi et al 2012 which was reflected in our study that straw mulch and enhanced nutrient doses significantly improved soil chemical properties with increasing experimental years table 8 slightly higher soc after two years of experiment with mulch and nutrients may be due to the initial application of vermicompost and decomposition of mulched materials choudhary and choudhary 2005 reported that the incorporation of biofertilizers with inorganic fertilizers significantly improved the soc in cabbage manure application can improve the turnover of nutrients and help to preserve them in the soil by increasing microbial activities lentz and lehrsch 2018 more residual npk is likely to become available in the soil after harvesting of cabbage particularly in the second year and this may be due to the presence of clay accumulation horizon table 2 that slows the rate of water drainage and nutrient loss from the upper root zone at a given time tahir and marschner 2016 nonetheless the organic matter together with the clay particles in the surface horizon holds many nutrients that also may reduce leaching loss other studies have shown that the application of straw with sufficient water conservation can increase nutrient fixation through mineralization and thus reduce its leaching at greater depths döring et al 2005 tian et al 2018 the small and scattered roots extending a small volume of soil at depth might be responsible for low npk uptake towards the increase in yield our results demonstrate that the residual npk increased proportionally with the increasing npk application rate khan et al 2002 also noted the maximum available n in the plots supplied with 100 chemical fertilizers and explained that in chemical fertilizers the mineralization process was faster and thereby has shown immediate release of n and its availability in the soil yu et al 2006 and zhang et al 2017 showed that the n fertilizer application rate is the main factor affecting n leaching and n leaching losses increase with increasing amounts of applied fertilizer a similar trend was observed for available phosphorous content in this soil the results were consistent with kar and kumar 2007 and wang et al 2013 who showed that n p and k continued to rise in the plots of straw return combined with inorganic fertilizers the addition of vermicompost crop residue mulch in combination with inorganic fertilizer under surface irrigation had a beneficial effect in increasing phosphate availability upadhyay et al 2012 and potassium release tahir and marschner 2016 tian et al 2018 higher partial factor productivity of fertilizer pfp f coupled with mulch may be attributed to the efficient use of water and fertilizer nutrients throughout the crop growth stages with frequent and controlled water utilization to promote increased yield while also checking or restricting water and nutrient losses through evaporation or deep percolation roberts 2008 wang et al 2017 similar findings have been reported by bai et al 2020 in which pfp f as a direct measurement of fertilizer use efficiency sharply decreased with an increase in fertilization level 4 6 economic analysis although paddy straw mulch m3 had the highest cabbage yield table 7 contributing to the highest gross return however lower bcr was attributed to its higher cost of cultivation table 9 the cost of living mulch was much lower than the cost of paddy straw and ultimately diminished the cost of cultivation and the highest bcr was achieved moreover a higher level of nutrient application ensured higher gross return due to a concomitant increase in cabbage yield covering up the relative increase in cultivation cost was reflected in higher bcr thus m2n3 had the highest bcr among the treatments and it could earn an additional 91 usd ha 1 than m3n3 or 416 usd ha 1 than m1n1 treatments 5 conclusion from the results of the experiment and economic analysis of cabbage production with the combined action of nutrients and mulching it can be concluded that the higher seasonal evapotranspiration was noticed using no mulch feeding with higher rdf 250 150 150 n p2o5 k2o to cabbage at the head filling stage paddy straw and living mulch retained 25 and 10 more soil water storage as compared to no mulch treatments and were reflected in cabbage yield more wp under mulches compared to no mulch demonstrated the effectiveness of mulch in reducing soil evaporation and enhancing soil water storage that increased cabbage yield through utilizing applied nutrients in conserved water competition between the living mulch egyptian clover and cabbage caused a reduction in the yield of cabbage as compared to straw mulch mulch residues along with npk were known to regulate nutrient water availability throughout the growth period and improved soil fertility the crop coefficient values estimated for cabbage can be used to work out the crop water requirements and also irrigation scheduling under similar sub humid climatic conditions the maximum pfp f was obtained with the application of paddy straw mulch along with 75 of rdf application of straw mulch 11 t ha 1 along with 125 of rdf increased cabbage yield and wp in this low fertile clay loam soil thus in situations where paddy straw is cheaply available and land water productivity gets priority paddy straw mulch may be the option yet in the case of economic profitability living mulch is preferable for cabbage cultivation credit authorship contribution statement t biswas conceptualization methodology writing original

actual evapotranspiration eta crop coefficients kc yield and yield attributes of cabbage brassica oleracea var capitata l cv green express during the winter seasons of 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 in the cabbage fallow upland system under surface irrigated conditions the experiment was laid out in a factorial strip plot design where no mulch m1 live mulch m2 egyptian clover trifolium alexandrinum l and paddy straw mulch m3 were in strips with cabbage each treatment contained nutrient levels of 75 n1 100 n2 and 125 n3 of the recommended dose of an npk fertilizer rdf with 200 n 100 p2o5 100 k2o higher soil water conservation under m3 incited 60 and 46 lower profile water change than m1 and m2 treatments respectively paddy straw mulch produced 10 1 and 22 3 more yield and achieved 29 5 and 15 1 higher water productivity wp as compared to m1 and m2 respectively treatment n3 produced the highest yield and the least partial factor productivity of fertilizer pfp f compared to n2 and n1 treatments maximum eta loss was from the m1n3 treatment 226 30 mm and the highest yield 25 695 kg ha 1 yield attributes and wp 120 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 were obtained from the m3n3 combination the average estimated kc values were 0 5 for initial 1 0 for crop development and 1 2 for mid season and 0 6 for maturity stages the results suggest that the application of straw mulch with 125 rdf of chemical

popular winter november to march leafy vegetable grown extensively in the indo gangetic plains of eastern india with the productivity of 21500 kg ha 1 horticulturae statistics division 2015 this shallow rooted cool season crop is cultivated for its large leafy head however soil water availability and inadequate nutrient management strategies are the main constraint for growing profitable crops in this area in the winter season though the region receives high average annual rainfall 1400 mm of which 80 occurs within june to september rainfall during winter is erratic and meager therefore harvesting rainwater and its recycling with proper irrigation management are necessary for growing cabbage in the winter dry season again adopting adequate nutrient management strategies along with soil moisture conservation measures can improve soil ecological conditions and alleviate the damage to crops caused by water and nutrient shortages and uneven distribution of rainfall tiwari et al 2003 kar and kumar 2007 wang et al 2017 saha et al 2021 thus the productivity of cabbage can be improved with proper technological intervention and the adoption of the technology cabbage is a heavy feeder requiring a high rate of nutrition for growth and head yield and prone to nutrient deficiencies khan et al 2002 choudhary et al 2009 chatterjee et al 2012 manea 2017 the nutritional status of the young crop especially nitrogen can markedly affect the rate of development of leaf area chadha 2019 farmers of this area do not follow proper fertilizer management practices and use indiscriminate synthetic fertilizers particularly nitrogen in vegetable production to meet their expectations for higher productivity at the expense of overall soil health and fertilizer costs dasgupta et al 2017 excessive nitrogen may cause loosehead formation and internal decay chatterjee et al 2012 takahashi et al 2017 the demand for phosphorous increases during the head formation stage and potassium deficiency can result in marginal necrosis and retards head quality but in excess cause the head to be loose chatterjee et al 2012 takahashi et al 2017 chadha 2019 wu et al 2020 according to kar and kumar 2007 soil moisture conservation measures can alter water distribution between soil evaporation and plant transpiration and fertilization can increase the use of stored soil water and improve crop yield most of the research works in cabbage were done under drip and plastic mulch conditions barrett et al 2018 shinde et al 2021 takahashi et al 2017 tiwari et al 2003 wu et al 2020 the surface irrigation in the presence of the paddy straw mulch may increase the residence time of the conserved soil water that would help in the dissolution of nutrients paddy straw mulch modifies the micro climate and growing conditions of crops and is commonly used for vegetable crops to retain better moisture through reduced evaporation tiwari et al 2003 suppressing weeds enhancing

management in field crops as well as in vegetables kar and kumar 2007 patil et al 2013 rathod et al 2020 shinde et al 2021 verma et al 2017 most of the field studies on mulch has been focused on soil fertility and crop yield however the effect of straw and live mulches with different doses of npk under the surface irrigated condition on soil water use soil fertility and the production of cabbage are meager in this region since leaf expansion relates closely to water availability the cabbage production during winter november february depends on supplemental irrigation chadha 2019 and being a shallow rooted crop cabbage shows greater sensitivity to soil water stress takahashi et al 2017 saha et al 2021 the major concern of this experiment is the restoration of the fertile conditions of the soil with the rationalized use of water under mulch for the betterment of water productivity and partial factor productivity of applied fertilizers avoiding any soil moisture stress at critical growth stages researchers de pascale et al 2011 shinde et al 2021 tiwari et al 2003 zotarelli et al 2009 postulated that the drip irrigation method has proved its superiority over other conventional methods of irrigation for vegetables throughout the world in respect of water economy but the initial investment required for installing drip accessories is beyond the reach of small farmers of india narayanamoorthy et al 2018 rathod et al 2020 surface irrigation is the most common method for vegetable production by poor resource farmers of india with small land holdings the low pressure hand held sprinkler system with flexible hose pipe has proved to be an effective and efficient surface irrigation technology for small scale farmers and small farmers groups for conveying water efficiently to fields and crops smith et al 2014 rathod et al 2020 the field water balance method involves the change in soil water over time and is employed to measure total water use or actual crop evapotranspiration eta when lysimeters are not available beshir 2017 water use by cabbage is determined by micrometeorological variables nutrients and water availability especially at the stage of development knowledge of crop water requirements to compensate for the eta loss from the soil and its extrapolation through crop coefficient kc is an important practical consideration to improve cabbage water productivity in irrigated agriculture doorenbos and kassam 1979 since kc values vary with local climate and field scale management practices doorenbos and kassam 1979 brouwer and heibloem 1986 allen et al 1998 it can be used as an indicator to measure the effectiveness of a particular soil and water management through eta based irrigation practices it also provides precise water applications in those areas where high irrigation efficiencies are achieved by low energy precision application or subsurface drip irrigation chaterlán et al 2011 beshir 2017 yimam et al 2020 there is no information concerning actual kc at different stages of growth obtained from water balance with cabbage under humid subtropical conditions of eastern india hence considering three mulched conditions no mulch live mulch and paddy straw mulch combined with the three different inorganic fertilizer n p2o5 k2o doses 75 100 and 125 of state recommended dose under surface irrigation our objectives were to find out the changes of profile soil water and evapotranspiration at different growth stages of cabbage to evaluate soil fertility yield attributes and economics of cabbage and to estimate crop coefficients of cabbage under humid subtropical agroecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the research work was carried out at the balindi research complex 22 57 n and

and afternoon for one week for the establishment of seedlings later irrigation water was applied five times at a 10 day interval surface water from sources like runnel a small and narrow channel of watercourse along the side of the ground filled by water during the rainy season july to october was available in the vicinity of the experimental area for irrigation low pressure narrow polyvinylchloride pvc pipe and flexible hose outlets fixed with a 1 hp pump were used for hand held sprinkler irrigation the same amount of water was applied in the same way for mulch and un mulched treatments the depth of irrigation water i mm for the 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 cropping seasons at different stages of cabbage table 3 was calculated based on the following equation 1 i θ fc θ i ρ b ρ

observations soil water content was measured gravimetrically to a depth of 40 cm at 20 cm increments before sowing and every 10 days three random locations in each plot were taken to measure soil water content the sample holes created by screw augers were immediately refilled and packed with loose soils soil water storage sws mm was calculated using the following formula 3 sws θ m ρ b ρ w d 10 where θm is the fraction of soil water g g 1 during sampling and d is the effective root zone depth cm the actual evapotranspiration eta was calculated from the following water balance equation 4 eta

the amount of surface runoff mm δs the change in the soil water storage mm the effective precipitation mm in the crop growing season was estimated by the soil water balance sheet method following fao 1974 and bandyopadhyay and mallick 2003 the capillary rise was assumed nil because the groundwater table was deep 2 5 m during the observation periods no runoff was observed during the experiments due to low precipitation and flat topography deep drainage d beyond the root zone was calculated as the excess water above the storage capacity of soil after application of each event of irrigation or heavy rainfall from the soil water balance sheet method bandyopadhyay et al 2003 in this study no drainage water out of the root zone was observed as very little and scattered rainfall occurred during the cabbage growth periods 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 and the low pressure hand held sprinkler irrigation never attained more than storage capacity 100 mm of the experimental soil in the root zone the δs

distance of short green grass as 1000 m from the pan allen et al 1998 during the cabbage growing seasons crop coefficient value kc is the empirical ratio of eta by a target crop under the non stressed condition to eto and is expressed as 7 k c et a et 0 where the eta values of m1n3 treatment i e with maximum evapotranspiration were used to calculate kc 2 6 yield and yield attributes during harvesting ten cabbage heads per treatment plot taken randomly were cut and split longitudinally to measure the following parameters the diameter of the head mm was measured as the horizontal distance from one side to another side of the selected head and the thickness of the head mm was measured as the vertical distance from the lowermost level to the uppermost level of the head to determine the cabbage volume cm3 the circumference of the cabbage head was measured assuming a spherical shape of it and the compactness was calculated from the fresh weight g measured by a digital weighing balance per unit volume of cabbage the yield per unit plot kg plot 1 was recorded by weighing all compact cabbage heads excluding unfolded leaves marketable yield in each unit plot and was expressed in kg per

factor productivity of applied fertilizer pfp f is a simple production efficiency expression calculated in units of crop yield per unit of fertilizer npk applied and expressed as kg kg 1 as 9 pfp f y amount of npk applied 2 8 post harvest soil analyses to find out the existence of residual npk in soils five representative field moist samples were collected from each plot from the 0 40 cm soil depth with a bucket auger after harvesting of cabbage in each year and pooled to make a composite sample for each replication bulk samples were placed in plastic bags air dried at room temperature 28 air dried sub samples were crushed passed through a 2 0 mm sieve and used for the determination of chemical properties oxidizable soil organic carbon soc available n p2o5 and k2o were determined following sparks 1996 2 9 economic analysis through benefit cost ratio economic analysis of the field experiment was done by considering contemporary market prices of inputs labor and produce in indian rupee inr during 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 crop seasons and converted into us dollars usd the cost of cultivation included the expenses incurred for land preparation seed procurement nursery raising planting intercultural operation mulching materials organic and mineral fertilizers and their application plant protection measures irrigation water harvesting and processing the gross return was calculated by multiplying the marketable yield kg ha 1 with the market price of cabbage 0 081 0 093 usd kg 1 based on the prevailing average market price of cabbage heads during 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively the net return was determined by deducting the cost of cultivation from the gross return and the benefit cost ratio bcr was calculated as the ratio of gross return to the cost of cultivation 2 10 statistical analysis two way analysis of variance anova was performed on each dependent variable with mulch no mulch live mulch and paddy straw mulch and nutrient management three different doses of npk as factors and their interactions statistical analyses of evapotranspiration yield and yield attributes water use efficiency residual soil nutrients and economic analysis were performed using windows based genstat ver 12 0 comparisons and interactions among treatment means were performed using the least significant difference lsd through duncan s multiple range test dmrt calculated at 5 level of significance 3 results 3 1 temperature and rainfall prevail for cabbage growth daily distribution of temperature rainfall and reference evapotranspiration eto varied during

eto along with temperature during 20 dat onwards figs 1a and 1b imposed more irrigation demand of cabbage 3 2 soil water storage the root zone soil water storage with paddy straw mulch treatment increased in various degrees compared with no mulch and living mulch at cupping to maturity stages of cabbage over the two experimental years table 4 at the cupping stage of cabbage straw mulch increased 15 and 10 over live much and 20 and 13 over no mulch in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 cropping seasons respectively however no significant difference was observed among live mulch and no mulch treatments at the head formation stage soil water storage was significantly higher with straw mulch treatment by 15 22 than that with live mulch and by 37 38 than with no mulch treatments respectively live mulch treatment showed significantly higher storage by 13 20 than that with no mulch treatment during this period during the head filling stage live mulch and straw mulch treatments significantly increased the soil water storage by 9 10 and 23 28 over no mulch treatment on average mulching significantly increased soil water storage at maturity by 19 20 in comparison to no mulch treatments over the two years 3 3 soil water balance and evapotranspiration soil profile water change under different treatments in the 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 cropping seasons ranged from 18 33 to 37 67 mm and 16 53 35 87 mm respectively table 5 application of straw mulch m3 produced 60 and 46 lower profile water change as compared with no mulch m1 and live mulch m2 further 23 and 9 more change in profile water was observed under n3 as compared with n1 and n2 treatments respectively a total of 184 and 195 mm water was applied on cabbage in the form of irrigation water 170 and 165 mm and effective rainfall 14 and 30 mm during the 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 cropping seasons in this study the actual evapotranspiration eta ranged from 202 30 to 221 70 mm and 211 50 230 90 mm during the 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 cropping seasons respectively table 5 no mulch m1 significantly produced higher eta as compared with m2 and m3 on the other hand n3 produced significantly the highest eta as compared with n1 and n2 respectively maximum eta ranged between 221 70 and 230 90 mm with a mean seasonal value of 226 30 mm under the combination of m1n3 treatment over the two experimental years the combined analysis of variance indicated table 5 that mulch nutrient doses year and the interaction among mulch and nutrient doses showed a significant variation on profile water change as well as actual evapotranspiration the eta rate under different mulching and nutrient dose during the 2018 2019 figs 2a and 2b and 2019 2020 figs 2c and 2d cropping seasons showed that the eta rate was comparatively higher during the first year and m1 and n3 possessed maximum eta rate throughout the growth period the maximum eta rate was observed at the head formation stage of the crop growth i e at 36 45 dat in both years for m1 m2 and m3 treatments the rates were 2 19 2 00 and 1 84 mm d 1 during 2018 2019 and 1 80 1 77 and 1 62 mm d 1 during 2019 2020 cropping season on the other hand the eta rates for n1 n2 and n3 treatments were 1 68 1 86 and 2 14 mm d 1 during 2018 2019 and 1 41 1 49 and 1 68 mm d 1 during 2019 2020 cropping season simultaneously eto maintained a constant rate up to 30 dat after which it increased depending upon the evaporative demand of the environment in which the cabbage was grown 3 4 yield attributes and water use efficiency cabbage diameter thickness or height volume and compactness under different treatments in the 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 cropping seasons ranged from 142 7 to 168 5 mm and 146 6 169 6 mm 144 6 167 2 mm and 147 3 173 0 mm 1522 2506 cm3 and 1651 2556 cm3 0 78 1 03 g cm 3 and 0 90 1 04 g cm 3 respectively table 6 the application of straw mulch m3 significantly produced more diameter 2 4 and 6 0 thickness 4 7 and 6 2 and volume of cabbage 7 5 and 18 6 than live m2 and no mulch m1 respectively a higher dose of npk fertilizers n3 also significantly increased the diameter 4 5 and 8 2 thickness 8 0 and 9 5 and volume 13 8 and 26 1 of cabbage than n2 and n1 respectively both m2 and m3 as well as n1 and n2 contributed equivalent to the compaction of cabbage significantly highest diameter 168 5 and 169 6 mm thickness 167 2 and 173 0 mm and volume 2506 and 2556 cm3 of cabbage were recorded from the treatment combination of m3n3 for 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 cropping seasons respectively table 6 however the highest compactness 1 03 and 1 04 g cm 3 was observed under the m1n1 treatment combination the combined analysis of variance indicated that mulch nutrient doses year and the interaction of mulch nutrient doses affected the yield attributes of cabbage especially diameter and thickness mulch and its interactions with year and nutrient showed no significant variation in cabbage compactness yield and water productivity wp were significantly affected by the application of mulch and different levels of fertilizer dose during the 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 cropping seasons table 7 the cabbage yield ranged from 17 780 to 26 420 and from 16 320 to 24 970 kg ha 1 for the two consecutive years respectively results showed that straw mulch m3 recorded 10 1 and 22 3 more yield than live mulch m2 and no mulch m1 respectively live mulch increased by 11 0 more yield than no mulch treatment on average higher nutrient dose n3 significantly increased 12 0 and 25 7 more yield than n2 and n1 respectively and treatment n2 increased by 12 2 more yield than n1 table 7 on average straw mulch m3 and live mulch m2 produced 29 5 and 12 6 more wp as compared to no mulch table 7 during the experimental years n3 treatment significantly increased 10 8 and 22 3 more wp than n2 and n1 respectively the combined application of m3n3 significantly produced the highest yield 25 695 kg ha 1 and wp 120 10 kg ha 1 mm 1 the analysis of variance indicated that mulch nutrient doses and year individually and mulch nutrient doses had a significant effect on the marketable yield of cabbage and water productivity 3 5 crop coefficients of cabbage crop coefficient kc values of cabbage were obtained from eta of m1n3 treatment i e with maximum evapotranspiration divided by the reference et eto during 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 cropping seasons and are shown in fig 3 during the first stage of crop growth which covered the period from sowing through 20 days after sowing das kc values increased from 0 1 to 0 9 during the crop development stage 21 35 das kc values further increased from 0 9 to 1 3 the maximum value of kc was 1 5 during 50 55 das close to the head formation stage of cabbage during the mid season of crop growth starting from 36 to 70 das the average crop coefficient was 1 2 the crop coefficients declined rapidly to 0 5 during the last crop growth stage covering the period from 71 to 90 das fig 3 the average estimated values of crop coefficients were 0 5 for initial 1 0 for crop development and 1 2 for mid season and 0 6 for maturity stages although the estimated kc value of initial was identical with fao tm3 brouwer and heibloem 1986 value however it showed 29 lower than fao 56 allen et al 1998 value during the crop development and mid season stages the estimated kc values were 33 and 14 higher than the values reported by fao tm3 the kc value at the last growth stage was 33 and 37 lower than fao tm3 and fao 56 values respectively 3 6 post harvest soil fertility the effect of mulch and nutrients on soil chemical properties viz soil organic carbon soc available n p2o5 and k2o after cabbage harvesting during 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 cropping seasons are presented in table 8 during the 2019 2020 cropping season the soil chemical property values showed significantly higher than the previous year soil organic carbon ranged from 4 58 to 5 94 and 4 86 6 36 g kg 1 under different treatment combinations whereas soil available n ranged from 119 8 to 189 8 and 127 8 203 6 kg ha 1 for the two consecutive years respectively available p2o5 and k2o for these years ranged from 24 5 to 42 8 and from 232 2 to 302 3 kg ha 1 live mulch m2 and straw mulch m3 increased 9 and 18 more soc 14 and 23 more available n 18 and 27 more available p2o5 and 10 and 18 more available k2o as compared to no mulch m1 treatment again n3 treatment increased 6 5 and 7 5 more soc 11 and 28 more available n 18 and 36 more available p2o5 and 5 and 10 more available k2o as compared with n2 and n1 treatments respectively on average m3n3 treatment combinations showed the highest values of soc 6 2 g kg 1 available n 196 7 kg ha 1 p2o5 42 8 kg ha 1 and k2o 302 3 kg ha 1 respectively table 8 the analysis of variance indicated that mulch nutrient doses year and the interaction among mulch and nutrient doses had a significant effect on residual soc available n p2o5 and k2o interaction of year mulch had a significant effect on available p2o5 and k2o and interaction of year nutrient showed a significant effect on available n and p2o5 nonetheless interactions among variables were significant for available n p2o5 and k2o the grain yield per unit fertilizer inputs described by the partial factor productivity of applied fertilizers pfpf ranged from 36 53 m1n3 to 67 80 m3n1 kg kg 1 under different treatment combinations fig 4 n1 registered a higher pfpf of 61 33 kg kg 1 as against n2 51 61 kg kg 1 and n3 42 03 kg kg 1 respectively the pfpf of straw mulch m3 was noticed to be relatively higher 56 80 kg kg 1 as compared with m2 51 37 kg kg 1 and m1 46 80 kg kg 1 respectively the treatment combination of m3n1found significantly higher pfpf 67 80 kg kg 1 followed by m2n1 59 37 kg kg 1 and m1n1 56 83 kg kg 1 respectively fig 4 although m3n3 treatment showed higher yield and wue but exerted a lower pfpf 46 71 kg kg 1 3 7 economic analysis the economic feasibility of mulching and different levels of fertilizer application were evaluated by conducting benefit cost analysis and it was presented in table 9 among mulching treatments paddy straw mulching m3 had 29 higher cultivation cost over no mulch in both years and 24 and 23 higher cultivation cost over live mulch in two years of cultivation respectively the results indicated that m3n3 required the highest cost of cultivation 1445 6 and 1578 9 usd ha 1 in both years however significantly the highest gross return was also encountered in m3n3 treatments in both years 2141 9 and 2318 5 usd ha 1 although m3 ensued significantly higher gross return 21 23 than m1 m2 had significantly the highest 27 higher over m1 net return for both years of cabbage cultivation 690 9 and 702 2 usd ha 1 thus significantly the highest benefit cost ratio bcr was observed table 9 in m2 treatments 1 537 and 1 498 in two years respectively for nutrient treatments 125 rdf treatment ensued significantly the highest gross and net return in the case of interaction treatments m3n3 had the highest gross return 2141 9 and 2318 5 usd ha 1 respectively but m2n3 had the highest net return 822 2 and 795 6 usd ha 1 respectively which ultimately reflected in terms of higher bcr 1 699 and 1 615 respectively in the studied two years 4 discussion 4 1 soil water storage soil water availability for crop growth was strongly related to soil physical conditions in this study cabbage plants under mulch treatments utilized maximum water due to higher water retention and low permeability of the surface soil table 2 creating a narrow suction gradient nonetheless higher soil water storage with straw mulch and living mulch at various stages of cabbage table 4 may be attributed to the improvement of soil properties lower soil evaporation and the cumulative effect of residue buildup nie et al 2007 tahir and marschner 2016 tian et al 2018 although the living mulch competes with cabbage for light moisture and nutrients by depleting a considerable amount of water resulting in a smaller amount of water storage than paddy straw mulch treatment especially during the head filling stage of cabbage a similar effect was observed by brainard et al 2004 4 2 soil water balance and actual evapotranspiration the actual evapotranspiration eta rate expresses the amount of water lost from the cabbage plot in units of water depth higher profile water change in m2 as compared with m3 may be due to collective evapotranspiration of clover and cabbage for moisture hooks and johnson 2004 the decrease in eta under paddy straw could be related to the existence of micro climate concerning evaporation loss by acting as a barrier between the soil and environment resulting in better soil water retention ability a total of 184 and 195 mm water was applied on cabbage in the form of irrigation water 170 and 165 mm and effective rainfall 14 and 30 mm during the 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 cropping seasons several researchers tiwari et al 2003 wahome et al 2009 kumar and sahu 2013 wu et al 2020 saha et al 2021 reported a wide range of depth of irrigation water of cabbage crops under different climatic conditions and geographic locations due to variety length of the growing season irrigation methods and intervals and types of mulching used the contribution of eta using live mulch as compared to no mulch was very low and probably due to cutting of live mulch and the covered area with succulent cutting tissues at the drying and decomposition highest eta under n3 as compared with n1 and n2 table 5 and figs 2b and 2d may be due to higher depletion of soil water to promote the vegetative growth and head development of cabbage especially at the transpiring area leaf area and dry matter and thus resulted in higher crop transpiration and eta by using the water balance method the mean highest measured seasonal eta of cabbage during both years amounts to 226 30 mm for m1n3 table 5 and the variation of eta depends on the straw loading live mulch density loading soil water content and the evaporative demand many researchers han et al 2015 beshir 2017 verma et al 2017 shinde et al 2021 showed that the magnitude of seasonal crop water use or eta of cabbage varied with the type of mulching polythene straw live mulch etc imposed irrigation amount and methods drip sprinkler or surface flooding during 2018 2019 the eta and eto rate was comparatively higher due to sunny warm weather fig 1 than the 2019 2020 cropping season with scattered cloudy weather and high relative humidity table 1 4 3 yield attributes and water use efficiency the improvement of yield attributes might be because the significantly higher soil moisture at the head filling stage of cabbage table 4 and the higher soil nutrient table 6 with straw incorporation promote crop transpiration many researchers meena and paliwal 2003 choudhary and choudhary 2005 chadha 2019 reported that an increase in cabbage parameters corresponded with an increase in levels of npk fertilizers in indian soils the greater effectiveness of straw mulch in increasing the growth components was attributed to suppressing weed growth maintaining optimum soil temperature and retarding moisture as well as nutrient depletion nonetheless the optimum water in the vicinity of the root zone throughout the crop growth stages reducing soil water stress and plant cell turgid pressure and enhanced the vegetative growth of the crop through increasing photosynthesis and efficient translocation of photosynthates towards the head kumar and sahu 2013 verma et al 2017 the yield of the cabbage varies greatly depending upon variety water availability soil fertility maturity group and season of cultivation cabbage prefers 12 27 c though it can tolerate a minimum temperature of 5 c chadha 2019 in this experiment the minimum and maximum atmospheric temperatures resided within the desirable range the yield increase in response to the higher dose of npk fertilizers n3 suggests that n supplied from the soil as well as from the living mulch did not fully meet the need of the crop application of a higher dose of npk fertilizers and paddy straw mulch m3n3 was largely a function of improved growth and subsequent increase in yield attributing characters the straw mulch extends the soil water residence times and helps in the dissolution and distribution of nutrients throughout the root zone wu et al 2020 this combined action may result in faster carbohydrate production and efficient transport of photosynthates to the head and thus leads to increase head diameter volume and yield agrawal et al 2018 a similar beneficial effect of mulches on the yield of cabbage was also reported by tiwari et al 2003 beshir 2017 and verma et al 2017 reduction of soil temperature by mulching at the head filling stage 51 50 dat may also be the reason for higher yield our finding of cabbage yield 25 695 kg ha 1 is in close agreement with 25 000 30 000 kg ha 1 savita et al 2014 in india from this type of early varieties in this study the living mulch egyptian clover was able to overtop the cabbage restricting light from reaching the crop canopy and causing a 10 yield reduction as compared to straw mulch interspecific competition for light water and nutrients between the living mulch and vegetable crops can limit the use of the system brainard et al 2004 kolota and adamczewska sowinska 2013 the low initial fertility status of the soil and the unavailability of mineralized n from the egyptian clover within the short growing period of cabbage may be the reason for the poor yield under m2 nonetheless clippings of the egyptian clover to cabbage row may also cause nitrogen immobilization as well as water loss yuvaraj et al 2020 thus moisture competition as well as the nutrient demand for cabbage could also be the dominant factors for yield reduction in this study the water productivity wp varies due to the variety used climatic conditions and soil management for the effective use of water ali and talukder 2008 chadha 2019 a higher amount of actual evapotranspiration eta under no mulch system may be primarily the cause of the lowest wp due to the complete utilization of water for proportional yield gain the application of straw mulch had the highest wp the combined application of n3m3 significantly produced the maximum wp 120 10 kg ha 1 mm 1 and this might be due to higher water and nutrient availability in the soil at low tension with less evaporation and drainage of water and nutrients as well as root proliferation in favorable soil conditions here mulch provides a better moisture nutrient interaction for metabolic activity of cabbage leading to an increase in the yield of the crop with the same application rate of water and nutrients than the without mulch treatments ali and talukder 2008 kumar and sahu 2013 4 4 crop coefficient of cabbage the crop coefficient represents a crop specific water use and it facilitates the estimation of irrigation water requirements beshir 2017 several researchers kadyampakeni 2013 beshir 2017 yimam et al 2020 used fao tm3 reported brouwer and heibloem 1986 kc values for initial development mid season and maturity as 0 45 0 75 1 05 and 0 90 for non stressed well managed crops in sub humid climates as compared to our values of 0 5 1 0 1 2 and 0 6 respectively chaterlán et al 2011 also determined kc values as 0 65 0 65 1 05 1 05 and 0 95 for initial development mid season and end season for cabbage again the most used fao 56 allen et al 1998 reported kc values of cabbage were 0 7 1 05 and 0 95 for initial mid season and end season respectively the lower kc value at the last growth stage kc end in this study indicated maturity while fao tm3 and fao 56 considered the kc values kc end before senescence starts allen et al 1998 the variation could be mainly due to experiments performed under advective conditions small plots or might be due to the canopy architecture of the variety used and its duration of growth the soil hydraulic properties retention and release and low frequency of irrigation water application considering shallow depth 40 cm of water content as well as differences in the radiation energy available at the soil were also the valuable reasons for changes in kc nonetheless the variations of kc could also be due to the procedure used to compute eto e pan vs fao pm and the non consideration of all water balance components to measure eta however the student s t test was applied to estimate the degree of closeness and it was confirmed that the average seasonal kc value of the studied cabbage 0 82 is close to the fao tm3 reported kc 0 79 value but significantly differed from fao 56 reported kc 0 90 hence this attempt is needed to experimentally verify the estimates locally 4 5 post harvest soil fertility retention of straw and n fertilizer application increased soil quality by enhancing the n supplying power of the soil malhi et al 2012 which was reflected in our study that straw mulch and enhanced nutrient doses significantly improved soil chemical properties with increasing experimental years table 8 slightly higher soc after two years of experiment with mulch and nutrients may be due to the initial application of vermicompost and decomposition of mulched materials choudhary and choudhary 2005 reported that the incorporation of biofertilizers with inorganic fertilizers significantly improved the soc in cabbage manure application can improve the turnover of nutrients and help to preserve them in the soil by increasing microbial activities lentz and lehrsch 2018 more residual npk is likely to become available in the soil after harvesting of cabbage particularly in the second year and this may be due to the presence of clay accumulation horizon table 2 that slows the rate of water drainage and nutrient loss from the upper root zone at a given time tahir and marschner 2016 nonetheless the organic matter together with the clay particles in the surface horizon holds many nutrients that also may reduce leaching loss other studies have shown that the application of straw with sufficient water conservation can increase nutrient fixation through mineralization and thus reduce its leaching at greater depths döring et al 2005 tian et al 2018 the small and scattered roots extending a small volume of soil at depth might be responsible for low npk uptake towards the increase in yield our results demonstrate that the residual npk increased proportionally with the increasing npk application rate khan et al 2002 also noted the maximum available n in the plots supplied with 100 chemical fertilizers and explained that in chemical fertilizers the mineralization process was faster and thereby has shown immediate release of n and its availability in the soil yu et al 2006 and zhang et al 2017 showed that the n fertilizer application rate is the main factor affecting n leaching and n leaching losses increase with increasing amounts of applied fertilizer a similar trend was observed for available phosphorous content in this soil the results were consistent with kar and kumar 2007 and wang et al 2013 who showed that n p and k continued to rise in the plots of straw return combined with inorganic fertilizers the addition of vermicompost crop residue mulch in combination with inorganic fertilizer under surface irrigation had a beneficial effect in increasing phosphate availability upadhyay et al 2012 and potassium release tahir and marschner 2016 tian et al 2018 higher partial factor productivity of fertilizer pfp f coupled with mulch may be attributed to the efficient use of water and fertilizer nutrients throughout the crop growth stages with frequent and controlled water utilization to promote increased yield while also checking or restricting water and nutrient losses through evaporation or deep percolation roberts 2008 wang et al 2017 similar findings have been reported by bai et al 2020 in which pfp f as a direct measurement of fertilizer use efficiency sharply decreased with an increase in fertilization level 4 6 economic analysis although paddy straw mulch m3 had the highest cabbage yield table 7 contributing to the highest gross return however lower bcr was attributed to its higher cost of cultivation table 9 the cost of living mulch was much lower than the cost of paddy straw and ultimately diminished the cost of cultivation and the highest bcr was achieved moreover a higher level of nutrient application ensured higher gross return due to a concomitant increase in cabbage yield covering up the relative increase in cultivation cost was reflected in higher bcr thus m2n3 had the highest bcr among the treatments and it could earn an additional 91 usd ha 1 than m3n3 or 416 usd ha 1 than m1n1 treatments 5 conclusion from the results of the experiment and economic analysis of cabbage production with the combined action of nutrients and mulching it can be concluded that the higher seasonal evapotranspiration was noticed using no mulch feeding with higher rdf 250 150 150 n p2o5 k2o to cabbage at the head filling stage paddy straw and living mulch retained 25 and 10 more soil water storage as compared to no mulch treatments and were reflected in cabbage yield more wp under mulches compared to no mulch demonstrated the effectiveness of mulch in reducing soil evaporation and enhancing soil water storage that increased cabbage yield through utilizing applied nutrients in conserved water competition between the living mulch egyptian clover and cabbage caused a reduction in the yield of cabbage as compared to straw mulch mulch residues along with npk were known to regulate nutrient water availability throughout the growth period and improved soil fertility the crop coefficient values estimated for cabbage can be used to work out the crop water requirements and also irrigation scheduling under similar sub humid climatic conditions the maximum pfp f was obtained with the application of paddy straw mulch along with 75 of rdf application of straw mulch 11 t ha 1 along with 125 of rdf increased cabbage yield and wp in this low fertile clay loam soil thus in situations where paddy straw is cheaply available and land water productivity gets priority paddy straw mulch may be the option yet in the case of economic profitability living mulch is preferable for cabbage cultivation credit authorship contribution statement t biswas conceptualization methodology writing original

9649,satellite soil moisture sm has been increasingly available and the use of sm based indices has a great potential for agricultural drought monitoring this study evaluates the performance of two satellite sm products the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos and soil moisture active passive smap on drought detection and assessment in the north china plain ncp over the period of 2015 2018 with a comparison between two sm based drought indices soil water deficit index swdi and soil moisture condition index smci vegetation condition index vci and vegetation drought index vdi were adopted as the reference indices overall smap outperformed smos in sm data validation as well as drought detection in the ncp region a simple bias correction of the satellite sm data was able to improve their performance in characterizing agricultural drought via sm based indices compared with swdi smci appeared to be the more appropriate index for drought monitoring by showing a better agreement with both vci and vdi in terms of drought characteristics i e spatial distribution drought category and frequency though both sm based indices overestimated drought severity to some extent a simply sm based drought indicator could be effective when satellite sm was applied for capturing agricultural drought and a full consideration of longer term satellite data might be necessary keywords agricultural drought soil moisture smos smap swdi smci 1 introduction drought can be classified into four types meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic drought among which agricultural drought is considered to be the more complex and poorly understood natural hazard shen et al 2019 agricultural drought normally occurs when soil moisture sm reaches such a low level that poses a negative effect on crop yield agricultural drought could impact agricultural production and threat food security boyer 1982 tian et al 2018 and it is associated with environmental and socio economic issues due to its high frequency and long lasting impacts piao et al 2010 the frequency of agricultural drought disasters may increase with increasing extreme weather under climate change boyer 1982 therefore monitoring agricultural drought and establishing effective early warning systems are necessary in risk management research on drought monitoring has been of increasing interest to the scientific community and a variety of indices based on different indicators have been proposed to detect drought most of the indices are based on the meteorological data e g the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and the precipitation condition index pci zhang and jia 2013 based on precipitation the atmosphere water deficit awd purcell et al 2003 and the evaporative stress index esi otkin et al 2013 calculated by evapotranspiration and the temperature condition index tci kogan 1995b related to temperature agricultural drought was initially investigated more from a climatological perspective most typically the crop moisture index cmi palmer 1968 a traditional agricultural drought index was developed on the basis of the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 which is a commonly used meteorological drought index vegetation condition was then taken into account to form indices such as the vegetation condition index vci schell 1973 the vegetation health index vhi kogan 1995a and the vegetation drought index vdi sun et al 2013 in fact sm is a storage component for antecedent precipitation and meteorological conditions that responds to rainfall anomalies in prior to plants making it a more critical factor for crop growth sm is considered to be the governing variable for agricultural drought and it has been incorporated into agricultural drought studies initially it was calculated or estimated through water balance or hydrological modeling using meteorological data for instance sheffield et al 2004 constructed the vic variable infiltration capacity drought index using sm obtained from the vic model narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 developed the soil moisture deficit index smdi and the evapotranspiration deficit index etdi to analyze agricultural drought based on sm derived from the swat soil and water assessment tool model later on due to increasing availability of sm data they have been directly used to form indices for detecting and assessing agricultural drought sridhar et al 2008 introduced soil moisture index smi derived by sm from the automated weather data network awdn and identified a satisfactory role of sm played in drought monitoring more recently martinez fernandez et al 2015 proposed the soil water deficit index swdi based on sm data from the soil moisture measurements stations network of the university of salamanca remedhus and demonstrated its reliability by achieving high correlations with awd and cmi respectively despite the use of in situ sm data being identified effective to assess agricultural drought the great progress in remote sensing during recent decade provides a good alternative for drought monitoring using sm based indices due to its continuous spatial coverage there are two satellites dedicated to map global sm which have received increasing attention one is the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2010 from the europe space agency esa and the other is soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2008 from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa sm retrieved from the two satellites have been validated both on a global scale al yaari et al 2019 al bitar et al 2017 entekhabi et al 2008 and regional scale al yaari et al 2019 al bitar et al 2017 albergel et al 2012 dente et al 2012 entekhabi et al 2008 louvet et al 2015 rahmoune et al 2014 and desirable agreements were demonstrated between satellite based sm and in situ data application of the sm products for agricultural drought monitoring has been particularly investigated the application of smos sm was initially assimilated into crop models to assess agricultural drought chakrabarti et al 2014 upon the introduction of swdi martinez fernandez et al 2015 quite a few attempts have been made to apply smos data in detecting agricultural drought martinez fernandez et al 2016 paredes trejo and barbosa 2017 souza et al 2018 meanwhile a new soil moisture agricultural drought index smadi based on the integration of smos and modis observations was also developed sanchez et al 2016 which showed diverse applications of satellite data in agricultural drought monitoring with the launch of smap in 2015 similar efforts have been made in a number of studies either by a direct application of satellite based sm in monitoring drought or by use of agricultural drought indices derived from smap retrievals velpuri et al 2016 compared smap sm with the weekly drought severity images provided by the us drought monitor usdm and found that smap could well benefit drought assessment moreover the sm anomalies reflected by smap was compared with usdm and spi over the contiguous united states conus in the study of eswar et al 2018 who suggested that sm could be set as a parameter to drought monitoring system similar to smos fair to satisfactory performances of swdi derived by smap sm data have been found in the united states mishra et al 2017 china bai et al 2018 and a particular watershed e g the xiang river basin zhu et al 2019 so far there have been a variety of sm based agricultural drought indices that satellite observations tend to be utilized such as smci soil moisture condition index zhang and jia 2013 smdi soil moisture deficit index narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 swdi soil water deficit index martinez fernandez et al 2015 pablos et al 2017 initiatively compared four sm related agricultural drought indices over northwest spain and identified the best performance from swdi followed by smadi this might suggest that a sm based index which only relies on satellite sm data could be adequate for agricultural drought monitoring however very few works have been published investigating the impact of the choice of a sm based index on the effectiveness of agricultural drought characterization in this study we focused on two potentially applicable sm based indices swdi and smci of which satisfactory performances have been observed respectively swdi derived by sm from various satellites e g smos martinez fernandez et al 2016 smap bai et al 2018 amsr2 ascat and era interim baik et al 2019 were proved to have reliable drought detection capability due to the good consistency of results with those from awd smci also showed its potential to be integrated into a drought monitoring system since it was found to have good correlations with spi at various time scales especially at short or moderate time scales zhang and jia 2013 zhang et al 2017 smci more commonly acted as a sm representative index to be incorporated with other indices characterizing vegetation land surface temperature etc to form a new drought index sanchez et al 2016 while separate use of smci was relatively rare the objective of this study is to achieve an advanced understanding of the capability and applicability of simply sm based agricultural drought indices via an inter comparison between different indices as well as different satellite data the north china plain ncp one of the main grain production areas and also one of the most drought prone regions in china is chosen as the study area spatiotemporal drought behavior is assessed in this region using two satellite products i e smos l3 and smap l3 for their appropriate data length temporal and spatial resolution swdi and smci two drought indices based on sm are analyzed and compared with the widely accepted agricultural drought index vci and the more recently used vdi this study could provide insights into incorporating remote sensing sm into an agricultural drought monitoring system 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the north china plain ncp is the second largest plain in china ranging between 32 n and 43 n and 113 e and 123 e the ncp region involves five provinces hebei shandong henan anhui and jiangsu and two municipalities beijing tianjin fig 1 with an area of approximately 400 000 km2 the ncp region investigated in this study follows the administrative boundaries for simplicity according to köppen climate classification the ncp area is subject to different climate from north to south with hot summer continental climate for beijing and tianjin hot semi arid climate for hebei dry winter subtropical climate for henan and shandong and humid subtropical climate for anhui and jiangsu fig 2a ncp has distinct seasonal variation in precipitation and temperature with mean annual temperature of 8 15 c and annual precipitation of 500 900 mm soil is characterized by loam and silt loam fig 2b which is fertile since the ncp region is formed by the sedimentation of yellow haihe and luanhe rivers the ncp is one of the main agricultural production areas and an important production base for grain cotton and oil in china with a cultivated land area mainly dry land and paddy field fig 2c accounting for 27 9 of the whole national arable land however due to a strong temporal variability of precipitation the ncp has been suffering frequent droughts especially in spring early summer and autumn as recorded the area of drought in this region normally accounts for the highest proportion of drought stricken area of china 2 2 soil moisture data 2 2 1 smos and smap products the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos launched by european space agency in november 2009 is the first satellite that takes mapping global sm at the top 5 cm as one of its main missions kerr et al 2010 smos is equipped with an aperture synthesis l band radiometer 1 41 ghz for a target accuracy of 0 04 m3 m 3 datum from different levels and versions of smos are provided in https www catds fr sipad compared to previous versions of smos smos l3 products provide enhanced global sm maps at different time scales easing the processing processes for the scientific community al yaari et al 2019 the data quality of smos l3 was guaranteed though smos l2 outperformed l3 products in some regions due to the time lag issues it had little impact for studies on drought monitoring al bitar et al 2017 daily and monthly sm data from smos l3 products 25 km 25 km has been available since june 2011 with a 7 day latency one cycle of the satellite provides the data of ascending 6 00 am and descending 6 00 pm orbits respectively since the ascending smos data were widely shown to better match ground based sm than the descending data al bitar et al 2017 carsten et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 the ascending data of smos l3 at a daily time scale from 2015 to 2018 was used in this study launched by nasa in january 2015 the soil moisture active passive smap is the most recent satellite to observe surface sm and also provide root zone sm products carrying sensors of an active l band radar 3 km 1 26 ghz and a passive l band radiometer 36 km 1 41 ghz on a single platform the combined active passive satellite is able to provide 3 km 9 km and 36 km sm estimates on a global scale with an accuracy target of unrmse unbiased root mean square errors less than 0 04 m3 m 3 the radiometer of smap continuously provided high quality data as planned whereas its radar unfortunately failed on 7 july 2015 smap l3 providing a composite of smap l2 is retrieved from the smap radiometer tavakol et al 2019 therefore its continuity was not influenced by the failure of radar and was chosen in this study smap science data processing system sds processed and released smap science data which are available freely from https nsidc org data smap smap data html similar to smos the smap was placed to monitor the earth s surface twice a day descending sun synchronous 6 00 am and ascending 6 00 pm orbit separately smap l3 enhanced sm products with a spatial resolution of 9 km 9 km descending from 2015 to 2018 were used in this study 2 2 2 cldas and gldas cldas china meteorological administration land data assimilation system v2 0 is developed by data fusion and assimilation techniques using ground satellite and other observation data from various sources shi et al 2011 launched by china meteorological data service centre in january 2017 cldas v2 0 provides hourly gridded sm data covering the east asian region 70 150 e 0 60 n at a spatial resolution of 0 0625 at six different layers 0 5 cm 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 10 40 cm 40 80 cm and 80 200 cm eskinder et al 2018 liu et al 2019a according to product manual china meteorological administration 2017 the sm product of cldas v2 0 in china has been evaluated by the quality controlled observation data and the results were satisfactory on average the pearson correlation coefficient is 0 89 and root mean square error is 0 02 the cldas sm products were also validated in a number of studies eskinder et al 2018 leng et al 2019 yu et al 2018 which confirmed the reliability and stability of the dataset in this study daily averaged cldas sm 0 5 cm in 2017 was used to validate the satellite based products gldas global land data assimilation system rodell et al 2004 v2 1 2000 present is also a combination of model and observation based datasets which provides global sm data at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 every 3 h at four different depths 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm validation and the application of gldas have been conducted all over the world showing good performances of the sm datasets cammalleri et al 2017 liu et al 2019b in addition good agreements between cldas and gldas were achieved in different areas of china huan huan et al 2018 qin et al 2017 ullah et al 2017 due to the availability of longer time series of sm comparing to cldas daily averaged gldas surface sm 0 10 cm from 2015 to 2018 was used for cdf cumulative distribution function rescaling of the remote sensing data 2 2 3 in situ soil moisture there is a network of 56 sm monitoring stations distributed across the ncp region fig 1 the in situ sm is measured by the gravimetric method at four depths 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm sampling at the 1st 11th and 21st days every month in this study the ground based observation of sm at the depth of 10 cm in 2017 was used for validating the satellite products as an important supplementary to the cldas sm 2 3 supplementary data 2 3 1 modis products the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis is an instrumental part of the nasa s terra eos am 1 and aqua eospm 1 satellites which provide images of diverse surface reflections e g land surface temperature lst normalized difference vegetation index ndvi land surface reflectance lsr at spatial resolutions of 250 m 500 m or 1 km ndvi has been proved to be effective for monitoring the crop condition and thus suitable for detecting agricultural drought since it well represents the near infrared radiation reflected by the internal mesophyll structure of healthy green leaves dutta et al 2015 in addition the terra modis ndvi are suitable for drought monitoring for being less prone to noise brown et al 2015 in this study the 16 day ndvi dataset provided by mod13a2 at the spatial scale of 1 km were used to compute vci lst is important for land cover mapping and crop management jaber 2021 and it was recognized to be sensitive to evaporation regarded as an indicator of moisture condition mandianpari et al 2017 nguyen thanh et al 2018 here lst from mod 11a2 8 day composites at a spatial scale of 1 km was used to calculate vdi in addition the band 2 near infrared range and band 6 shortwave infrared reflectance of modis lsr are needed for calculating the normalized different water index ndwi gao 1996 an intermediate variable for vdi the mod09a1 products 8 day composites at a spatial scale of 500 m were used in this study the modis products used in this study at corresponding spatial scales from 2015 to 2018 were downloaded from the land processes distributed active center lpdaac http lpdaac usgs gov 2 3 2 soil properties isric soilgrids database https www soilgrids org babaeian et al 2018 provides global gridded soil information with a spatial resolution of 0 25 km or 1 km for a variety of soil depths 0 cm 5 cm 15 cm 30 cm 60 cm 100 cm and 200 cm soil properties 1 km including soil bulk density organic carbon content sand content and clay content were used for soil moisture derivation and drought index calculation which will be further described in detail in section 3 to be consistent with the satellite sm data which only detect for the soil surface soil properties at 5 cm depth were used 3 methodology 3 1 transformation of in situ sm data while the satellite sm products provide volumetric sm the ground based observations measure gravimetric sm it is thus necessary to transform the gravimetric sm from in situ stations into volumetric sm using eq 1 1 θ ω ρ b where θ is the volumetric soil water content cm3 cm3 ω represents the gravimetric soil water content g g and ρ b denotes soil bulk density g cm3 each ground sm station was interpolated using nearest neighbor resampling into the grid of soilgrids to obtain the corresponding soil bulk density 3 2 cdf matching method cdf matching method is a non linear bias correction approach that was initially introduced to remove bias among different sources of sm estimates such as ground measurement model data and satellite retrievals with the objective to obtain consistent average values or dynamic ranges reichle and koster 2004 this approach has been adopted in correction of various types of satellite data especially on the improvement of satellite sm products and its effectiveness has been shown in published studies anagnostou and negri 2010 liao et al 2017 mishra et al 2017 in addition the superiority of cdf approach in bias correction compared to other methods has also been demonstrated han et al 2012 jana et al 2008 vinodkumar and dharssi 2019 therefore this approach was applied in the study by taking the following procedures 1 construct the cumulative distribution functions for gldas and satellite based sm data separately in each grid 2 calculate percentiles through satellite based cumulative distribution curve for each satellite data 3 compute the scaled satellite data by matching the percentiles calculated from the previous step to the cumulative distribution functions of gldas a piece wise linear cdf matching method liu et al 2011 was adopted this approach reduces the complexity of calculation and improves the efficiency of correction compared with the traditional cdf matching method by substituting the cdf curve with a finite number of piece wise lines liao et al 2017 liu et al 2011 wang et al 2018 3 3 drought monitoring indices 3 3 1 soil water deficit index swdi the soil water deficit index swdi martinez fernandez et al 2015 is an agricultural index based on sm and basic soil water parameters with a specific agricultural meaning this index has been considered effective and timely when characterizing a drought event martinez fernandez et al 2016 swdi is calculated using eq 2 2 s w d i θ θ f c θ a w d 10 where θ is the soil water content m3 m3 θ f c represents field capacity m3 m3 and θ a w d denotes available water content m3 m3 which is calculated by subtracting the water content at wilting point θ w p from θ f c positive swdi indicates there is adequate soil water for crops with no possibility for drought negative values represent the occurrence of an agricultural drought with the drought severity classified according to table 1 there are usually three approaches to determine the soil water constants θ f c and θ w p 1 calculate percentiles using long term sm time series taking the 5th and 95th percentiles as estimators of θ w p and θ f c hunt et al 2009 2 estimate from laboratory analysis on the water retention curve sridhar et al 2008 3 derive the parameters based on pedo transfer function ptf regression between soil parameters and soil properties e g soil texture organic matter since the first method requires a long time series of sm and the second technique is quite time consuming ptfs have been commonly used to provide the moisture constants for swdi batjes 1996 rawls et al 1982 saxton and rawls 2006 the ptf from saxton and rawls 2006 which performed well in a number of studies bai et al 2018 mishra et al 2017 nachtergaele et al 2010 was applied in this study based on the soil information from soilgrids the calculation is given by 3 θ 1500 θ 1500 0 14 θ 1500 0 02 θ 1500 0 024 p s a n d 0 487 p c l a y 0 006

matter separately the percentage of organic matter is converted from the organic carbon content by a factor of 0 58 pribyl 2010 θ 1500 and θ 330 represent sm at the potential of 1500 kpa and 33kpa which are recognized as wilting point and field capacity respectively derived soil water constants and daily satellite based sm was used to calculate daily swdi which was further averaged over a 16 day period for the comparison with vci and vdi 3 3 2 soil moisture condition index smci the soil moisture condition index smci is a normalized indicator of sm which relies on the maximum and minimum value of long time sm data hence the drought condition monitored by smci is related to the length of data to some extent in this study smci was calculated on a daily scale in every pixel of smos and smap products separately according to eq 5 5 s m c i θ θ min θ max θ min 100 where θ max and θ min represent the maximum and minimum soil water content v v respectively in the study period in each grid similar with swdi the 16 day average values of daily smci were calculated to match the time scale of vci and vdi 3 3 3 vegetation condition index vci vegetation condition index vci is also a normalized drought index which has been widely used in the existing studies demonstrating good applicability in agricultural drought analysis across different regions baniya et al 2019 bhuyan erhardt et al 2019 bircher et al 2013 jiao et al 2016 therefore vci was adopted as a reference index in this study for validating purpose for the sm based indices vci is calculated based on processed 16 day ndvi as follows 6 v c i n d v i n d v i min n d v i max n d v i min 100 where n d v i min n d v i max are the minimum and maximum ndvi respectively for the whole time series at each pixel nearest neighbor resampling was performed to match the spatial scale between sm based indices and vci the drought classification criteria for smci and vci based on zhang et al 2017 and figueira branco et al 2019 is shown in table 2 3 3 4 vegetation drought index vdi vegetation drought index vdi was developed from the widely used agricultural drought index vhi vegetation health index by replacing ndvi and lst with ndwi and day night lst difference δ l s t respectively sun et al 2013 vhi has widespread application in agricultural drought monitoring whereas a number of studies proclaimed that vhi should be used with prudence due to the unexpectedly positive correlation between ndvi and lst in some regions bento et al 2018 karnieli et al 2006 kogan et al 2017 vdi could overcome this drawback according to sun et al 2013 and this index was chosen as another reference index in this study to access the capacity of sm based indices on drought monitoring vdi is calculated using the following equations 7 n d w i ρ 2 ρ 6 ρ 2 ρ 6 8 w c i n w d i n w d i min n w d i max n w d i min 100 9 δ t c i δ l s t max δ l s t δ l s t max δ l s t min 100 10 v d i α w c i 1 α δ t c i where ρ 2 and ρ 6 denote the band 2 and band 6 of modis lsr the subscript min and max represent the minimum and maximum of each index respectively wci is the water condition index that separates short term ndwi fluctuations from long term ecosystem changes and δ t c i is the day night temperature difference condition index derived from δ l s t difference between daytime and night time lst α is the weighing factor that reflects the contribution of w c i and δ t c i to determine the severity of drought it is set as 0 5 due to assumed identical contribution of both the drought classification based on vdi can be referred to sun et al 2013 as is shown in table 3 3 4 goodness of fit 3 4 1 validation of satellite soil moisture satellite sm products for the growing season from april 1 to november 31 in 2017 were validated mainly against grid scale cldas data supplemented by site measurements of sm nearest neighbor resampling of cldas grid data was conducted before the validation due to a mismatch between cldas grids and satellite pixels for ground sm station the satellite pixel whose centroid is the nearest to the in situ location was identified to get the corresponding satellite sm to evaluate the accuracy of smos and smap sm products three statistical scores were computed pearson correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and bias 3 4 2 evaluation of sm based drought indices to verify the reliability of the sm based drought indices comparisons were made between the two sm based indices swdi and smci and the reference vegetation indices vci and vdi firstly maps of drought indices were generated and compared to assess the spatial behavior of drought events reflected by the indices r was calculated between the time series of sm based drought indices and vegetation indices for each grid over the study area secondly in order to explore the capability of moisture indices for drought detection and assessment drought frequency refers to the percentage of the time that drought occurs during a specific period was calculated for different drought categories and compared with that derived by the reference indices in addition we assigned integers 0 4 to represent the five categories i e no drought mild drought moderate drought severe drought and extreme drought respectively and we used probability of detection pod paredes trejo et al 2016 with a modified interpretation to access the performance of sm based indices on capturing drought events of certain severity pod is calculated according to eq 11 11 p o d a a c where a and c represent the number of hits and number of misses for pairs of sm based indices and vegetation indices for all drought categories respectively pod ranges from 0 to 1 with a higher pod representing a better role the index plays in detecting droughts moreover mean absolute error mae was adopted to further analyze the degree of deviation of sm based indices in detected drought categories which is given as 12 m a e i 1 n l s m i i l v i i n where l s m i and l v i are the assigned integer of drought category identified by sm based indices and vegetation indices respectively n is the length of time series of drought indices a smaller value of mae indicates a higher degree of similarity between the indices in characterizing drought severity 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation and correction of smos and smap soil moisture products smos l3 and smap l3 sm products during the growing season from april 1 to november 30 in 2017 were evaluated against daily cldas data and the site measurements frequency distributions of the three statistical coefficients for the validation based on grid scale cldas are shown in fig 3 smos and smap both showed satisfactory performances in the ncp region smap appeared to outperform smos in capturing sm dynamics with the correlation concentrated to a much higher value around 0 7 for smap against 0 4 for smos fig 3a and rmse centralized to a lower value around 0 1 for smap against 0 2 for smos fig 3c outperformance of smap over smos was also detected when validating against the site data fig 4 r for the validation against the in situ sm observations mainly ranged between 0 1 and 0 4 for smap and from 0 to 0 3 for smos which were not as good as cldas validation results possibly due to point scale limitation of the site data our results are consistent with previous studies blyverket et al 2019 chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 where the superiority of smap over smos was also observed even so the validation results of smos in ncp was reasonably good since the statistics fell within the range identified by existing studies in other regions of china cui et al 2017 sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 despite that a better performance was revealed in west africa louvet et al 2015 the united states leroux et al 2014 and australia lievens et al 2015 our results also concurred with the conclusion from a global evaluation al bitar et al 2017 where relatively poorer performance of smos in china was demonstrated smap sm was well validated worldwide al yaari et al 2019 chen et al 2017 stillman and zeng 2018 in this study the correlation coefficient between smap and cldas was in line with the validation results from montzka et al 2017 who evaluated smap on a global scale surprisingly the capability of smap in mapping sm in ncp seemed to be far better than the results suggested by other studies in china specifically an average r of 0 44 and rmse of 0 108 across china was found by sun et al 2017 and validation of smap in northwest china by zhang et al 2019 showed r values ranging from 0 44 to 0 55 this might be due to topographic factors e g altitude and slope of the land surface which impacted the reliability of smap data there is no great change in terrain over the region of ncp leading to more desirable validation results although the r values between the two satellites and in situ sm were fairly satisfactory the rmse values did not achieve the satellite target accuracy which was also the case for nearly all published studies al yaari et al 2019 blyverket et al 2019 chen et al 2017 it can be clearly observed that the correlations between the two satellite based sm and cldas sm decreased from north to south in the ncp fig 5 and the spatial pattern seemed to be consistent with that of land cover types fig 2c smap was especially well validated with cldas in the north and central of ncp where is mainly dry land on the contrary smap failed to show a good accuracy in areas covered by paddy field and woodland previous studies found out that the accuracy of satellite data was associated with the type of land cover cui et al 2017 stillman and zeng 2018 sun et al 2017 the less satisfactory performance of smap was found to be related to the rfi radio frequency interference whose impact on the performance of satellite data was strikingly stronger in the more developed areas bai et al 2018 the negative values of r appearing in beijing and tianjin supported this point smos also witnessed the possible land cover effect but not as significant as smap it is worth noting that for either smos l3 or smap l3 product the bias was concentrated to negative values indicating a distinct dry bias fig 3c fig 4c this was in line with reported research which discovered almost an overall underestimation of the two satellite sm over china chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 for global scale validations though overestimation was found in some areas such as africa louvet et al 2015 and italy lievens et al 2015 dry biases have been more commonly detected across different regions worldwide al yaari et al 2014 al bitar et al 2017 carsten et al 2017 dry biases of the two satellite based sm would prevent exploiting the useful information in satellite data mishra et al 2017 thus they should not be overlooked especially for smos l3 according to the global evaluation map of smos from al yaari et al 2014 the bias varied from 0 4 0 2 worldwide and ranged between 0 1 to 0 2 in the ncp region which coincided with our findings fig 3c fig 4c in this study we applied the widely used cdf matching approach to remove the bias gldas sm which is in a very good agreement with cldas data was used for the cdf correction due to its relative long time series of sm distributions of the three statistical scores for post correction validations of smos and smap against cldas sm are shown in fig 3b d and f for the two satellite products the correlations did not change much compared to the raw data whereas both of rmses and biases have been improved fig 3a specifically the abnormal rmse values 0 2 of smos almost disappeared after correction and most of the biases were reduced to around 0 for both smos and smap post correction validations against the in situ sm exhibited similar results although the improvement on the statistics was not as significant as that based on cldas fig 4 fig 6 presents the temporal dynamics of sm from the two satellites at a typical grid of which there was at least one station located in the pixel and the three statistical scores all fell into the highest frequency category of the distributions fig 3 overall cldas sm followed similar dynamics of ground based observations suggesting its suitability and capability for validating the satellite sm time series there was a better agreement between the satellite products and cldas than the site data this might be due to point scale feature of in situ measurements in comparison to the grid pixel averaging of both cldas and satellite sm products smos sm was significantly more dispersed than smap both before and after the cdf correction it is clearly seen that the original satellite based sm was almost consistently lower than both the cldas sm and in situ data while the cdf correction significantly reduced the bias and rmse for both satellite products making them well capture the sm dynamics especially for smap achieving an rmse close to or even less than the satellite target accuracy of 0 04 effectiveness of the cdf matching technique has also been identified in previous studies mishra et al 2017 carried out the cdf correction on smap and reduced the rmse from 0 15 to 0 06 m3 m3 in the united states smos l2 was validated in the northwest spain and post correction rmse was significantly decreased without a clear improvement on r gumuzzio et al 2016 which was identical to our results generally our validation results showed more satisfactory performance of smap sm in ncp the cdf matching approach was capable of correcting the dry bias which existed in both satellite products bias removal for the satellite sm data would be expected to be helpful for their application in drought monitoring which is further discussed in this study 4 2 evaluation of performance of satellite based soil moisture on drought monitoring 4 2 1 comparison between sm based drought indices and vegetation indices fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of correlation between sm based indices and the two reference vegetation related agricultural indices vci and vdi since smci and swdi are both linearly related to sm see eq 2 eq 5 the two indices would have the same correlation coefficient with vegetation indices and share the same distribution the spatial pattern of r based on the two satellites was similar with higher correlations in the northern part of the ncp and lower correlations in the south regardless of comparing to vci or vdi it is evident that smap derived indices outperformed those from smos over whole study region with higher r values and particularly high rs over 0 8 with both vegetation indices were observed in some areas of hebei and shandong provinces it is worth noting that the spatial pattern of r between sm based indices and vegetation indices followed the spatial distribution of r between satellite based sm and cldas fig 5 to a large extent smap sm better validated against cldas presented a more satisfactory spatial consistency with both vci and vdi this suggested the accuracy of satellite data would impact the performance of satellite sm based agricultural drought indices besides it is interesting to note that soil type seemed to be a factor driving the performance of sm based drought indices fig 2b especially when compared with vci results from both satellites showed clear outperformance in regions characterized by loam over the area with silt loam which seemed to be inconsistent with the findings from paredes trejo and barbosa 2017 who pointed out the irrelevance of the comparison results between swdi and awd to soil texture this was likely due to our using vegetation based drought indices as the reference indices in the ncp the main crop cultivated in dry land is wheat whose growth is closely related to soil type as loam provides plants with more organic matter and better retains soil water and fertilizer preventing loss of nutrients agha et al 2020 thus the growth of wheat here which was reflected by vci and vdi showed a reasonably better correlation with sm given that the cdf matching method did not improve the correlation coefficient for satellite sm data in its validation the post correction behavior of r between sm based indices and vegetation indices also remained the same for instance the 16 day evolution of smap smci and the vegetation indices at a typical grid from 2015 to 2018 is presented in fig 8 smap smci and the reference indices displayed similar seasonal cycles regardless of the bias correction but there was a clear discrepancy in the absolute values especially between smci and vci nonetheless smci deviated less from vci after dry bias correction on satellite based sm which would possibly make an improvement on drought characterization according to the drought classification criteria table 2 smci showed more dynamics than vci in its temporal evolution which was likely due to the fast response of soil wetness condition to precipitation it could also be the reason for the higher rs between vci and sm based indices in the north part of ncp as precipitation decreased from south to north wu et al 2020 moreover it is interesting to note that vdi had more frequent fluctuations than vci which was more consistent with the smci dynamics ndwi was found to be more sensitive to agricultural drought than ndvi which could result in the frequent fluctuations gu et al 2007 4 2 2 behaviors of satellite sm based indices on detecting a drought event to evaluate the potential of satellite based sm observations in drought monitoring the capability of satellite sm derived swdi and smci on detecting a drought event was firstly investigated a widespread drought in north china from august to mid october 2015 was analyzed according to the records moderate or more severe meteorological droughts occurred in henan and shandong provinces due to the lack of rainfall as the reference index both vci and vdi could well reflect the location and situation of the actual drought event to a large extent wang et al 2016 ymdc 2016 specifically both the indices revealed the severe or extreme drought in the central area of ncp indicating decent capacity of the two indices in agricultural drought monitoring nonetheless only vci captured the drought occurred in the west of shandong while vdi managed to detect the drought circumstances in the southeast of henan where vci underestimated the drought severity fig 9 presents drought detection results by sm based indices in comparison to vci and vdi in general indices based on the raw sm data from the two satellites were able to identify the severe drought occurred in a large area of shandong and henan province but overestimated the severity of drought for the rest part of the ncp region especially the drought maps based on swdi it is apparent that smap outperformed smos with relatively more consistent drought characteristics from sm based indices with that from vegetation indices except that the higher data acquisition rate of smap zhang et al 2019 might also contribute to its superiority in detecting drought as smos was more likely to fail to retrieve sm condition in drought stricken regions with bias correction of the satellite sm data all drought detection results have been improved in terms of more confined impact area in the middle of the ncp region only except for post correction smos smci which depicted an almost drought free condition over the whole area fig 9 on the contrary smap smci based on corrected data exhibited the best performance demonstrating distinctly confined drought stricken area which is also most accordant to the spatial pattern indicated by the reference indices and presenting least overestimation of the degree of drought severity of the study region specifically cdf corrected smap smci represented the severe drought conditions in the central ncp it appeared to perform slightly better when compared with vdi in reproducing the drought in the southeast of henan which was also more consistent with the reality wang et al 2016 for swdi however either corrected smap or smos did not provide satisfactory results of detecting the drought event still with a clear overestimation of drought severity and impact area which might suggest the inadequacy of swdi in our study region in terms of the significance of bias correction of satellite sm data mishra et al 2017 also discovered the efficiency of cdf matching in lessening the overestimation of smap derived swdi on identifying the category of drought in the united states although bai et al 2018 indicated a slight impact of the dry bias of smap l3 sm on drought assessment in the north of china they speculated that smap swdi could be less efficient when rainfall was rare in summary the potential advantages of smap over smos and smci over swdi were revealed when detecting the ncp drought event in october 2015 it would be necessary to analyze the capability of satellite sm based indices on characterizing droughts at the whole spatial temporal scale 4 2 3 potential skills of satellite sm based indices on drought monitoring the statistical evaluation of the sm based indices over the whole study period is shown in fig 10 we witnessed higher pod and smaller mae after dry bias correction regardless of which satellite data sm based drought index or reference index was used which highlighted the need for bias removal before applying satellite sm in monitoring drought for smos smci based on original sm data performed not as well as swdi particularly in terms of the pod whereas contrast behavior was observed after bias correction with smci gaining a higher pod and a smaller mae the improvement brought by the bias correction was more obvious to smos smci than that to smos swdi however it is interesting to note that smap swdi appeared to be more clearly improved by the correction comparing to smap smci but it did not affect the noticeable outperformance of smci over swdi in general smap tended to be better than smos in detecting drought and bias correction for the satellite sm made smci a consistently more appropriate drought index drought frequency analysis was further performed for the sm based indices based on corrected smap sm fig 11 for the two reference indices the overall higher drought frequency of vdi compared to vci might due to the higher sensitivity of nwdi to drought than ndvi however the severe and extreme drought frequencies detected by vdi were much lower which was likely due to the homogenization of δ t c i tci was found to underestimate the severity of drought to some extent especially for severe and extreme droughts wei et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 which could possibly result in the underestimaion from vdi in some cases vci might be the more preferable index for detecting crop affected drought usually severe and extreme drought du et al 2013 comparing to the reference indices both smci and swdi overestimated the severity of drought to some extent coinciding with the results on characterizing the 2015 drought event fig 9 the spatial distribution of drought frequency in different category identified by smci was in general more accordant with the vegetation based drought indices particularly vci compared to that of swdi specifically the overestimation of swdi was much more dramatic than smci especially in the north and central region of ncp the frequency of severe drought and moderate drought detected by swdi was significantly higher than that from smci and the reference indices compared with vegetation condition soil wetness condition is more sensitive to the meteorological factors e g precipitation and evaporation especially the surface soil moisture 5 cm depth that are only measured by remote sensing techniques this contributed to more dynamics of sm based indices fig 8 likely predicting higher frequencies of drought since vegetation accesses sm not just at the top layer agricultural drought is more closely related to sm in the root zone despite a strong correlation between the surface and root zone sm hirschi et al 2014 the use of remote sensing sm data might still limit the capability of sm based drought indices higher sensitivity of surface sm to the climate condition might lead to the false alarm although a 16 day averaging was likely to reduce the impact despite the overestimation a clear superiority of smci over swdi on characterizing agricultural droughts was observed in our study region interestingly swdi has been more commonly used for its simplicity of calculation and satisfactory performances on detecting drought have been found across different regions over the world martinez fernandez et al 2016 mishra et al 2017 pablos et al 2017 but it did not show similarly good results in this work as we expected in previous studies swdi has been more commonly evaluated by comparing with awd a meteorologically based index for drought avoidance on the weekly scale the threshold value of drought occurrence for awd was determined based on agricultural practice in the us which related to the rooting depth and available water content from an extensive survey of soils purcell et al 2003 consistent results on drought probability assessments were found when awd was initially compared with soil water deficit approach using long term soil moisture measurements torres et al 2013 it was thus not surprising to see a good agreement between awd and swdi however good consistency between awd and swdi might be not enough to support swdi to be a qualified index for drought monitoring as otkin et al 2016 noted it was advantageous to apply indices that are sensitive to vegetation when detecting agricultural drought vegetation health data rather than meteorological information was more reliable in providing maps of local drought conditions given the crop losses due to droughts garcia leon et al 2019 either vci or vdi serves as an appropriate reference agricultural drought index vci reflects vegetation stress and has a high correlation with crop yields kogan 1995a vdi is based on nwdi which is sensitive to the changes in water content and spongy mesophyll of vegetation canopies and often used as a drought index with a focus on vegetation water content fensholt and sandholt 2003 gao 1996 patel et al 2012 these two indices were able to identify the severity of drought over different regions and time periods rembold et al 2013 singh et al 2003 additionally we proposed that the verification of a drought index could be conducted from different perspectives to set up a solid foundation for its applications for the better performance of smci one possible reason might be that the smci vci and vdi are all based on long term data series and confined to a certain range of values due to normalization compared with smci swdi would be more sensitive to extreme conditions e g very dry soil can result in a very low swdi value which could be reason for more obvious overestimation of swdi on identifying drought severity from this perspective normalization could be an effective way to lessen the influence brought by erratic fluctuation of surface sm zhang et al 2017 also observed an outperformance of condition index based indices over other categories of drought indices which related to the use of time series analysis like other normalized indices smci is only related to the variable itself here soil moisture it requires a relative long time series and data update if necessary to guarantee the accuracy of maximum and minimum values of sm which is of vital importance when smci is adopted for drought monitoring with increasing availability of satellite sm with decent spatial temporal resolution and data quality it would be helpful to evaluate the applicability of this simply sm based index across wide range of regions in this study smci overestimated the drought severity in some areas in ncp when compared with vci and vdi we used the same drought classification criteria for smci and vci and whether it is appropriate requires further evidence in addition the overestimation might be associated with regional climate such as local precipitation and climate related land cover types specifically the higher frequency of moderate drought and above concentrated in areas under cold semi arid and humid subtropical climate fig 2a the climate dependency of drought detecting capability of smci was also observed by zhang and jia 2013 who found that smci presented highest correlation with spi in a dry area with least annual precipitation shen et al 2019 found that smci exhibited different behaviors across inner mongolia covered by different crops in previous studies smci was more commonly used via a combination with other indices to form a new drought index which was assumed to overcome the limitation of each single index zhang and jia 2013 however zhang et al 2017 discovered that the integrated indices did not show significant advantages over single indices when compared with in situ indices pdsi z indices and spi our results suggested a good potential of smci when being singly used in monitoring agricultural drought moreover since the meteorological indices e g spi kalisa et al 2020 and vegetation related indices e g vci have been applied to explore the relationship between drought and crop losses smci as the representative of satellite sm based indices could also be considered for crop yield analysis and prediction 5 conclusion in this study we investigated the potential application of satellite soil moisture sm in agricultural drought monitoring using simply sm based drought indices both the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos and soil moisture active passive smap were validated and corrected before their use in drought assessment temporal dynamics and performance on drought characterization from soli water deficit index swdi and soil moisture condition index smci were evaluated against those from the reference drought indices i e vegetation condition index vci and vegetation drought index vdi the following conclusions are drawn 1 both smos l3 and smap l3 products were able to capture soil moisture dynamics but smap markedly outperformed smos their performance especially smap varied with respect to land cover types with dry land obtaining a higher data accuracy both satellite data showed a clear dry bias which could be effectively removed by the simple cdf matching method 2 the superiority of smap over smos was observed in their comparison with vci and vdi either in capturing the temporal dynamics of these two vegetation based drought indices or in detecting and characterizing drought as the reference indices presented both satellites tended to have a better performance in regions characterized by loam while higher accuracy of smap sm data was contributed to the outperformance of smap bias correction of the satellite data was able to improve their performance on drought monitoring by lessening the overestimation of drought severity inferred by the original satellite sm data 3 applying cdf corrected satellite soil moisture data no matter smap or smos smci consistently showed a better performance in drought assessment with higher pod and smaller mae compared with vci and vdi drought frequency analysis based on corrected smap further supported the better capability of smci still both sm based indices overestimated drought severity but the overestimation of swdi was much more serious in ncp it seems choosing a sm based normalized index was able to reduce the influence brought by erratic fluctuation of surface sm instead of being incorporated to form a new multiple index as its common application smci presented a good potential in monitoring agricultural drought when used alone in general the results of this study suggested an effective application of satellite sm data in agricultural drought monitoring and a simply sm based drought index was likely to be adequate with increasing availability of satellite sm data with decent resolution and data quality it could be necessary to consider longer term satellite data for the more efficient normalized drought index i e smci declaration of competing interest the authors

9649,satellite soil moisture sm has been increasingly available and the use of sm based indices has a great potential for agricultural drought monitoring this study evaluates the performance of two satellite sm products the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos and soil moisture active passive smap on drought detection and assessment in the north china plain ncp over the period of 2015 2018 with a comparison between two sm based drought indices soil water deficit index swdi and soil moisture condition index smci vegetation condition index vci and vegetation drought index vdi were adopted as the reference indices overall smap outperformed smos in sm data validation as well as drought detection in the ncp region a simple bias correction of the satellite sm data was able to improve their performance in characterizing agricultural drought via sm based indices compared with swdi smci appeared to be the more appropriate index for drought monitoring by showing a better agreement with both vci and vdi in terms of drought characteristics i e spatial distribution drought category and frequency though both sm based indices overestimated drought severity to some extent a simply sm based drought indicator could be effective when satellite sm was applied for capturing agricultural drought and a full consideration of longer term satellite data might be necessary keywords agricultural drought soil moisture smos smap swdi smci 1 introduction drought can be classified into four types meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic drought among which agricultural drought is considered to be the more complex and poorly understood natural hazard shen et al 2019 agricultural drought normally occurs when soil moisture sm reaches such a low level that poses a negative effect on crop yield agricultural drought could impact agricultural production and threat food security boyer 1982 tian et al 2018 and it is associated with environmental and socio economic issues due to its high frequency and long lasting impacts piao et al 2010 the frequency of agricultural drought disasters may increase with increasing extreme weather under climate change boyer 1982 therefore monitoring agricultural drought and establishing effective early warning systems are necessary in risk management research on drought monitoring has been of increasing interest to the scientific community and a variety of indices based on different indicators have been proposed to detect drought most of the indices are based on the meteorological data e g the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and the precipitation condition index pci zhang and jia 2013 based on precipitation the atmosphere water deficit awd purcell et al 2003 and the evaporative stress index esi otkin et al 2013 calculated by evapotranspiration and the temperature condition index tci kogan 1995b related to temperature agricultural drought was initially investigated more from a climatological perspective most typically the crop moisture index cmi palmer 1968 a traditional agricultural drought index was developed on the basis of the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 which is a commonly used meteorological drought index vegetation condition was then taken into account to form indices such as the vegetation condition index vci schell 1973 the vegetation health index vhi kogan 1995a and the vegetation drought index vdi sun et al 2013 in fact sm is a storage component for antecedent precipitation and meteorological conditions that responds to rainfall anomalies in prior to plants making it a more critical factor for crop growth sm is considered to be the governing variable for agricultural drought and it has been incorporated into agricultural drought studies initially it was calculated or estimated through water balance or hydrological modeling using meteorological data for instance sheffield et al 2004 constructed the vic variable infiltration capacity drought index using sm obtained from the vic model narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 developed the soil moisture deficit index smdi and the evapotranspiration deficit index etdi to analyze agricultural drought based on sm derived from the swat soil and water assessment tool model later on due to increasing availability of sm data they have been directly used to form indices for detecting and assessing agricultural drought sridhar et al 2008 introduced soil moisture index smi derived by sm from the automated weather data network awdn and identified a satisfactory role of sm played in drought monitoring more recently martinez fernandez et al 2015 proposed the soil water deficit index swdi based on sm data from the soil moisture measurements stations network of the university of salamanca remedhus and demonstrated its reliability by achieving high correlations with awd and cmi respectively despite the use of in situ sm data being identified effective to assess agricultural drought the great progress in remote sensing during recent decade provides a good alternative for drought monitoring using sm based indices due to its continuous spatial coverage there are two satellites dedicated to map global sm which have received increasing attention one is the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2010 from the europe space agency esa and the other is soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2008 from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa sm retrieved from the two satellites have been validated both on a global scale al yaari et al 2019 al bitar et al 2017 entekhabi et al 2008 and regional scale al yaari et al 2019 al bitar et al 2017 albergel et al 2012 dente et al 2012 entekhabi et al 2008 louvet et al 2015 rahmoune et al 2014 and desirable agreements were demonstrated between satellite based sm and in situ data application of the sm products for agricultural drought monitoring has been particularly investigated the application of smos sm was initially assimilated into crop models to assess agricultural drought chakrabarti et al 2014 upon the introduction of swdi martinez fernandez et al 2015 quite a few attempts have been made to apply smos data in detecting agricultural drought martinez fernandez et al 2016 paredes trejo and barbosa 2017 souza et al 2018 meanwhile a new soil moisture agricultural drought index smadi based on the integration of smos and modis observations was also developed sanchez et al 2016 which showed diverse applications of satellite data in agricultural drought monitoring with the launch of smap in 2015 similar efforts have been made in a number of studies either by a direct application of satellite based sm in monitoring drought or by use of agricultural drought indices derived from smap retrievals velpuri et al 2016 compared smap sm with the weekly drought severity images provided by the us drought monitor usdm and found that smap could well benefit drought assessment moreover the sm anomalies reflected by smap was compared with usdm and spi over the contiguous united states conus in the study of eswar et al 2018 who suggested that sm could be set as a parameter to drought monitoring system similar to smos fair to satisfactory performances of swdi derived by smap sm data have been found in the united states mishra et al 2017 china bai et al 2018 and a particular watershed e g the xiang river basin zhu et al 2019 so far there have been a variety of sm based agricultural drought indices that satellite observations tend to be utilized such as smci soil moisture condition index zhang and jia 2013 smdi soil moisture deficit index narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 swdi soil water deficit index martinez fernandez et al 2015 pablos et al 2017 initiatively compared four sm related agricultural drought indices over northwest spain and identified the best performance from swdi followed by smadi this might suggest that a sm based index which only relies on satellite sm data could be adequate for agricultural drought monitoring however very few works have been published investigating the impact of the choice of a sm based index on the effectiveness of agricultural drought characterization in this study we focused on two potentially applicable sm based indices swdi and smci of which satisfactory performances have been observed respectively swdi derived by sm from various satellites e g smos martinez fernandez et al 2016 smap bai et al 2018 amsr2 ascat and era interim baik et al 2019 were proved to have reliable drought detection capability due to the good consistency of results with those from awd smci also showed its potential to be integrated into a drought monitoring system since it was found to have good correlations with spi at various time scales especially at short or moderate time scales zhang and jia 2013 zhang et al 2017 smci more commonly acted as a sm representative index to be incorporated with other indices characterizing vegetation land surface temperature etc to form a new drought index sanchez et al 2016 while separate use of smci was relatively rare the objective of this study is to achieve an advanced understanding of the capability and applicability of simply sm based agricultural drought indices via an inter comparison between different indices as well as different satellite data the north china plain ncp one of the main grain production areas and also one of the most drought prone regions in china is chosen as the study area spatiotemporal drought behavior is assessed in this region using two satellite products i e smos l3 and smap l3 for their appropriate data length temporal and spatial resolution swdi and smci two drought indices based on sm are analyzed and compared with the widely accepted agricultural drought index vci and the more recently used vdi this study could provide insights into incorporating remote sensing sm into an agricultural drought monitoring system 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the north china plain ncp is the second largest plain in china ranging between 32 n and 43 n and 113 e and 123 e the ncp region involves five provinces hebei shandong henan anhui and jiangsu and two municipalities beijing tianjin fig 1 with an area of approximately 400 000 km2 the ncp region investigated in this study follows the administrative boundaries for simplicity according to köppen climate classification the ncp area is subject to different climate from north to south with hot summer continental climate for beijing and tianjin hot semi arid climate for hebei dry winter subtropical climate for henan and shandong and humid subtropical climate for anhui and jiangsu fig 2a ncp has distinct seasonal variation in precipitation and temperature with mean annual temperature of 8 15 c and annual precipitation of 500 900 mm soil is characterized by loam and silt loam fig 2b which is fertile since the ncp region is formed by the sedimentation of yellow haihe and luanhe rivers the ncp is one of the main agricultural production areas and an important production base for grain cotton and oil in china with a cultivated land area mainly dry land and paddy field fig 2c accounting for 27 9 of the whole national arable land however due to a strong temporal variability of precipitation the ncp has been suffering frequent droughts especially in spring early summer and autumn as recorded the area of drought in this region normally accounts for the highest proportion of drought stricken area of china 2 2 soil moisture data 2 2 1 smos and smap products the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos launched by european space agency in november 2009 is the first satellite that takes mapping global sm at the top 5 cm as one of its main missions kerr et al 2010 smos is equipped with an aperture synthesis l band radiometer 1 41 ghz for a target accuracy of 0 04 m3 m 3 datum from different levels and versions of smos are provided in https www catds fr sipad compared to previous versions of smos smos l3 products provide enhanced global sm maps at different time scales easing the processing processes for the scientific community al yaari et al 2019 the data quality of smos l3 was guaranteed though smos l2 outperformed l3 products in some regions due to the time lag issues it had little impact for studies on drought monitoring al bitar et al 2017 daily and monthly sm data from smos l3 products 25 km 25 km has been available since june 2011 with a 7 day latency one cycle of the satellite provides the data of ascending 6 00 am and descending 6 00 pm orbits respectively since the ascending smos data were widely shown to better match ground based sm than the descending data al bitar et al 2017 carsten et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 the ascending data of smos l3 at a daily time scale from 2015 to 2018 was used in this study launched by nasa in january 2015 the soil moisture active passive smap is the most recent satellite to observe surface sm and also provide root zone sm products carrying sensors of an active l band radar 3 km 1 26 ghz and a passive l band radiometer 36 km 1 41 ghz on a single platform the combined active passive satellite is able to provide 3 km 9 km and 36 km sm estimates on a global scale with an accuracy target of unrmse unbiased root mean square errors less than 0 04 m3 m 3 the radiometer of smap continuously provided high quality data as planned whereas its radar unfortunately failed on 7 july 2015 smap l3 providing a composite of smap l2 is retrieved from the smap radiometer tavakol et al 2019 therefore its continuity was not influenced by the failure of radar and was chosen in this study smap science data processing system sds processed and released smap science data which are available freely from https nsidc org data smap smap data html similar to smos the smap was placed to monitor the earth s surface twice a day descending sun synchronous 6 00 am and ascending 6 00 pm orbit separately smap l3 enhanced sm products with a spatial resolution of 9 km 9 km descending from 2015 to 2018 were used in this study 2 2 2 cldas and gldas cldas china meteorological administration land data assimilation system v2 0 is developed by data fusion and assimilation techniques using ground satellite and other observation data from various sources shi et al 2011 launched by china meteorological data service centre in january 2017 cldas v2 0 provides hourly gridded sm data covering the east asian region 70 150 e 0 60 n at a spatial resolution of 0 0625 at six different layers 0 5 cm 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 10 40 cm 40 80 cm and 80 200 cm eskinder et al 2018 liu et al 2019a according to product manual china meteorological administration 2017 the sm product of cldas v2 0 in china has been evaluated by the quality controlled observation data and the results were satisfactory on average the pearson correlation coefficient is 0 89 and root mean square error is 0 02 the cldas sm products were also validated in a number of studies eskinder et al 2018 leng et al 2019 yu et al 2018 which confirmed the reliability and stability of the dataset in this study daily averaged cldas sm 0 5 cm in 2017 was used to validate the satellite based products gldas global land data assimilation system rodell et al 2004 v2 1 2000 present is also a combination of model and observation based datasets which provides global sm data at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 every 3 h at four different depths 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm validation and the application of gldas have been conducted all over the world showing good performances of the sm datasets cammalleri et al 2017 liu et al 2019b in addition good agreements between cldas and gldas were achieved in different areas of china huan huan et al 2018 qin et al 2017 ullah et al 2017 due to the availability of longer time series of sm comparing to cldas daily averaged gldas surface sm 0 10 cm from 2015 to 2018 was used for cdf cumulative distribution function rescaling of the remote sensing data 2 2 3 in situ soil moisture there is a network of 56 sm monitoring stations distributed across the ncp region fig 1 the in situ sm is measured by the gravimetric method at four depths 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm sampling at the 1st 11th and 21st days every month in this study the ground based observation of sm at the depth of 10 cm in 2017 was used for validating the satellite products as an important supplementary to the cldas sm 2 3 supplementary data 2 3 1 modis products the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis is an instrumental part of the nasa s terra eos am 1 and aqua eospm 1 satellites which provide images of diverse surface reflections e g land surface temperature lst normalized difference vegetation index ndvi land surface reflectance lsr at spatial resolutions of 250 m 500 m or 1 km ndvi has been proved to be effective for monitoring the crop condition and thus suitable for detecting agricultural drought since it well represents the near infrared radiation reflected by the internal mesophyll structure of healthy green leaves dutta et al 2015 in addition the terra modis ndvi are suitable for drought monitoring for being less prone to noise brown et al 2015 in this study the 16 day ndvi dataset provided by mod13a2 at the spatial scale of 1 km were used to compute vci lst is important for land cover mapping and crop management jaber 2021 and it was recognized to be sensitive to evaporation regarded as an indicator of moisture condition mandianpari et al 2017 nguyen thanh et al 2018 here lst from mod 11a2 8 day composites at a spatial scale of 1 km was used to calculate vdi in addition the band 2 near infrared range and band 6 shortwave infrared reflectance of modis lsr are needed for calculating the normalized different water index ndwi gao 1996 an intermediate variable for vdi the mod09a1 products 8 day composites at a spatial scale of 500 m were used in this study the modis products used in this study at corresponding spatial scales from 2015 to 2018 were downloaded from the land processes distributed active center lpdaac http lpdaac usgs gov 2 3 2 soil properties isric soilgrids database https www soilgrids org babaeian et al 2018 provides global gridded soil information with a spatial resolution of 0 25 km or 1 km for a variety of soil depths 0 cm 5 cm 15 cm 30 cm 60 cm 100 cm and 200 cm soil properties 1 km including soil bulk density organic carbon content sand content and clay content were used for soil moisture derivation and drought index calculation which will be further described in detail in section 3 to be consistent with the satellite sm data which only detect for the soil surface soil properties at 5 cm depth were used 3 methodology 3 1 transformation of in situ sm data while the satellite sm products provide volumetric sm the ground based observations measure gravimetric sm it is thus necessary to transform the gravimetric sm from in situ stations into volumetric sm using eq 1 1 θ ω ρ b where θ is the volumetric soil water content cm3 cm3 ω represents the gravimetric soil water content g g and ρ b denotes soil bulk density g cm3 each ground sm station was interpolated using nearest neighbor resampling into the grid of soilgrids to obtain the corresponding soil bulk density 3 2 cdf matching method cdf matching method is a non linear bias correction approach that was initially introduced to remove bias among different sources of sm estimates such as ground measurement model data and satellite retrievals with the objective to obtain consistent average values or dynamic ranges reichle and koster 2004 this approach has been adopted in correction of various types of satellite data especially on the improvement of satellite sm products and its effectiveness has been shown in published studies anagnostou and negri 2010 liao et al 2017 mishra et al 2017 in addition the superiority of cdf approach in bias correction compared to other methods has also been demonstrated han et al 2012 jana et al 2008 vinodkumar and dharssi 2019 therefore this approach was applied in the study by taking the following procedures 1 construct the cumulative distribution functions for gldas and satellite based sm data separately in each grid 2 calculate percentiles through satellite based cumulative distribution curve for each satellite data 3 compute the scaled satellite data by matching the percentiles calculated from the previous step to the cumulative distribution functions of gldas a piece wise linear cdf matching method liu et al 2011 was adopted this approach reduces the complexity of calculation and improves the efficiency of correction compared with the traditional cdf matching method by substituting the cdf curve with a finite number of piece wise lines liao et al 2017 liu et al 2011 wang et al 2018 3 3 drought monitoring indices 3 3 1 soil water deficit index swdi the soil water deficit index swdi martinez fernandez et al 2015 is an agricultural index based on sm and basic soil water parameters with a specific agricultural meaning this index has been considered effective and timely when characterizing a drought event martinez fernandez et al 2016 swdi is calculated using eq 2 2 s w d i θ θ f c θ a w d 10 where θ is the soil water content m3 m3 θ f c represents field capacity m3 m3 and θ a w d denotes available water content m3 m3 which is calculated by subtracting the water content at wilting point θ w p from θ f c positive swdi indicates there is adequate soil water for crops with no possibility for drought negative values represent the occurrence of an agricultural drought with the drought severity classified according to table 1 there are usually three approaches to determine the soil water constants θ f c and θ w p 1 calculate percentiles using long term sm time series taking the 5th and 95th percentiles as estimators of θ w p and θ f c hunt et al 2009 2 estimate from laboratory analysis on the water retention curve sridhar et al 2008 3 derive the parameters based on pedo transfer function ptf regression between soil parameters and soil properties e g soil texture organic matter since the first method requires a long time series of sm and the second technique is quite time consuming ptfs have been commonly used to provide the moisture constants for swdi batjes 1996 rawls et al 1982 saxton and rawls 2006 the ptf from saxton and rawls 2006 which performed well in a number of studies bai et al 2018 mishra et al 2017

which are recognized as wilting point and field capacity respectively derived soil water constants and daily satellite based sm was used to calculate daily swdi which was further averaged over a 16 day period for the comparison with vci and vdi 3 3 2 soil moisture condition index smci the soil moisture condition index smci is a normalized indicator of sm which relies on the maximum and minimum value of long time sm data hence the drought condition monitored by smci is related to the length of data to some extent in this study smci was calculated on a daily scale in every pixel of smos and smap products separately according to eq 5 5 s m c i θ θ min θ max θ min 100 where θ max and θ min represent the maximum and minimum soil water content v v respectively in the study period in each grid similar with swdi the 16 day average values of daily smci were calculated to match the time scale of vci and vdi 3 3 3 vegetation condition index vci vegetation condition index vci is also a normalized drought index which has been widely used in the existing studies demonstrating good applicability in agricultural drought analysis across different regions baniya et al 2019 bhuyan erhardt et al 2019 bircher et al 2013 jiao et al 2016 therefore vci was adopted as a reference index in this study for validating purpose for the sm based indices vci is calculated based on processed 16 day ndvi as follows 6 v c i n d v i n d v i min n d v i max n d v i min 100 where n d v i min n d v i max are the minimum and maximum ndvi respectively for the whole time series at each pixel nearest neighbor resampling was performed to match the spatial scale between sm based indices and vci the drought classification criteria for smci and vci based on zhang et al 2017 and figueira branco et al 2019 is shown in table 2 3 3 4 vegetation drought index vdi vegetation drought index vdi was developed from the widely used agricultural drought index vhi vegetation health index by replacing ndvi and lst with ndwi and day night lst difference δ l s t respectively sun et al 2013 vhi has widespread application in agricultural drought monitoring whereas a number of studies proclaimed that vhi should be used with prudence due to the unexpectedly positive correlation between ndvi and lst in some regions bento et al 2018 karnieli et al 2006 kogan et al 2017 vdi could overcome this drawback according to sun et al 2013 and this index was chosen as another reference index in this study to access the capacity of sm based indices on drought monitoring vdi is calculated using the following equations 7 n d w i ρ 2 ρ 6 ρ 2 ρ 6 8 w c i n w d i n w d i min n w d i max n w d i min 100 9 δ t c i δ l s t max δ l s t δ l s t max δ l s t min 100 10 v d i α w c i 1 α δ t c i where ρ 2 and ρ 6 denote the band 2 and band 6 of modis lsr the subscript min and max represent the minimum and maximum of each index respectively wci is the water condition index that separates short term ndwi fluctuations from long term ecosystem changes and δ t c i is the day night temperature difference condition index derived from δ l s t difference between daytime and night time lst α is the weighing factor that reflects the contribution of w c i and δ t c i to determine the severity of drought it is set as 0 5 due to assumed identical contribution of both the drought classification based on vdi can be referred to sun et al 2013 as is shown in table 3 3 4 goodness of fit 3 4 1 validation of satellite soil moisture satellite sm products for the growing season from april 1 to november 31 in 2017 were validated mainly against grid scale cldas data supplemented by site measurements of sm nearest neighbor resampling of cldas grid data was conducted before the validation due to a mismatch between cldas grids and satellite pixels for ground sm station the satellite pixel whose centroid is the nearest to the in situ location was identified to get the corresponding satellite sm to evaluate the accuracy of smos and smap sm products three statistical scores were computed pearson correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and bias 3 4 2 evaluation of sm based drought indices to verify the reliability of the sm based drought indices comparisons were made between the two sm based indices swdi and smci and the reference vegetation indices vci and vdi firstly maps of drought indices were generated and compared to assess the spatial behavior of drought events reflected by the indices r was calculated between the time series of sm based drought indices and vegetation indices for each grid over the study area secondly in order to explore the capability of moisture indices for drought detection and assessment drought frequency refers to the percentage of the time that drought occurs during a specific period was calculated for different drought categories and compared with that derived by the reference indices in addition we assigned integers 0 4 to represent the five categories i e no drought mild drought moderate drought severe drought and extreme drought respectively and we used probability of detection pod paredes trejo et al 2016 with a modified interpretation to access the performance of sm based indices on capturing drought events of certain severity pod is calculated according to eq 11 11 p o d a a c where a and c represent the number of hits and number of misses for pairs of sm based indices and vegetation indices for all drought categories respectively pod ranges from 0 to 1 with a higher pod representing a better role the index plays in detecting droughts moreover mean absolute error mae was adopted to further analyze the degree of deviation of sm based indices in detected drought categories which is given as 12 m a e i 1 n l s m i i l v i i n where l s m i and l v i are the assigned integer of drought category identified by sm based indices and vegetation indices respectively n is the length of time series of drought indices a smaller value of mae indicates a higher degree of similarity between the indices in characterizing drought severity 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation and correction of smos and smap soil moisture products smos l3 and smap l3 sm products during the growing season from april 1 to november 30 in 2017 were evaluated against daily cldas data and the site measurements frequency distributions of the three statistical coefficients for the validation based on grid scale cldas are shown in fig 3 smos and smap both showed satisfactory performances in the ncp region smap appeared to outperform smos in capturing sm dynamics with the correlation concentrated to a much higher value around 0 7 for smap against 0 4 for smos fig 3a and rmse centralized to a lower value around 0 1 for smap against 0 2 for smos fig 3c outperformance of smap over smos was also detected when validating against the site data fig 4 r for the validation against the in situ sm observations mainly ranged between 0 1 and 0 4 for smap and from 0 to 0 3 for smos which were not as good as cldas validation results possibly due to point scale limitation of the site data our results are consistent with previous studies blyverket et al 2019 chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 where the superiority of smap over smos was also observed even so the validation results of smos in ncp was reasonably good since the statistics fell within the range identified by existing studies in other regions of china cui et al 2017 sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 despite that a better performance was revealed in west africa louvet et al 2015 the united states leroux et al 2014 and australia lievens et al 2015 our results also concurred with the conclusion from a global evaluation al bitar et al 2017 where relatively poorer performance of smos in china was demonstrated smap sm was well validated worldwide al yaari et al 2019 chen et al 2017 stillman and zeng 2018 in this study the correlation coefficient between smap and cldas was in line with the validation results from montzka et al 2017 who evaluated smap on a global scale surprisingly the capability of smap in mapping sm in ncp seemed to be far better than the results suggested by other studies in china specifically an average r of 0 44 and rmse of 0 108 across china was found by sun et al 2017 and validation of smap in northwest china by zhang et al 2019 showed r values ranging from 0 44 to 0 55 this might be due to topographic factors e g altitude and slope of the land surface which impacted the reliability of smap data there is no great change in terrain over the region of ncp leading to more desirable validation results although the r values between the two satellites and in situ sm were fairly satisfactory the rmse values did not achieve the satellite target accuracy which was also the case for nearly all published studies al yaari et al 2019 blyverket et al 2019 chen et al 2017 it can be clearly observed that the correlations between the two satellite based sm and cldas sm decreased from north to south in the ncp fig 5 and the spatial pattern seemed to be consistent with that of land cover types fig 2c smap was especially well validated with cldas in the north and central of ncp where is mainly dry land on the contrary smap failed to show a good accuracy in areas covered by paddy field and woodland previous studies found out that the accuracy of satellite data was associated with the type of land cover cui et al 2017 stillman and zeng 2018 sun et al 2017 the less satisfactory performance of smap was found to be related to the rfi radio frequency interference whose impact on the performance of satellite data was strikingly stronger in the more developed areas bai et al 2018 the negative values of r appearing in beijing and tianjin supported this point smos also witnessed the possible land cover effect but not as significant as smap it is worth noting that for either smos l3 or smap l3 product the bias was concentrated to negative values indicating a distinct dry bias fig 3c fig 4c this was in line with reported research which discovered almost an overall underestimation of the two satellite sm over china chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 for global scale validations though overestimation was found in some areas such as africa louvet et al 2015 and italy lievens et al 2015 dry biases have been more commonly detected across different regions worldwide al yaari et al 2014 al bitar et al 2017 carsten et al 2017 dry biases of the two satellite based sm would prevent exploiting the useful information in satellite data mishra et al 2017 thus they should not be overlooked especially for smos l3 according to the global evaluation map of smos from al yaari et al 2014 the bias varied from 0 4 0 2 worldwide and ranged between 0 1 to 0 2 in the ncp region which coincided with our findings fig 3c fig 4c in this study we applied the widely used cdf matching approach to remove the bias gldas sm which is in a very good agreement with cldas data was used for the cdf correction due to its relative long time series of sm distributions of the three statistical scores for post correction validations of smos and smap against cldas sm are shown in fig 3b d and f for the two satellite products the correlations did not change much compared to the raw data whereas both of rmses and biases have been improved fig 3a specifically the abnormal rmse values 0 2 of smos almost disappeared after correction and most of the biases were reduced to around 0 for both smos and smap post correction validations against the in situ sm exhibited similar results although the improvement on the statistics was not as significant as that based on cldas fig 4 fig 6 presents the temporal dynamics of sm from the two satellites at a typical grid of which there was at least one station located in the pixel and the three statistical scores all fell into the highest frequency category of the distributions fig 3 overall cldas sm followed similar dynamics of ground based observations suggesting its suitability and capability for validating the satellite sm time series there was a better agreement between the satellite products and cldas than the site data this might be due to point scale feature of in situ measurements in comparison to the grid pixel averaging of both cldas and satellite sm products smos sm was significantly more dispersed than smap both before and after the cdf correction it is clearly seen that the original satellite based sm was almost consistently lower than both the cldas sm and in situ data while the cdf correction significantly reduced the bias and rmse for both satellite products making them well capture the sm dynamics especially for smap achieving an rmse close to or even less than the satellite target accuracy of 0 04 effectiveness of the cdf matching technique has also been identified in previous studies mishra et al 2017 carried out the cdf correction on smap and reduced the rmse from 0 15 to 0 06 m3 m3 in the united states smos l2 was validated in the northwest spain and post correction rmse was significantly decreased without a clear improvement on r gumuzzio et al 2016 which was identical to our results generally our validation results showed more satisfactory performance of smap sm in ncp the cdf matching approach was capable of correcting the dry bias which existed in both satellite products bias removal for the satellite sm data would be expected to be helpful for their application in drought monitoring which is further discussed in this study 4 2 evaluation of performance of satellite based soil moisture on drought monitoring 4 2 1 comparison between sm based drought indices and vegetation indices fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of correlation between sm based indices and the two reference vegetation related agricultural indices vci and vdi since smci and swdi are both linearly related to sm see eq 2 eq 5 the two indices would have the same correlation coefficient with vegetation indices and share the same distribution the spatial pattern of r based on the two satellites was similar with higher correlations in the northern part of the ncp and lower correlations in the south regardless of comparing to vci or vdi it is evident that smap derived indices outperformed those from smos over whole study region with higher r values and particularly high rs over 0 8 with both vegetation indices were observed in some areas of hebei and shandong provinces it is worth noting that the spatial pattern of r between sm based indices and vegetation indices followed the spatial distribution of r between satellite based sm and cldas fig 5 to a large extent smap sm better validated against cldas presented a more satisfactory spatial consistency with both vci and vdi this suggested the accuracy of satellite data would impact the performance of satellite sm based agricultural drought indices besides it is interesting to note that soil type seemed to be a factor driving the performance of sm based drought indices fig 2b especially when compared with vci results from both satellites showed clear outperformance in regions characterized by loam over the area with silt loam which seemed to be inconsistent with the findings from paredes trejo and barbosa 2017 who pointed out the irrelevance of the comparison results between swdi and awd to soil texture this was likely due to our using vegetation based drought indices as the reference indices in the ncp the main crop cultivated in dry land is wheat whose growth is closely related to soil type as loam provides plants with more organic matter and better retains soil water and fertilizer preventing loss of nutrients agha et al 2020 thus the growth of wheat here which was reflected by vci and vdi showed a reasonably better correlation with sm given that the cdf matching method did not improve the correlation coefficient for satellite sm data in its validation the post correction behavior of r between sm based indices and vegetation indices also remained the same for instance the 16 day evolution of smap smci and the vegetation indices at a typical grid from 2015 to 2018 is presented in fig 8 smap smci and the reference indices displayed similar seasonal cycles regardless of the bias correction but there was a clear discrepancy in the absolute values especially between smci and vci nonetheless smci deviated less from vci after dry bias correction on satellite based sm which would possibly make an improvement on drought characterization according to the drought classification criteria table 2 smci showed more dynamics than vci in its temporal evolution which was likely due to the fast response of soil wetness condition to precipitation it could also be the reason for the higher rs between vci and sm based indices in the north part of ncp as precipitation decreased from south to north wu et al 2020 moreover it is interesting to note that vdi had more frequent fluctuations than vci which was more consistent with the smci dynamics ndwi was found to be more sensitive to agricultural drought than ndvi which could result in the frequent fluctuations gu et al 2007 4 2 2 behaviors of satellite sm based indices on detecting a drought event to evaluate the potential of satellite based sm observations in drought monitoring the capability of satellite sm derived swdi and smci on detecting a drought event was firstly investigated a widespread drought in north china from august to mid october 2015 was analyzed according to the records moderate or more severe meteorological droughts occurred in henan and shandong provinces due to the lack of rainfall as the reference index both vci and vdi could well reflect the location and situation of the actual drought event to a large extent wang et al 2016 ymdc 2016 specifically both the indices revealed the severe or extreme drought in the central area of ncp indicating decent capacity of the two indices in agricultural drought monitoring nonetheless only vci captured the drought occurred in the west of shandong while vdi managed to detect the drought circumstances in the southeast of henan where vci underestimated the drought severity fig 9 presents drought detection results by sm based indices in comparison to vci and vdi in general indices based on the raw sm data from the two satellites were able to identify the severe drought occurred in a large area of shandong and henan province but overestimated the severity of drought for the rest part of the ncp region especially the drought maps based on swdi it is apparent that smap outperformed smos with relatively more consistent drought characteristics from sm based indices with that from vegetation indices except that the higher data acquisition rate of smap zhang et al 2019 might also contribute to its superiority in detecting drought as smos was more likely to fail to retrieve sm condition in drought stricken regions with bias correction of the satellite sm data all drought detection results have been improved in terms of more confined impact area in the middle of the ncp region only except for post correction smos smci which depicted an almost drought free condition over the whole area fig 9 on the contrary smap smci based on corrected data exhibited the best performance demonstrating distinctly confined drought stricken area which is also most accordant to the spatial pattern indicated by the reference indices and presenting least overestimation of the degree of drought severity of the study region specifically cdf corrected smap smci represented the severe drought conditions in the central ncp it appeared to perform slightly better when compared with vdi in reproducing the drought in the southeast of henan which was also more consistent with the reality wang et al 2016 for swdi however either corrected smap or smos did not provide satisfactory results of detecting the drought event still with a clear overestimation of drought severity and impact area which might suggest the inadequacy of swdi in our study region in terms of the significance of bias correction of satellite sm data mishra et al 2017 also discovered the efficiency of cdf matching in lessening the overestimation of smap derived swdi on identifying the category of drought in the united states although bai et al 2018 indicated a slight impact of the dry bias of smap l3 sm on drought assessment in the north of china they speculated that smap swdi could be less efficient when rainfall was rare in summary the potential advantages of smap over smos and smci over swdi were revealed when detecting the ncp drought event in october 2015 it would be necessary to analyze the capability of satellite sm based indices on characterizing droughts at the whole spatial temporal scale 4 2 3 potential skills of satellite sm based indices on drought monitoring the statistical evaluation of the sm based indices over the whole study period is shown in fig 10 we witnessed higher pod and smaller mae after dry bias correction regardless of which satellite data sm based drought index or reference index was used which highlighted the need for bias removal before applying satellite sm in monitoring drought for smos smci based on original sm data performed not as well as swdi particularly in terms of the pod whereas contrast behavior was observed after bias correction with smci gaining a higher pod and a smaller mae the improvement brought by the bias correction was more obvious to smos smci than that to smos swdi however it is interesting to note that smap swdi appeared to be more clearly improved by the correction comparing to smap smci but it did not affect the noticeable outperformance of smci over swdi in general smap tended to be better than smos in detecting drought and bias correction for the satellite sm made smci a consistently more appropriate drought index drought frequency analysis was further performed for the sm based indices based on corrected smap sm fig 11 for the two reference indices the overall higher drought frequency of vdi compared to vci might due to the higher sensitivity of nwdi to drought than ndvi however the severe and extreme drought frequencies detected by vdi were much lower which was likely due to the homogenization of δ t c i tci was found to underestimate the severity of drought to some extent especially for severe and extreme droughts wei et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 which could possibly result in the underestimaion from vdi in some cases vci might be the more preferable index for detecting crop affected drought usually severe and extreme drought du et al 2013 comparing to the reference indices both smci and swdi overestimated the severity of drought to some extent coinciding with the results on characterizing the 2015 drought event fig 9 the spatial distribution of drought frequency in different category identified by smci was in general more accordant with the vegetation based drought indices particularly vci compared to that of swdi specifically the overestimation of swdi was much more dramatic than smci especially in the north and central region of ncp the frequency of severe drought and moderate drought detected by swdi was significantly higher than that from smci and the reference indices compared with vegetation condition soil wetness condition is more sensitive to the meteorological factors e g precipitation and evaporation especially the surface soil moisture 5 cm depth that are only measured by remote sensing techniques this contributed to more dynamics of sm based indices fig 8 likely predicting higher frequencies of drought since vegetation accesses sm not just at the top layer agricultural drought is more closely related to sm in the root zone despite a strong correlation between the surface and root zone sm hirschi et al 2014 the use of remote sensing sm data might still limit the capability of sm based drought indices higher sensitivity of surface sm to the climate condition might lead to the false alarm although a 16 day averaging was likely to reduce the impact despite the overestimation a clear superiority of smci over swdi on characterizing agricultural droughts was observed in our study region interestingly swdi has been more commonly used for its simplicity of calculation and satisfactory performances on detecting drought have been found across different regions over the world martinez fernandez et al 2016 mishra et al 2017 pablos et al 2017 but it did not show similarly good results in this work as we expected in previous studies swdi has been more commonly evaluated by comparing with awd a meteorologically based index for drought avoidance on the weekly scale the threshold value of drought occurrence for awd was determined based on agricultural practice in the us which related to the rooting depth and available water content from an extensive survey of soils purcell et al 2003 consistent results on drought probability assessments were found when awd was initially compared with soil water deficit approach using long term soil moisture measurements torres et al 2013 it was thus not surprising to see a good agreement between awd and swdi however good consistency between awd and swdi might be not enough to support swdi to be a qualified index for drought monitoring as otkin et al 2016 noted it was advantageous to apply indices that are sensitive to vegetation when detecting agricultural drought vegetation health data rather than meteorological information was more reliable in providing maps of local drought conditions given the crop losses due to droughts garcia leon et al 2019 either vci or vdi serves as an appropriate reference agricultural drought index vci reflects vegetation stress and has a high correlation with crop yields kogan 1995a vdi is based on nwdi which is sensitive to the changes in water content and spongy mesophyll of vegetation canopies and often used as a drought index with a focus on vegetation water content fensholt and sandholt 2003 gao 1996 patel et al 2012 these two indices were able to identify the severity of drought over different regions and time periods rembold et al 2013 singh et al 2003 additionally we proposed that the verification of a drought index could be conducted from different perspectives to set up a solid foundation for its applications for the better performance of smci one possible reason might be that the smci vci and vdi are all based on long term data series and confined to a certain range of values due to normalization compared with smci swdi would be more sensitive to extreme conditions e g very dry soil can result in a very low swdi value which could be reason for more obvious overestimation of swdi on identifying drought severity from this perspective normalization could be an effective way to lessen the influence brought by erratic fluctuation of surface sm zhang et al 2017 also observed an outperformance of condition index based indices over other categories of drought indices which related to the use of time series analysis like other normalized indices smci is only related to the variable itself here soil moisture it requires a relative long time series and data update if necessary to guarantee the accuracy of maximum and minimum values of sm which is of vital importance when smci is adopted for drought monitoring with increasing availability of satellite sm with decent spatial temporal resolution and data quality it would be helpful to evaluate the applicability of this simply sm based index across wide range of regions in this study smci overestimated the drought severity in some areas in ncp when compared with vci and vdi we used the same drought classification criteria for smci and vci and whether it is appropriate requires further evidence in addition the overestimation might be associated with regional climate such as local precipitation and climate related land cover types specifically the higher frequency of moderate drought and above concentrated in areas under cold semi arid and humid subtropical climate fig 2a the climate dependency of drought detecting capability of smci was also observed by zhang and jia 2013 who found that smci presented highest correlation with spi in a dry area with least annual precipitation shen et al 2019 found that smci exhibited different behaviors across inner mongolia covered by different crops in previous studies smci was more commonly used via a combination with other indices to form a new drought index which was assumed to overcome the limitation of each single index zhang and jia 2013 however zhang et al 2017 discovered that the integrated indices did not show significant advantages over single indices when compared with in situ indices pdsi z indices and spi our results suggested a good potential of smci when being singly used in monitoring agricultural drought moreover since the meteorological indices e g spi kalisa et al 2020 and vegetation related indices e g vci have been applied to explore the relationship between drought and crop losses smci as the representative of satellite sm based indices could also be considered for crop yield analysis and prediction 5 conclusion in this study we investigated the potential application of satellite soil moisture sm in agricultural drought monitoring using simply sm based drought indices both the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos and soil moisture active passive smap were validated and corrected before their use in drought assessment temporal dynamics and performance on drought characterization from soli water deficit index swdi and soil moisture condition index smci were evaluated against those from the reference drought indices i e vegetation condition index vci and vegetation drought index vdi the following conclusions are drawn 1 both smos l3 and smap l3 products were able to capture soil moisture dynamics but smap markedly outperformed smos their performance especially smap varied with respect to land cover types with dry land obtaining a higher data accuracy both satellite data showed a clear dry bias which could be effectively removed by the simple cdf matching method 2 the superiority of smap over smos was observed in their comparison with vci and vdi either in capturing the temporal dynamics of these two vegetation based drought indices or in detecting and characterizing drought as the reference indices presented both satellites tended to have a better performance in regions characterized by loam while higher accuracy of smap sm data was contributed to the outperformance of smap bias correction of the satellite data was able to improve their performance on drought monitoring by lessening the overestimation of drought severity inferred by the original satellite sm data 3 applying cdf corrected satellite soil moisture data no matter smap or smos smci consistently showed a better performance in drought assessment with higher pod and smaller mae compared with vci and vdi drought frequency analysis based on corrected smap further supported the better capability of smci still both sm based indices overestimated drought severity but the overestimation of swdi was much more serious in ncp it seems choosing a sm based normalized index was able to reduce the influence brought by erratic fluctuation of surface sm instead of being incorporated to form a new multiple index as its common application smci presented a good potential in monitoring agricultural drought when used alone in general the results of this study suggested an effective application of satellite sm data in agricultural drought monitoring and a simply sm based drought index was likely to be adequate with increasing availability of satellite sm data with decent resolution and data quality it could be necessary to consider longer term satellite data for the more efficient normalized drought index i e smci declaration of competing interest the authors
