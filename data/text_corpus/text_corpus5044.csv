highly relevant this study proposes an approach to integrate groundwater recharge into a fmm the approach is based on knowledge transfer between two different forest growth models for site specific simulations on the landscape level observation based models require functions that describe groundwater recharge in a non mechanistic way however groundwater recharge is difficult to measure and strongly depends on environmental conditions thus we calibrated the observation based fmm site specific for two different case study areas using a process based forest growth model and substitute empiricism relations between forest structure and groundwater recharge were derived with multiple linear regressions and included in a fmm the groundwater recharge was remarkably influenced by tree

development must be aligned to meet a broader range of tasks as in the past accordingly modern forest management must consider a wide spectrum of ecosystem services the helsinki criteria mcpfe 1993 implicates changes in forests that are managed with a focus on wood production and the maximization of financial gain toward more multifunctional forest ecosystems because of the strong paradigm shift within the past decades it has become increasingly important to have an understanding of the manner in which sensitive ecosystem service provisions react to forest management and the possible conflicts and compatibility of various services biber et al 2015 practicing sustainable development remains a challenge today pandeya et al 2016 in germany for example there are efforts by several political parties to pay forest owners for the provisioning of modern ecosystem services and supportive forest management practices dfwr 2017 water is an increasingly critical economic factor in decision making in industries such as mining power and tourism wwap 2012 today s global water withdrawal consists of one third of groundwater kundzewicz and döll 2009 by 2025 half of the world s population will be living in water stressed areas who 2017 when considering the total water requirements of society and ecosystems even more humid areas such as substantial parts of europe north america south west australia and south america are prone to water scarcity rijsberman 2006 water scarcity on the one hand is a result of increasing consumption and decreasing availability of water the human population and consumption of water per person are increasing fao 2011 industries agriculture and municipalities are the biggest consumers of water agriculture is the biggest consumer worldwide within europe industries have the largest demand for water fao 2011 according to the food and agriculture organization fao freshwater is not being used efficiently in addition to increasing water withdrawal the second reason for water scarcity is decreasing water availability according to natkhin et al 2012 a decline in groundwater levels is recognizable across several regions in northeast germany turral et al 2011 stressed on the ways in which climate change influences water availability they underpin that climate change will significantly reduce the recharge of groundwater in dry regions like south america and africa in europe climate change brings higher probability of droughts groundwater serves as the primary buffer for decreasing water supply therefore it is highly important to be aware of the ways in which land use and landscape structures govern the availability of water forests normally consume more water than cropland müller 2011 during droughts however forests become more efficient and consume much less water zimmermann et al 2008 intensive agricultural land use is challenged with groundwater pollution therefore about half of the water protection area in germany is within forests lfu 2015 an upcoming issue that is often discussed is the development of a water cycle that is dependent on climate change and land cover peel 2009 oudin et al 2008 however only few investigations consider forest stand structure natkhin et al 2012 beside soil and climate conditions the composition of tree species and stand structure influence groundwater recharge müller 2013 typical variables for describing the forest stand characteristics are tree species stand density tree height and vertical heterogeneity findings in the literature concerning the magnitude of groundwater recharge differ strongly from each other this is because of the differences between precipitation quantity and other site and stand conditions as a benchmark a range between 20 50 of the precipitation is a plausible quantity of groundwater recharge anders et al 2004 rust 2009 müller 2011 sutmöller and meesenburg 2012 müller 2013 groundwater recharge has been proved to depend on tree species douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii mirb franco recharges less groundwater than norway spruce picea abies l h karst and scots pine pinus sylvestris l and these two tree species recharge less groundwater than european beech fagus sylvatica l prietzel and bachmann 2011 sutmöller and meesenburg 2012 reported a significant difference between norway spruce and european beech in their groundwater recharge norway spruce stands form less groundwater than european beech stands groundwater recharge primarily occurs outside the vegetation period during winter deciduous species almost consume no water whereas conifers transpire and consume water hölting and coldewey 2013 rötzer et al 2017 this is the main reason for which conifers form less groundwater than deciduous trees previous work have also reported that species with low growth provide higher groundwater recharge pöhler et al 2013 ilstedt et al 2016 and sutmöller and meesenburg 2012 show that groundwater recharge was maximized at intermediate tree densities müller 2011 demonstrated that stands with small trees form more groundwater than stands with big trees but the influence of the tree species is higher than the influence of the tree height delzon and loustau 2005 show an age related decline in stand water use therefore previous work connote contrary findings about the impact of stand height on groundwater recharge although the process of creating concepts for ecosystem services in science and politics has an obvious advantage the quantitative assessment of ecosystem services is still a challenge this is particularly true when local decision makers require local information for that purpose simulation techniques play an increasingly important role nelson et al 2009 projects that investigate the long term effect of forest management on the provision of ecosystem services like alterfor alternative models for future forest management alterfor 2017 are fully based on landscape scale simulation scenarios therefore management models must now provide a broad range of ecosystem service results the simulations of silvicultural treatment which are part of forest management models enable the investigation of forest management with respect to all relevant ecosystem services simulation models that intrinsically represent the interaction between various driving forces and management are an essential tool for estimating the long term management effects on ecosystem services in particular water balance and landscape development are predestined for model evaluation because they depend on the interaction of many boundary conditions and are difficult to be depicted in empirical results pandeya et al 2016 the objectives of this study which is based on two case study areas are 1 to present an algorithm that integrates quantitative groundwater recharge into forest management models 2 to analyze whether there are species specific relations between forest stand structure and groundwater recharge 3 to examine whether there is a trade off between productivity and groundwater recharge 2 material and methods 2 1 procedure our approach combines a process based forest growth model with an observation based one fig 1 therefore we derive multilinear functions that describe groundwater recharge as dependent on forest stand structure attributes to that end we use the process based eco physiological growth model balance grote and pretzsch 2002 rötzer et al 2017 we then use those functions to calculate groundwater recharge based on simulated stand structure development obtained from the practice oriented management model silva pretzsch and kahn 1998 pretzsch et al 2002 the stand structure range within the case study areas was initially analyzed virtual stands were then generated for obtaining stand structure gradients subsequently groundwater recharge was quantified for each structure type finally the productivity and groundwater recharge of one stand within the case study area was exemplarily simulated with the forest management model 2 2 software tools balance silva strugen balance is a detailed and complex process based forest growth model grote and pretzsch 2002 pretzsch et al 2015 rötzer et al 2017 growth response is simulated at the tree level by considering the influences of competition stand structure species mixture and management impacts balance simulates tree growth on the base of environmental conditions and their changes over time dendrometrical characteristics of trees change with interactions between multiple physiological processes that depend on physical and chemical site conditions the altered structure of trees such as asymmetric crown shapes generate spatially explicit patterns within the stand the processes are calculated for several crown and root layers therefore the growth within the tree can be calculated spatially explicit for each layer based on energy supply and resource availability the most fundamental processes of balance are the carbon water and nutrient flows daily inputs of temperature radiation precipitation humidity and wind velocity form the basis of calculating the micro climate and water balance of each layer the physiological processes assimilation respiration nutrient up take growth senescence and allocation affect the dimensional tree growth that is calculated once a year in this manner tree growth and the development of site conditions like water balance and percolation can be simulated but this model approach requires detailed input data concerning weather and soil conditions eq 1 describes the water balance calculation within balance rötzer et al 2017 1 δswc prec eta per swc soil water content δswc change in swc prec precipitation eta actual evapotranspiration per percolation the actual evapotranspiration eta is the sum of transpiration interception and soil evapotranspiration and is based on the approach of penman monteith e g allen et al 1998 dvwk 1996 for this study we assume that groundwater recharge gwr can be considered as the sum of percolation per from the lowest soil layer percolation is the reduction of soil water content to field capacity fc and arises if soil water content is above field capacity 2 if swc fc than per swc fc in balance all parameters of the water balance e g eqs 1 and 2 are calculated continuously in daily time steps silva pretzsch and kahn 1998 pretzsch et al 2002 2015 pretzsch et al 2017 pretzsch 2002 is an empirical forest management model based on individual tree growth the simulation results comprise estimates of growth and yield including ecological and socio economic indicators this growth model breaks stands down into a mosaic of individual trees and simulates the interactions in a space time system this approach follows a combination of process and observation based modeling and uses only a few initial stand parameters rough site variables and silvicultural prescriptions and stand dynamics are simulated in five year cycles this time interval is also the standard time interval for measuring on the trial plots that were used for model evaluation each simulation cycle consists of four steps the first step is the quantification of spatial growth conditions of a tree by calculating a competition index the second step is the identification of trees that will be removed according to the rules of a user defined thinning concept following which dimension changes are calculated for all trees inside the stand in the fourth step a mortality model uses the previously calculated competition index to determine which trees did not survive if a detailed inventory of a stand is not available the missing data for simulation can be generated with strugen pretzsch 1993 1997 pretzsch 2010 strugen is a software tool that consists of an algorithm for stand structure generation based on a tree list or stem number diameter distribution a realistic stand can be established for the position of a tree the stand area is covered with random uniformly distributed x and y coordinates to manufacture desired structures of a stand the generated dot coordinates are accepted with different levels of probability in essence the points must pass through some filters that regulate macro structures for example only those positions are accepted that have an appointed distance to neighboring trees that are generated this process is repeated until the desired diameter distribution of the tree species is achieved subsequently further processes are performed to introduce additional tree species this completion of required values and the creation of first structure states provides realistic initialization data for simulation agreement between the real and created structures does not imply that each tree in the stand must have the same position but the characteristics of the structure can correspond 2 3 stand structure within the case study areas the size of the case study area lieberose schlaubetal neuzelle lsn in north east germany brandenburg is 90 000 ha the tree species comprise about 65 scots pine and 11 sessile oak quercus petraea mattuschka liebl the size of the case study area augsburg western forests awf in south germany bavaria is 60 000 ha and the tree species comprise about 62 norway spruce and 11 european beech based on data from the third german national forest inventory nfi thünen institut 2017 we created virtual stands by using strugen pretzsch 1997 those virtual stands represent the landscape of the case study areas the virtual stands were then analyzed according to the stand structure three structure indices suitable for characterizing stand structure were selected and calculated for each stand the first index is the stand density index sdi according to reineke 1933 3 s d i n q m d 25 1 605 qmd quadratic mean diameter in cm n number of trees per hectare the second index is the arithmetic mean height mh of a stand 4 m h 1 n i 1 n h i h tree height the third indicator is the variations coefficient of the tree height and includes information concerning the vertical heterogeneity vh 5 v h 1 m h 1 n 1 i 1 n h i m h i 2 variables as in eq 3 and 4 table 1 presents the characteristics of the case study areas comparing both areas a higher range and average of all structures in awf is apparent excluding the vertical heterogeneity that has a slightly lower average than in lsn 2 4 site conditions soils and climate the prevalent soil type in lsn table 2 consists of sand dominated base poor unconsolidated rocks with reduced nutrient supply in contrast soils in awf table 2 are generally lowland soils consisting of loess clay with high nutrient supply grüneberg et al 2016 andreae et al 2016 for the case study area in bavaria awf moisture data can be summarized with plant available water content of 257 mm in a profile with a depth of 125 cm in brandenburg lsn plant available soil water content of 177 mm characterizes the 90 cm deep profile the soil characteristics are taken from level ii permanent observation plots which form an international program icp forests 2011 the level ii plots are uniformly established in europe and were selected representing the conditions of the landscapes forst brandenburg 2017 the recordings of the level ii plots were used to calculate the plant available water content with the pedotransferfunction hypres wösten et al 1999 inside the hydrologic balance model lwf brook90 hammel and kennel 2001 the climate conditions were provided from the international institute for applied systems analysis iiasa within the alterfor project and are based on the climate model hadgem2 es collins et al 2011 the used developments depict climatic conditions considering climate change over the last 50 years within the considered time range temperature increased by 1 c and the precipitation quantities remained mostly constant fig 2 given by decade table 3 presents the mean values for the whole simulation time the precipitation average in lsn is slightly less than two thirds of the one in awf the average of the annual mean temperature and the wind speed are higher in lsn whereas the average of the radiation and the relative humidity are higher in awf 2 5 generating stands for obtaining structure gradients to parameterize groundwater recharge functions we generated five representative stand structures for each species and structure index i e model predictor to that end we considered two species with the highest share per case study area bavaria norway spruce european beech brandenburg scots pine sessile oak for each species and each of the three predictors we derived a set of five monospecific stands fig 3 within each of these predictor related sets the stands varied in the value of the related predictor while the remaining predictors were held at their landscape specific average in this manner a total of 60 stands was generated i e 15 stands per tree species in fig 3 this setup is visualized for spruce the set of virtual stands for each predictor covers the predictor s entire value range within the case study area considered table 1 for example the middle row in fig 3 shows five stands that represent the landscape specific spectrum of the stand density similarly each stand represents the average of the predictors in the top and bottom row therefore in the middle of fig 3 all stands have approximately the same vh and arithmetic mh but vary in stand density to generate the desired stands corresponding data for strugen suitable for achieving the desired structure values during the generation process is required strugen requires the number of trees as well as the basal area per height class to generate stands with a desired vh one set of heights was sampled from an empirical height distribution within the case study area considered each height value from that set was associated to a corresponding tree diameter which is defined as the mean diameter of all trees in the case study area of the corresponding height and tree species to achieve the desired densities the total number of trees was determined using the quadratic mean diameter and the sdi eq 3 balance simulations require buffer trees that surround the selected stand and serve to counteract edge effects those trees are needed for creating the same conditions at the edge of a stand to obtain a stand size of 0 25 ha the side length of the generated stand with strugen was 70 m trees with a distance to the edge of smaller than 10 m count as buffer trees table 4 presents the structure values of each generated stand the values according to the stands in the middle of fig 3 are signed in the middle of table 4 with sdi1 5 sp on the right hand side 2 6 simulation of groundwater recharge per stand of structure gradient for each of the two case study areas exactly one climate development was used both developments were fifty years long each climate development was divided into five consecutive ten year periods each generated stand of the structure gradient was simulated with balance for each of the five development periods in this manner we maintained consistency in the structures used for groundwater recharge function calibration and the structures employed during dynamic simulation for each stand the results of all corresponding simulation runs were averaged therefore each stand with a known structure combination could be matched with one value of groundwater recharge the aic akaike 1974 procedure provided by venables and ripley 2002 served for species specific stepwise model selection this procedure only accepts predictors that sufficiently contribute for estimation otherwise they are not suggested for being part of the model thus four statistical linear models were created those models are species specific groundwater recharge functions that have the general form of eq 6 6 gwr y intercept a mh b vh c sdi gwr groundwater recharge mh arithmetic mean height vh vertical heterogeneity sdi stand density index in addition the beta coefficients of each statistical model were calculated to enable a comparison of the slope and the influence among the model s predictors each beta coefficient results from a regression that uses standardized predictors each with a variance of one each predictor was divided by its variance for clarity and validation the groundwater recharge average of all five climate time steps was plotted over the structure gradients wherever applicable a line of linear regression was added to the plots 2 7 exemplary test application with the forest management model silva to demonstrate the application of the results a mixed european beech and norway spruce stand was simulated by the forest management model silva two management pathways were simulated one assumed that no interventions took place the other one however applied thinning and harvest interventions to establish continuous cover forestry ccf the structure development of the initial stand from period zero up to 100 years notably depends on the treatment scenario fig 4 the ccf forest management is characterized by future crop tree thinnings combined with target diameter harvests one objective of forest management is to maintain stock at a level that provides a continuous cover the other objective is the rise of the broadleaved species proportion within each of the two management pathways the statistical groundwater model was applied to the resulting stand structure on a per time step basis to that end the model s predictors see section 2 3 table 1 were calculated for each simulation period then for each time step the species specific groundwater recharge was calculated eq 6 the unweighted species specific contribution gwrspecies was then weighted by mixing the proportion gssspecies of each tree species eq 7 7 gwrtotal gssspecies1 gwrspecies1 gssspecies2 gwrspecies2 gwrtotal groundwater recharge of mixed stand gwrspecies species specific groundwater recharge contribution gssspecies species specific growing space share the mixing proportion for each species was calculated as the species specific share of crown projection area i e growing space 3 results 3 1 structure dependent groundwater functions the relation of groundwater recharge to structure was species specific fig 5 furthermore it is discernible that there was a higher level of groundwater recharge in awf than in lsn norway spruce was sensitive to all structure variables the vh of norway spruce demonstrated less influence than its arithmetic mh within the simulated norway spruce stands density was the most important predictor whereas the lines of the linear regressions for european beech have low slopes at most vh caused a notable drift in groundwater recharge sessile oak has a horizontal regression line at the sdi but the groundwater recharge was decreasing with increasing arithmetic mh and vertical structure scots pine was only reacting on arithmetic mh obviously in lsn as well as in awf within the virtual coniferous species stands percolation was lower than in the broadleaved species stands the groundwater recharge of european beech and scots pine was only dependent on one structure variable table 5 in contrast the recharge values of sessile oak were dependent on arithmetic mh and vh moreover the groundwater recharge of the virtual norway spruce stands was clearly influenced by all structure variables mh vh and sdi it is necessary to consider that it is not possible to check all species in this study against each other only the species of one case study area are comparable among each other because they rely on the same environmental conditions each species was solely investigated within one case study area comparing norway spruce and european beech awf the broadleaved species has a higher y intercept than the coniferous the same is true for scots pine and sessile oak lsn where the same relationship is discernible the standardized beta coefficients of norway spruce in awf underpin a stronger influence of the arithmetic mh on groundwater recharge than of the vh nevertheless the arithmetic mh of a norway spruce stand in awf seems to have less influence than the sdi in such a norway spruce stand however vh had less influence than in a european beech stand within sessile oak stands the arithmetic mh had a larger effect than in a scots pine stands lsn 3 2 exemplary test simulation the exemplary simulation of over 100 years that assumed silvicultural treatment compared to the untreated one leads to higher values of the norway spruce proportion and furthermore of the stocking volume fig 6 a and b the norway spruce share in the untreated stand is approximately constant whereas the curve of the treatment scenario develops toward higher shares of european beech furthermore the untreated stock increases throughout the entire simulation time but the stock in the treatment scenario is constant between 400 and 500 m3 therefore within that scenario a ccf system has been established density in the treatment scenario first decreases and then oscillates within a sustained level in contrast the density in the simulation without treatment is higher and approximately constant initially the vertical structure slightly falls in the treated and in the untreated stand the development without treatments is then by continuous increase the treated stand s vh increases rapidly within a short initial period and then remains constant the arithmetic mh is lower in the treated stand than in the untreated stand norway spruce inside the exemplary mixed stand contributed between 300 and up to 400 mm yr 1 to groundwater recharge unweighted contribution see section 2 7 fig 7 a within that scope the treated stand had considerably higher recharge values than the untreated one the unweighted contribution of european beech fig 7b remained almost constant and was nearly independent of the treatment scenario european beech has higher unweighted contribution of groundwater recharge than spruce as a coherent outcome the mixed species stand groundwater recharge obtained as the weighted sum of the contributions of both species see section 2 7 shows an increasing influence of european beech it overrides a development that is initially governed by the norway spruce curve the stand volume growth decreases during simulation time fig 7c this trend is visible in both management pathways but is stronger in the treatment scenario there was a clear trade off between stand volume growth and groundwater recharge fig 8 the treated as well as the untreated scenario demonstrate this trend but the scenario of the treated version is steeper higher groundwater recharge thus was paid for with lower stand volume growth 4 discussion 4 1 relevance of forest management for ecosystem services provision to improve sustainability current forest management planning must consider a multitude of ecosystem services on the background of various planning alternatives lasch et al 2005 water scarcity steadily becomes more critical wwap 2012 a relevant process on that background is the effect of forest management activities on the groundwater system that interaction however has rarely been investigated smerdon et al 2009 this study shows that forest management can raise groundwater recharge reduce stand productivity change tree species composition and thus influences ecosystem services consequently it is important to be aware of the ways in which management affects ecosystem service provisioning possibly trade offs between ecosystem services are particularly related to certain management systems therefore our study presents a method for revealing possible conflicts between groundwater recharge and production on the landscape scale level to that end we developed a novel approach and applied it to test its suitability for trade off analyses within two treatment scenarios as also underpinned by previous work pöhler et al 2013 there was a clear trade off between groundwater recharge and productivity both treatment variants that we exemplified exhibit a trade off in the same direction but of different slope considering the ccf variant that result may be explained by a decrease in wood production and a concomitant increase in groundwater recharge within that variant stand productivity declined because of a decreasing stand density and a drop in the proportion of spruce groundwater recharge conversely became larger because of an increase in the proportion of beech and a concomitant decrease in stand density within the non thinned variant only a decline in productivity caused the trade off and groundwater recharge was almost constant that decline in productivity was likely because of raising mortality resulting from increased stock and tree density 4 2 validity of the results 4 2 1 implementation procedure simulation results are always as exact and valid as the modeling approach allows this approach stripped down the modeling of the most important predictors for groundwater estimation to reduce the aimed prediction to essential variables strongly correlating with forest management in particular this approach underpins the practicability of a method that integrates relations from a mechanistic approach into a model of higher abstraction level observation based models are commonly parameterized with functions resulting from field trails modeling with a detailed representation including a high resolution of the system is quite suitable for investigating ecological relations based on a causal explanation of process interactions therefore process based models are suitable for deriving functions for observation based models according to pandeya et al 2016 water balance and locally required results for landscapes are very suitable for simulation but this higher level of abstraction leads to limitations in the validity of the results this approach aims to estimate averages of magnitudes as well as strength and direction of changes with respect to forest management this means more smooth results as probably prevalent in reality the sensitivity of deflection is buffered to the average of changes in the direction 4 2 1 1 balance balance which was used for the percolation estimations is a process based growth model which simulates the three dimensional development of trees and forest stands and estimates consequences of environmental conditions the carbon water and nutrient flows of individual trees of different tree species form the fundamental processes for the growth simulations a first version of the growth model balance was published in 2002 grote and pretzsch 2002 the development of the model is still ongoing rötzer et al 2013a b rötzer et al 2017 extensive validations of the model balance were published for growth processes and stand development grote and pretzsch 2002 rötzer et al 2005 rötzer et al 2010 rötzer et al 2013a b micro climate rötzer et al 2010 phenology rötzer et al 2004 rötzer et al 2005 rötzer et al 2010 and water balance rötzer et al 2005 rötzer et al 2010 rötzer et al 2017 this way the process based growth model balance is able to realistically simulate growth and water balance including percolation for central european forests 4 2 1 2 parameter selection neither parameters for environmental conditions nor the fundamental process parameters for driving groundwater recharge were used directly in the predictive models groundwater functions however both are taken into account in the modeling approach the used process model reflects the important processes and is sensitive to the environmental conditions that were explicitly set for the two case study areas therefore we performed no sensitivity analysis in advance to find out which are the most important factors influencing groundwater recharge because rather than identifying the most important predictors for groundwater recharge the prediction should be limited to management related parameters in order to reduce the predictive model to the impact of forest management the predictive models are thus only valid in the case study areas with the set environmental conditions as a consequence of not implementing the fundamental predictors for groundwater recharge directly in the prediction model this approach has the mentioned limitations and this can be regarded as weakness but at the same time thereby some benefit arises this approach abstracts quantification of groundwater recharge to the essential variables regarding the pure influence of forest management on landscape level for rough quantitative estimation of groundwater recharge in dependence on forest management on landscape level the results show that species and structure are convenient predictors under assumed environmental conditions the overriding target of this article was to develop a procedure resp which is an algorithm to statistically simulate groundwater recharge for forest management purposes our proposed procedure its prediction models and parameters seem to be the appropriate way the process leads to recognizable differentiations and changes in the groundwater recharge simulation of the forest management model and therefore the algorithm and its parameters fulfill its purpose a further finding in this study is that only a subset of the predictors considered had a pivotal influence on groundwater recharge the consideration of structure variables as predictors makes the procedure more complicated and they had a small influence as compared to the influence of the consideration of the tree species this can be deduced from the differences between the y intercepts table 5 compared with the slopes in this study and this csas this knowledge would have been possible to be applied to simplify both model calibration and application for an even more straightforward estimation of groundwater recharge for the purposes regarded in this paper the prediction could have been stripped down to the tree species as the only parameter of the prediction model 4 2 2 relation between groundwater recharge and stand structure because climate and soil conditions were set in balance they are the basis where the derived relation between groundwater recharge and forest stand structure pertain for improved comparability the results of groundwater recharge can be considered as a share of precipitation that generalization reveals that the results have a plausible magnitude in this study the groundwater recharge values account for approximately 30 50 of the occurring precipitation in the case study areas such values are conform with those from the literature anders et al 2004 rust 2009 müller 2011 sutmöller and meesenburg 2012 müller 2013 the magnitude of the values however is at the top of the range reported our modeling approach aims to represent groundwater recharge within any mixed species stand considered therefore our approach aggregates various independent estimations each estimation is related to the whole stand s structure but is specific to a monoculture of one of the stand s tree species the estimations fundamental data were obtained through simulation of the recharge process within constructed monocultural stands each of which represented a structure type from forest landscape analysis to meet the overall structure of any mixed stand these virtual stands irrespective of their tree species had to represent the entire range of structures including mixed species stands from inventory analysis thus the virtual stands exhibited structures that were not necessarily typical of the tree species monocultures therein however as a crucial property they represent spatial relationships that may occur within mixed stands such relationships influence throughfall interception and transpiration through flux resistances and competition within the stand canopy jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 our approach neglects the possible dependence of these intrinsic variables on the direct interaction among trees of different species however the approximation presented is fast and feasible for estimating long term trends of groundwater recharge within assumed climate conditions and forest management scenarios on landscape scale level in the literature intermediate stand density is recommended for forest management aiming high groundwater recharge sutmöller and meesenburg 2012 ilstedt et al 2016 the reasons are that sparse stand density facilitates high discharge rates and ground cover vegetation high stand density causes high interception and transpiration and thus reduces groundwater recharge groundwater recharge is not very sensitive to stand density within this study except the virtual spruce stands at first intermediate density mean another sdi and number of trees for each species as already mentioned the study at hand investigated a limited range of structures that were typical for mixed species stands within the case study areas considered and thus not for each tree species separately for example same sdi value resulting from the mixed species stands in a csa could imply typically high density for beech and almost low density for spruce in monoculture environmental and site specific conditions as well as the range of simulated sdi values for each species similar could be reasons for the initially unexpected relation between stand density and groundwater recharge in this study finally it should not be assumed that the relations are necessarily typical of the tree species in general much more the results are a snapshot which results in a sensible calibration for the fmm as functional likeness of species mixtures on the entire case study area and environmental conditions 5 conclusions the modeling approach presented leads to plausible results of groundwater recharge it enables the estimation of the quantitative changes of the essential ecosystem service to contrasting options of forest management therefore it is suitable to practice forest management planning with trade off estimations among ecosystem services on the landscape level within an exemplary scenario the approach underpinned a trade off between groundwater recharge and productivity this important relation was amplified through a change in tree species composition within ccf management the influence of the model s predictors on groundwater recharge notably differs in strength the dominating tree species has a higher influence than stand structure however both stand structure and tree species have a significant effect that is case study area

development must be aligned to meet a broader range of tasks as in the past accordingly modern forest management must consider a wide spectrum of ecosystem services the helsinki criteria mcpfe 1993 implicates changes in forests that are managed with a focus on wood production and the maximization of financial gain toward more multifunctional forest ecosystems because of the strong paradigm shift within the past decades it has become increasingly important to have an understanding of the manner in which sensitive ecosystem service provisions react to forest management and the possible conflicts and compatibility of various services biber et al 2015 practicing sustainable development remains a challenge today pandeya et al 2016 in germany for example there are efforts by several political parties to pay forest owners for the provisioning of modern ecosystem services and supportive forest management practices dfwr 2017 water is an increasingly critical economic factor in decision making in industries such as mining power and tourism wwap 2012 today s global water withdrawal consists of one third of groundwater kundzewicz and döll 2009 by 2025 half of the world s population will be living in water stressed areas who 2017 when considering the total water requirements of society and ecosystems even more humid areas such as substantial parts of europe north america south west australia and south america are prone to water scarcity rijsberman 2006 water scarcity on the one hand is a result of increasing consumption and decreasing availability of water the human population and consumption of water per person are increasing fao 2011 industries agriculture and municipalities are the biggest consumers of water agriculture is the biggest consumer worldwide within europe industries have the largest demand for water fao 2011 according to the food and agriculture organization fao freshwater is not being used efficiently in addition to increasing water withdrawal the second reason for water scarcity is decreasing water availability according to natkhin et al 2012 a decline in groundwater levels is recognizable across several regions in northeast germany turral et al 2011 stressed on the ways in which climate change influences water availability they underpin that climate change will significantly reduce the recharge of groundwater in dry regions like south america and africa in europe climate change brings higher probability of droughts groundwater serves as the primary buffer for decreasing water supply therefore it is highly important to be aware of the ways in which land use and landscape structures govern the availability of water forests normally consume more water than cropland müller 2011 during droughts however forests become more efficient and consume much less water zimmermann et al 2008 intensive agricultural land use is challenged with groundwater pollution therefore about half of the water protection area in germany is within forests lfu 2015 an upcoming issue that is often discussed is the development of a water cycle that is dependent on climate change and land cover peel 2009 oudin et al 2008 however only few investigations consider forest stand structure natkhin et al 2012 beside soil and climate conditions the composition of tree species and stand structure influence groundwater recharge müller 2013 typical variables for describing the forest stand characteristics are tree species stand density tree height and vertical heterogeneity findings in the literature concerning the magnitude of groundwater recharge differ strongly from each other this is because of the differences between precipitation quantity and other site and stand conditions as a benchmark a range between 20 50 of the precipitation is a plausible quantity of groundwater recharge anders et al 2004 rust 2009 müller 2011 sutmöller and meesenburg 2012 müller 2013 groundwater recharge has been proved to depend on tree species douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii mirb franco recharges less groundwater than norway spruce picea abies l h karst and scots pine pinus sylvestris l and these two tree species recharge less groundwater than european beech fagus sylvatica l prietzel and bachmann 2011 sutmöller and meesenburg 2012 reported a significant difference between norway spruce and european beech in their groundwater recharge norway spruce stands form less groundwater than european beech stands groundwater recharge primarily occurs outside the vegetation period during winter deciduous species almost consume no water whereas conifers transpire and consume water hölting and coldewey 2013 rötzer et al 2017 this is the main reason for which conifers form less groundwater than deciduous trees previous work have also reported that species with low growth provide higher groundwater recharge pöhler et al 2013 ilstedt et al 2016 and sutmöller and meesenburg 2012 show that groundwater recharge was maximized at intermediate tree densities müller 2011 demonstrated that stands with small trees form more groundwater than stands with big trees but the influence of the tree species is higher than the influence of the tree height delzon and loustau 2005 show an age related decline in stand water use therefore previous work connote contrary findings about the impact of stand height on groundwater recharge although the process of creating concepts for ecosystem services in science and politics has an obvious advantage the quantitative assessment of ecosystem services is still a challenge this is particularly true when local decision makers require local information for that purpose simulation techniques play an increasingly important role nelson et al 2009 projects that investigate the long term effect of forest management on the provision of ecosystem services like alterfor alternative models for future forest management alterfor 2017 are fully based on landscape scale simulation scenarios therefore management models must now provide a broad range of ecosystem service results the simulations of silvicultural treatment which are part of forest management models enable the investigation of forest management with respect to all relevant ecosystem services simulation models that intrinsically represent the interaction between various driving forces and management are an essential tool for estimating the long term management effects on ecosystem services in particular water balance and landscape development are predestined for model evaluation because they depend on the interaction of many boundary conditions and are difficult to be depicted in empirical results pandeya et al 2016 the objectives of this study which is based on two case study areas are 1 to present an algorithm that integrates quantitative groundwater recharge into forest management models 2 to analyze whether there are species specific relations between forest stand structure and groundwater recharge 3 to examine whether there is a trade off between productivity and groundwater recharge 2 material and methods 2 1 procedure our approach combines a process based forest growth model with an observation based one fig 1 therefore we derive multilinear functions that describe groundwater recharge as dependent on forest stand structure attributes to that end we use the process based eco physiological growth model balance grote and pretzsch 2002 rötzer et al 2017 we then use those functions to calculate groundwater recharge based on simulated stand structure development obtained from the practice oriented management model silva pretzsch and kahn 1998 pretzsch et al 2002 the stand structure range within the case study areas was initially analyzed virtual stands were then generated for obtaining stand structure gradients subsequently groundwater recharge was quantified for each structure type finally the productivity and groundwater recharge of one stand within the case study area was exemplarily simulated with the forest management model 2 2 software tools balance silva strugen balance is a detailed and complex process based forest growth model grote and pretzsch 2002 pretzsch et al 2015 rötzer et al 2017 growth response is simulated at the tree level by considering the influences of competition stand structure species mixture and management impacts balance simulates tree growth on the base of environmental conditions and their changes over time dendrometrical characteristics of trees change with interactions between multiple physiological processes that depend on physical and chemical site conditions the altered structure of trees such as asymmetric crown shapes generate spatially explicit patterns within the stand the processes are calculated for several crown and root layers therefore the growth within the tree can be calculated spatially explicit for each layer based on energy supply and resource availability the most fundamental processes of balance are the carbon water and nutrient flows daily inputs of temperature radiation precipitation humidity and wind velocity form the basis of calculating the micro climate and water balance of each layer the physiological processes assimilation respiration nutrient up take growth senescence and allocation affect the dimensional tree growth that is calculated once a year in this manner tree growth and the development of site conditions like water balance and percolation can be simulated but this model approach requires detailed input data concerning weather and soil conditions eq 1 describes the water balance calculation within balance rötzer et al 2017 1 δswc prec eta per swc soil water content δswc change in swc prec precipitation eta actual evapotranspiration per percolation the actual evapotranspiration eta is the sum of transpiration interception and soil evapotranspiration and is based on the approach of penman monteith e g allen et al 1998 dvwk 1996 for this study we assume that groundwater recharge gwr can be considered as the sum of percolation per from the lowest soil layer percolation is the reduction of soil water content to field capacity fc and arises if soil water content is above field capacity 2 if swc fc than per swc fc in balance all parameters of the water balance e g eqs 1 and 2 are calculated continuously in daily time steps silva pretzsch and kahn 1998 pretzsch et al 2002 2015 pretzsch et al 2017 pretzsch 2002 is an empirical forest management model based on individual tree growth the simulation results comprise estimates of growth and yield including ecological and socio economic indicators this growth model breaks stands down into a mosaic of individual trees and simulates the interactions in a space time system this approach follows a combination of process and observation based modeling and uses only a few initial stand parameters rough site variables and silvicultural prescriptions and stand dynamics are simulated in five year cycles this time interval is also the standard time interval for measuring on the trial plots that were used for model evaluation each simulation cycle consists of four steps the first step is the quantification of spatial growth conditions of a tree by calculating a competition index the second step is the identification of trees that will be removed according to the rules of a user defined thinning concept following which dimension changes are calculated for all trees inside the stand in the fourth step a mortality model uses the previously calculated competition index to determine which trees did not survive if a detailed inventory of a stand is not available the missing data for simulation can be generated with strugen pretzsch 1993 1997 pretzsch 2010 strugen is a software tool that consists of an algorithm for stand structure generation based on a tree list or stem number diameter distribution a realistic stand can be established for the position of a tree the stand area is covered with random uniformly distributed x and y coordinates to manufacture desired structures of a stand the generated dot coordinates are accepted with different levels of probability in essence the points must pass through some filters that regulate macro structures for example only those positions are accepted that have an appointed distance to neighboring trees that are generated this process is repeated until the desired diameter distribution of the tree species is achieved subsequently further processes are performed to introduce additional tree species this completion of required values and the creation of first structure states provides realistic initialization data for simulation agreement between the real and created structures does not imply that each tree in the stand must have the same position but the characteristics of the structure can correspond 2 3 stand structure within the case study areas the size of the case study area lieberose schlaubetal neuzelle lsn in north east germany brandenburg is 90 000 ha the tree species comprise about 65 scots pine and 11 sessile oak quercus petraea mattuschka liebl the size of the case study area augsburg western forests awf in south germany bavaria is 60 000 ha and the tree species comprise about 62 norway spruce and 11 european beech based on data from the third german national forest inventory nfi thünen institut 2017 we created virtual stands by using strugen pretzsch 1997 those virtual stands represent the landscape of the case study areas the virtual stands were then analyzed according to the stand structure three structure indices suitable for characterizing stand structure were selected and calculated for each stand the first index is the stand density index sdi according to reineke 1933 3 s d i n q m d 25 1 605 qmd quadratic mean diameter in cm n number of trees per hectare the second index is the arithmetic mean height mh of a stand 4 m h 1 n i 1 n h i h tree height the third indicator is the variations coefficient of the tree height and includes information concerning the vertical heterogeneity vh 5 v h 1 m h 1 n 1 i 1 n h i m h i 2 variables as in eq 3 and 4 table 1 presents the characteristics of the case study areas comparing both areas a higher range and average of all structures in awf is apparent excluding the vertical heterogeneity that has a slightly lower average than in lsn 2 4 site conditions soils and climate the prevalent soil type in lsn table 2 consists of sand dominated base poor unconsolidated rocks with reduced nutrient supply in contrast soils in awf table 2 are generally lowland soils consisting of loess clay with high nutrient supply grüneberg et al 2016 andreae et al 2016 for the case study area in bavaria awf moisture data can be summarized with plant available water content of 257 mm in a profile with a depth of 125 cm in brandenburg lsn plant available soil water content of 177 mm characterizes the 90 cm deep profile the soil characteristics are taken from level ii permanent observation plots which form an international program icp forests 2011 the level ii plots are uniformly established in europe and were selected representing the conditions of the landscapes forst brandenburg 2017 the recordings of the level ii plots were used to calculate the plant available water content with the pedotransferfunction hypres wösten et al 1999 inside the hydrologic balance model lwf brook90 hammel and kennel 2001 the climate conditions were provided from the international institute for applied systems analysis iiasa within the alterfor project and are based on the climate model hadgem2 es collins et al 2011 the used developments depict climatic conditions considering climate change over the last 50 years within the considered time range temperature increased by 1 c and the precipitation quantities remained mostly constant fig 2 given by decade table 3 presents the mean values for the whole simulation time the precipitation average in lsn is slightly less than two thirds of the one in awf the average of the annual mean temperature and the wind speed are higher in lsn whereas the average of the radiation and the relative humidity are higher in awf 2 5 generating stands for obtaining structure gradients to parameterize groundwater recharge functions we generated five representative stand structures for each species and structure index i e model predictor to that end we considered two species with the highest share per case study area bavaria norway spruce european beech brandenburg scots pine sessile oak for each species and each of the three predictors we derived a set of five monospecific stands fig 3 within each of these predictor related sets the stands varied in the value of the related predictor while the remaining predictors were held at their landscape specific average in this manner a total of 60 stands was generated i e 15 stands per tree species in fig 3 this setup is visualized for spruce the set of virtual stands for each predictor covers the predictor s entire value range within the case study area considered table 1 for example the middle row in fig 3 shows five stands that represent the landscape specific spectrum of the stand density similarly each stand represents the average of the predictors in the top and bottom row therefore in the middle of fig 3 all stands have approximately the same vh and arithmetic mh but vary in stand density to generate the desired stands corresponding data for strugen suitable for achieving the desired structure values during the generation process is required strugen requires the number of trees as well as the basal area per height class to generate stands with a desired vh one set of heights was sampled from an empirical height distribution within the case study area considered each height value from that set was associated to a corresponding tree diameter which is defined as the mean diameter of all trees in the case study area of the corresponding height and tree species to achieve the desired densities the total number of trees was determined using the quadratic mean diameter and the sdi eq 3 balance simulations require buffer trees that surround the selected stand and serve to counteract edge effects those trees are needed for creating the same conditions at the edge of a stand to obtain a stand size of 0 25 ha the side length of the generated stand with strugen was 70 m trees with a distance to the edge of smaller than 10 m count as buffer trees table 4 presents the structure values of each generated stand the values according to the stands in the middle of fig 3 are signed in the middle of table 4 with sdi1 5 sp on the right hand side 2 6 simulation of groundwater recharge per stand of structure gradient for each of the two case study areas exactly one climate development was used both developments were fifty years long each climate development was divided into five consecutive ten year periods each generated stand of the structure gradient was simulated with balance for each of the five development periods in this manner we maintained consistency in the structures used for groundwater recharge function calibration and the structures employed during dynamic simulation for each stand the results of all corresponding simulation runs were averaged therefore each stand with a known structure combination could be matched with one value of groundwater recharge the aic akaike 1974 procedure provided by venables and ripley 2002 served for species specific stepwise model selection this procedure only accepts predictors that sufficiently contribute for estimation otherwise they are not suggested for being part of the model thus four statistical linear models were created those models are species specific groundwater recharge functions that have the general form of eq 6 6 gwr y intercept a mh b vh c sdi gwr groundwater recharge mh arithmetic mean height vh vertical heterogeneity sdi stand density index in addition the beta coefficients of each statistical model were calculated to enable a comparison of the slope and the influence among the model s predictors each beta coefficient results from a regression that uses standardized predictors each with a variance of one each predictor was divided by its variance for clarity and validation the groundwater recharge average of all five climate time steps was plotted over the structure gradients wherever applicable a line of linear regression was added to the plots 2 7 exemplary test application with the forest management model silva to demonstrate the application of the results a mixed european beech and norway spruce stand was simulated by the forest management model silva two management pathways were simulated one assumed that no interventions took place the other one however applied thinning and harvest interventions to establish continuous cover forestry ccf the structure development of the initial stand from period zero up to 100 years notably depends on the treatment scenario fig 4 the ccf forest management is characterized by future crop tree thinnings combined with target diameter harvests one objective of forest management is to maintain stock at a level that provides a continuous cover the other objective is the rise of the broadleaved species proportion within each of the two management pathways the statistical groundwater model was applied to the resulting stand structure on a per time step basis to that end the model s predictors see section 2 3 table 1 were calculated for each simulation period then for each time step the species specific groundwater recharge was calculated eq 6 the unweighted species specific contribution gwrspecies was then weighted by mixing the proportion gssspecies of each tree species eq 7 7 gwrtotal gssspecies1 gwrspecies1 gssspecies2 gwrspecies2 gwrtotal groundwater recharge of mixed stand gwrspecies species specific groundwater recharge contribution gssspecies species specific growing space share the mixing proportion for each species was calculated as the species specific share of crown projection area i e growing space 3 results 3 1 structure dependent groundwater functions the relation of groundwater recharge to structure was species specific fig 5 furthermore it is discernible that there was a higher level of groundwater recharge in awf than in lsn norway spruce was sensitive to all structure variables the vh of norway spruce demonstrated less influence than its arithmetic mh within the simulated norway spruce stands density was the most important predictor whereas the lines of the linear regressions for european beech have low slopes at most vh caused a notable drift in groundwater recharge sessile oak has a horizontal regression line at the sdi but the groundwater recharge was decreasing with increasing arithmetic mh and vertical structure scots pine was only reacting on arithmetic mh obviously in lsn as well as in awf within the virtual coniferous species stands percolation was lower than in the broadleaved species stands the groundwater recharge of european beech and scots pine was only dependent on one structure variable table 5 in contrast the recharge values of sessile oak were dependent on arithmetic mh and vh moreover the groundwater recharge of the virtual norway spruce stands was clearly influenced by all structure variables mh vh and sdi it is necessary to consider that it is not possible to check all species in this study against each other only the species of one case study area are comparable among each other because they rely on the same environmental conditions each species was solely investigated within one case study area comparing norway spruce and european beech awf the broadleaved species has a higher y intercept than the coniferous the same is true for scots pine and sessile oak lsn where the same relationship is discernible the standardized beta coefficients of norway spruce in awf underpin a stronger influence of the arithmetic mh on groundwater recharge than of the vh nevertheless the arithmetic mh of a norway spruce stand in awf seems to have less influence than the sdi in such a norway spruce stand however vh had less influence than in a european beech stand within sessile oak stands the arithmetic mh had a larger effect than in a scots pine stands lsn 3 2 exemplary test simulation the exemplary simulation of over 100 years that assumed silvicultural treatment compared to the untreated one leads to higher values of the norway spruce proportion and furthermore of the stocking volume fig 6 a and b the norway spruce share in the untreated stand is approximately constant whereas the curve of the treatment scenario develops toward higher shares of european beech furthermore the untreated stock increases throughout the entire simulation time but the stock in the treatment scenario is constant between 400 and 500 m3 therefore within that scenario a ccf system has been established density in the treatment scenario first decreases and then oscillates within a sustained level in contrast the density in the simulation without treatment is higher and approximately constant initially the vertical structure slightly falls in the treated and in the untreated stand the development without treatments is then by continuous increase the treated stand s vh increases rapidly within a short initial period and then remains constant the arithmetic mh is lower in the treated stand than in the untreated stand norway spruce inside the exemplary mixed stand contributed between 300 and up to 400 mm yr 1 to groundwater recharge unweighted contribution see section 2 7 fig 7 a within that scope the treated stand had considerably higher recharge values than the untreated one the unweighted contribution of european beech fig 7b remained almost constant and was nearly independent of the treatment scenario european beech has higher unweighted contribution of groundwater recharge than spruce as a coherent outcome the mixed species stand groundwater recharge obtained as the weighted sum of the contributions of both species see section 2 7 shows an increasing influence of european beech it overrides a development that is initially governed by the norway spruce curve the stand volume growth decreases during simulation time fig 7c this trend is visible in both management pathways but is stronger in the treatment scenario there was a clear trade off between stand volume growth and groundwater recharge fig 8 the treated as well as the untreated scenario demonstrate this trend but the scenario of the treated version is steeper higher groundwater recharge thus was paid for with lower stand volume growth 4 discussion 4 1 relevance of forest management for ecosystem services provision to improve sustainability current forest management planning must consider a multitude of ecosystem services on the background of various planning alternatives lasch et al 2005 water scarcity steadily becomes more critical wwap 2012 a relevant process on that background is the effect of forest management activities on the groundwater system that interaction however has rarely been investigated smerdon et al 2009 this study shows that forest management can raise groundwater recharge reduce stand productivity change tree species composition and thus influences ecosystem services consequently it is important to be aware of the ways in which management affects ecosystem service provisioning possibly trade offs between ecosystem services are particularly related to certain management systems therefore our study presents a method for revealing possible conflicts between groundwater recharge and production on the landscape scale level to that end we developed a novel approach and applied it to test its suitability for trade off analyses within two treatment scenarios as also underpinned by previous work pöhler et al 2013 there was a clear trade off between groundwater recharge and productivity both treatment variants that we exemplified exhibit a trade off in the same direction but of different slope considering the ccf variant that result may be explained by a decrease in wood production and a concomitant increase in groundwater recharge within that variant stand productivity declined because of a decreasing stand density and a drop in the proportion of spruce groundwater recharge conversely became larger because of an increase in the proportion of beech and a concomitant decrease in stand density within the non thinned variant only a decline in productivity caused the trade off and groundwater recharge was almost constant that decline in productivity was likely because of raising mortality resulting from increased stock and tree density 4 2 validity of the results 4 2 1 implementation procedure simulation results are always as exact and valid as the modeling approach allows this approach stripped down the modeling of the most important predictors for groundwater estimation to reduce the aimed prediction to essential variables strongly correlating with forest management in particular this approach underpins the practicability of a method that integrates relations from a mechanistic approach into a model of higher abstraction level observation based models are commonly parameterized with functions resulting from field trails modeling with a detailed representation including a high resolution of the system is quite suitable for investigating ecological relations based on a causal explanation of process interactions therefore process based models are suitable for deriving functions for observation based models according to pandeya et al 2016 water balance and locally required results for landscapes are very suitable for simulation but this higher level of abstraction leads to limitations in the validity of the results this approach aims to estimate averages of magnitudes as well as strength and direction of changes with respect to forest management this means more smooth results as probably prevalent in reality the sensitivity of deflection is buffered to the average of changes in the direction 4 2 1 1 balance balance which was used for the percolation estimations is a process based growth model which simulates the three dimensional development of trees and forest stands and estimates consequences of environmental conditions the carbon water and nutrient flows of individual trees of different tree species form the fundamental processes for the growth simulations a first version of the growth model balance was published in 2002 grote and pretzsch 2002 the development of the model is still ongoing rötzer et al 2013a b rötzer et al 2017 extensive validations of the model balance were published for growth processes and stand development grote and pretzsch 2002 rötzer et al 2005 rötzer et al 2010 rötzer et al 2013a b micro climate rötzer et al 2010 phenology rötzer et al 2004 rötzer et al 2005 rötzer et al 2010 and water balance rötzer et al 2005 rötzer et al 2010 rötzer et al 2017 this way the process based growth model balance is able to realistically simulate growth and water balance including percolation for central european forests 4 2 1 2 parameter selection neither parameters for environmental conditions nor the fundamental process parameters for driving groundwater recharge were used directly in the predictive models groundwater functions however both are taken into account in the modeling approach the used process model reflects the important processes and is sensitive to the environmental conditions that were explicitly set for the two case study areas therefore we performed no sensitivity analysis in advance to find out which are the most important factors influencing groundwater recharge because rather than identifying the most important predictors for groundwater recharge the prediction should be limited to management related parameters in order to reduce the predictive model to the impact of forest management the predictive models are thus only valid in the case study areas with the set environmental conditions as a consequence of not implementing the fundamental predictors for groundwater recharge directly in the prediction model this approach has the mentioned limitations and this can be regarded as weakness but at the same time thereby some benefit arises this approach abstracts quantification of groundwater recharge to the essential variables regarding the pure influence of forest management on landscape level for rough quantitative estimation of groundwater recharge in dependence on forest management on landscape level the results show that species and structure are convenient predictors under assumed environmental conditions the overriding target of this article was to develop a procedure resp which is an algorithm to statistically simulate groundwater recharge for forest management purposes our proposed procedure its prediction models and parameters seem to be the appropriate way the process leads to recognizable differentiations and changes in the groundwater recharge simulation of the forest management model and therefore the algorithm and its parameters fulfill its purpose a further finding in this study is that only a subset of the predictors considered had a pivotal influence on groundwater recharge the consideration of structure variables as predictors makes the procedure more complicated and they had a small influence as compared to the influence of the consideration of the tree species this can be deduced from the differences between the y intercepts table 5 compared with the slopes in this study and this csas this knowledge would have been possible to be applied to simplify both model calibration and application for an even more straightforward estimation of groundwater recharge for the purposes regarded in this paper the prediction could have been stripped down to the tree species as the only parameter of the prediction model 4 2 2 relation between groundwater recharge and stand structure because climate and soil conditions were set in balance they are the basis where the derived relation between groundwater recharge and forest stand structure pertain for improved comparability the results of groundwater recharge can be considered as a share of precipitation that generalization reveals that the results have a plausible magnitude in this study the groundwater recharge values account for approximately 30 50 of the occurring precipitation in the case study areas such values are conform with those from the literature anders et al 2004 rust 2009 müller 2011 sutmöller and meesenburg 2012 müller 2013 the magnitude of the values however is at the top of the range reported our modeling approach aims to represent groundwater recharge within any mixed species stand considered therefore our approach aggregates various independent estimations each estimation is related to the whole stand s structure but is specific to a monoculture of one of the stand s tree species the estimations fundamental data were obtained through simulation of the recharge process within constructed monocultural stands each of which represented a structure type from forest landscape analysis to meet the overall structure of any mixed stand these virtual stands irrespective of their tree species had to represent the entire range of structures including mixed species stands from inventory analysis thus the virtual stands exhibited structures that were not necessarily typical of the tree species monocultures therein however as a crucial property they represent spatial relationships that may occur within mixed stands such relationships influence throughfall interception and transpiration through flux resistances and competition within the stand canopy jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 our approach neglects the possible dependence of these intrinsic variables on the direct interaction among trees of different species however the approximation presented is fast and feasible for estimating long term trends of groundwater recharge within assumed climate conditions and forest management scenarios on landscape scale level in the literature intermediate stand density is recommended for forest management aiming high groundwater recharge sutmöller and meesenburg 2012 ilstedt et al 2016 the reasons are that sparse stand density facilitates high discharge rates and ground cover vegetation high stand density causes high interception and transpiration and thus reduces groundwater recharge groundwater recharge is not very sensitive to stand density within this study except the virtual spruce stands at first intermediate density mean another sdi and number of trees for each species as already mentioned the study at hand investigated a limited range of structures that were typical for mixed species stands within the case study areas considered and thus not for each tree species separately for example same sdi value resulting from the mixed species stands in a csa could imply typically high density for beech and almost low density for spruce in monoculture environmental and site specific conditions as well as the range of simulated sdi values for each species similar could be reasons for the initially unexpected relation between stand density and groundwater recharge in this study finally it should not be assumed that the relations are necessarily typical of the tree species in general much more the results are a snapshot which results in a sensible calibration for the fmm as functional likeness of species mixtures on the entire case study area and environmental conditions 5 conclusions the modeling approach presented leads to plausible results of groundwater recharge it enables the estimation of the quantitative changes of the essential ecosystem service to contrasting options of forest management therefore it is suitable to practice forest management planning with trade off estimations among ecosystem services on the landscape level within an exemplary scenario the approach underpinned a trade off between groundwater recharge and productivity this important relation was amplified through a change in tree species composition within ccf management the influence of the model s predictors on groundwater recharge notably differs in strength the dominating tree species has a higher influence than stand structure however both stand structure and tree species have a significant effect that is case study area

additionally when management is spatially explicit the spatial scale of management may differ from the spatial structure of stock units cadrin and secor 2009 accordingly the international council for the exploration of the sea ices stock identification methods working group simwg ices 2016 stated that traditionally exploited stocks have been assessed and managed according to geographical features and ices subdivisions i e lines on a map in order to facilitate decision making and agreements among countries in other cases such as for pacific herring clupea pallasii management may be delineated by general spawning locations or occur at the aggregate stock level determining finer scale sub stock structure is not yet possible with currently available scientific methods overexploitation of stocks can lead to loss of spawning grounds through ecological extinction of sub stocks which could reduce total productivity and subsequently impair full recovery schmidt et al 2009 additionally the loss of sub stocks can happen in fisheries that are deemed sustainable at the stock level but in which individual sub stocks cannot sustain the localized fishing intensity that occurs for example because of differences in access costs reich and dealteris 2009 despite the appearance of large scale sustainability local depletion and related losses in potential catch are clearly inconsistent with policy goals related to sustainable fishing as well as food security and wellbeing for adjacent coastal peoples and communities e g united nations 2015 in such cases spatial management tools may thus lead to greater sustainability and improved human well being however spatial management comes with increased costs for example data needs are greater and monitoring costs are correspondingly higher additionally regulations associated with management are ostensibly more complex and may lead to increased implementation and enforcement costs detailed knowledge of fish behavior is needed to better understand the importance of spatially explicit spawning components including how fish recruit into certain sites or sub stocks the assumption of random diffusion versus other concepts e g entrainment petitgas et al 2006 2010 might considerably alter management outcomes as a broad literature on harvesting fish metapopulations has shown e g maccall et al 2018 armstrong and skonhoft 2006 bulte et al 1999 sanchirico and wilen 2001 2005 supriatna and possingham 1999 these studies typically focus on two patches connected by movement however in many cases fish populations occur in many patches and knowledge about exact spatial patterns of recruitment is not readily available or conclusions about recruitment behavior are disputed among experts thus competing assumptions need to be examined in addition to the economic benefits of fisheries much recent work has highlighted the importance of considering the ecological and socio cultural consequences of fisheries e g halpern et al 2013 tahvonen et al 2014 marshall et al 2017 careful evaluation of the costs and benefits of spatial management requires accounting for the full suite of trade offs among ecological economic and socio cultural objectives marshall et al 2017 we take a first step in this direction by evaluating trade offs between a subset of social ecological and economic objectives fisheries yield present value of economic surplus and loss of spawning sites which in some cases is linked to loss of cultural values between socio ecological economic objectives including yield present value of economic surplus and loss of spawning sites which might be linked to loss of cultural values in this analysis we use a generic spatially structured ecological economic model to explore the ecological and economic importance of knowledge about spatial patterns in harvested fish populations in order to investigate the hypothetical benefits of implementing spatially differentiated fisheries management the model that we use is heuristic and simplified motivated by the fishery for pacific herring using our generic spatially structured model we explore the consequences for fisheries management and ecosystem objectives of alternative and equally plausible spatial recruitment behaviors heterogeneity in spawning site productivity and global versus spatially explicit fisheries management regulations using this conceptual model sensu mangel et al 2001 mangel and levin 2005 we illuminate the broad consequences of these biological assumptions as related to fisheries yield and maintenance of spawning sites 2 material and methods the bio economic model has spatial structure with several in the baseline model n 50 spawning components that are partially connected by diffusion of adults and recruits among adjacent spawning sites the general set up and biological assumptions follow maccall et al 2018 stock dynamics within each site are described by a ricker type stock recruitment function in which the density independent parameter may vary spatially recruitment to the adult stock of each spawning component occurs according to one of two behavior models under the diffusion reproductive strategy diff recruits are distributed in fixed proportions among habitats near their natal habitat and subsequently tend to return to those spawning locations under the go with the older fish gwof fig 1 maccall et al 2018 strategy recruits join a school of older migrating fish repeat spawners and adopt that school s migration behavior with subsequent homing behavior following the migration path and spawning location of those older fish thus under gwof strategy first time spawners recruit to the same set of spawning sites as diff recruits but proportional to the relative abundances of repeat spawners currently using those sites maccall et al 2018 for each combination of recruitment behavior and fishing mortality we perform 100 iterations of the model each with randomly drawn spatial distributions for the density independent productivity parameter when assuming site specific variability in productivity each run simulates a 100 year projection assuring that a steady state equilibrium is reached the spawning sites are assumed to be organized around a circle and diffusion of recruits occurs to five sites i e from site i to sites i i 1 i 2 i 1 and i 2 similarly diffusion from site i 1 is to sites i 2 and i 3 as well as to sites i and i 1 returning spawners adults diffuse to three sites i e if originating at site i they can return to sites i i 1 or i 1 this assumption of periodic or circular boundary conditions avoids boundary effects the parameter l i as part of the ricker stock recruitment function denotes site specific density independent productivity mathematical notation is as follows biomass in sites i 1 n is given by the vector b t with elements b i t with circular boundaries to model this we extend the biomass vector with four extra elements set equal to the respective elements at the left and right boundaries of the vector such that b 1 b n 1 b 0 b n b n 1 b 1 b n 2 b 2 we need four such elements two to the left and two to the right to capture dispersal to the respective next and second next neighbor δ a matrix with elements δ i t α 1 2 δ δ i i 1 δ i 1 i α δ and all other entries zero describes diffusion of adult fish we set the overall survivability from natural mortality to α 0 7 and diffusion to δ 0 1 in the baseline parametrization this means that 80 of adult fish remain in their current site while 10 diffuse to the site to the left and another 10 to the site on the right including the effects of the circular boundary r t φ b t a vector of recruits with element i being the ricker stock recruitment function for site i φ i b t b i t exp l i φ β b i t having parameters β 0 01 and li as well asφ set to zero in the scenario with homogeneous sites and assigned random numbers from a uniform distribution on σ σ with σ varying between 0 and 1 or set equal to 1 in the scenario with heterogeneous site specific productivities at maximum heterogeneity the most productive sites are ca 7 4 times more productive as compared to the least productive sites we set φ such that e exp l i φ 1 1 1 this means we set φ ln exp l i ln 1 2 σ σ σ exp l d l ln 1 2 σ exp σ exp σ to keep the expected productivity for each site at the same level as for the case with fixed homogeneous site specific productivity for a particular randomly drawn set of productivity parameters the average productivity over sites can differ from the constant site specific productivity diffusion of recruits in the diff model is described by a n 4 n 4 matrix d with elements equal to zero except d i i 3 9 d i i 1 d i i 1 2 9 d i i 2 d i i 2 1 9 circular boundaries are modeled by including diffusion from sites 1 and 2 to n and n 1 and the other way around we use the n 4 n 4 matrix with two rows and two columns added at each border of the interior n n diffusion matrix to model these circular boundary conditions consequently biomasses are described by an n 4 dimensional vector where the first two elements are always identical to elements n 1 and n 2 and the last two elements are always identical toe elements 3 and 4 thus the elements 3 to n 2 are the relevant interior biomasses for the gwof model migration of recruits is described by a n 4 n 4 matrix g b t with dispersal from i to j given by g i j b t b j t b i 2 t b i 1 t b i t b i 1 t b i 2 t for all i and j i 2 i 1 i i 1 i 2 again circular boundaries are modeled by including diffusion from sites 1 and 2 to n and n 1 and the other way around as above biomass dynamics subject to harvesting are in matrix notation 1 b t 1 δ e t d r t in the diff model 2 b t 1 δ e t g e t r t in the gwof model where δ d and g are the matrices introduced above e i t 1 f i t b i t is escapement for site i at time t with fishing mortality fit 2 2 strictly speaking this is an exploitation rate as fishing mortality is in continuous time since there is a monotonic relationship between the two we use the term fishing mortality for fit i e et is the biomass remaining after harvesting and rt φ et is the recruitment produced by that biomass as an initial condition we set the biomass in all sites equal to 100 i e the biomass where the ricker stock recruitment function peaks in expectation in all of our computations the steady state was unique and globally stable thus assumptions regarding the initial biomass distribution have no impact on the steady state results yield levels can be interpreted with respect to this biomass as this is a conceptual model biomass as well as yield are handled without dimension we consider a schooling fish and set the fish price net of constant marginal harvesting costs equal to one tahvonen et al 2013 we consider the management objective to maximize the present value of economic surplus for the entire fishery for the management scenario where fishing mortality is chosen independently for each site and time step the optimization problem is 3 max e i j t 0 ρ t i 1 n b i t e i t that is to maximize the present value of yield discounted at a discount factor ρ i e the discount rate is 1 ρ ρ the model is implemented in matlab and code is available in the online supporting material we consider three scenarios for both recruitment behavior models table 1 first the model is used to compare the two alternative recruitment behavior scenarios diff and gwof while spawning sites are assumed to be homogeneous and management ignores spatial structure i e fishing mortality f is the same for all sites hereafter termed global f in this scenario the density independent parameter of the ricker stock recruitment function is pre specified the model is run for 100 years and model output is used to construct a yield curve for the f range of 0 0 6 here we ask the question how does the assumed recruitment behavior affect steady state yield and the associated fishing mortality in a second scenario management is still assumed to be global but we additionally allow for heterogeneity in spawning site productivity i e the density independent parameter may vary spatially variation in productivity involves assigning a value randomly drawn from a uniform distribution we perform 100 iterations of the model for each combination of recruitment behavior and fishing mortality as before results are used to construct yield curves over the range f 0 0 6 again we determine optimal steady state yields and economically optimal exploitation rates used here as a proxy for a management measure that limits fishing mortality such as a spatial quota additionally we calculate the number of lost spawning sites a site is defined as being lost if its biomass drops below 10 of the biomass that would produce the maximum sustainable yield for that site i e fishing at fmsy 3 3 this doesn t necessarily reflect current fisheries practice e g pacific herring fisheries where current f is assumed to be below fmsy to explore the effect of the model assumptions we perform a sensitivity analysis with respect to the number of sites n the natural survivability α and the diffusion rate δ to explore how the results depend on the parametrization of the numerical model the third scenario allows for fully spatially explicit management i e setting site specific fishing mortality f hereafter referred to as local f table 1 here the model is analytically solved for the special case of optimal local f for heterogeneous sites we also quantify potential benefits of spatially differentiated local management compared to spatially homogeneous global management by varying the degree of spatial heterogeneity of spawning sites benefits are quantified in terms of both surplus yield and loss of spawning sites we maintain the assumption that recruitment parameters are randomly drawn from a uniform distribution but vary the range of the uniform distribution keeping average productivity fixed we refer to the upper bound of the range equal to the absolute value of the lower bound as the spread of site productivities we perform 100 model iterations for each value of spread with the optimal exploitation rate computed for each site at each iteration the results are presented in three sections one for each scenario 3 results 3 1 homogeneous productivity of spawning sites the spatial recruitment mechanism i e diff versus gwof has no effect on fisheries management or ecosystem objectives if all spawning sites are equally productive no spatial structure also in terms of fishing mortality termed homogeneous in table 1 fig 2 steady state harvest follows an almost symmetric concave function with positive long term harvest for fishing mortality up to a value fcrit 0 41 4 4 in the homogeneous case equilibrium biomass is the same for all patches and described by equations 1 and 2 with exploitation rate f natural survivability α and the parameter β of the ricker function it is given by b e q 1 β 1 f ln 1 α 1 f 1 f it becomes zero when f fcrit 1 α 1 1 0 7 1 0 41 higher fishing mortality than fcrit results in stock collapse in our idealized fishery optimal yield is equal for both models and optimal fishing mortality under these assumptions is fhom 0 23 5 5 fhom is the value of f that maximizes equilibrium yield f b e q f f β 1 f l φ ln 1 α 1 f 1 f for the homogeneous case l φ 0 which is fhom 0 233 with harvest level fhom beq 15 32 for α 0 7 and β 0 01 two thirds of the maximum yield could be realized within the range of f 0 1 to f 0 35 3 2 heterogeneous spawning sites no spatial management results become more complex for the heterogeneous spawning sites scenario here the diff strategy results in a slightly higher optimal yield as compared to the diff strategy with homogeneous sites which is realized at a global exploitation rate of f 0 254 fig 2 as with homogenous productivity the steady state yield curve is symmetric and concave variability in results from the 100 iterations with randomly drawn local density independent productivity parameters is relatively large one standard deviation covers a harvest range of 13 5 17 5 near the optimal f the gwof strategy in a system with heterogeneous habitats results in markedly reduced achievable steady state harvest optimal f is lower 0 179 and the shape of the yield function becomes left skewed in this scenario optimal global f i e management without spatial differentiation depends on the biological setting assuming incorrect recruitment behavior might either lead to overfishing or to underutilization of the resource opportunity costs i e a benefit that a person could receive but gave up to take another course of action of incorrectly applying spatial management rules are relatively low see discussion the diff migration strategy results in robustness of stock components to overfishing over a wide range of fishing mortality i e up to a f of 0 3 fig 3 managing for the optimal f independent of the assumptions made regarding recruitment behavior would never deplete any spawning component however under the gwof strategy an increasing f will lead to an increasing number of collapsed sites fishing mortality producing optimal harvest in terms of biomass would lead to ca 19 of collapsed sites for the gwof hypothesis if management wrongly used the optimal f estimated based on the diff assumption this would double to almost 40 reducing the number of sites to n 20 shown in fig 4 panel a or increasing it to n 100 panel b has hardly any effect on expected outcomes but increasing the number of sites clearly reduces variability due to spatial variation in productivity reducing dispersion to δ 0 05 panel c or increasing it to δ 0 2 panel d has hardly any effect in the homogeneous setting or in the heterogeneous setting for the diff model in the gwof model reducing dispersion reduces maximum yield and increasing dispersion increases the maximum yield with less pronounced effects at fishing mortalities below or above the corresponding f msy increasing natural survivability to α 0 9 panel e shifts the fishing mortalities that generate the maximum sustainable yield and the fishing mortality where the fishery collapses in the homogeneous case to larger values and increases yields in the gwof model the peak of the yield curve becomes more pronounced at high α decreasing natural survivability to α 0 5 panel f decreases yields and shifts the fishing mortalities that generate the maximum sustainable yield and the fishing mortality where the fishery collapses in the homogeneous case to smaller values for all models except for the gwof model in the heterogeneous case in the gwof model yields decrease as well but the fishing mortality that generates the maximum sustainable yield increases 3 3 optimal local f management 3 3 1 analytical results for the idealized case of optimal local f management in which the fishing mortality is fixed for each spawning component individually the assumed recruitment behavior model does not play a role and knowledge about the recruitment behavior would accordingly not be needed for management purposes this can be shown analytically as outlined below if the biomass dynamics are sufficiently fast to exclude a corner solution the optimal solution is a constant escapement strategy the reason is that the state of the populations in all patches can be fully controlled by choosing the escapement levels and thus the condition for the optimal next period s population sizes is independent of the current population size we omit the proof which follows the standard approach in the literature e g costello and polasky 2008 with the gwof assumption optimal constant escapement levels are given by the condition 4 1 ρ e k t i 1 n j 1 n δ i j e j t g i j e t e j t exp l j β e j t condition 4 states that the marginal benefit of immediate harvest the fish price net of constant marginal harvesting costs set equal to one on the left hand side of the equation should equal the marginal benefit of leaving an extra unit of biomass in the ocean this marginal benefit is given by the expression on the right hand side of eq 4 it is the marginal increase in catches from all patches i 1 n that arises from a marginal increase in biomass of the fish stock in all patches j 1 n to which the patches i are connected by migration due to the marginal increase of the escapement e kt at site k as the benefit arises one period in the future it is discounted by the factor ρ using the fact that marginal benefits from harvesting are the same across patches this condition can be substantially simplified rearranging we obtain 5 1 ρ i 1 n δ i k g i k e t 1 β e k t exp l k β e k t j 1 n g i j e t e k t e j t exp l j β e j t ρ α 1 β e k t exp l k β e k t j 1 n e j t exp l j β e j t i 1 n g i j e t e k t ρ α 1 β e k t exp l k β e k t j k 2 k 2 e j

condition is obtained for the optimal escapement levels in the diff model we thus have the following result proposition 1 optimal spatially differentiated management is identical under the diff and gwof models human time preferences are captured in bio economic models by setting discount rates positive discount rates imply that realizing catches today is more valued than taking the same amount of fish at a later point in time this seems to be a reasonable assumption both under economic considerations as well as acknowledging the highly uncertain conditions in many fisheries it is straightforward to show that the optimal escapement in each site decreases with the discount rate i e increases with the discount factor for no discounting we obtain the corollary that all sites are harvested according to the respective site specific maximum sustainable yield if there is no discounting i e if ρ 1 proposition 2 optimal spatially differentiated management with no discounting ρ 1 is achieved when harvesting each patch according to its individual maximum sustainable yield ignoring spatial movement 3 3 2 economic benefits of applying optimal local f management we now turn to the question how much harvest might be gained if spatially differentiated management optimally adapted to local productivities could be used the potential benefits from the fishery rise with increasing spatial spread in productivity following a convex function i e local f management is increasingly rewarding if local differences in site specific productivity are pronounced when the spread of productivity reaches one mean steady state harvest could be increased by ca 15 fig 5 while no spawning components would be lost see section 3 2 the reason that yield increases with variability is that spatially differentiated management adapts to the productivity of sites and thus can take advantage of more productive sites compared to the homogeneous case with equal average productivity for the case without discounting this can be easily demonstrated analytically in this case the optimal spatially differentiated management is to harvest each patch according to its individual maximum sustainable yield ignoring spatial movement maximum equilibrium yield see footnote 6 is a convex function of site productivity as the following argument shows d 2 d l 2 f m s y β 1 f m s y l φ ln 1 α 1 f m s y 1 f m s y f d d l f m s y β 1 f m s y d f m s y d l β 1 f m s y 2 0 here fmsy is the maximum sustainable yield fishing mortality which is increasing in site productivity l to derive the first equality we have used the envelope theorem where the derivative of equilibrium yield with respect to fmsy is zero as this is exactly the value of f that maximizes equilibrium yield thus harvest from the more productive sites more than proportionally contributes to aggregate yield by contrast the mean yield decreases with spatial heterogeneity applying a spatially homogeneous exploitation rate equal to the msy level at the expected productivity for the reasons discussed in section 3 2 the benefit of spatially differentiated local management thus increases with the spread of site productivities fig 5 shows the variability across model runs as productivities are drawn randomly spatial variability can also lead to an overall reduction in catches even with local f management for the largest value of the spread the catches of the least productive site are on average over model runs 0 36 of the average catches over sites for the most productive site catches are 370 of the average over sites 4 discussion our results provide the methodological basis to quantify and evaluate potential economic and conservation benefits of applying spatially explicit fisheries management furthermore we analyze the risks associated with assuming incorrect migration behavior and quantify the potential economics gains if such knowledge becomes available our work thereby offers general insights rather than providing tactical management advice and we discuss these below we explore two contrasting scenarios to describe migrational behaviour which we consider to be simplified but plausible alternative assumptions the diff scenario is behaviorally neutral and applies basic diffusion rules founded in physics on the other hand the gwof scenario incorporates active behavior of recruits and is based on the concept of entrainment e g corten 2002 petitgas et al 2006 both the gwof and diff scenarios could result in observations for herring like stocks i e complex population structure without genetic differentiation variable migration patterns or archaeological spatial patterns of herring abundance dickey collas et al 2009 mckechnie et al 2014 the gwof behavior is consistent with traditional knowledge of pacific herring indicating that local spawning may consist of mixed or sequential waves of separate sub stocks maccall et al 2018 both migratory strategies incorporate homing to preferred spawning areas which need not be the natal site in either case in our simplified model the distribution of recruits is limited to a local window of five adjacent sites however the spatial distances over which either mechanism would operate in actual fish populations are presently unknown we have also considered symmetrical exchanges between sites how other types of spatial movement e g source sink dynamics would play out is still an open question in our model optimal local f management becomes progressively more beneficial with increasing spatial variability in productivity we estimate potential gains in yield of up to 15 in our theoretical setting under optimal local f management knowledge of the underlying recruitment behavior is not relevant each local site would be managed according to its maximum sustainable yield ignoring spatial redistribution of adults and recruits this theoretical result provides a reference point for optimal spatially differentiated management given the assumptions that the marginal net benefits of fishing are the same across patches as prices and marginal costs are assumed to be spatially homogeneous and that management is only concerned with total catch the manager may not care from which patch the catch comes the total catch is maximized by adjusting stock sizes in all patches such as to maximize surplus production before spatial movement previous work on optimal fishing under biological uncertainties suggests that levels of optimal fishing mortality are fairly robust to uncertainties in for example the parameters of the recruitment function kapaun and quaas 2013 tahvonen et al 2017 the spatial recruitment behavior would influence the optimal spatial management of the fishery if it matters from which site the catch is taken for example if prices differ transport costs matter protecting local sites for traditional harvest is a priority or distributing catch to avoid ecological implications of overharvesting individual patches is a priority however such theoretical optimal solutions for spatial management would require perfect spawning site specific implementation a condition difficult to be met in reality if optimal local f management cannot be implemented e g due to lack of administrative resources the underlying migration behavior of recruits and adult fish becomes important unfortunately migration behavior is unknown for many fish stocks and has been recognized as important and ongoing field of research mcquinn 1997 huse et al 2002 petitgas et al 2010 planque et al 2011 therefore a precautionary approach to the development of fisheries policy would be to adopt the scenario with the least negative impacts for high natural survival rates α 0 7 and α 0 9 the lowest risk is associated with the gwof migration behavior hypothesis and fishery managers would need to apply lower f values as a less productive stock is implied if the major management objective was to minimize the loss of spawning grounds a maximum f of ca 0 08 would be chosen resulting in site losses 5 fig 3 table 2 maximum yield policies under the gwof recruitment behavior assumption would allow for f 0 18 fig 2 however this relatively small increase in yield as compared to yield under f 0 08 would be accompanied by an approximately 15 loss of spawning sites fig 3 table 2 if management set f 0 23 the optimum f with diff recruitment hypothesis fig 2 while in reality fish behave according to the gwof model this would result in a loss of 35 of all spawning sites and a reduction of total catches table 2 the absolute values of fishing mortality discussed here relate to our theoretical example they will change if ecological e g natural mortality rates diffusion rates or economic e g costs conditions differ management could allow for higher f and optimal yield limits could approximately be doubled without risking the loss of any spawning grounds if biological research could verify the diff migration behavior as the underlying process therefore such quantification of potential benefits as well as the risks of adopting the wrong biological hypothesis might inform decisions on future research priorities we focused on optimal yield involving ecological and social concepts as our management objective however setting sustainable fishery harvest limits is only one element of ecosystem based fishery management ebfm marshall et al 2017 here we show that spatial structure of fish populations is linked to optimal yield regulations and that optimal yield management based on incorrect ecological assumptions can lead to overexploitation and local stock depletions spawning site loss will disproportionately affect harvesters and people from place bound communities that do not or cannot move widely to alternative sites i e small scale commercial harvesters and or those who harvest for food social ceremonial purposes there is a further hidden problem with losing individual spawning sites and that is the risk of loss of the behavior associated with that site this problem was investigated by huse et al 2010 who found that migratory knowledge begins to be lost when the fraction of repeat spawners was reduced below about 30 and destruction of the behavioral knowledge became certain at 10 nevertheless optimal yield involving ecological and social concepts remains a valuable concept as it provides an existing governance framework for the operationalization of ebfm by requiring that fisheries balance ecological economic and social goals patrick and link 2015 using optimal yield oy within an ebfm framework by definition and statute requires a multiobjective approach and a challenge in operationalizing the use of multiattribute decision tools is identifying the objectives with which to measure performance of each potential strategy patrick and link 2015 this should be a multi step process starting with first bounding the problem or essentially identifying the stakeholder groups and objectives to include in any tradeoff analyses levin et al 2016 knowing the specific social ecological and economic objectives of different stakeholders it is then possible to craft management strategies that attempt to meet these goals in the u s management system for instance msy is estimated first and subsequently quota can be reduced below msy in order to achieve other objectives patrick and link 2015 successful non spatial fisheries management e g applying uniform fishing mortality across sites should be predicated on understanding spatial dynamics of fish populations especially recruitment otherwise economic benefits might be wasted either by overfishing losing yield and spawning sites by wrongly assuming diff behavior or by being overly precautionary wrongly assuming gwof behavior in this case knowledge of recruitment behavior might increase allowable long term catches by ca 100 table 2 conservation of spawning sites eventually even of low productivity sites might in some cases be economically sub optimal it might however be of considerable importance when socio cultural objectives are included e g the interest of indigenous fisheries levin et al 2016 we should however be aware that applying uniform fishing mortality across sites is actually a special form of spatial management as f is forced to be similar across sites when in practice global management using tacs does not ensure that removals occur at the same proportion of the biomass across sites further research concerning migration behavior site specific productivity and spatial structures of exploited fish populations is warranted for pacific herring as well as other species levin et al 2016 as long as such crucial knowledge is missing precautionary management should aim at lower f and lower yield targets acknowledgements the authors would like to thank margaret c siple and two anonymous reviewers for numerous constructive

25221,improving fisheries management is a key challenge in addressing the united nations sustainable development goal 2 zero hunger and support goals 1 no poverty and 14 life below water however sustaining the ocean s living resources has important dimensions beyond food security such as cultural values which might be of equal importance in some settings fisheries management faces special challenges when there is a mismatch between biological units and management units e g when ecological spatial structures are not reflected in how catch limits are set this might result in overexploitation and even the loss of sub stocks we use a spatially structured ecological economic model parameterized for a pelagic schooling fish to examine how the benefits of implementing spatially differentiated fisheries management depend on biological parameters we focus on a subset of socio ecological variables i e fisheries yield present value of economic surplus and loss of spawning sites which might be linked to loss of cultural values to demonstrate that in theory ideally differentiated spatial management can be implemented without exact information about recruitment behavior for imperfectly differentiated spatial management however knowledge about recruitment behavior becomes key to avoiding economic losses and to sustaining stock structure especially when there is large spatial heterogeneity in biological parameters knowledge about variability in site specific productivity determines the expectation of achievable sustainable harvest levels further research on such ecological issues is therefore warranted both for ecological as well as economic reasons keywords ecological economic model spatial management recruitment models pacific herring precautionary approach entrainment 1 introduction populations of fishes like many species display spatial structure their dynamics are driven by spawning migrations ontogenetic habitat shifts as well as movement to feeding and overwintering sites harden jones 1968 aro 2002 secor 2002 within fish populations sub stocks may exist in some fish often with multiple spatially segregated and discrete spawning grounds and limited connectivity among them reich and dealteris 2009 for some species stocks and sub stocks may not be genetically distinguishable and can be difficult to identify as a consequence researchers working in different regions may define and use these terms inconsistently fisheries assessment and management often lack ecological or genetic detail and stock sub structure is often not considered additionally when management is spatially explicit the spatial scale of management may differ from the spatial structure of stock units cadrin and secor 2009 accordingly the international council for the exploration of the sea ices stock identification methods working group simwg ices 2016 stated that traditionally exploited stocks have been assessed and managed according to geographical features and ices subdivisions i e lines on a map in order to facilitate decision making and agreements among countries in other cases such as for pacific herring clupea pallasii management may be delineated by general spawning locations or occur at the aggregate stock level determining finer scale sub stock structure is not yet possible with currently available scientific methods overexploitation of stocks can lead to loss of spawning grounds through ecological extinction of sub stocks which could reduce total productivity and subsequently impair full recovery schmidt et al 2009 additionally the loss of sub stocks can happen in fisheries that are deemed sustainable at the stock level but in which individual sub stocks cannot sustain the localized fishing intensity that occurs for example because of differences in access costs reich and dealteris 2009 despite the appearance of large scale sustainability local depletion and related losses in potential catch are clearly inconsistent with policy goals related to sustainable fishing as well as food security and wellbeing for adjacent coastal peoples and communities e g united nations 2015 in such cases spatial management tools may thus lead to greater sustainability and improved human well being however spatial management comes with increased costs for example data needs are greater and monitoring costs are correspondingly higher additionally regulations associated with management are ostensibly more complex and may lead to increased implementation and enforcement costs detailed knowledge of fish behavior is needed to better understand the importance of spatially explicit spawning components including how fish recruit into certain sites or sub stocks the assumption of random diffusion versus other concepts e g entrainment petitgas et al 2006 2010 might considerably alter management outcomes as a broad literature on harvesting fish metapopulations has shown e g maccall et al 2018 armstrong and skonhoft 2006 bulte et al 1999 sanchirico and wilen 2001 2005 supriatna and possingham 1999 these studies typically focus on two patches connected by movement however in many cases fish populations occur in many patches and knowledge about exact spatial patterns of recruitment is not readily available or conclusions about recruitment behavior are disputed among experts thus competing assumptions need to be examined in addition to the economic benefits of fisheries much recent work has highlighted the importance of considering the ecological and socio cultural consequences of fisheries e g halpern et al 2013 tahvonen et al 2014 marshall et al 2017 careful evaluation of the costs and benefits of spatial management requires accounting for the full suite of trade offs among ecological economic and socio cultural objectives marshall et al 2017 we take a first step in this direction by evaluating trade offs between a subset of social ecological and economic objectives fisheries yield present value of economic surplus and loss of spawning sites which in some cases is linked to loss of cultural values between socio ecological economic objectives including yield present value of economic surplus and loss of spawning sites which might be linked to loss of cultural values in this analysis we use a generic spatially structured ecological economic model to explore the ecological and economic importance of knowledge about spatial patterns in harvested fish populations in order to investigate the hypothetical benefits of implementing spatially differentiated fisheries management the model that we use is heuristic and simplified motivated by the fishery for pacific herring using our generic spatially structured model we explore the consequences for fisheries management and ecosystem objectives of alternative and equally plausible spatial recruitment behaviors heterogeneity in spawning site productivity and global versus spatially explicit fisheries management regulations using this conceptual model sensu mangel et al 2001 mangel and levin 2005 we illuminate the broad consequences of these biological assumptions as related to fisheries yield and maintenance of spawning sites 2 material and methods the bio economic model has spatial structure with several in the baseline model n 50 spawning components that are partially connected by diffusion of adults and recruits among adjacent spawning sites the general set up and biological assumptions follow maccall et al 2018 stock dynamics within each site are described by a ricker type stock recruitment function in which the density independent parameter may vary spatially recruitment to the adult stock of each spawning component occurs according to one of two behavior models under the diffusion reproductive strategy diff recruits are distributed in fixed proportions among habitats near their natal habitat and subsequently tend to return to those spawning locations under the go with the older fish gwof fig 1 maccall et al 2018 strategy recruits join a school of older migrating fish repeat spawners and adopt that school s migration behavior with subsequent homing behavior following the migration path and spawning location of those older fish thus under gwof strategy first time spawners recruit to the same set of spawning sites as diff recruits but proportional to the relative abundances of repeat spawners currently using those sites maccall et al 2018 for each combination of recruitment behavior and fishing mortality we perform 100 iterations of the model each with randomly drawn spatial distributions for the density independent productivity parameter when assuming site specific variability in productivity each run simulates a 100 year projection assuring that a steady state equilibrium is reached the spawning sites are assumed to be organized around a circle and diffusion of recruits occurs to five sites i e from site i to sites i i 1 i 2 i 1 and i 2 similarly diffusion from site i 1 is to sites i 2 and i 3 as well as to sites i and i 1 returning spawners adults diffuse to three sites i e if originating at site i they can return to sites i i 1 or i 1 this assumption of periodic or circular boundary conditions avoids boundary effects the parameter l i as part of the ricker stock recruitment function denotes site specific density independent productivity mathematical notation is as follows biomass in sites i 1 n is given by the vector b t with elements b i t with circular boundaries to model this we extend the biomass vector with four extra elements set equal to the respective elements at the left and right boundaries of the vector such that b 1 b n 1 b 0 b n b n 1 b 1 b n 2 b 2 we need four such elements two to the left and two to the right to capture dispersal to the respective next and second next neighbor δ a matrix with elements δ i t α 1 2 δ δ i i 1 δ i 1 i α δ and all other entries zero describes diffusion of adult fish we set the overall survivability from natural mortality to α 0 7 and diffusion to δ 0 1 in the baseline parametrization this means that 80 of adult fish remain in their current site while 10 diffuse to the site to the left and another 10 to the site on the right including the effects of the circular boundary r t φ b t a vector of recruits with element i being the ricker stock recruitment function for site i φ i b t b i t exp l i φ β b i t having parameters β 0 01 and li as well asφ set to zero in the scenario with homogeneous sites and assigned random numbers from a uniform distribution on σ σ with σ varying between 0 and 1 or set equal to 1 in the scenario with heterogeneous site specific productivities at maximum heterogeneity the most productive sites are ca 7 4 times more productive as compared to the least productive sites we set φ such that e exp l i φ 1 1 1 this means we set φ ln exp l i ln 1 2 σ σ σ exp l d l ln 1 2 σ exp σ exp σ to keep the expected productivity for each site at the same level as for the case with fixed homogeneous site specific productivity for a particular randomly drawn set of productivity parameters the average productivity over sites can differ from the constant site specific productivity diffusion of recruits in the diff model is described by a n 4 n 4 matrix d with elements equal to zero except d i i 3 9 d i i 1 d i i 1 2 9 d i i 2 d i i 2 1 9 circular boundaries are modeled by including diffusion from sites 1 and 2 to n and n 1 and the other way around we use the n 4 n 4 matrix with two rows and two columns added at each border of the interior n n diffusion matrix to model these circular boundary conditions consequently biomasses are described by an n 4 dimensional vector where the first two elements are always identical to elements n 1 and n 2 and the last two elements are always identical toe elements 3 and 4 thus the elements 3 to n 2 are the relevant interior biomasses for the gwof model migration of recruits is described by a n 4 n 4 matrix g b t with dispersal from i to j given by g i j b t b j t b i 2 t b i 1 t b i t b i 1 t b i 2 t for all i and j i 2 i 1 i i 1 i 2 again circular boundaries are modeled by including diffusion from sites 1 and 2 to n and n 1 and the other way around as above biomass dynamics subject to harvesting are in matrix notation 1 b t 1 δ e t d r t in the diff model 2 b t 1 δ e t g e t r t in the gwof model where δ d and g are the matrices introduced above e i t 1 f i t b i t is escapement for site i at time t with fishing mortality fit 2 2 strictly speaking this is an exploitation rate as fishing mortality is in continuous time since there is a monotonic relationship between the two we use the term fishing mortality for fit i e et is the biomass remaining after harvesting and rt φ et is the recruitment produced by that biomass as an initial condition we set the biomass in all sites equal to 100 i e the biomass where the ricker stock recruitment function peaks in expectation in all of our computations the steady state was unique and globally stable thus assumptions regarding the initial biomass distribution have no impact on the steady state results yield levels can be interpreted with respect to this biomass as this is a conceptual model biomass as well as yield are handled without dimension we consider a schooling fish and set the fish price net of constant marginal harvesting costs equal to one tahvonen et al 2013 we consider the management objective to maximize the present value of economic surplus for the entire fishery for the management scenario where fishing mortality is chosen independently for each site and time step the optimization problem is 3 max e i j t 0 ρ t i 1 n b i t e i t that is to maximize the present value of yield discounted at a discount factor ρ i e the discount rate is 1 ρ ρ the model is implemented in matlab and code is available in the online supporting material we consider three scenarios for both recruitment behavior models table 1 first the model is used to compare the two alternative recruitment behavior scenarios diff and gwof while spawning sites are assumed to be homogeneous and management ignores spatial structure i e fishing mortality f is the same for all sites hereafter termed global f in this scenario the density independent parameter of the ricker stock recruitment function is pre specified the model is run for 100 years and model output is used to construct a yield curve for the f range of 0 0 6 here we ask the question how does the assumed recruitment behavior affect steady state yield and the associated fishing mortality in a second scenario management is still assumed to be global but we additionally allow for heterogeneity in spawning site productivity i e the density independent parameter may vary spatially variation in productivity involves assigning a value randomly drawn from a uniform distribution we perform 100 iterations of the model for each combination of recruitment behavior and fishing mortality as before results are used to construct yield curves over the range f 0 0 6 again we determine optimal steady state yields and economically optimal exploitation rates used here as a proxy for a management measure that limits fishing mortality such as a spatial quota additionally we calculate the number of lost spawning sites a site is defined as being lost if its biomass drops below 10 of the biomass that would produce the maximum sustainable yield for that site i e fishing at fmsy 3 3 this doesn t necessarily reflect current fisheries practice e g pacific herring fisheries where current f is assumed to be below fmsy to explore the effect of the model assumptions we perform a sensitivity analysis with respect to the number of sites n the natural survivability α and the diffusion rate δ to explore how the results depend on the parametrization of the numerical model the third scenario allows for fully spatially explicit management i e setting site specific fishing mortality f hereafter referred to as local f table 1 here the model is analytically solved for the special case of optimal local f for heterogeneous sites we also quantify potential benefits of spatially differentiated local management compared to spatially homogeneous global management by varying the degree of spatial heterogeneity of spawning sites benefits are quantified in terms of both surplus yield and loss of spawning sites we maintain the assumption that recruitment parameters are randomly drawn from a uniform distribution but vary the range of the uniform distribution keeping average productivity fixed we refer to the upper bound of the range equal to the absolute value of the lower bound as the spread of site productivities we perform 100 model iterations for each value of spread with the optimal exploitation rate computed for each site at each iteration the results are presented in three sections one for each scenario 3 results 3 1 homogeneous productivity of spawning sites the spatial recruitment mechanism i e diff versus gwof has no effect on fisheries management or ecosystem objectives if all spawning sites are equally productive no spatial structure also in terms of fishing mortality termed homogeneous in table 1 fig 2 steady state harvest follows an almost symmetric concave function with positive long term harvest for fishing mortality up to a value fcrit 0 41 4 4 in the homogeneous case equilibrium biomass is the same for all patches and described by equations 1 and 2 with exploitation rate f natural survivability α and the parameter β of the ricker function it is given by b e q 1 β 1 f ln 1 α 1 f 1 f it becomes zero when f fcrit 1 α 1 1 0 7 1 0 41 higher fishing mortality than fcrit results in stock collapse in our idealized fishery optimal yield is equal for both models and optimal fishing mortality under these assumptions is fhom 0 23 5 5 fhom is the value of f that maximizes equilibrium yield f b e q f f β 1 f l φ ln 1 α 1 f 1 f for the homogeneous case l φ 0 which is fhom 0 233 with harvest level fhom beq 15 32 for α 0 7 and β 0 01 two thirds of the maximum yield could be realized within the range of f 0 1 to f 0 35 3 2 heterogeneous spawning sites no spatial management results become more complex for the heterogeneous spawning sites scenario here the diff strategy results in a slightly higher optimal yield as compared to the diff strategy with homogeneous sites which is realized at a global exploitation rate of f 0 254 fig 2 as with homogenous productivity the steady state yield curve is symmetric and concave variability in results from the 100 iterations with randomly drawn local density independent productivity parameters is relatively large one standard deviation covers a harvest range of 13 5 17 5 near the optimal f the gwof strategy in a system with heterogeneous habitats results in markedly reduced achievable steady state harvest optimal f is lower 0 179 and the shape of the yield function becomes left skewed in this scenario optimal global f i e management without spatial differentiation depends on the biological setting assuming incorrect recruitment behavior might either lead to overfishing or to underutilization of the resource opportunity costs i e a benefit that a person could receive but gave up to take another course of action of incorrectly applying spatial management rules are relatively low see discussion the diff migration strategy results in robustness of stock components to overfishing over a wide range of fishing mortality i e up to a f of 0 3 fig 3 managing for the optimal f independent of the assumptions made regarding recruitment behavior would never deplete any spawning component however under the gwof strategy an increasing f will lead to an increasing number of collapsed sites fishing mortality producing optimal harvest in terms of biomass would lead to ca 19 of collapsed sites for the gwof hypothesis if management wrongly used the optimal f estimated based on the diff assumption this would double to almost 40 reducing the number of sites to n 20 shown in fig 4 panel a or increasing it to n 100 panel b has hardly any effect on expected outcomes but increasing the number of sites clearly reduces variability due to spatial variation in productivity reducing dispersion to δ 0 05 panel c or increasing it to δ 0 2 panel d has hardly any effect in the homogeneous setting or in the heterogeneous setting for the diff model in the gwof model reducing dispersion reduces maximum yield and increasing dispersion increases the maximum yield with less pronounced effects at fishing mortalities below or above the corresponding f msy increasing natural survivability to α 0 9 panel e shifts the fishing mortalities that generate the maximum sustainable yield and the fishing mortality where the fishery collapses in the homogeneous case to larger values and increases yields in the gwof model the peak of the yield curve becomes more pronounced at high α decreasing natural survivability to α 0 5 panel f decreases yields and shifts the fishing mortalities that generate the maximum sustainable yield and the fishing mortality where the fishery collapses in the homogeneous case to smaller values for all models except for the gwof model in the heterogeneous case in the gwof model yields decrease as well but the fishing mortality that generates the maximum sustainable yield increases 3 3 optimal local f management 3 3 1 analytical results for the idealized case of optimal local f management in which the fishing mortality is fixed for each spawning component individually the assumed recruitment behavior model does not play a role and knowledge about the recruitment behavior would accordingly not be needed for management purposes this can be shown analytically as outlined below if the biomass dynamics are sufficiently fast to exclude a corner solution the optimal solution is a constant escapement strategy the reason is that the state of the populations in all patches can be fully controlled by choosing the escapement levels and thus the condition for the optimal next period s population sizes is independent of the current population size we omit the proof which follows the standard approach in the literature e g costello and polasky 2008 with the gwof assumption optimal constant escapement levels are given by the condition 4 1 ρ e k t i 1 n j 1 n δ i j e j t g i j e t e j t exp l j β e j t condition 4 states that the marginal benefit of immediate harvest the fish price net of constant marginal harvesting costs set equal to one on the left hand side of the equation should equal the marginal benefit of leaving an extra unit of biomass in the ocean this marginal benefit is given by the expression on the right hand side of eq 4 it is the marginal increase in catches from all patches i 1 n that arises from a marginal increase in biomass of the fish stock in all patches j 1 n to which the patches i are connected by migration due to the marginal increase of the escapement e kt at site k as the benefit arises one period in the future it is discounted by the factor ρ using the fact that marginal benefits from harvesting are the same across patches this condition can be substantially simplified rearranging we obtain 5 1 ρ i 1 n δ i k g i k e t 1 β e k t exp l k β e k t j 1 n g i j e t e k t e j t exp l j β e j t ρ α 1 β e k t exp l k β e k t j 1 n e j t exp l j β e j t i 1 n g i j e t e k t ρ α 1 β e k t exp l k β e k t j k 2 k 2 e j

condition is obtained for the optimal escapement levels in the diff model we thus have the following result proposition 1 optimal spatially differentiated management is identical under the diff and gwof models human time preferences are captured in bio economic models by setting discount rates positive discount rates imply that realizing catches today is more valued than taking the same amount of fish at a later point in time this seems to be a reasonable assumption both under economic considerations as well as acknowledging the highly uncertain conditions in many fisheries it is straightforward to show that the optimal escapement in each site decreases with the discount rate i e increases with the discount factor for no discounting we obtain the corollary that all sites are harvested according to the respective site specific maximum sustainable yield if there is no discounting i e if ρ 1 proposition 2 optimal spatially differentiated management with no discounting ρ 1 is achieved when harvesting each patch according to its individual maximum sustainable yield ignoring spatial movement 3 3 2 economic benefits of applying optimal local f management we now turn to the question how much harvest might be gained if spatially differentiated management optimally adapted to local productivities could be used the potential benefits from the fishery rise with increasing spatial spread in productivity following a convex function i e local f management is increasingly rewarding if local differences in site specific productivity are pronounced when the spread of productivity reaches one mean steady state harvest could be increased by ca 15 fig 5 while no spawning components would be lost see section 3 2 the reason that yield increases with variability is that spatially differentiated management adapts to the productivity of sites and thus can take advantage of more productive sites compared to the homogeneous case with equal average productivity for the case without discounting this can be easily demonstrated analytically in this case the optimal spatially differentiated management is to harvest each patch according to its individual maximum sustainable yield ignoring spatial movement maximum equilibrium yield see footnote 6 is a convex function of site productivity as the following argument shows d 2 d l 2 f m s y β 1 f m s y l φ ln 1 α 1 f m s y 1 f m s y f d d l f m s y β 1 f m s y d f m s y d l β 1 f m s y 2 0 here fmsy is the maximum sustainable yield fishing mortality which is increasing in site productivity l to derive the first equality we have used the envelope theorem where the derivative of equilibrium yield with respect to fmsy is zero as this is exactly the value of f that maximizes equilibrium yield thus harvest from the more productive sites more than proportionally contributes to aggregate yield by contrast the mean yield decreases with spatial heterogeneity applying a spatially homogeneous exploitation rate equal to the msy level at the expected productivity for the reasons discussed in section 3 2 the benefit of spatially differentiated local management thus increases with the spread of site productivities fig 5 shows the variability across model runs as productivities are drawn randomly spatial variability can also lead to an overall reduction in catches even with local f management for the largest value of the spread the catches of the least productive site are on average over model runs 0 36 of the average catches over sites for the most productive site catches are 370 of the average over sites 4 discussion our results provide the methodological basis to quantify and evaluate potential economic and conservation benefits of applying spatially explicit fisheries management furthermore we analyze the risks associated with assuming incorrect migration behavior and quantify the potential economics gains if such knowledge becomes available our work thereby offers general insights rather than providing tactical management advice and we discuss these below we explore two contrasting scenarios to describe migrational behaviour which we consider to be simplified but plausible alternative assumptions the diff scenario is behaviorally neutral and applies basic diffusion rules founded in physics on the other hand the gwof scenario incorporates active behavior of recruits and is based on the concept of entrainment e g corten 2002 petitgas et al 2006 both the gwof and diff scenarios could result in observations for herring like stocks i e complex population structure without genetic differentiation variable migration patterns or archaeological spatial patterns of herring abundance dickey collas et al 2009 mckechnie et al 2014 the gwof behavior is consistent with traditional knowledge of pacific herring indicating that local spawning may consist of mixed or sequential waves of separate sub stocks maccall et al 2018 both migratory strategies incorporate homing to preferred spawning areas which need not be the natal site in either case in our simplified model the distribution of recruits is limited to a local window of five adjacent sites however the spatial distances over which either mechanism would operate in actual fish populations are presently unknown we have also considered symmetrical exchanges between sites how other types of spatial movement e g source sink dynamics would play out is still an open question in our model optimal local f management becomes progressively more beneficial with increasing spatial variability in productivity we estimate potential gains in yield of up to 15 in our theoretical setting under optimal local f management knowledge of the underlying recruitment behavior is not relevant each local site would be managed according to its maximum sustainable yield ignoring spatial redistribution of adults and recruits this theoretical result provides a reference point for optimal spatially differentiated management given the assumptions that the marginal net benefits of fishing are the same across patches as prices and marginal costs are assumed to be spatially homogeneous and that management is only concerned with total catch the manager may not care from which patch the catch comes the total catch is maximized by adjusting stock sizes in all patches such as to maximize surplus production before spatial movement previous work on optimal fishing under biological uncertainties suggests that levels of optimal fishing mortality are fairly robust to uncertainties in for example the parameters of the recruitment function kapaun and quaas 2013 tahvonen et al 2017 the spatial recruitment behavior would influence the optimal spatial management of the fishery if it matters from which site the catch is taken for example if prices differ transport costs matter protecting local sites for traditional harvest is a priority or distributing catch to avoid ecological implications of overharvesting individual patches is a priority however such theoretical optimal solutions for spatial management would require perfect spawning site specific implementation a condition difficult to be met in reality if optimal local f management cannot be implemented e g due to lack of administrative resources the underlying migration behavior of recruits and adult fish becomes important unfortunately migration behavior is unknown for many fish stocks and has been recognized as important and ongoing field of research mcquinn 1997 huse et al 2002 petitgas et al 2010 planque et al 2011 therefore a precautionary approach to the development of fisheries policy would be to adopt the scenario with the least negative impacts for high natural survival rates α 0 7 and α 0 9 the lowest risk is associated with the gwof migration behavior hypothesis and fishery managers would need to apply lower f values as a less productive stock is implied if the major management objective was to minimize the loss of spawning grounds a maximum f of ca 0 08 would be chosen resulting in site losses 5 fig 3 table 2 maximum yield policies under the gwof recruitment behavior assumption would allow for f 0 18 fig 2 however this relatively small increase in yield as compared to yield under f 0 08 would be accompanied by an approximately 15 loss of spawning sites fig 3 table 2 if management set f 0 23 the optimum f with diff recruitment hypothesis fig 2 while in reality fish behave according to the gwof model this would result in a loss of 35 of all spawning sites and a reduction of total catches table 2 the absolute values of fishing mortality discussed here relate to our theoretical example they will change if ecological e g natural mortality rates diffusion rates or economic e g costs conditions differ management could allow for higher f and optimal yield limits could approximately be doubled without risking the loss of any spawning grounds if biological research could verify the diff migration behavior as the underlying process therefore such quantification of potential benefits as well as the risks of adopting the wrong biological hypothesis might inform decisions on future research priorities we focused on optimal yield involving ecological and social concepts as our management objective however setting sustainable fishery harvest limits is only one element of ecosystem based fishery management ebfm marshall et al 2017 here we show that spatial structure of fish populations is linked to optimal yield regulations and that optimal yield management based on incorrect ecological assumptions can lead to overexploitation and local stock depletions spawning site loss will disproportionately affect harvesters and people from place bound communities that do not or cannot move widely to alternative sites i e small scale commercial harvesters and or those who harvest for food social ceremonial purposes there is a further hidden problem with losing individual spawning sites and that is the risk of loss of the behavior associated with that site this problem was investigated by huse et al 2010 who found that migratory knowledge begins to be lost when the fraction of repeat spawners was reduced below about 30 and destruction of the behavioral knowledge became certain at 10 nevertheless optimal yield involving ecological and social concepts remains a valuable concept as it provides an existing governance framework for the operationalization of ebfm by requiring that fisheries balance ecological economic and social goals patrick and link 2015 using optimal yield oy within an ebfm framework by definition and statute requires a multiobjective approach and a challenge in operationalizing the use of multiattribute decision tools is identifying the objectives with which to measure performance of each potential strategy patrick and link 2015 this should be a multi step process starting with first bounding the problem or essentially identifying the stakeholder groups and objectives to include in any tradeoff analyses levin et al 2016 knowing the specific social ecological and economic objectives of different stakeholders it is then possible to craft management strategies that attempt to meet these goals in the u s management system for instance msy is estimated first and subsequently quota can be reduced below msy in order to achieve other objectives patrick and link 2015 successful non spatial fisheries management e g applying uniform fishing mortality across sites should be predicated on understanding spatial dynamics of fish populations especially recruitment otherwise economic benefits might be wasted either by overfishing losing yield and spawning sites by wrongly assuming diff behavior or by being overly precautionary wrongly assuming gwof behavior in this case knowledge of recruitment behavior might increase allowable long term catches by ca 100 table 2 conservation of spawning sites eventually even of low productivity sites might in some cases be economically sub optimal it might however be of considerable importance when socio cultural objectives are included e g the interest of indigenous fisheries levin et al 2016 we should however be aware that applying uniform fishing mortality across sites is actually a special form of spatial management as f is forced to be similar across sites when in practice global management using tacs does not ensure that removals occur at the same proportion of the biomass across sites further research concerning migration behavior site specific productivity and spatial structures of exploited fish populations is warranted for pacific herring as well as other species levin et al 2016 as long as such crucial knowledge is missing precautionary management should aim at lower f and lower yield targets acknowledgements the authors would like to thank margaret c siple and two anonymous reviewers for numerous constructive

25222,in this work we describe and implement a data assimilation approach for pm10 pollution data in northern italy this was done by combining the best available information from observations and chemical transport models specifically by 1 incorporating pm10 surface daily concentrations and model results from the cams copernicus atmosphere monitoring service ensemble and 2 spreading the forecast corrections from the observation locations to the entire gridded domain covered by model forecasts by means of a data regularization approach results were verified against independent pm10 observations measured at 169 stations by local environmental protection agencies twelve months of observations were matched in time and space from january to december 2017 with air pollution model results the studied domain encompassed the po valley one of the most polluted areas in europe and that still does not meet the air quality criteria for the annual average concentration and the maximum number of exceedances allowed for the particulate matter raw model data were found to be affected by a bias with a strong seasonal dependency a large negative bias in winter and a small bias in the summer months the data assimilation approach embedded into a bayesian hierarchical approach was able to drastically reduce the bias furthermore an advanced computational approach based on the variational bayes method coupled with the minimization of the kullback leibler divergence to approximate the optimal solution made it possible to cost effectively assimilate data throughout the period under consideration by using stratified cross validation to test the accuracy of our predictions we found high out of sample r 2 0 83 and an average decrease of about two thirds of the root mean square error assimilated data were used to produce daily resolved cumulative population exposures the po valley in relation to the interim targets its defined by the world health organization accomplishes the it 2 level that is to say that the average annual concentration is lower than 50 μg m3 but it is still very far from the it 3 level corresponding to an average annual concentration of less than 30 μg m3 moreover most of the po valley still has a high number of days in which the average daily concentration is higher than 50 μg m3 well above the maximum limit of 35 days established by european and italian legislation our results demonstrate that pm10 can be reproduced reliably using this assimilation approach combining different sources of information so as to perform a thorough diagnosis of air quality over a spatially and temporally uniform area keywords particulate matter data assimilation and regularization atmospheric matter flow population exposure 1 introduction

resolution and accurate spatiotemporal estimates of all these parameters for example accurate spatiotemporal characterization of ground level ambient air pollution can be used for the identification of specific drivers of adverse air pollution health effects including multipollutant mixtures and potential effect modifiers e g synergistic effects of multiple risk factors bell et al 2004 pope et al 2009 brunekreef and holgate 2002 to investigate air pollution effects experimentally retrieved time series from monitoring networks are often used unfortunately many pollutants of interest are measured infrequently in a few locations or not at all with the typically sparse spatial coverage of air quality monitoring networks spatial variability such as the urban to rural gradient is usually poorly characterized a workaround for sparse data consists in to use a chemical transport model ctm equipped with codes for the numerical simulation of transport and chemical transformations based on coherent meteorological and emission data inputs a ctm provides complete spatial and temporal coverage on the other hand such modeling approach is computationally intensive and prone to errors due to the incomplete or erroneous specification of physical processes and initial boundary state blending ctm data with observational information can overcome at least in part the limits of spatially scattered and temporally incomplete environmental monitoring data and at the same time correct the misdiagnoses provided by ctms numerous studies are available combining different sources of information for example chen et al 2014 used an inverse distance error weighting method to adjust 36 km resolution cmaq model biases within 100 km of monitors for several pollutants and compared results with other regional estimates singh et al 2011 used cokriging combining observational data coupled with the results from tcam model simulations as a secondary explanatory variable to study air pollution in northern italy hooyberghs et al 2006 present the cokriging based rio residual interpolation model for spatial interpolation of ambient ozone concentrations from sparse monitoring points in belgium using population density as auxiliary data to remove spatial trend due to titration effects janssen et al 2008 extend the rio model to pm and nitrogen oxide using corine land cover data as an indicator for interpolation also royle and berliner 1999 propose a multivariate interpolation method to estimate the daily ozone similar to cokriging and kriging with external drift all these studies share the same basic idea combining the best from different sources of information another level of sophistication is added by the use of ensemble models to account for the range of possible solutions due to uncertainties in initial and boundary conditions physical parameterizations and numerics it has been demonstrated that impact assessments based on a single model are subject to statistical biases underestimation of the model uncertainty and consequently to excessive overconfidence in the results obtained vrugt and robinson 2007 knutti et al 2010 riccio et al 2012 as recently emerged within the aqmeii evaluation activity solazzo et al 2013 solazzo and galmarini 2016 unfortunately the practice of the ensemble modeling is rare in air quality studies and still not very widespread in this work we explore the usability of air quality ensembles in providing accurate spatiotemporal analyses combined with observational data we demonstrate how our approach can be used to

and validation of observed data most of the italian regional environmental agencies take part in this project and share pm10 nitrogen dioxide ozone and pm2 5 observations also observations from non italian countries are collected daily in this work we used the pm10 data in calicantus for the year 2017 from three regions piemonte veneto and emilia romagna moreover data from the lombardia region http www arpalombardia it sites qaria were included fig 1 shows the monitoring network data from 169 monitoring sites were available during the period under consideration before their use we checked for outliers in observational data to identify and eliminate suspicious data we applied an automated quality control procedure the procedure was applied independently to the one year time series of each site this algorithm has the following components and thresholds 1 if a monitoring site has more than 80 of missing values that site was excluded from further analysis 2 data over 500 μg m3 were rejected the temporal continuity of observations is a key indicator of data quality and two tests were implemented to identify significant outliers 1 single spike if the difference in pm10 concentration between the present day d and both the previous day d 1 or following day d 1 was greater than 200 μg m3 data for day d was discarded 2 averaged spike if the mean concentration over three consecutive days d 1 d d 1 was greater than the data in the previous d 2 or the following day d 2 by more than 200 μg m3 the data for days d 1 d d 1 were rejected 3 histogram gap check a histogram of all daily values for the year of data is compiled and then a search for large gaps in the distribution is performed if a large gap greater than 50 μg m3 when the maximum value is less than 200 μg m3 exists then all the points in the tail of the distribution beyond the gap were rejected for that site besides monitoring data another valuable source of information is the copernicus atmosphere monitoring service cams hosted by ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecasts as part of the delegation agreement with the european union cams has the overall functional objective of delivering reliable and enhanced atmospheric environmental information services to support research european environmental policy and the on going development of user specific downstream services currently cams supports the ensemble forecasting of air quality for europe at a 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution and several vertical levels starting from the surface up to 5000 m the ensemble is based on seven models namely chimere emep eurad lotos euros match mocage and silam each model provides forecasts for several key atmospheric pollutants for the next four days and forecasts are updated daily together with their previous day analysis most products are disseminated in near real time through a rest api service archived data are also available starting from october 1st 2015 more information on these services can be found at http atmosphere copernicus eu these models convey valuable information as they provide uniform spatial and temporal coverage and are the only way to predict air quality on a physical basis despite this valuable information post processing their predictions is an important step to reconcile predictions with observations and provide the a posteriori diagnosis of air quality to the best of our knowledge this process has never been attempted using cams data for northern italy 3 the data assimilation approach 3 1 background a chemical transport model ctm is a type of numerical model which typically simulates atmospheric chemistry and provides for air pollution forecasting starting from several input data e g emission and boundary conditions a ctm gives the dynamical evolution of one or more chemical species in the atmosphere x at a given time the chemical state can be compared with observations y to estimate how reliable this estimate is assuming perfect observations and model the general relationship between model predicted data and observations can be expressed as 1 y f x b f is a shorthand notation to define the relationship between observations and model predicted data in 1 b is the bias which should be added to model predicted data to explain observations of course the bias is not directly available so its estimation can be viewed as an inverse problem where the model bias at each grid point and time should be estimated from few sparse observations current methods for estimating the bias are usually formulated as the minimization of a cost function 2 j b argmin b f x b y t f x b y subject to x b 0 to avoid meaningless negative concentrations the superscript t denotes transposition so that the dot product corresponds to the square of the 2 norm of the vector in parenthesis the solution b minimizing j is assumed to best explain observations unfortunately when the fine resolution of a gridded map is introduced observations do probably not contain sufficient information to constrain well all the elements of the bias making the problem ill conditioned this means that the minimizer b if one exists might be nonunique and sensitive to small errors in measurements i e ill conditioned in the real world measurements are never exact so that solving eq 2 means fitting the bias to inexact data within an ill posed context the sensitivity of the retrieved solution to data may result in a least squares solution far away from the true solution thus the inverse mapping based on eq 2 is not suitable for ill posed problems ill posedness can be ameliorated by adding information i e regularizing to better constrain the inverse problem for example among all possible solutions we encourage smoothness we expect that the bias does not oscillate drastically from one grid point to the next and small bias corrections we expect that the model is not flawed so its first guess response is close to the true solution these conditions are mathematically equivalent to the minimization of a slightly more complex cost function j j 1 j 2 j 3 with the three contributions given by 3 j 1 ω f x b y t f x b y j 2 ϵ d b t d b j 3 δ b t b still subject to x b 0 ω weights the distance of model predicted values from observations smoothness is implied by j 2 where d is a matrix representing the curvature of the solution e g the laplacian approximated by the typical tridiagonal matrix with elements on the main diagonal equal to 2 and elements of the diagonals above and below equal to 1 and ϵ a regularisation parameter determining the weight of this smoothness constraint the preference for small bias corrections is given by j 3 where δ measures the weight of this constraint this approach is not new in atmospheric science eckhardt et al 2008 exploited a functional similar to 3 to determine the vertical profile of sulfur dioxide injection by volcanic eruptions combining satellite column measurements and inverse transport modeling seibert 2000 used a source receptor relationship matrix from back trajectories to highlight the so2 major emission areas in europe constraining the magnitude and the laplacian of the solution during the inversion process solazzo et al 2018 also exploited a similar approach for the analysis of model based ensemble data for the evaluation of population exposure and crop production to ozone and atmospheric particulate matter note that the above formulation implies numerous assumptions which are hard to be fulfilled for example the component j 1 implies uncorrelated biases but we can guess that errors also model errors are implicitly comprised within this term are correlated with neighboring values and deviations are likely to be asymmetric the use of a simple parameter ω to take into account for model deviations from observations may seem an oversimplification the justifications for such an approach are manyfold the problem becomes much easier to solve detailed error statistics are unknown anyway and practice shows that reasonable results can be obtained as well daley 1993 menke 2018 wunsch 2006 for these reasons we prefer to keep as simple as possible the regularization of the inverse problem 3 2 link to bayesian formalism inverse problems have been addressed in a variety of science and engineering applications e g image and audio analysis initial boundary inverse problem linked to heat or mass transfer seismology source identification and so on it is thus not surprising that the same methods are known with different names for example in the mathematical literature the formulation in 3 is known as tikhonov regularization after tikhonov and arsenin 1977 4 j f x b y t p 1 f x b y b b 0 t q 1 b b 0 eq 4 is a generalization of eq 3 they coincide if q 1 ϵd t d δi p 1 ωi and b 0 0 i is the identity matrix the function j can also be derived within a formal bayesian approach in the bayesian approach the apriori information on the parameters of the studied model is defined as a probability distribution on the space of models p prior the a posteriori information p post is derived by incorporating on one hand a physical theory linking the parameters to observable quantities which themselves are defined by a probability distribution and on the other the information provided by the observed data the likelihood p like the knowledge of the system state is thus updated through the bayes rule p post p like p prior a detailed description of these methods can be found in the work of tarantola 2005 tikhonov regularization with a 2 norm penalty as in eq 3 is equivalent to a gaussian prior and a gaussian likelihood 5 p like y x b p exp 1 2 f x b y t p 1 f x b y p prior b q x exp 1 2 b t q 1 b h x positiveness of the final solution is encoded in h x a multi dimensional step function which is zero for any b x and one for any b x maximization of the posterior function given by the product of 5 is therefore equivalent to minimization of the cost function j in 4 with the additional constrains on the barrier for the bias correction p prior b q x denotes that the only admissible prior values for b lie in the interval x i e to a right truncated multivariate gaussian distribution since the bias correction cannot be greater than the model values to avoid meaningless negative concentrations 3 3 the prior model and tuning parameters the application of the model in 5 requires the specification of various parameters namely ω δ and ϵ in the brute force approach they are tuned manually but many authors proposed inversion schemes to reduce the arbitrariness on their choice l curve hansen 1992 desroziers scheme desroziers et al 2005 discrepancy principle scherzer 1993 the bayesian framework provides the natural context to estimate these parameters as well instead of tuning such parameters we estimated them from the data itself using hierarchical priors to do so the bayes update rule was generalized in the following manner 6 p post b ω δ ϵ x y p like b x y ω δ ϵ p prior ω δ ϵ hparams p hprior hparams in which an additional level of complexity is added through the introduction of hyperparameters as eq 6 highlights the introduction of hyperpriors allows the full inversion with tuning parameters estimated from observations as well similarly to tipping and bishop 1999 we define the hyperprior distribution for ω in the form of a gamma distribution as 7 p ω g θ 0 ρ 0 with chosen hyperprior constants θ 0 ρ 0 analogously it is possible to choose a gamma distribution as prior for δ and ϵ 8 p δ g ξ 0 η 0 p ϵ g α 0 β 0 note that more complex covariance structures have been proposed to cope better with the full covariance matrix of measurements ganesan et al 2014 proposed a model for non diagonal entries using exponential decay with a common autocorrelation timescale parameter weighted by estimated diagonal entries a similar model was also used by henne et al 2016 a model of only diagonal structure of the covariance matrix has been proposed by tipping 2001 to favor sparse solutions we preferred to take the hyperpriors as simple as possible because in doing so we have already obtained encouraging results as will be shown in section 4 for hyperprior constants we choose parameters to cover all possible values setting θ 0 ρ 0 ξ 0 η 0 α 0 β 0 10 2 this allows parameters to vary in the range circa 1 100 that we tested to be able to avoid numerical instabilities and at the same time sufficiently non informative 3 4 the computational approach estimation of unknown parameters can be obtained in different manners e g solution of the linear system of equations obtained by the differentiation of j menke 2018 markov chain monte carlo gilks et al 1995 iterative methods e g ista of fista daubechies et al 2004 beck and teboulle 2009 and many others a markov chain approach may be computationally cumbersome especially if a large number of maps spanning over a long time period should be inverted in this work we found that a viable and fast solution can be achieved using the variational bayes method bishop 2006 following this methodology we seek a posterior distribution in a very specific form satisfying posterior conditional independence 9 p b ω δ ϵ x y p b x y ω ˆ δ ˆ ϵ ˆ p ω x y δ ˆ ϵ ˆ p δ x y ω ˆ ϵ ˆ p ϵ x y δ ˆ ω ˆ the best approximation is defined as a minimizer of the kullback leibler divergence kullback and leibler 1951 between the solution and the hypothetical true posterior the choice of this form is motivated by the simplicity of evaluation and experience indicating 9 a very good approximation for linear models bishop 2006 values for b and ω δ ϵ are calculated from the minimization of the kullback leibler divergence for each hour and model in eq 9 hat stressed variables indicate the corresponding expected values of course each one depends on the expected values of other variables so that an iterative procedure is needed to solve 9 we chose the em expectation maximization algorithm which is guaranteed to converge for convex problems boyd and vandenberghe 2004 augmented with a projection step based on the truncated multivariate gaussian distribution to avoid negative concentrations 3 5 validation and assessment for evaluation cross validation was performed using 25 combinations of training 80 and validation 20 data sets validation sets were obtained by taking a stratified random sample using sampling probabilities based on the tabulation of pm10 categories 0 24 9 25 49 9 50 74 9 75 99 9 and 100 μg m3 or more resulting in concentrations in each validation set having the same distribution as the overall dataset the performance was calculated averaging over all the 25 combinations to judge the quality of an estimate it is also necessary to know the uncertainty associated with each estimated parameter and how this uncertainty is reflected in predicted concentrations a key advantage of the bayesian approach is the flexibility with which posterior inferences about parameters and predicted concentrations can be summarized to this end eq 6 can be used to explore the range of variability of each parameter i e a confidence interval and to estimate the posterior predictive distribution that is 10 p y x y b ω δ ϵ p y x y b ω δ ϵ p post b ω δ ϵ x y db d ω d δ d ϵ the distribution of predicted data y based on observed ones p y x y simulates new predicted values accounting for uncertainty about parameters since it is calculated by marginalizing the distribution of y given b ω δ ϵ over the posterior distribution the usefulness of eq 10 is twofold first if the model fits properly then replicated data should look similar to observed data to put it another way the observed data should look plausible under the posterior predictive distribution this is a self consistency check any systematic differences between the simulations and the data indicate potential failings of the model secondly eq 10 says how parameter uncertainties are reflected onto replicated data so the posterior predictive distribution can be basically used to assess how the variability about parameters affects simulated concentrations as will be shown in section 4 2 4 results 4 1 performance of the assimilation procedure a first insight into the performance of raw model values can be achieved from fig 2 we used 0h24h model predictions i e predictions for the next day bi linearly interpolated at monitoring sites a strong seasonal dependence is apparent with largest biases of up 30 μg m3 in january to about 5 μg m3 in late summer only in a few cases the monthly bias is slightly positive this is an expected result as the information provided by cams models corresponds to the background values which are representative of relatively large surface areas typically 100 km2 and they are unable to capture the gradients associated with high variability but there could also be specific causes including 1 the underestimate of primary pm emissions 2 incorrect representation of secondary organic aerosols soas 3 incorrect lateral boundary profiles 4 uncertainties of meteorological inputs related to meteorology chemistry coupling e g the planetary boundary layer height and eddy diffusivity parameterizations anyway fig 2 shows that the raw data cannot be used as such and that they can hardly be utilized to predict the worst pollution episodes to verify the extent to which the assimilation procedure is able to correct forecasts observations from the training set were assimilated into each model and results compared with the validation set simulating the evaluation of the quality of the predicted values at locations without measurements this procedure was repeated several times as explained in section 3 5 and finally results were averaged so as to include a large part of measurements in the validation set the results of the cross validation procedure were described by several statistical indicators the indicators used were the root mean squared error rmse bias mean absolute error mae and pearson correlation coefficient cc table 1 shows the statistical results obtained before and after the assimilation procedure model biases from raw values averaged on an annual base span from about 8 0 μg m3 for chimere and silam to 20 μg m3 for mocage but the assimilation procedure significantly improve over the raw forecasts damping the bias almost completely also the maes and the rmses are reduced to about half of the initial values table 1 also shows the performance of the ensemble of corrected results in this work the ensemble data are calculated as the simple arithmetic average of model results over each spatial and temporal location as can be seen there is an additional advantage induced by the use of the ensemble all the statistical indexes of the ensemble have performance always better than those of the individual models the same it not always true for raw data fig 3 shows the scatterplot between observations and corrected ensemble data for the validation set the r 2 value from a linear fit of 0 83 shows that corrected ensemble data are a reasonable predictor for observations these results are much better than those obtained by beelen et al 2009 where only a moderate amount of variability was explained using several meteorological and landuse related variables as predictors in a kriging context it can also be seen that only a few outliers are present i e the assimilation procedure is able to generate data that are consistent with observed ones this was also confirmed by posterior checks calculated by eq 10 another aspect of the post processing procedure is its impact on large forecast errors fig 4 shows the distribution of pm10 errors for the raw and corrected forecasts again for the full year the distribution of the raw errors for all the models shows a large skewness towards high negative errors due to the tendency to underestimation with frequent errors greater than 20 μg m3 in contrast the corrected forecasts have a close to gaussian shape almost symmetric about zero error and with a much sharper peak around zero error figures in fig 5 break the mae into bins of the observed pm10 magnitude the improvement occurs for all concentration classes and even for infrequent very large pm10 values for example there are rare occurrences of large observed pm10 events 100 μg m3 which are usually the hardest to simulate but it is found to have reductions of 50 in the associated errors 4 2 pm10 annual concentration and uncertainties the european legislation directive 2008 50 ec dictates the air quality limits with reference also to pm10 this directive has also been implemented by italian legislation and establishes a pm10 daily mean value of 50 μg m3 not to be exceeded more than 35 times in a year and the pm10 annual mean value not to exceed 40 μg m3 for the protection of human health using the corrected ensemble data helps to generate maps of pm10 concentrations this is shown in fig 6 unfortunately as the figure clearly demonstrates the limit for the protection of human health can hardly be respected for a large part of northern italy the domain averaged annual concentration is 30 μg m3 with peaks greater than 40 μg m3 for the central part corresponding to the strongly urbanized milan bergamo brescia conurbation apart from mountainous areas the central part of the domain i e the whole po valley presents annual average values close to or even exceeding the limit value of 40 μg m3 confirming the data already published for the year 2015 see map 4 2 in eea 2017 when the annual limits were violated by large cities in italy as well as in some areas of france spain poland and bulgaria eea 2017 this work substantiates and integrates the experimental information already available interpolating the pm10 concentrations on the whole area in question with the help of the cams data it is useless to add that if the raw model data were used even if combined together in an ensemble the average annual concentrations would be greatly underestimated the bayesian framework as explained in section 3 5 also provides an estimate of the uncertainty eq 10 can be used to verify how the uncertainty on the parameters is reflected in the estimate of the replicated concentrations fig 6 shows the 2 5th and 97 5th percentile of annual averaged pm10 concentration even if the 2 5th percentile were used the annual averaged pm10 values in the po valley would still remain close to the limit value showing that it is difficult to doubt that this limit is not exceeded in the light of results from the interpolation process finally given pm10 daily values it is possible to estimate the number of exceedances fig 7 shows the number of exceedances of the daily average of 50 μg m3 it must be remembered that european legislation sets the maximum number of exceedances for this threshold to 35 days per year but it is largely exceeded throughout the po valley with peaks of more than three months 5 population exposure to pm10 the latest report from the world health organization who world health and organization 2006 encouraged countries to consider adopting an increasingly stringent set of standards to protect the population s exposure to pm to assist this process three interim target it values and an air quality guideline aqg were suggested for which an increased mortality due to pm air pollution is expected based on current scientific findings ostro et al 2009 spira cohen et al 2011 pope et al 2002 an annual mean pm10 concentration of 70 μg m3 is selected as the it 1 level this level corresponds to the highest mean concentrations reported in studies of long term health effects e g cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality the it 2 level is set at 50 μg m3 and is likely to be associated with significant health impacts from both long term and daily exposures to pm10 but would reduce the health risks of long term exposure by about 6 relative to the it 1 value the recommended it 3 30 μg m3 places even greater weight on the likelihood of significant effects associated with long term exposures in addition to these levels the who recommends an aqg of 20 μg m3 which is the lower end of the range over which significant effects on survival were observed in the american cancer society s study pope et al 2002 finally as already mentioned italian legislation sets a limit of 40 μg m3 as an annual average concentration not to be exceeded table 2 gives the population exposure frequency distribution for the range of concentrations encompassing these thresholds as well as the corresponding population weighted concentrations for northern italy the it 1 and it 2 targets are fully met the small fraction of the population exposed to an average annual concentration higher than 40 μg m3 is probably not significant since the 95 confidence interval includes the zero value the majority of the population about two thirds is exposed to a concentration between 30 and 40 μg m3 with an average population weighted concentration of about 35 μg m3 and the remaining part at an average concentration of about 26 μg m3 the geographical distribution of these zones is mapped in fig 8 showing that the largest impact is found in the central part of po valley only remote mountainous areas can be considered unpolluted 6 conclusions in this study we show that our data assimilation procedure is suitable to estimate pm10 in northern italy model results from the cams data available in the public domain were used as covariates to spread information from observation sites to areas not covered by any monitoring station this allowed diagnosing in a uniform way from a spatial and temporal point of view the concentration of atmospheric particulate matter the bayesian hierarchical approach allowed to estimate the free parameters from the inverse model from the data themselves avoiding arbitrary choices the cross validation procedure supported the statistical evidence for the good predictive quality of the assimilation process with high correlations and low root mean squared errors for the validation dataset the assessment of population exposure evidenced that the who it 1 and it 2 targets are fully accomplished but the annual average concentration is still well above the it 3 targets i e 30 μg m3 and the number of daily concentrations often exceed the maximum allowed value over a large part of the po valley we wish to emphasize that our approach allows evaluating the short and long term human exposure that can be used to study both the acute and chronic effects of atmospheric particles furthermore it can easily be extended to other air pollutants as well acknowledgements the authors thank the environmental agencies providing data arpa veneto arpa piemonte and arpa emilia romagna and the calicantus staff the authors are either grateful to the cams service for having provided model ensemble data this work contains modified copernicus atmosphere monitoring

25222,in this work we describe and implement a data assimilation approach for pm10 pollution data in northern italy this was done by combining the best available information from observations and chemical transport models specifically by 1 incorporating pm10 surface daily concentrations and model results from the cams copernicus atmosphere monitoring service ensemble and 2 spreading the forecast corrections from the observation locations to the entire gridded domain covered by model forecasts by means of a data regularization approach results were verified against independent pm10 observations measured at 169 stations by local environmental protection agencies twelve months of observations were matched in time and space from january to december 2017 with air pollution model results the studied domain encompassed the po valley one of the most polluted areas in europe and that still does not meet the air quality criteria for the annual average concentration and the maximum number of exceedances allowed for the particulate matter raw model data were found to be affected by a bias with a strong seasonal dependency a large negative bias in winter and a small bias in the summer months the data assimilation approach embedded into a bayesian hierarchical approach was able to drastically reduce the bias furthermore an advanced computational approach based on the variational bayes method coupled with the minimization of the kullback leibler divergence to approximate the optimal solution made it possible to cost effectively assimilate data throughout the period under consideration by using stratified cross validation to test the accuracy of our predictions we found high out of sample r 2 0 83 and an average decrease of about two thirds of the root mean square error assimilated data were used to produce daily resolved cumulative population exposures the po valley in relation to the interim targets its defined by the world health organization accomplishes the it 2 level that is to say that the average annual concentration is lower than 50 μg m3 but it is still very far from the it 3 level corresponding to an average annual concentration of less than 30 μg m3 moreover most of the po valley still has a high number of days in which the average daily concentration is higher than 50 μg m3 well above the maximum limit of 35 days established by european and italian legislation our results demonstrate that pm10 can be reproduced reliably using this assimilation approach combining different sources of information so as to perform a thorough diagnosis of air quality over a spatially and temporally uniform area keywords particulate matter data assimilation and regularization atmospheric matter flow population exposure 1 introduction

and dockery 2006 shea et al 2008 for all these reasons aerosols are of central importance for atmospheric chemistry and physics the biosphere climate and public health the primary parameters that determine the environmental and health effects of aerosol particles are their concentration size structure and chemical composition investigations of ambient air pollution effects rely on high resolution and accurate spatiotemporal estimates of all these parameters for example accurate spatiotemporal characterization of ground level ambient air pollution can be used for the identification of specific drivers of adverse air pollution health effects including multipollutant mixtures and potential effect modifiers e g synergistic effects of multiple risk factors bell et al 2004 pope et al 2009 brunekreef and holgate 2002 to investigate air pollution effects experimentally retrieved time series from monitoring networks are often used unfortunately many pollutants of interest are measured infrequently in a few locations or not at all with the typically sparse spatial coverage of air quality monitoring networks spatial variability such as the urban to rural gradient is usually poorly characterized a workaround for sparse data consists in to use a chemical transport model ctm equipped with codes for the numerical simulation of transport and chemical transformations based on coherent meteorological and emission data inputs a ctm provides complete spatial and temporal coverage on the other hand such modeling approach is computationally intensive and prone to errors due to the incomplete or erroneous specification of physical processes and initial boundary state blending ctm data with observational information can overcome at least in part the limits of spatially scattered and temporally incomplete environmental monitoring data and at the same time correct the misdiagnoses provided by ctms numerous studies are available combining different sources of information for example chen et al 2014 used an inverse distance error weighting method to adjust 36 km resolution cmaq model biases within 100 km of monitors for several pollutants and compared results with other regional estimates singh et al 2011 used cokriging combining observational data coupled with the results from tcam model simulations as a secondary explanatory variable to study air pollution in northern italy hooyberghs et al 2006 present the cokriging based rio residual interpolation model for spatial interpolation of ambient ozone concentrations from sparse monitoring points in belgium using population density as auxiliary data to remove spatial trend due to titration effects janssen et al 2008 extend the rio model to pm and nitrogen oxide using corine land cover data as an indicator for interpolation also royle and berliner 1999 propose a multivariate interpolation method to estimate the daily ozone similar to cokriging and kriging with external drift all these studies share the same basic idea combining the best from different sources of information another level of sophistication is added by the use of ensemble models to account for the range of possible solutions due to uncertainties in initial and boundary conditions physical parameterizations and numerics it has been demonstrated that impact assessments based on a single model are subject to statistical biases underestimation of the model uncertainty and consequently to excessive overconfidence in the results obtained vrugt and robinson 2007 knutti et al 2010 riccio et al 2012 as recently emerged within the aqmeii evaluation activity solazzo et al 2013 solazzo and galmarini 2016 unfortunately the practice of the ensemble modeling is rare in air quality studies and still not very widespread in this work we explore the usability of air quality ensembles in providing accurate spatiotemporal analyses combined with observational data we demonstrate how our approach can be used to

each site this algorithm has the following components and thresholds 1 if a monitoring site has more than 80 of missing values that site was excluded from further analysis 2 data over 500 μg m3 were rejected the temporal continuity of observations is a key indicator of data quality and two tests were implemented to identify significant outliers 1 single spike if the difference in pm10 concentration between the present day d and both the previous day d 1 or following day d 1 was greater than 200 μg m3 data for day d was discarded 2 averaged spike if the mean concentration over three consecutive days d 1 d d 1 was greater than the data in the previous d 2 or the following day d 2 by more than 200 μg m3 the data for days d 1 d d 1 were rejected 3 histogram gap check a histogram of all daily values for the year of data is compiled and then a search for large gaps in the distribution is performed if a large gap greater than 50 μg m3 when the maximum value is less than 200 μg m3 exists then all the points in the tail of the distribution beyond the gap were rejected for that site besides monitoring data another valuable source of information is the copernicus atmosphere monitoring service cams hosted by ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecasts as part of the delegation agreement with the european union cams has the overall functional objective of delivering reliable and enhanced atmospheric environmental information services to support research european environmental policy and the on going development of user specific downstream services currently cams supports the ensemble forecasting of air quality for europe at a 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution and several vertical levels starting from the surface up to 5000 m the ensemble is based on seven models namely chimere emep eurad lotos euros match mocage and silam each model provides forecasts for several key atmospheric pollutants for the next four days and forecasts are updated daily together with their previous day analysis most products are disseminated in near real time through a rest api service archived data are also available starting from october 1st 2015 more information on these services can be found at http atmosphere copernicus eu these models convey valuable information as they provide uniform spatial and temporal coverage and are the only way to predict air quality on a physical basis despite this valuable information post processing their predictions is an important step to reconcile predictions with observations and provide the a posteriori diagnosis of air quality to the best of our knowledge this process has never been attempted using cams data for northern italy 3 the data assimilation approach 3 1 background a chemical transport model ctm is a type of numerical model which typically simulates atmospheric chemistry and provides for air pollution forecasting starting from several input data e g emission and boundary conditions a ctm gives the dynamical evolution of one or more chemical species in the atmosphere x at a given time the chemical state can be compared with observations y to estimate how reliable this estimate is assuming perfect observations and model the general relationship between model predicted data and observations can be expressed as 1 y f x b f is a shorthand notation to define the relationship between observations and model predicted data in 1 b is the bias which should be added to model predicted data to explain observations of course the bias is not directly available so its estimation can be viewed as an inverse problem where the model bias at each grid point and time should be estimated from few sparse observations current methods for estimating the bias are usually formulated as the minimization of a cost function 2 j b argmin b f x b y t f x b y subject to x b 0 to avoid meaningless negative concentrations the superscript t denotes transposition so that the dot product corresponds to the square of the 2 norm of the vector in parenthesis the solution b minimizing j is assumed to best explain observations unfortunately when the fine resolution of a gridded map is introduced observations do probably not contain sufficient information to constrain well all the elements of the bias making the problem ill conditioned this means that the minimizer b if one exists might be nonunique and sensitive to small errors in measurements i e ill conditioned in the real world measurements are never exact so that solving eq 2 means fitting the bias to inexact data within an ill posed context the sensitivity of the retrieved solution to data may result in a least squares solution far away from the true solution thus the inverse mapping based on eq 2 is not suitable for ill posed problems ill posedness can be ameliorated by adding information i e regularizing to better constrain the inverse problem for example among all possible solutions we encourage smoothness we expect that the bias does not oscillate drastically from one grid point to the next and small bias corrections we expect that the model is not flawed so its first guess response is close to the true solution these conditions are mathematically equivalent to the minimization of a slightly more complex cost function j j 1 j 2 j 3 with the three contributions given by 3 j 1 ω f x b y t f x b y j 2 ϵ d b t d b j 3 δ b t b still subject to x b 0 ω weights the distance of model predicted values from observations smoothness is implied by j 2 where d is a matrix representing the curvature of the solution e g the laplacian approximated by the typical tridiagonal matrix with elements on the main diagonal equal to 2 and elements of the diagonals above and below equal to 1 and ϵ a regularisation parameter determining the weight of this smoothness constraint the preference for small bias corrections is given by j 3 where δ measures the weight of this constraint this approach is not new in atmospheric science eckhardt et al 2008 exploited a functional similar to 3 to determine the vertical profile of sulfur dioxide injection by volcanic eruptions combining satellite column measurements and inverse transport modeling seibert 2000 used a source receptor relationship matrix from back trajectories to highlight the so2 major emission areas in europe constraining the magnitude and the laplacian of the solution during the inversion process solazzo et al 2018 also exploited a similar approach for the analysis of model based ensemble data for the evaluation of population exposure and crop production to ozone and atmospheric particulate matter note that the above formulation implies numerous assumptions which are hard to be fulfilled for example the component j 1 implies uncorrelated biases but we can guess that errors also model errors are implicitly comprised within this term are correlated with neighboring values and deviations are likely to be asymmetric the use of a simple parameter ω to take into account for model deviations from observations may seem an oversimplification the justifications for such an approach are manyfold the problem becomes much easier to solve detailed error statistics are unknown anyway and practice shows that reasonable results can be obtained as well daley 1993 menke 2018 wunsch 2006 for these reasons we prefer to keep as simple as possible the regularization of the inverse problem 3 2 link to bayesian formalism inverse problems have been addressed in a variety of science and engineering applications e g image and audio analysis initial boundary inverse problem linked to heat or mass transfer seismology source identification and so on it is thus not surprising that the same methods are known with different names for example in the mathematical literature the formulation in 3 is known as tikhonov regularization after tikhonov and arsenin 1977 4 j f x b y t p 1 f x b y b b 0 t q 1 b b 0 eq 4 is a generalization of eq 3 they coincide if q 1 ϵd t d δi p 1 ωi and b 0 0 i is the identity matrix the function j can also be derived within a formal bayesian approach in the bayesian approach the apriori information on the parameters of the studied model is defined as a probability distribution on the space of models p prior the a posteriori information p post is derived by incorporating on one hand a physical theory linking the parameters to observable quantities which themselves are defined by a probability distribution and on the other the information provided by the observed data the likelihood p like the knowledge of the system state is thus updated through the bayes rule p post p like p prior a detailed description of these methods can be found in the work of tarantola 2005 tikhonov regularization with a 2 norm penalty as in eq 3 is equivalent to a gaussian prior and a gaussian likelihood 5 p like y x b p exp 1 2 f x b y t p 1 f x b y p prior b q x exp 1 2 b t q 1 b h x positiveness of the final solution is encoded in h x a multi dimensional step function which is zero for any b x and one for any b x maximization of the posterior function given by the product of 5 is therefore equivalent to minimization of the cost function j in 4 with the additional constrains on the barrier for the bias correction p prior b q x denotes that the only admissible prior values for b lie in the interval x i e to a right truncated multivariate gaussian distribution since the bias correction cannot be greater than the model values to avoid meaningless negative concentrations 3 3 the prior model and tuning parameters the application of the model in 5 requires the specification of various parameters namely ω δ and ϵ in the brute force approach they are tuned manually but many authors proposed inversion schemes to reduce the arbitrariness on their choice l curve hansen 1992 desroziers scheme desroziers et al 2005 discrepancy principle scherzer 1993 the bayesian framework provides the natural context to estimate these parameters as well instead of tuning such parameters we estimated them from the data itself using hierarchical priors to do so the bayes update rule was generalized in the following manner 6 p post b ω δ ϵ x y p like b x y ω δ ϵ p prior ω δ ϵ hparams p hprior hparams in which an additional level of complexity is added through the introduction of hyperparameters as eq 6 highlights the introduction of hyperpriors allows the full inversion with tuning parameters estimated from observations as well similarly to tipping and bishop 1999 we define the hyperprior distribution for ω in the form of a gamma distribution as 7 p ω g θ 0 ρ 0 with chosen hyperprior constants θ 0 ρ 0 analogously it is possible to choose a gamma distribution as prior for δ and ϵ 8 p δ g ξ 0 η 0 p ϵ g α 0 β 0 note that more complex covariance structures have been proposed to cope better with the full covariance matrix of measurements ganesan et al 2014 proposed a model for non diagonal entries using exponential decay with a common autocorrelation timescale parameter weighted by estimated diagonal entries a similar model was also used by henne et al 2016 a model of only diagonal structure of the covariance matrix has been proposed by tipping 2001 to favor sparse solutions we preferred to take the hyperpriors as simple as possible because in doing so we have already obtained encouraging results as will be shown in section 4 for hyperprior constants we choose parameters to cover all possible values setting θ 0 ρ 0 ξ 0 η 0 α 0 β 0 10 2 this allows parameters to vary in the range circa 1 100 that we tested to be able to avoid numerical instabilities and at the same time sufficiently non informative 3 4 the computational approach estimation of unknown parameters can be obtained in different manners e g solution of the linear system of equations obtained by the differentiation of j menke 2018 markov chain monte carlo gilks et al 1995 iterative methods e g ista of fista daubechies et al 2004 beck and teboulle 2009 and many others a markov chain approach may be computationally cumbersome especially if a large number of maps spanning over a long time period should be inverted in this work we found that a viable and fast solution can be achieved using the variational bayes method bishop 2006 following this methodology we seek a posterior distribution in a very specific form satisfying posterior conditional independence 9 p b ω δ ϵ x y p b x y ω ˆ δ ˆ ϵ ˆ p ω x y δ ˆ ϵ ˆ p δ x y ω ˆ ϵ ˆ p ϵ x y δ ˆ ω ˆ the best approximation is defined as a minimizer of the kullback leibler divergence kullback and leibler 1951 between the solution and the hypothetical true posterior the choice of this form is motivated by the simplicity of evaluation and experience indicating 9 a very good approximation for linear models bishop 2006 values for b and ω δ ϵ are calculated from the minimization of the kullback leibler divergence for each hour and model in eq 9 hat stressed variables indicate the corresponding expected values of course each one depends on the expected values of other variables so that an iterative procedure is needed to solve 9 we chose the em expectation maximization algorithm which is guaranteed to converge for convex problems boyd and vandenberghe 2004 augmented with a projection step based on the truncated multivariate gaussian distribution to avoid negative concentrations 3 5 validation and assessment for evaluation cross validation was performed using 25 combinations of training 80 and validation 20 data sets validation sets were obtained by taking a stratified random sample using sampling probabilities based on the tabulation of pm10 categories 0 24 9 25 49 9 50 74 9 75 99 9 and 100 μg m3 or more resulting in concentrations in each validation set having the same distribution as the overall dataset the performance was calculated averaging over all the 25 combinations to judge the quality of an estimate it is also necessary to know the uncertainty associated with each estimated parameter and how this uncertainty is reflected in predicted concentrations a key advantage of the bayesian approach is the flexibility with which posterior inferences about parameters and predicted concentrations can be summarized to this end eq 6 can be used to explore the range of variability of each parameter i e a confidence interval and to estimate the posterior predictive distribution that is 10 p y x y b ω δ ϵ p y x y b ω δ ϵ p post b ω δ ϵ x y db d ω d δ d ϵ the distribution of predicted data y based on observed ones p y x y simulates new predicted values accounting for uncertainty about parameters since it is calculated by marginalizing the distribution of y given b ω δ ϵ over the posterior distribution the usefulness of eq 10 is twofold first if the model fits properly then replicated data should look similar to observed data to put it another way the observed data should look plausible under the posterior predictive distribution this is a self consistency check any systematic differences between the simulations and the data indicate potential failings of the model secondly eq 10 says how parameter uncertainties are reflected onto replicated data so the posterior predictive distribution can be basically used to assess how the variability about parameters affects simulated concentrations as will be shown in section 4 2 4 results 4 1 performance of the assimilation procedure a first insight into the performance of raw model values can be achieved from fig 2 we used 0h24h model predictions i e predictions for the next day bi linearly interpolated at monitoring sites a strong seasonal dependence is apparent with largest biases of up 30 μg m3 in january to about 5 μg m3 in late summer only in a few cases the monthly bias is slightly positive this is an expected result as the information provided by cams models corresponds to the background values which are representative of relatively large surface areas typically 100 km2 and they are unable to capture the gradients associated with high variability but there could also be specific causes including 1 the underestimate of primary pm emissions 2 incorrect representation of secondary organic aerosols soas 3 incorrect lateral boundary profiles 4 uncertainties of meteorological inputs related to meteorology chemistry coupling e g the planetary boundary layer height and eddy diffusivity parameterizations anyway fig 2 shows that the raw data cannot be used as such and that they can hardly be utilized to predict the worst pollution episodes to verify the extent to which the assimilation procedure is able to correct forecasts observations from the training set were assimilated into each model and results compared with the validation set simulating the evaluation of the quality of the predicted values at locations without measurements this procedure was repeated several times as explained in section 3 5 and finally results were averaged so as to include a large part of measurements in the validation set the results of the cross validation procedure were described by several statistical indicators the indicators used were the root mean squared error rmse bias mean absolute error mae and pearson correlation coefficient cc table 1 shows the statistical results obtained before and after the assimilation procedure model biases from raw values averaged on an annual base span from about 8 0 μg m3 for chimere and silam to 20 μg m3 for mocage but the assimilation procedure significantly improve over the raw forecasts damping the bias almost completely also the maes and the rmses are reduced to about half of the initial values table 1 also shows the performance of the ensemble of corrected results in this work the ensemble data are calculated as the simple arithmetic average of model results over each spatial and temporal location as can be seen there is an additional advantage induced by the use of the ensemble all the statistical indexes of the ensemble have performance always better than those of the individual models the same it not always true for raw data fig 3 shows the scatterplot between observations and corrected ensemble data for the validation set the r 2 value from a linear fit of 0 83 shows that corrected ensemble data are a reasonable predictor for observations these results are much better than those obtained by beelen et al 2009 where only a moderate amount of variability was explained using several meteorological and landuse related variables as predictors in a kriging context it can also be seen that only a few outliers are present i e the assimilation procedure is able to generate data that are consistent with observed ones this was also confirmed by posterior checks calculated by eq 10 another aspect of the post processing procedure is its impact on large forecast errors fig 4 shows the distribution of pm10 errors for the raw and corrected forecasts again for the full year the distribution of the raw errors for all the models shows a large skewness towards high negative errors due to the tendency to underestimation with frequent errors greater than 20 μg m3 in contrast the corrected forecasts have a close to gaussian shape almost symmetric about zero error and with a much sharper peak around zero error figures in fig 5 break the mae into bins of the observed pm10 magnitude the improvement occurs for all concentration classes and even for infrequent very large pm10 values for example there are rare occurrences of large observed pm10 events 100 μg m3 which are usually the hardest to simulate but it is found to have reductions of 50 in the associated errors 4 2 pm10 annual concentration and uncertainties the european legislation directive 2008 50 ec dictates the air quality limits with reference also to pm10 this directive has also been implemented by italian legislation and establishes a pm10 daily mean value of 50 μg m3 not to be exceeded more than 35 times in a year and the pm10 annual mean value not to exceed 40 μg m3 for the protection of human health using the corrected ensemble data helps to generate maps of pm10 concentrations this is shown in fig 6 unfortunately as the figure clearly demonstrates the limit for the protection of human health can hardly be respected for a large part of northern italy the domain averaged annual concentration is 30 μg m3 with peaks greater than 40 μg m3 for the central part corresponding to the strongly urbanized milan bergamo brescia conurbation apart from mountainous areas the central part of the domain i e the whole po valley presents annual average values close to or even exceeding the limit value of 40 μg m3 confirming the data already published for the year 2015 see map 4 2 in eea 2017 when the annual limits were violated by large cities in italy as well as in some areas of france spain poland and bulgaria eea 2017 this work substantiates and integrates the experimental information already available interpolating the pm10 concentrations on the whole area in question with the help of the cams data it is useless to add that if the raw model data were used even if combined together in an ensemble the average annual concentrations would be greatly underestimated the bayesian framework as explained in section 3 5 also provides an estimate of the uncertainty eq 10 can be used to verify how the uncertainty on the parameters is reflected in the estimate of the replicated concentrations fig 6 shows the 2 5th and 97 5th percentile of annual averaged pm10 concentration even if the 2 5th percentile were used the annual averaged pm10 values in the po valley would still remain close to the limit value showing that it is difficult to doubt that this limit is not exceeded in the light of results from the interpolation process finally given pm10 daily values it is possible to estimate the number of exceedances fig 7 shows the number of exceedances of the daily average of 50 μg m3 it must be remembered that european legislation sets the maximum number of exceedances for this threshold to 35 days per year but it is largely exceeded throughout the po valley with peaks of more than three months 5 population exposure to pm10 the latest report from the world health organization who world health and organization 2006 encouraged countries to consider adopting an increasingly stringent set of standards to protect the population s exposure to pm to assist this process three interim target it values and an air quality guideline aqg were suggested for which an increased mortality due to pm air pollution is expected based on current scientific findings ostro et al 2009 spira cohen et al 2011 pope et al 2002 an annual mean pm10 concentration of 70 μg m3 is selected as the it 1 level this level corresponds to the highest mean concentrations reported in studies of long term health effects e g cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality the it 2 level is set at 50 μg m3 and is likely to be associated with significant health impacts from both long term and daily exposures to pm10 but would reduce the health risks of long term exposure by about 6 relative to the it 1 value the recommended it 3 30 μg m3 places even greater weight on the likelihood of significant effects associated with long term exposures in addition to these levels the who recommends an aqg of 20 μg m3 which is the lower end of the range over which significant effects on survival were observed in the american cancer society s study pope et al 2002 finally as already mentioned italian legislation sets a limit of 40 μg m3 as an annual average concentration not to be exceeded table 2 gives the population exposure frequency distribution for the range of concentrations encompassing these thresholds as well as the corresponding population weighted concentrations for northern italy the it 1 and it 2 targets are fully met the small fraction of the population exposed to an average annual concentration higher than 40 μg m3 is probably not significant since the 95 confidence interval includes the zero value the majority of the population about two thirds is exposed to a concentration between 30 and 40 μg m3 with an average population weighted concentration of about 35 μg m3 and the remaining part at an average concentration of about 26 μg m3 the geographical distribution of these zones is mapped in fig 8 showing that the largest impact is found in the central part of po valley only remote mountainous areas can be considered unpolluted 6 conclusions in this study we show that our data assimilation procedure is suitable to estimate pm10 in northern italy model results from the cams data available in the public domain were used as covariates to spread information from observation sites to areas not covered by any monitoring station this allowed diagnosing in a uniform way from a spatial and temporal point of view the concentration of atmospheric particulate matter the bayesian hierarchical approach allowed to estimate the free parameters from the inverse model from the data themselves avoiding arbitrary choices the cross validation procedure supported the statistical evidence for the good predictive quality of the assimilation process with high correlations and low root mean squared errors for the validation dataset the assessment of population exposure evidenced that the who it 1 and it 2 targets are fully accomplished but the annual average concentration is still well above the it 3 targets i e 30 μg m3 and the number of daily concentrations often exceed the maximum allowed value over a large part of the po valley we wish to emphasize that our approach allows evaluating the short and long term human exposure that can be used to study both the acute and chronic effects of atmospheric particles furthermore it can easily be extended to other air pollutants as well acknowledgements the authors thank the environmental agencies providing data arpa veneto arpa piemonte and

25223,soil phosphatase is a biochemical indicator of soil quality and its activity plays a key role in the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems modeling the kinetic parameters of soil phosphatase is central to integrate ecological processes in tropical soils under different land use ecosystems the goal of this study was to determine the kinetic parameters of soil acid phosphatase apsoil and assess the relationship between its kinetic parameters and soil quality indicators in two topsoil layers at the 0 5 and 5 10 cm depths from an oxisol under the native cerrado pine soya and sugarcane ecosystems apsoil activity was assessed with different substrate concentrations 0 0 75 1 5 3 4 5 6 12 and 18 mmol l 1 of p nitrophenol phosphate in buffer at 37 c ph 6 5 and acetate buffer the kinetic parameters km and vmax were estimated using the michaelis menten m m and eadie hofstee e h equations soil organic carbon soc total nitrogen tn soil microbial respiration smr microbial biomass carbon mbc and nitrogen mbn and dehydrogenase activity dha were also measured in both models the highest vmax and km values were found in native cerrado soil followed by pine soil in two surface layers soya and sugarcane soils presented low km values showing a great substrate affinity of soil phosphatase in these ecosystems the m m model estimated higher vmax and km values than the e h model the m m model did not show any difference in km between the two layers of ecosystems but the e h model revealed significant differences between the layers with the lowest km values at the 5 10 cm depth the results revealed that km has a significant correlation with soc r 0 71 tn r 0 72 mbc r 0 75 and mbn r 0 75 the results also showed a greater correlation between the km of the e h model and soil quality indicators than the m m model our study shows the importance of modeling the apsoil in the brazilian cerrado in relation to land use ecosystems depths and the model applied keywords kinetics acid phosphatase cerrado soils soil depths michaelis menten equation eadie hofstee equation soil quality 1 introduction phosphorus p plays a key role in the productivity of tropical forest and agroecosystems cleveland et al 2002 hui et al 2013 ferreira et al 2016 nasto et al 2017 however p availability is very low in tropical soils due to the high adsorption of phosphate anions to aluminum and iron oxide compounds in highly weathered soils novais and smyth 1999 this availability also depends on the p mineralization process from soil organic matter tabatabai and bremner 1969 albrecht et al 2010 brooks et al 2013 the p mineralization in soils is an enzymatic process performed by a group of phosphatases that catalyze hydrolytic reactions of phosphate groups mono or diesters thereby providing inorganic p to the soil solution nannipieri et al 1982 neble et al 2007 criquet and braud 2008 tabatabai et al 1994 stone and plante 2014 nasto et al 2017 the increase in p availability through phosphatase activity may regulate other metabolic processes in the soil such as nitrogen cycling and carbon transformation nasto et al 2017 margalef et al 2017 soil phosphatase in tropical soils is a biochemical indicator of soil quality for assessing differences of land use systems dick 1997 stone and plante 2014 vinhal freitas et al 2013 hou et al 2015 ferreira et al 2016 vinhal freitas et al 2017 nevertheless the activity of soil phosphatase is regulated by several soil properties including carbon and nutrient availability soil organic matter microbial biomass and ph in topsoil layers marx et al 2005 sinsabaugh et al 2008 trasar cepeda et al 2008 hou et al 2015 ferreira et al 2016 vinhal freitas et al 2017 in addition soil phosphatase activity is also influenced by environmental conditions such as temperature and moisture in topsoil layers sylvia et al 1999 paul 2007 most studies of soil phosphatase have been focused on topsoil at the 0 10 or 0 20 cm depths stone and plante 2014 hou et al 2015 ratliff and fisk 2016 and few surveys have been performed in the short distances of surface layers between 0 5 and 5 10 cm vinhal freitas et al 2017 studies indicate that assessments of microbial indicators and phosphatase activity are more appropriate at the 0 5 and 5 10 cm depths for comparing different land use ecosystems ferreira et al 2016 sun et al 2016 vinhal freitas et al 2017 furthermore daily and seasonal fluctuations in soil temperature and moisture often occur in the soil surface layers altering microbial and biochemical properties sylvia et al 1999 paul 2007 most surveys of soil phosphatase activity have been performed by assessing the potential activity rather than the kinetic parameters of the enzyme the potential activity is usually measured by a single saturation substrate concentration serving simply as an indicator of soil quality among ecosystems stone and plante 2014 kinetic parameters offer a complete description of an enzyme s response because the active site of phosphatase is saturated with different substrate concentrations stone and plante 2014 ferreira et al 2016 measuring the activity of an enzyme through substrate saturation may also reduce competitive inhibition of natural substrates by the active site within the soil solution stone et al 2012 in ecosystems kinetic parameters depend on a pool of enzymes and isoenzymes produced by many different organisms stone and plante 2014 kinetic parameters can also improve the analysis performance of the enzyme activity and integrate microbial processes into biogeochemical models allison et al 2010 wieder et al 2013 stone and plante 2014 kinetic parameters of soil phosphatase can be estimated by the michaelis menten 1 and the eadie hofstee 2 equations which derives from the first one 1 v vmax s km s 2 v km v s vmax where v is the enzymatic reaction velocity of enzyme of substrate conversion s is the substrate concentration vmax is the maximum enzymatic activity of substrate conversion and km is the saturation constant both equations estimate the km which indicates the enzyme substrate binding affinity the eadie hofstee e h equation is a linear regression that derives from the michaelis menten m m equation all estimated kinetic parameters in both equations depend on the pool of enzymes and assay conditions ferreira et al 2016 the e h equation has also been used to demonstrate the presence of isoform phosphatases in soil according to sample dispersions of soil phosphatase activity to different substrate concentrations ferreira et al 2016 furthermore measuring kinetic parameters beyond simple measurements of enzyme activity is essential for understanding enzyme control mechanisms enzyme roles in specific soil conditions and enzyme responses to changes in metabolite concentration marinari et al 2008 henry 2012 in tropical soils surveys with kinetic parameters of soil phosphatase using different models are important for better understanding the dynamic p between surface layers in the brazilian cerrado the majority of soils are old and highly weathered such as oxisols and ultisols these soils are acidic are poor in nutrients and are rich in iron and aluminum oxides vinhal freitas et al 2013 however the cerrado has been used for a variety of agricultural activities since 1970 such as grain production soya corn and wheat ethanol production sugarcane and commercial forests pine and eucalyptus in addition the areas of native cerrado present different landscapes and are ecologically important for the preservation and conservation of biodiversity thus soil p availability may exert a critical role in soil function under different land use systems in addition the soils of the cerrado biome are ideal for this investigation due to high fluxes of energy and mass and soil microbial transformations in tropical regions including soil p cycling therefore the present study aimed to determine the kinetic parameters of soil acid phosphatase apsoil in two surface layers at the 0 5 and 5 10 cm depths and assess the relationship between the kinetic parameters of apsoil and soil quality indicators from an oxisol under different land use agroecosystems in the brazilian cerrado this study was performed under the same geographical region in the south west of brazil 2 material and methods 2 1 sites the

the models were also separately applied to each replicate to obtain the km value of each replicate then these km values were correlated with soil chemical and microbial indicators using pearson s correlation and its coefficients tested by t student s test at 1 and 5 significance levels 3 results 3 1 general soil characteristics the studied sites presented differences in relation to soil physicochemical properties table 1 the results show that native cerrado and pine soils have lower ph values than soya and sugarcane soils soil ph values are similar between the two depths within the same land use system overall p k ca2 and mg2 concentrations increased in soya and sugarcane soils compared to the native cerrado soil the lowest concentrations of nutrients including tn were observed in the pine forest soil total nitrogen concentration was greater in the native cerrado soil than in other soils in all ecosystems the tn concentration was greater at the 0 5 cm depth than at 5 10 cm the results of this study show a loss of toc in top soil layers by 34 in the pine forest soil and 38 in soya and sugarcane soils in relation to the native cerrado soil table 2 at the 5 10 cm depth the loss of toc was of 52 in the pine soil 30 in the soya soil and 23 in the sugarcane soil in relation to the native cerrado soil in addition the results also showed that there was no apparent difference in toc concentrations between the two depths in soya and sugarcane soils the native cerrado ecosystem and pine forest also showed differences between depths with a higher concentration of toc at the 0 5 cm depth than at the 5 10 cm depth approximately 1 3 and 1 6 times higher respectively soil microbial indicators such as mbc mbn smr and dha decreased significantly within land use agroecosystems pine soya and sugarcane compared to the native cerrado ecosystem table 3 overall the lowest soil microbial values were observed in the sugarcane soil however soil qco2 values were greater for the studied agroecosystems than for native cerrado showing that these land uses cause a greater environmental stress to soil microorganisms table 3 in general soil microbial activities showed higher values at the 0 5 cm depth than at the 5 10 cm depth for all the four land uses 3 2 kinetic parameters of apsoil the kinetic parameters of apsoil were calculated using the m m and e h models the response of apsoil to the m m model depended on land use ecosystems at both depths fig 1 a and b the average km values ranged from 2 73 to 13 9 umol p npp l 1 and the maximum reaction vmax values of apsoil activity ranged from 674 to 4838 μg p np g 1 soil h 1 higher values of km and vmax were found in native cerrado table 4 soya and sugarcane soils presented low km and vmax values when compared with the native cerrado soil this model presented a high coefficient fit r2 0 89 but the fits decreased in all sites studied at the 5 10 cm depth when the e h model was applied the response of apsoil to different substrate concentrations depended on land use ecosystems and depths figs 2 and 3 with the mean km values ranging from 2 3 to 6 7 umol p npp l 1 and estimated vmax ranging from 725 to 4144 μg p np g 1 soil h 1 this model also shows a greater variation coefficient of variation of apsoil activity in native cerrado and pine soils to different substrate concentrations compared to soya and sugarcane soils in addition this model showed a higher fit value r2 0 69 with values at the 5 10 cm depth than at the 0 5 cm depth comparatively the two models used to calculate the affinity constant km of soil phosphatase activity showed different outcomes table 5 all values of km estimated were significantly greater than p 0 05 in both models however the m m model revealed greater km values at the 5 10 cm depth than at the 0 5 cm depth while the e h model showed lower km values at the 5 10 cm depth for the pine ecosystem the e h model showed the lowest km values of all ecosystems in both depths 3 3 correlations between affinity constant km and soil quality indicators pearson s correlations were calculated between km values from both models and soil quality indicators using student s t test to validate the r values table 6 high values of pearson s correlation between cot and km for both models were observed as well as tn mbc and mbn also presented a strong positive correlation with km smr and dha activity presented smaller r values overall km from the eadie hofstee model tended to increase correlation values compared with km from the michaelis menten model mainly when it was correlated with mbc and mbn our results did not show any significant correlation between km and p availability total phosphorus qco2 ph and nutrient availability k ca2 mg2 and al3 4 discussion this study is one of the first reports that shows the kinetic parameters of apsoil in different land uses and two topsoil layers in the cerrado biome here it was also shown that the response of apsoil to different substrate concentrations depended on the model used for estimating the kinetic parameters land use ecosystems and surface layers although apsoil activities have been reported in many previous studies tabatabai and bremner 1969 nannipieri et al 1982 juma and tabatabai 1988 trasar cepeda and gil sotres 1988 marinari et al 2008 understanding apsoil activities has gained renewed importance due to the findings of phosphorus as a limiting nutrient in tropical ecosystems and the effects of this limitation on several ecological processes in the terrestrial biosphere hui et al 2013 stone and plante 2014 wieder et al 2015 ferreira et al 2016 ratliff and fisk 2016 our study also carried out an important characterization of soil quality indicators under different land use and at two depths 0 5 and 5 10 cm of surface layers in agroecosystem soils there were significant losses of som compared to the native cerrado soil these losses were greater at the 0 5 cm depth than at the 5 10 cm depth in the soya and sugarcane ecosystems in relation to the same depths in the native cerrado soil the findings of this work are similar to previous reports in the literature for cerrado soils batlle bayer et al 2010 vinhal freitas et al 2013 2017 various reports have shown the impact of agricultural soils on som losses in the brazilian cerrado however our outcomes are specifically related to four land uses and two thin layers of topsoil for which there is no report in the literature our results also showed higher n concentrations in the native cerrado soil than in agricultural soils for both studied depths som and tn can be the main soil components that affect the metabolic response of heterotrophic microorganisms in the terrestrial ecosystem wieder et al 2015 ratliff and fisk 2016 all microbial indicators such as smr mbc mbn and dha confirmed the negative impacts of agroecosystems on soil functions these indicators are very important in ecosystem functioning because they measure a general response of soil microorganisms to environmental disturbances the maximum reaction velocity vmax and affinity constant km of apsoil varied with land use systems and topsoil layers the highest the vmax and km values were found in the native cerrado which were higher than those found in the literature williams et al 1973 sinsabaugh and follstad shah 2012 these high values of kinetic parameters for apsoil can be explained by the native forest features in the cerrado biome which have also presented high values of soil microbial properties our results also revealed that the kinetic parameters of apsoil decreased in agricultural soils however each kinetic parameter can indicate specific information about the enzyme s response in soil from each ecosystem high vmax values may be due to a greater pool of enzymes produced by soil microorganisms while differences in km values may depend more on diverse isoenzymes as a consequence of a different litter quality and quantity marinari et al 2008 land use systems alter the soil microbial community due to several biotic and abiotic factors shifting the soil metabolism including the production quality and quantity enzymes i e isoenzymes although vmax and km of a soil enzyme have been highly correlated it is not always possible to apply this dependence in soil due to the enzyme s response depending on diverse factors such as type of plant cover soil textural class microbiota and environmental conditions in topsoil layers ferreira et al 2016 ratliff and fisk 2016 vinhal freitas et al 2017 for example soil under pine had high vmax values and low km values when assessed by the e h model in ecosystems km can show more environmental substrate availability rather than enzyme substrate binding affinity in addition high concentrations of substrates in soil may stimulate soil microorganisms to produce more enzymes thereby increasing values of vmax sinsabaugh and follstad shah 2010 2012 modeling is an important tool to assess the kinetic parameters of apsoil in different land use systems within the regional scale and at the same time it is essential for monitoring and comparing ecosystems on a global scale furthermore models can improve the correlations between the kinetic parameters and soil quality indicators which are of paramount importance for understanding the soil ecological processes in terrestrial ecosystems stone and plante 2014 in this work the m m and e h models were used to describe the response of apsoil to its substrate concentrations which showed changes in the kinetic parameter values of apsoil although the m m model has usually been applied in soil enzymes studies have also shown that the hyperbolic response of michaelis menten will not be the best model to measure the kinetic parameters of the apsoil due to heterogeneity of the soil system and the presence of isoenzymes nannipieri et al 1982 wang and post 2013 stone and plante 2014 linear regression equations have been suggested and applied in soil enzymes such as the hanes wolf hw lineweaver burk lb eadie scatchar es and eadie hofstee e h models margon and fornasier 2008 hui et al 2013 ferreira et al 2016 all linear regression models suggest a transformation of independent x and dependent y variables where vmax and km are estimated by the y intercept and the slope of linear equation respectively our data showed that the fits of the e h equation depend on the dispersion points of the velocity reaction between the phosphatase activity and substrate concentrations showing a low fit when there was a high dispersion of points measured by coefficient of variation cv this model also shows that the dispersion of points might be linked to a greater production of isoenzymes studies have reported that the production of isoenzymes can define the kinetic parameters of an enzyme and this production occurs due to different communities of soil microorganisms khalili et al 2011 stone and plante 2014 ferreira et al 2016 studies have also shown that the activity of phosphatase enzymes has high correlations with soc and tn in soil ratliff and fisk 2016 margalef et al 2017 our results followed the same tendency of these surveys soils with high soc concentrations may have several porg substrates and thus induce more production of phosphatases soc can increase the diversity of the soil microbial community increasing the number of isoenzymes in soil in addition soil phosphatases appear to be strongly coupled to the availability of n in soil according to current reports ratliff and fisk 2016 margalef et al 2017 this strong relationship between soil phosphatase activity and availability of n occurs due to the n limitation of various metabolic processes in ecosystems including the synthesis of phosphatases our results indicate that km values of apsoil have a high correlation with tn indicating an important effect of n on the activity of apsoil in tropical soil under different land uses and topsoil layers our survey also shows that the km of apsoil had a high correlation with mbc and mbn demonstrating that the activity of apsoil is strongly related to the microbial metabolisms high mbc values indicate a greater intensity of organic transformations in soil which can result in the increase in different porg forms in general soils with high mbc concentrations have greater diversity in their microbial communities than soils with low mbc and consequently isoenzymes of apsoil might be produced with increasing mbc the km of apsoil had a high correlation with mbn suggesting that the synthesis of apsoil depends on microbial transformations of n and its availability in soil a current report ratliff and fisk 2016 suggests that n availability influences phosphatase production in forest soil and that this relationship affects the p availability in soil the same authors suggested that high losses of n occur in agricultural soils decreasing the microbial efficiency of n use our results showed that the e h model increased the correlation km of apsoil with microbial indicators compared to the m m model suggesting that linear equations can improve the relationship between the soil phosphatase activity and the soil microbial properties however more studies are needed in tropical soils to assess and compare the kinetic parameters of apsoil coupled to soil ecological processes 5 conclusions the results of this work showed the impact of land use ecosystems on kinetic parameters of acid soil phosphatase in four representative areas of the brazilian cerrado biome our results also revealed that kinetic parameters of soil acid phosphatase depended on the models applied the highest km and vmax values were found in the native cerrado soil and the lowest values were found in soya and sugarcane soils the kinetic parameters estimated by the m m model were always higher than those estimated by the e h model but the m m model did not detect differences between topsoil layers the e h model showed significant differences between both layers as the lowest km values appeared at the 5 10 cm depth our results reveal that km values of acid soil phosphatase have a high correlation with soc tn and soil microbial indicators for both models but the correlation tends be higher with the e h model compared to the m m model the results also suggested that the e h model may be better for modeling the kinetic parameters of acid phosphatase in cerrado soils indicating differences among land use ecosystems between two topsoil layers and a higher correlation with soil quality indicators this work is the first report that applies modeling to an acid phosphatase study in cerrado soils and it might encourage similar studies of soil phosphatase in tropical areas on a global scale acknowledgements the authors are thankful to the conselho nacional de pesquisa cnpq brazil for scholarship support of the last author 
25223,soil phosphatase is a biochemical indicator of soil quality and its activity plays a key role in the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems modeling the kinetic parameters of soil phosphatase is central to integrate ecological processes in tropical soils under different land use ecosystems the goal of this study was to determine the kinetic parameters of soil acid phosphatase apsoil and assess the relationship between its kinetic parameters and soil quality indicators in two topsoil layers at the 0 5 and 5 10 cm depths from an oxisol under the native cerrado pine soya and sugarcane ecosystems apsoil activity was assessed with different substrate concentrations 0 0 75 1 5 3 4 5 6 12 and 18 mmol l 1 of p nitrophenol phosphate in buffer at 37 c ph 6 5 and acetate buffer the kinetic parameters km and vmax were estimated using the michaelis menten m m and eadie hofstee e h equations soil organic carbon soc total nitrogen tn soil microbial respiration smr microbial biomass carbon mbc and nitrogen mbn and dehydrogenase activity dha were also measured in both models the highest vmax and km values were found in native cerrado soil followed by pine soil in two surface layers soya and sugarcane soils presented low km values showing a great substrate affinity of soil phosphatase in these ecosystems the m m model estimated higher vmax and km values than the e h model the m m model did not show any difference in km between the two layers of ecosystems but the e h model revealed significant differences between the layers with the lowest km values at the 5 10 cm depth the results revealed that km has a significant correlation with soc r 0 71 tn r 0 72 mbc r 0 75 and mbn r 0 75 the results also showed a greater correlation between the km of the e h model and soil quality indicators than the m m model our study shows the importance of modeling the apsoil in the brazilian cerrado in relation to land use ecosystems depths and the model applied keywords kinetics

agroecosystems cleveland et al 2002 hui et al 2013 ferreira et al 2016 nasto et al 2017 however p availability is very low in tropical soils due to the high adsorption of phosphate anions to aluminum and iron oxide compounds in highly weathered soils novais and smyth 1999 this availability also depends on the p mineralization process from soil organic matter tabatabai and bremner 1969 albrecht et al 2010 brooks et al 2013 the p mineralization in soils is an enzymatic process performed by a group of phosphatases that catalyze hydrolytic reactions of phosphate groups mono or diesters thereby providing inorganic p to the soil solution nannipieri et al 1982 neble et al 2007 criquet and braud 2008 tabatabai et al 1994 stone and plante 2014 nasto et al 2017 the increase in p availability through phosphatase activity may regulate other metabolic processes in the soil such as nitrogen cycling and carbon transformation nasto et al 2017 margalef et al 2017 soil phosphatase in tropical soils is a biochemical indicator of soil quality for assessing differences of land use systems dick 1997 stone and plante 2014 vinhal freitas et al 2013 hou et al 2015 ferreira et al 2016 vinhal freitas et al 2017 nevertheless the activity of soil phosphatase is regulated by several soil properties including carbon and nutrient availability soil organic matter microbial biomass and ph in topsoil layers marx et al 2005 sinsabaugh et al 2008 trasar cepeda et al 2008 hou et al 2015 ferreira et al 2016 vinhal freitas et al 2017 in addition soil phosphatase activity is also influenced by environmental conditions such as temperature and moisture in topsoil layers sylvia et al 1999 paul 2007 most studies of soil phosphatase have been focused on topsoil at the 0 10 or 0 20 cm depths stone and plante 2014 hou et al 2015 ratliff and fisk 2016 and few surveys have been performed in the short distances of surface layers between 0 5 and 5 10 cm vinhal freitas et al 2017 studies indicate that assessments of microbial indicators and phosphatase activity are more appropriate at the 0 5 and 5 10 cm depths for comparing different land use ecosystems ferreira et al 2016 sun et al 2016 vinhal freitas et al 2017 furthermore daily and seasonal fluctuations in soil temperature and moisture often occur in the soil surface layers altering microbial and biochemical properties sylvia et al 1999 paul 2007 most surveys of soil phosphatase activity have been performed by assessing the potential activity rather than the kinetic parameters of the enzyme the potential activity is usually measured by a single saturation substrate concentration serving simply as an indicator of soil quality among ecosystems stone and plante 2014 kinetic parameters offer a complete description of an enzyme s response because the active site of phosphatase is saturated with different substrate concentrations stone and plante 2014 ferreira et al 2016 measuring the activity of an enzyme through substrate saturation may also reduce competitive inhibition of natural substrates by the active site within the soil solution stone et al 2012 in ecosystems kinetic parameters depend on a pool of enzymes and isoenzymes produced by many different organisms stone and plante 2014 kinetic parameters can also improve the analysis performance of the enzyme activity and integrate microbial processes into biogeochemical models allison et al 2010 wieder et al 2013 stone and plante 2014 kinetic parameters of soil phosphatase can be estimated by the michaelis menten 1 and the eadie hofstee 2 equations which derives from the first one 1 v vmax s km s 2 v km v s vmax where v is the enzymatic reaction velocity of enzyme of substrate conversion s is the substrate concentration vmax is the maximum enzymatic activity of substrate conversion and km is the saturation constant both equations estimate the km which indicates the enzyme substrate binding affinity the eadie hofstee e h equation is a linear regression that derives from the michaelis menten m m equation all estimated kinetic parameters in both equations depend on the pool of enzymes and assay conditions ferreira et al 2016 the e h equation has also been used to demonstrate the presence of isoform phosphatases in soil according to sample dispersions of soil phosphatase activity to different substrate concentrations ferreira et al 2016 furthermore measuring kinetic parameters beyond simple measurements of enzyme activity is essential for understanding enzyme control mechanisms enzyme roles in specific soil conditions and enzyme responses to changes in metabolite concentration marinari et al 2008 henry 2012 in tropical soils surveys with kinetic parameters of soil phosphatase using different models are important for better understanding the dynamic p between surface layers in the brazilian cerrado the majority of soils are old and highly weathered such as oxisols and ultisols these soils are acidic are poor in nutrients and are rich in iron and aluminum oxides vinhal freitas et al 2013 however the cerrado has been used for a variety of agricultural activities since 1970 such as grain production soya corn and wheat ethanol production sugarcane and commercial forests pine and eucalyptus in addition the areas of native cerrado present different landscapes and are ecologically important for the preservation and conservation of biodiversity thus soil p availability may exert a critical role in soil function under different land use systems in addition the soils of the cerrado biome are ideal for this investigation due to high fluxes of energy and mass and soil microbial transformations in tropical regions including soil p cycling therefore the present study aimed to determine the kinetic parameters of soil acid phosphatase apsoil in two surface layers at the 0 5 and 5 10 cm depths and assess the relationship between the kinetic parameters of apsoil and soil quality indicators from an oxisol under different land use agroecosystems in the brazilian cerrado this study was performed under the same geographical region in the south west of brazil 2 material and methods 2 1 sites the

layers the highest the vmax and km values were found in the native cerrado which were higher than those found in the literature williams et al 1973 sinsabaugh and follstad shah 2012 these high values of kinetic parameters for apsoil can be explained by the native forest features in the cerrado biome which have also presented high values of soil microbial properties our results also revealed that the kinetic parameters of apsoil decreased in agricultural soils however each kinetic parameter can indicate specific information about the enzyme s response in soil from each ecosystem high vmax values may be due to a greater pool of enzymes produced by soil microorganisms while differences in km values may depend more on diverse isoenzymes as a consequence of a different litter quality and quantity marinari et al 2008 land use systems alter the soil microbial community due to several biotic and abiotic factors shifting the soil metabolism including the production quality and quantity enzymes i e isoenzymes although vmax and km of a soil enzyme have been highly correlated it is not always possible to apply this dependence in soil due to the enzyme s response depending on diverse factors such as type of plant cover soil textural class microbiota and environmental conditions in topsoil layers ferreira et al 2016 ratliff and fisk 2016 vinhal freitas et al 2017 for example soil under pine had high vmax values and low km values when assessed by the e h model in ecosystems km can show more environmental substrate availability rather than enzyme substrate binding affinity in addition high concentrations of substrates in soil may stimulate soil microorganisms to produce more enzymes thereby increasing values of vmax sinsabaugh and follstad shah 2010 2012 modeling is an important tool to assess the kinetic parameters of apsoil in different land use systems within the regional scale and at the same time it is essential for monitoring and comparing ecosystems on a global scale furthermore models can improve the correlations between the kinetic parameters and soil quality indicators which are of paramount importance for understanding the soil ecological processes in terrestrial ecosystems stone and plante 2014 in this work the m m and e h models were used to describe the response of apsoil to its substrate concentrations which showed changes in the kinetic parameter values of apsoil although the m m model has usually been applied in soil enzymes studies have also shown that the hyperbolic response of michaelis menten will not be the best model to measure the kinetic parameters of the apsoil due to heterogeneity of the soil system and the presence of isoenzymes nannipieri et al 1982 wang and post 2013 stone and plante 2014 linear regression equations have been suggested and applied in soil enzymes such as the hanes wolf hw lineweaver burk lb eadie scatchar es and eadie hofstee e h models margon and fornasier 2008 hui et al 2013 ferreira et al 2016 all linear regression models suggest a transformation of independent x and dependent y variables where vmax and km are estimated by the y intercept and the slope of linear equation respectively our data showed that the fits of the e h equation depend on the dispersion points of the velocity reaction between the phosphatase activity and substrate concentrations showing a low fit when there was a high dispersion of points measured by coefficient of variation cv this model also shows that the dispersion of points might be linked to a greater production of isoenzymes studies have reported that the production of isoenzymes can define the kinetic parameters of an enzyme and this production occurs due to different communities of soil microorganisms khalili et al 2011 stone and plante 2014 ferreira et al 2016 studies have also shown that the activity of phosphatase enzymes has high correlations with soc and tn in soil ratliff and fisk 2016 margalef et al 2017 our results followed the same tendency of these surveys soils with high soc concentrations may have several porg substrates and thus induce more production of phosphatases soc can increase the diversity of the soil microbial community increasing the number of isoenzymes in soil in addition soil phosphatases appear to be strongly coupled to the availability of n in soil according to current reports ratliff and fisk 2016 margalef et al 2017 this strong relationship between soil phosphatase activity and availability of n occurs due to the n limitation of various metabolic processes in ecosystems including the synthesis of phosphatases our results indicate that km values of apsoil have a high correlation with tn indicating an important effect of n on the activity of apsoil in tropical soil under different land uses and topsoil layers our survey also shows that the km of apsoil had a high correlation with mbc and mbn demonstrating that the activity of apsoil is strongly related to the microbial metabolisms high mbc values indicate a greater intensity of organic transformations in soil which can result in the increase in different porg forms in general soils with high mbc concentrations have greater diversity in their microbial communities than soils with low mbc and consequently isoenzymes of apsoil might be produced with increasing mbc the km of apsoil had a high correlation with mbn suggesting that the synthesis of apsoil depends on microbial transformations of n and its availability in soil a current report ratliff and fisk 2016 suggests that n availability influences phosphatase production in forest soil and that this relationship affects the p availability in soil the same authors suggested that high losses of n occur in agricultural soils decreasing the microbial efficiency of n use our results showed that the e h model increased the correlation km of apsoil with microbial indicators compared to the m m model suggesting that linear equations can improve the relationship between the soil phosphatase activity and the soil microbial properties however more studies are needed in tropical soils to assess and compare the kinetic parameters of apsoil coupled to soil ecological processes 5 conclusions the results of this work showed the impact of land use ecosystems on kinetic parameters of acid soil phosphatase in four representative areas of the brazilian cerrado biome our results also revealed that kinetic parameters of soil acid phosphatase depended on the models applied the highest km and vmax values were found in the native cerrado soil and the lowest values were found in soya and sugarcane soils the kinetic parameters estimated by the m m model were always higher than those estimated by the e h model but the m m model did not detect differences between topsoil layers the e h model showed significant differences between both layers as the lowest km values appeared at the 5 10 cm depth our results reveal that km values of acid soil phosphatase have a high correlation with soc tn and soil microbial indicators for both models but the correlation tends be higher with the e h model compared to the m m model the results also suggested that the e h model may be better for modeling the kinetic parameters of acid phosphatase in cerrado soils indicating differences among land use ecosystems between two topsoil layers and a higher correlation with soil quality indicators this work is the first report that applies modeling to an acid phosphatase study in cerrado soils and it might encourage similar studies of soil phosphatase in tropical areas on a global scale acknowledgements the authors are thankful to the conselho nacional de pesquisa cnpq brazil for scholarship support of the last author 
25224,the guanaco lama guanicoe is one of the two south american native wild camelid species and despite its important ecological role and economic value conservationists are in a permanent conflict with sheep ranchers currently management programs are being developed in argentina and chile to guarantee guanaco and grassland conservation we developed a non linear simulation three stages structured matrix model of guanaco population dynamics with climatic and density dependence effects that can be used as a tool to devise optimal management interventions we estimated population parameters using a 41 year time series data from a guanaco population in tierra del fuego chile we conducted a multivariate multiple regression analysis between matrix demographic parameters survival at each stage and fertility as dependent variables and climatic variables and population density as independent variables guanaco density was significantly correlated with female newborn and adult annual survival while annual precipitation correlated significantly with the fertility females born per female per year in contrast to population regulation mechanisms commonly seen in other ungulate species this guanaco model allows the evaluation of the effects of different events e g offtake particular dry or wet years poaching on specific sexes and life stages which is the field information commonly available keywords demographic parameters guanaco multivariate multiple regression population regulation south american camelids ungulates 1 introduction the guanaco lama guanicoe one of the two wild camelid species of south america is a seasonal breeder with a resource defence polygyny mating system franklin 1983 1982 it has an average gestation period of 11 5 months gives birth to only one offspring per female per season and breeds in summer within a couple of weeks following parturition from december to mid february franklin 1982 in the wild females breed for the first time at 2 years of age raedeke 1979 currently the guanaco occupies only 26 of its original range baldi et al 2016 and its range distribution has been reduced by 60 in argentina 75 in chile franklin et al 1997 and over 90 in perú bolivia and paraguay cunazza et al 1995 additionally its distribution has become fragmented having small relatively isolated populations baldi et al 2016 however this species was not considered as a threatened species but was assigned a least concern status in the iucn red list of threatened species baldi et al 2016 based upon its wide continental distribution around one million km2 its presumed total population size around one million adults and the presence of numerous protected areas across its range of distribution for the same reasons the guanaco has been included in appendix ii of cites cites 2015 which implies the regulation of international commerce of meat and fine fiber products to insure that such trade does not threaten the guanaco s survival by requiring that management plans have been put in place this species has high conservation interest and economic value and it is embedded in socioeconomic and political conflicts between conservation groups and sheep ranchers baldi et al 2016 this conflict results from an apparent guanaco sheep competition for food and water resources baldi et al 2001 2004 currently different management programs are being developed in argentina and chile in an attempt to resolve this unsettled situation and guarantee both guanaco and grassland conservation nonetheless those management programs do not evaluate possible effects of potential management actions and environmental influences on the population dynamics of guanacos because although there are some works which considered age structured models for this species in the chilean island of tierra del fuego franklin and fritz 1991 and elsewhere rabinovich 1995 there are no studies showing how density dependent processes and climatic factors may differentially affect guanaco age or stage classes density dependence has been incorporated in population models since the conception of the logistic model of population growth dennis and taper 1994 proposed a discrete density dependent stochastic logistic model to test the existence of density dependence processes this model and others derived from it are still frequently used for demographic studies as well as for wildlife management keyser et al 2006 hostetler et al 2013 however models that differentiate individuals by sex age or stage can be more useful when comparing different management strategies as expressed by gordon et al 2004 the long term population dynamics research has revealed fundamental differences in how sex age classes are affected by changes in density and weather consequently management must be tailored to the age and sex structure of the population rather than to simple population counts structured demographic models are useful because they provide explanations of population dynamics in terms of the fates of individuals in each class mentis 1977 objected to the use of non structured logistic type population models to estimate the maximum harvestable yield because the harvesting is likely to alter the age distribution and therefore r and caswell and fujiwara 2004 consider that in age or stage structured models modelling relationships between a species life cycle and its population dynamics is richer and more realistic in the logistic population model the optimal per capita harvest rate to achieve maximum sustained yield is h r 2 r being the intrinsic rate of population increase while in a stage structured model it is h r λ λ being the finite rate of population growth williams et al 2002 many years have passed since structured models began to be used to describe population dynamics leslie 1959 proposed the first stage structured model with a linear restriction on survival from one age to the next as a function of the population size jensen 1995 developed a variation of the matrix model of liu and cohen 1987 based on a discrete time form of the logistic equation that was successfully applied to a grey wolf population in a limited environment miller et al 2002 these structured models have also become usual tools in conservation biology and wildlife management e g jensen 1996 developed a harvest model for white tailed deer odocoileus virginianus borealis based on a density dependent matrix model to determine the maximum sustainable yield evaluate the effect of harvest on fecundity and survival of each age group and to estimate the age structure of the optimum yield in the case of south american camelids there only a few non age structured models rabinovich 1985 shaw et al 2012 zubillaga et al 2014 marino et al 2014 and only two age structured population matrix models that have been developed for guanacos franklin and fritz 1991 rabinovich 1995 however none of them included density dependent and climate components these two components are very important in ungulate dynamics particularly for species that show relatively low fecundity and long longevity as is the case of guanacos it was found that in this kind of species usually a depression of both fecundity and survival results with increases in population density particularly in winter time clutton brock et al 1997 determining their particular dynamic population pattern we used a stage structured model to test the hypothesis that both density dependence and climatic processes regulate and or limit guanaco populations we also used this model to determine which guanaco stage class is more sensitive to density dependent or climatic factors and set the grounds for its future use as model to inform management decisions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we used a 41 year long time series 1977 2017 of data from a wild guanaco population sampled in the 2000 km2 cameron ranch 53 9 s 69 3 w located in the central northern part of the island of tierra del fuego chile at an altitude of 0 300 m the area has a mean annual precipitation of 370 6 mm sd 51 8 and a mean annual temperature of 6 55 c sd 0 35 it is characterized by undulating terrain with abundant streams and valleys and presence of peat bogs in the lower elevations a single major river the río grande runs through the area the region is a mosaic of steppe pampa and forest biomes the latter is composed by deciduous forests dominated by lenga nothofagus pumilio and ñire n antartica the steppe is composed of species of stipa festuca berberis baccharis empetrum azorella trifolium agrostis poa hordeum grasses as well as species of juncacea and cyperacea and of the genera carex and sphagnum peat bogs on tierra del fuego island guanacos are not preyed upon by pumas puma concolor as they are in continental populations soto 2010 see zubillaga et al 2014 for more detailed information on the study site 2 2 field sampling counts of visible guanacos took place during the post reproductive period february april and lasted approximately 7 days counts occurred daily between 10 30 and 19 00 h with two observers in each of two 4 4 vehicles driving the main secondary and local roads at a maximum speed of 40 km h each road was covered only once and particular care was taken to avoid duplication of counts at road intersections guanacos were counted for 41 consecutive years between 1977 and 2017 with the exception of years 1986 and 1996 for those two years we linearly interpolated the population count using counts from the adjacent years from 1977 to 2000 a transect with a variable width was used to spot guanacos and from 2001 to 2017 a transect with a fixed width band of 500 m to each side of the transect was used tellería 1986 davis and winstead 1987 caughley 1980 buckland et al 1993 in addition to individual guanaco counts the following were recorded for each observation weather conditions time distance km from the starting point coordinates observation distance from the transect m and an estimate of the angle to the animals locations when the animals were observed in groups the number of individuals and the social type of the group family groups constituted by an territorial male several females and their offspring bachelor groups constituted principally by non reproductive juvenile and adult males and solitary males franklin 1982 1983 were also recorded as well as its age class structure newborns juveniles and adults there are other minor variations on this classification in social units of patagonian guanacos like mixed groups and female groups ortega and franklin 1995 iranzo et al 2018 but the one we used covers the dominant social units and the easiest to recognize in the field the road network and all geo referenced observations were processed with the arcview 9 3 geographical information system gis and transferred to a spreadsheet using program map source cartography was kindly provided by the agriculture and livestock service from chile despite randomly selected transects are recommended eberhardt 1978 pre existing roads were used because according to soto 2010 the existing system of roads cover an adequate sample of the whole area the area effectively surveyed in each sampling period was around 420 km2 which represents about 20 of the study area existing roads may not comply with the requirement of random transects to survey wildlife populations however in the case of the area occupied by the guanacos in tierra del fuego chile two field surveys were made comparing guanaco counts using existing roads with guanaco aerial surveys based on systematic transects one such comparison was made in the area of the río cóndor forest project forestal savia ltda 2002 and the second in san gregorio commune province of magallanes corcoran and graells 2015 sag 2015 the results of the former field comparison showed that the aerial survey estimated 11 less guanacos than the road survey but no detailed information to estimate a statistical significance of this difference was provided the latter resulted in aerial population estimate of 63 540 guanacos while the road survey resulted in a population estimate of 62 692 guanacos range 59 058 66 327 the road count range includes the population estimated with the aerial survey providing the necessary assurance that the guanaco road count can be considered acceptable on the other hand neither the road counts nor the aerial surveys estimate guanaco numbers in the forested areas because of the low visibility there but at the time when the annual surveys are carried out most of the guanaco population is found in the grasslands additionally as the regulations in chile prohibit hunting along roads the annual variations in hunting pressure should not affect guanaco counts that are made along existing roads the population size was estimated as given in soto 2010 which was based on the king method modified by leopold 1933 and described by raedeke 1979 the population estimate n is given by n a n 2 y x where a is the total study area n is the total number of animals counted x is the total transect distance covered rounded to one meter and y is the average of the perpendicular distance from the transect to the animals counted the factor of 2 is included to consider that there is one band to each side of the transect the variance s 2 of the population estimate is given by s 2 n p 2 1 p n n 2 with p n n this variance was used to estimate the 95 upper and lower confidence intervals soto 2010 compared population estimates by the leopold and distance methods and found that the value of the means estimated by the leopold method fall within the confidence intervals estimated by the distance method all sampling periods used the same field methodology in the case of undetermined animals or social units in the survey we distributed them into each of the three social units family groups bachelor groups and solitary males using the 41 years average proportion of each of these social units 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 outlier analysis time series outliers may have important impacts on population model predictions trívez 1994 we searched for possible outliers using the tsoutliers package in r lopez de lacalle 2014 r version 3 2 1 www r project org for non linear time series chen and liu 1993 this package can be applied to seasonal and non seasonal autoregressive moving average arma processes detecting types and effects of outliers and their location outliers can be classified in four types according to their effect on the series given the dynamic process of the guanaco the outliers the use of additive outliers ao of the tsoutliers package was justified events an external effect affect a time series in a single instant of time and causes an immediate and one shot effect on the observed series trívez 1994 chen and liu 1993 once an ao was detected we corrected it by averaging the population estimates from the previous and following years 2 4 population matrix model we used a female only stage structured matrix population model lefkovitch 1965 according to their size and behaviour female guanacos were differentiated in three classes newborns individuals aged 0 1 years juveniles individuals aged 1 2 years not sexually mature and adults individuals 2 years old sexually mature although guanaco males may reach sexual maturity at over 3 years old when testes are functional and some females 2 yrs old may become mature if they are over 80 of their adult body weight the former cannot be represented in a female only model and the latter represents only a small fraction of the female juvenile population the projection matrix a has the fertility in the first row and last column indicating that only adults reproduce the annual survival of individuals of each stage in the diagonal and the annual transition probabilities between stages in the sub diagonal caswell 2001 the projection matrix we used is given by a 0 0 f s n 0 0 0 s j s a where f is fertility female newborns per adult female per year and sa represents female adult annual survival as the newborn and juvenile stages last 1 year their transition probabilities are the survival from one year to the next represented by sn and sj respectively the projection operation can be written as 1 n t 1 a n t where n t is a vector with the number of female individuals in each age class at time t we used a model step time projection interval t of 1 year for each simulation period we sum each stage of the female population vector n to obtain the total female population we estimated the total population female and male multiplying the female model predictions by 2 because the newborn sex ratio is 1 1 franklin and johnson 1994 and we found no reliable information suggesting differential survival between male and female individuals sarno et al 1999 sarno and franklin 1999 2 4 1 parameter estimation we implemented the population matrix model in an excel spreadsheet with one population matrix for every year of data and parameterized the four matrix coefficients for each year of data to estimate the annual matrix coefficients we used the solver tool in excel spreadsheet version 2010 minimizing separately the sum of the square error sse between field counts and model predictions of newborns on one hand and of pooled juvenile and adult classes on the other hand the latter procedure was used because the field identification between juveniles and adults wasn t as reliable as that of the newborns the pool of the juvenile and adult classes was made exclusively for the purpose of having a more consistent goodness of fit measure and does preclude the use of a three stage projection matrix model and because it results in a more accurate fecundity estimation a pool of juvenile and adult females in one stage class leading to a 2 2 stage matrix population model would under estimate the fecundity because juveniles are a non reproductive class since from a time series of t years only t 1 transition matrices are possible from our 41 years long time series we obtained 40 projection matrices the four matrix parameters of the 40 matrices were estimated simultaneously by the solver tool i e the 160 parameters were simultaneously modified in each iteration we used the generalized reduced gradient grg non linear option of solver which usually converged to a minimum sse in between one to five minutes of computing time we constrained the possible annual survival coefficient estimates to be 0 99 and the adult female fertility estimates to be 0 5 because they are the biological maxima for these parameters during the time period of the field guanaco population data series there were 13 seven events of adult guanaco harvests years 1980 1982 1999 2003 2005 2006 2010 2015 and 2017 with harvests of 100 100 69 1700 2000 2000 1500 1461 2176 2220 1804 401 and 988 individuals respectively to include the harvest events in our model we subtracted the number of field harvested adult individuals from the modelled adult population at simulated time t 1 because in the field the population is sampled before it is harvested so that the effects of the harvest become manifest in the population when sampled at the following year 2 4 2 sensitivity and elasticity analysis we carried out a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of the each of the four matrix model parameters on the finite population growth rate λ because transition probabilities and fertility are measured on different scales we also conducted an elasticity analysis to measure proportional sensitivity caswell 2001 the elasticity analysis was carried out for each annual projection matrix to evaluate possible elasticity changes among years using the poptools application for excel version 2010 2 5 density dependent and climatic factors to test our hypothesis that density dependent processes and climatic factors regulate and limit guanaco population size respectively we used the point estimates of the annual projection matrix coefficients and tested statistically their possible relationship with total annual guanaco density estimates the sheep presence and climatic factors the projection matrix coefficients cannot follow a normal distribution because they are asymmetric and also truncated on both tails we therefore checked the underlying statistical distribution of all four matrix coefficients we fitted the 40 years of the projection matrix coefficient estimates to four statistical distributions the normal distribution and three non symmetric distributions weibull gamma and lognormal using the fitdistrplus package in r delignette muller and dutang 2015 with a special modification to account for the particular case of truncated data c dutang personal communication using the truncdits package in r novomestky et al 2016 when more than one statistical model resulted in a statistically significant fit we selected the best one based on the akaike information criterion aic we evaluated the possible effect of density and or climate on the projection matrix coefficients by a multiple multivariate regression analysis mmra and a multivariate analysis of variance manova to account for correlations among responses friendly 2007 mmra fixes experiment wide error rates and the significance level α is adjusted to account for simultaneous testing of many variables to maintain the overall α at the level set by the researcher rencher 2002 to determine if the inter annual variation of the matrix coefficients was related to density and or climate variables we used the stage specific matrix coefficients as dependent variables and as independent variables we selected the following total guanaco population size sheep abundance annual precipitation annual and winter temperature annual precipitation with a lag of 1 year annual and winter temperature with a lag of 1 year 2 yr average annual precipitation 3 yr average annual precipitation and total guanaco population size with a lag of 1 year the winter period was from june to august because the population data come from a post breeding survey february april and annual climatic data were taken from january to december we considered the lags in climatic effects as affecting the population counts in the following year sheep abundance data were based on the time series shown in zubillaga et al 2014 and the series was extended until 2016 using information provided by the agriculture and livestock service of chile fifteen years of data were available 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2006 2008 2016 with sheep abundances of 45 000 43 000 41 000 26 000 35 000 37 000 37 227 25 789 45 370 45 360 19 900 24 215 26 075 33 100 30 025 and 27 271 animals respectively in 1995 an extremely harsh winter resulted in the death of 15 000 sheep in addition to the standing sheep count for 1995 so we corrected the 1995 sheep count to 41 000 sheep 26 000 sheep in 1995 plus 15 000 winter killed sheep additionally sheep numbers changed smoothly between years personal information by mr dalmiro guineo 2011 administrator of cameron ranch kevin mac lean 2009 administrator of cameron ranch and chilean statistics of agriculture and livestock service 2006 we used the baboon package in r meinfelder et al 2015 to conduct a bayesian bootstrap predictive mean matching multiple and single imputation algorithm a procedure considered to be more efficient than parametric methods for discrete data when missing data are very abundant we imputed the missing data between years with baboon package sheep estimates we used 29 years of climactic data 1974 2002 for the cameron ranch from the climatic research unit cru ts 2 1 database compiled by the tyndall centre cru school of environmental sciences of the university of east anglia united kingdom http www cru uea ac uk cru data hrg htm because the cru data ended in 2002 we completed that time series from 2003 to 2017 with data from punta arenas chile the closest meteorological station to cameron ranch 340 km away these data were downloaded from the meteorological service of chile http www meteochile gob cl the mmra method assumes no collinearity among the independent variables friendly 2007 we checked for collinearity among the independent variables using the software statistica statsoft inc 2009 version 9 0 www statsoft com we implemented the mmra modelling using the package candisc friendly 2007 in r and used the statistically significant relationships obtained with the mmra to select the independent variables correlated with the projection s matrix coefficients as multiplicative factors given that since 2010 the harvest was an annual except for 2016 and with increased offtakes we decided to carry out the analysis by time segments in order to avoid the offtake masking the possible effect of density dependence or of climate a first segment was 34 year long 1977 2010 and a second segment included the last 15 years as the response variables do not have normal distribution a log odds transformation was applied to the matrix coefficients fertility and survival of newborns juveniles and adults anticipating that the guanaco population could be regulated by the total guanaco population size we considered the effect of density dependence using seven different candidate functions bellows 1981 and found that the ullyett function ullyett 1950 provided the most flexible sigmoid form of density dependence this function was implemented replacing nt population size by the variable dpk eq 2 2 d d f 1 1 e d p k a b where ddf is the density dependent factor 0 ddf 1 dpk is the density of the guanaco population expressed as a proportion of its carrying capacity k and a and b are parameters to be estimated as an estimate of k we used the result obtained by zubillaga et al 2014 for the guanaco population of cameron ranch k 46 563 guanacos which represents the average carrying capacity around which the population size fluctuates to incorporate the effects of climatic factors clf in the simulation model we used a linear regression through the origin eq 3 3 c l f c c v a r where c is a parameter to be estimated and cvar are the climatic variables precipitation or temperature we expressed cvar as a relative proportion calculated as cvar 1 annual value of the climatic variable long term average of the annual climatic variable long term average of the annual climatic variable our definition of cvar sums a value of 1 to the relative proportion to avoid negative numbers and allows it to be used as a multiplicative factor this format also provides more generalizability to the climatic effects i e it can be applied to a new location we estimated the a b and c parameters of the density dependent and climatic factor equations using the solver utility of excel applied to the average of the 40 values of the estimated matrix coefficients in order to obtain a single set of values of the parameters a b and c which in the simulations is annually affected by the inter annual variation of the model s covariates total population density and precipitation or temperature we calculated confidence intervals for these estimated parameters using a monte carlo simulation method as proposed by lambert et al 2012 3 results 3 1 data analysis 3 1 1 outlier analysis we found two outliers in the population time series total population sizes of 33 125 guanacos for year 2007 and 56 973 guanacos for 2011 and we replaced them by the new values 56 895 and 45 073 guanacos respectively table s1 in supporting information 3 2 population matrix model 3 2 1 population matrix parameter estimation the estimated values of the 160 matrix coefficients four coefficients for each of the 40 matrices are given in table s1 in the supporting information table 1 shows the average and coefficient of variation of fertility and annual survival of newborns juveniles and adults resulting in an intrinsic rate of natural increase of r 0 051 and the population finite rate of growth was λ 1 052 for this guanaco population 3 2 2 sensitivity and elasticity analysis using the average value of the matrix coefficients the one with the highest impact on λ was adult survival 0 69 while juvenile survival newborn survival and fertility had the same much lower impact 0 10 when using each of the 40 estimated annual transition matrices adult survival also had the strongest effect on λ table s2 in supporting information 3 3 density dependent and climatic factors 3 3 1 collinearity analysis winter temperature with and without lags and precipitation with and without lags and total guanaco population size were not collinear and were kept in the mmr analysis table s3 in supporting information sheep abundance was significantly and negatively correlated with guanaco abundance r² 0 5 p 0 0001 we decided to keep the guanaco density as the independent variable for the mmra because 1 we wanted to evaluate the effect of the guanaco density on demographic parameters 2 we didn t find any literature supporting the idea that sheep abundance causes a change in guanaco survival or fertility and 3 the negative correlation between guanaco and sheep is likely to be related to guanaco avoidance of sheep and human activity rather than to a change in guanaco survival or fertility marino et al 2016 3 3 2 multiple multivariate regression analysis the manova pillai test statistic

conformed well to the observed guanaco population with population size fluctuating around the average carrying capacity fig 1 the range of clf was 0 98 and 1 78 between all years resulting in an increase in fertility by up to 78 highest precipitation values and a decrease by down to 2 lowest precipitation values the effective fertility i e average fertility clf oscillated between 0 24 and 0 43 due to the effect of precipitation the estimated ddf ranged between 0 81 and 1 leading to an adult survival decrease of 19 at high population densities 4 discussion analyses of vital rates and factors that affect them are often made by univariate methods even if more than one dependent variable is evaluated univariate and multivariate analyses may give different results and lead to different conclusions friendly 2007 mmra is more appropriate than univariate multiple regression analysis for assessing potential relationships among several dependent and several independent variables and determining which of the independent variables should be incorporated in the final model this is the first application of mmra to a mammal population regulation analysis we recommend this type of analysis to be applied to other mammalian populations analysis whenever several population parameters and various extrinsic conditions are available as time series data for the same period there is a body of theory showing that the relationship between the guanaco counts and the matrix coefficients reflects a genuine relationship doak et al 2005 wisdom et al 2000 modelling the coefficients with part of the series and using the other part for validation purposes was initially considered but two factors persuaded us against it a the time series for parameter estimation and prediction verification would become too short and b during those 40 years of data there is a marked trend from a very small initial population to a fairly large population oscillating around its carrying capacity by splitting this time series in two parts would make impossible carried out the coefficients validation and would make impossible the detection of the observed trend from a small population with an almost exponential population growth rate to a high density population oscillating near its carrying capacity the demographic parameters estimated in our study seem to conform well to values available in the literature in a guanaco study carried out in the san pablo de valdés reserve chubut province argentina adult survival was 0 97 around 0 86 0 87 for newborns and the average recruitment was 0 26 0 18 and 0 32 marino et al 2016 likewise franklin and fritz 1991 found that in torres del paine national park southern chile the annual survival of newborns juveniles and adults was 0 74 0 86 and 0 91 respectively almost identical to the results of our matrix coefficient estimates for the cameron ranch 0 73 0 86 and 0 91 respectively however their estimate of the fecundity female newborns per female was higher 0 34 than the fecundity estimated at the cameron ranch 0 24 between 1991 and 1992 gustafson et al 1998 found that also in torres del paine national park within the first 10 days of life the average survival of guanaco newborns was 0 85 which is a plausible value before reaching a lower survival of 0 74 after one year of life as newborns however we should remark that the main cause of mortality found by gustafson et al 1998 was the puma which is not present in the cameron ranch our results also conform well with the generalization that environmental variation and density dependence co occur and have similar effects on various fitness components for large herbivore populations galliard et al 2000 interestingly this pattern is independent of body mass taxonomic group and ecological conditions our results also conform well with the general conclusions of galliard et al 2000 that adult female survival should show little year to year variation with cv 10 yearling survival should show moderate year to year variation with cv 20 and fertility should show strong variation with cv 30 however our cv estimated for juvenile survival was 8 7 while galliard et al 2000 indicated the cv for juvenile survival is often 30 this difference indicates a that survival of guanaco newborns seems more stable than in other ungulates maybe as a result of the lack of important predators the puma is absent in the cameron ranch and the human offtake is regulated to a relatively low level more field studies particularly with marked individuals are necessary to evaluate the effect of these events on the guanaco population and elucidate this departure from theoretical expected results some of the differences between our results and those found in some of the ungulate literature possibly reflect the difficulty in isolating climatic factors from density dependent effects a serious problem encountered by weladji et al 2002 in the analysis of rangifer tarandus and other ungulates we believe that the relation between precipitation and guanaco fertility is well founded since precipitation affects directly primary productivity and therefore on the availability of foraging resources and the nutritional state condition of females raedeke 1979 franklin 1982 additionally marino et al 2016 suggest that there is no density dependence on fertility the effect of density on adult survival has also been recorded in other large mammalian herbivore populations in three african ungulates the effect of density on adult survival was evident above some threshold density owen smith 2006 in our study density dependence was detected only at high densities roughly above 14 guanaco km² because the ddf factor only differed from 1 when the population abundance was near its carrying capacity as observed in other species such as the black rhino cromsigt et al 2002 moreover our result that density dependence affected mainly the female adult survival conforms well with another of our results that the guanaco population rate of growth is by far most sensitive to the guanaco female adult survival from a biological and ecological standpoint this seems reasonable because adults are a class involving individuals up to 15 20 years of age while the newborn and juvenile stages are composed of a one year age class each the function we used to represent the density dependence process conforms well with non linear density dependent functions in population matrix models such as the inverted logistic for survival pennycuick et al 1968 beddington 1974 also flexible functions of this type have been widely used to describe the effect of density on different features of the life history watt 1960 the average carrying capacity of the guanaco population of the cameron ranch based upon the last 17 years when the population seemed to stabilize was 46 694 guanacos 9384 std dev which is quite similar to the 46 563 guanacos estimated in zubillaga et al 2014 using a non structured mathematical model the estimation of this parameter is of importance for it is part of the density dependent equation see eq 2 it should be noted that this estimation of carrying capacity is a bcc biological carrying capacity and not a ccc cultural carrying capacity sensu minnis and peyton 1995 which was applied to the guanaco sheep conflict by hernández et al 2017 our exclusion of sheep abundance from the mmra analysis doesn t mean that sheep management is not important for guanaco conservation guanaco abundance is likely to have a stronger effect than sheep abundance on guanaco demographic parameters because there is a spatial segregation between guanacos and domestic herbivores schroeder et al 2013 hernández et al 2017 we believe that the negative correlation between sheep and guanaco may reflect avoidance by guanacos of sites used by sheep rather than a possible effect of sheep on guanaco demographic parameters this assumption is in accordance with the findings of pedrana et al 2010 who using species distribution modelling methods found that the probability of guanaco occurrence decreased in places with moderate to high values of sheep abundance additionally messier 1994 showed that in the north american moose alces alces there is a complex combined effect between density dependent food competition and predation by wolves resulting in two density equilibrium conditions the absence on the cameron ranch of the puma the main guanaco predator simplified our analysis because we would not expect multiple equilibra guanacos are known to behave both as sedentary animals as well as dispersing ones for example iranzo et al 2018 found that in torres del paine national park and its surroundings in southern chile guanaco abundance significantly declined with increasing distance from the center of the local distribution and marginally with predation risk and that social structures showed only minor differences between areas pointing to a diffusive dispersal pattern these results suggest that the population in torres del paine national park is already well established and we believe that the cameron ranch is in a similar condition on the other hand there are also seasonal movements novaro et al 2009 estimated the seasonal abundance of guanacos and livestock using transect counts during 2005 2009 in the 450 000 ha payunia reserve of mendoza argentina and observed that 63 out of 17 individuals of radio collared guanacos migrated seasonally between summer and winter ranges neither of these two conditions would affect the population matrix model here used because the population estimates were made in the same month every year and any potential individuals lost by dispersal would be compensated by potential individuals added also by dispersal we didn t take into account senescence a decline of survival with increasing age bleu et al 2015 found in two chamois populations that senescence responded differently to environmental variation in different age classes suggesting that senescence patterns are not fixed within a species this process was also found in wild boar sus scrofa females gamelon et al 2014 these authors concluded that in evolutionary terms in ungulates the timing of senescence not its rate is associated with the magnitude of fertility this is probably the situation for guanacos with females showing a delayed onset of senescence and relatively low fertility although possibly data to test this process directly at our study site might exist because of the annually harvested animals that data was not available to us but we would expect the same pattern in guanacos because guanaco individuals can obtain only a limited amount of energy and thus cannot maximize both reproductive output and survival law 1979 and as guanacos are considered reproductive throughout all their life raedeke 1979 they may not have a reproductive senescent period the are several advantages of our stage structured matrix model if it were applied to guanaco population management the identification of age groups makes the model more amenable to include other factors such as predation by puma and foxes that attack more frequently the newborns a selective offtake e g harvesting only adults or only adults and juveniles and poaching that usually go after adults the largest individuals for their weight in meat additionally for the same reasons of being age group specific our model is also more amenable to an adaptive management framework because testing refining and eventually improving the model s performance is facilitated by the age group structure of the model because those age groups are easily identifiable in the field in summary we were able to disentangle the role of weather and density dependence in the population regulation of guanacos on the cameron ranch chile our results add a new example of the various ways in which ungulate species have responded to selection to their environment and evolved to maximize their fitness under climate uncertainty acknowledgments this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in

25224,the guanaco lama guanicoe is one of the two south american native wild camelid species and despite its important ecological role and economic value conservationists are in a permanent conflict with sheep ranchers currently management programs are being developed in argentina and chile to guarantee guanaco and grassland conservation we developed a non linear simulation three stages structured matrix model of guanaco population dynamics with climatic and density dependence effects that can be used as a tool to devise optimal management interventions we estimated population parameters using a 41 year time series data from a guanaco population in tierra del fuego chile we conducted a multivariate multiple regression analysis between matrix demographic parameters survival at each stage and fertility as dependent variables and climatic variables and population density as independent variables guanaco density was significantly correlated with female newborn and adult annual survival while annual precipitation correlated significantly with the fertility females born per female per year in contrast to population regulation mechanisms commonly seen in other ungulate species this guanaco model allows the evaluation of the effects of different events e g offtake particular dry or wet years poaching on specific sexes and life stages which is the field information commonly available keywords demographic parameters guanaco multivariate multiple regression population regulation south american camelids ungulates 1 introduction the guanaco lama guanicoe one of the two wild camelid species of south america is a seasonal breeder with a resource defence polygyny mating system franklin 1983 1982 it has an average gestation period of 11 5 months gives birth to only one offspring per female per season and breeds in summer within a couple of weeks following parturition from december to mid february franklin 1982 in the wild females breed for the first time at 2 years of age raedeke 1979 currently the guanaco occupies only 26 of its original range baldi et al 2016 and its range distribution has been reduced by 60 in argentina 75 in chile franklin et al 1997 and over 90 in perú bolivia and paraguay cunazza et al 1995 additionally its distribution has become fragmented having small relatively isolated populations baldi et al 2016 however this species was not considered as a threatened species but was assigned a least concern status in the iucn red list of threatened species baldi et al 2016 based upon its wide continental distribution around one million km2 its presumed total population size around one million adults and the presence of numerous protected areas across its range of distribution for the same reasons the guanaco has been included in appendix ii of cites cites 2015 which implies the regulation of international commerce of meat and fine fiber products to insure that such trade does not threaten the guanaco s survival by requiring that management plans have been put in place this species has high conservation interest and economic value and it is embedded in socioeconomic and political conflicts between conservation groups and sheep ranchers baldi et al 2016 this conflict results from an apparent guanaco sheep competition for food and water resources baldi et al 2001 2004 currently different management programs are being developed in argentina and chile in an attempt to resolve this unsettled situation and guarantee both guanaco and grassland conservation nonetheless those management programs do not evaluate possible effects of potential management actions and environmental influences on the population dynamics of guanacos because although there are some works which considered age structured models for this species in the chilean island of tierra del fuego franklin and fritz 1991 and elsewhere rabinovich 1995 there are no studies showing how density dependent processes and climatic factors may differentially affect guanaco age or stage classes density dependence has been incorporated in population models since the conception of the logistic model of population growth dennis and taper 1994 proposed a discrete density dependent stochastic logistic model to test the existence of density dependence processes this model and others derived from it are still frequently used for demographic studies as well as for wildlife management keyser et al 2006 hostetler et al 2013 however models that differentiate individuals by sex age or stage can be more useful when comparing different management strategies as expressed by gordon et al 2004 the long term population dynamics research has revealed fundamental differences in how sex age classes are affected by changes in density and weather consequently management must be tailored to the age and sex structure of the population rather than to simple population counts structured demographic models are useful because they provide explanations of population dynamics in terms of the fates of individuals in each class mentis 1977 objected to the use of non structured logistic type population models to estimate the maximum harvestable yield because the harvesting is likely to alter the age distribution and therefore r and caswell and fujiwara 2004 consider that in age or stage structured models modelling relationships between a species life cycle and its population dynamics is richer and more realistic in the logistic population model the optimal per capita harvest rate to achieve maximum sustained yield is h r 2 r being the intrinsic rate of population increase while in a stage structured model it is h r λ λ being the finite rate of population growth williams et al 2002 many years have passed since structured models began to be used to describe population dynamics leslie 1959 proposed the first stage structured model with a linear restriction on survival from one age to the next as a function of the population size jensen 1995 developed a variation of the matrix model of liu and cohen 1987 based on a discrete time form of the logistic equation that was successfully applied to a grey wolf population in a limited environment miller et al 2002 these structured models have also become usual tools in conservation biology and wildlife management e g jensen 1996 developed a harvest model for white tailed deer odocoileus virginianus borealis based on a density dependent matrix model to determine the maximum sustainable yield evaluate the effect of harvest on fecundity and survival of each age group and to estimate the age structure of the optimum yield in the case of south american camelids there only a few non age structured models rabinovich 1985 shaw et al 2012 zubillaga et al 2014 marino et al 2014 and only two age structured population matrix models that have been developed for guanacos franklin and fritz 1991 rabinovich 1995 however none of them included density dependent and climate components these two components are very important in ungulate dynamics particularly for species that show relatively low fecundity and long longevity as is the case of guanacos it was found that in this kind of species usually a depression of both fecundity and survival results with increases in population density particularly in winter time clutton brock et al 1997 determining their particular dynamic population pattern we used a stage structured model to test the hypothesis that both density dependence and climatic processes regulate and or limit guanaco populations we also used this model to determine which guanaco stage class is more sensitive to density dependent or climatic factors and set the grounds for its future use as model to inform management decisions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we used a 41 year long time series 1977 2017 of data from a wild guanaco population sampled in the 2000 km2 cameron ranch 53 9 s 69 3 w located in the central northern part of the island of tierra del fuego chile at an altitude of 0 300 m the area has a mean annual precipitation of 370 6 mm sd 51 8 and a mean annual temperature of 6 55 c sd 0 35 it is characterized by undulating terrain with abundant streams and valleys and presence of peat bogs in the lower elevations a single major river the río grande runs through the area the region is a mosaic of steppe pampa and forest biomes the latter is composed by deciduous forests dominated by lenga nothofagus pumilio and ñire n antartica the steppe is composed of species of stipa festuca berberis baccharis empetrum azorella trifolium agrostis poa hordeum grasses as well as species of juncacea and cyperacea and of the genera carex and sphagnum peat bogs on tierra del fuego island guanacos are not preyed upon by pumas puma concolor as they are in continental populations soto 2010 see zubillaga et al 2014 for more detailed information on the study site 2 2 field sampling counts of visible guanacos took place during the post reproductive period february april and lasted approximately 7 days counts occurred daily between 10 30 and 19 00 h with two observers in each of two 4 4 vehicles driving the main secondary and local roads at a maximum speed of 40 km h each road was covered only once and particular care was taken to avoid duplication of counts at road intersections guanacos were counted for 41 consecutive years between 1977 and 2017 with the exception of years 1986 and 1996 for those two years we linearly interpolated the population count using counts from the adjacent years from 1977 to 2000 a transect with a variable width was used to spot guanacos and from 2001 to 2017 a transect with a fixed width band of 500 m to each side of the transect was used tellería 1986 davis and winstead 1987 caughley 1980 buckland et al 1993 in addition to individual guanaco counts the following were recorded for each observation weather conditions time distance km from the starting point coordinates observation distance from the transect m and an estimate of the angle to the animals locations when the animals were observed in groups the number of individuals and the social type of the group family groups constituted by an territorial male several females and their offspring bachelor groups constituted principally by non reproductive juvenile and adult males and solitary males franklin 1982 1983 were also recorded as well as its age class structure newborns juveniles and adults there are other minor variations on this classification in social units of patagonian guanacos like mixed groups and female groups ortega and franklin 1995 iranzo et al 2018 but the one we used covers the dominant social units and the easiest to recognize in the field the road network and all geo referenced observations were processed with the arcview 9 3 geographical information system gis and transferred to a spreadsheet using program map source cartography was kindly provided by the agriculture and livestock service from chile despite randomly selected transects are recommended eberhardt 1978 pre existing roads were used because according to soto 2010 the existing system of roads cover an adequate sample of the whole area the area effectively surveyed in each sampling period was around 420 km2 which represents about 20 of the study area existing roads may not comply with the requirement of random transects to survey wildlife populations however in the case of the area occupied by the guanacos in tierra del fuego chile two field surveys were made comparing guanaco counts using existing roads with guanaco aerial surveys based on systematic transects one such comparison was made in the area of the río cóndor forest project forestal savia ltda 2002 and the second in san gregorio commune province of magallanes corcoran and graells 2015 sag 2015 the results of the former field comparison showed that the aerial survey estimated 11 less guanacos than the road survey but no detailed information to estimate a statistical significance of this difference was provided the latter resulted in aerial population estimate of 63 540 guanacos while the road survey resulted in a population estimate of 62 692 guanacos range 59 058 66 327 the road count range includes the population estimated with the aerial survey providing the necessary assurance that the guanaco road count can be considered acceptable on the other hand neither the road counts nor the aerial surveys estimate guanaco numbers in the forested areas because of the low visibility there but at the time when the annual surveys are carried out most of the guanaco population is found in the grasslands additionally as the regulations in chile prohibit hunting along roads the annual variations in hunting pressure should not affect guanaco counts that are made along existing roads the population size was estimated as given in soto 2010 which was based on the king method modified by leopold 1933 and described by raedeke 1979 the population estimate n is given by n a n 2 y x where a is the total study area n is the total number of animals counted x is the total transect distance covered rounded to one meter and y is the average of the perpendicular distance from the transect to the animals counted the factor of 2 is included to consider that there is one band to each side of the transect the variance s 2 of the population estimate is given by s 2 n p 2 1 p n n 2 with p n n this variance was used to estimate the 95 upper and lower confidence intervals soto 2010 compared population estimates by the leopold and distance methods and found that the value of the means estimated by the leopold method fall within the confidence intervals estimated by the distance method all sampling periods used the same field methodology in the case of undetermined animals or social units in the survey we distributed them into each of the three social units family groups bachelor groups and solitary males using the 41 years average proportion of each of these social units 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 outlier analysis time series outliers may have important impacts on population model predictions trívez 1994 we searched for possible outliers using the tsoutliers package in r lopez de lacalle 2014 r version 3 2 1 www r project org for non linear time series chen and liu 1993 this package can be applied to seasonal and non seasonal autoregressive moving average arma processes detecting types and effects of outliers and their location outliers can be classified in four types according to their effect on the series given the dynamic process of the guanaco the outliers the use of additive outliers ao of the tsoutliers package was justified events an external effect affect a time series in a single instant of time and causes an immediate and one shot effect on the observed series trívez 1994 chen and liu 1993 once an ao was detected we corrected it by averaging the population estimates from the previous and following years 2 4 population matrix model we used a female only stage structured matrix population model lefkovitch 1965 according to their size and behaviour female guanacos were differentiated in three classes newborns individuals aged 0 1 years juveniles individuals aged 1 2 years not sexually mature and adults individuals 2 years old sexually mature although guanaco males may reach sexual maturity at over 3 years old when testes are functional and some females 2 yrs old may become mature if they are over 80 of their adult body weight the former cannot be represented in a female only model and the latter represents only a small fraction of the female juvenile population the projection matrix a has the fertility in the first row and last column indicating that only adults reproduce the annual survival of individuals of each stage in the diagonal and the annual transition probabilities between stages in the sub diagonal caswell 2001 the projection matrix we used is given by a 0 0 f s n 0 0 0 s j s a where f is fertility female newborns per adult female per year and sa represents female adult annual survival as the newborn and juvenile stages last 1 year their transition probabilities are the survival from one year to the next represented by sn and sj respectively the projection operation can be written as 1 n t 1 a n t where n t is a vector with the number of female individuals in each age class at time t we used a model step time projection interval t of 1 year for each simulation period we sum each stage of the female population vector n to obtain the total female population we estimated the total population female and male multiplying the female model predictions by 2 because the newborn sex ratio is 1 1 franklin and johnson 1994 and we found no reliable information suggesting differential survival between male and female individuals sarno et al 1999 sarno and franklin 1999 2 4 1 parameter estimation we implemented the population matrix model in an excel spreadsheet with one population matrix for every year of data and parameterized the four matrix coefficients for each year of data to estimate the annual matrix coefficients we used the solver tool in excel spreadsheet version 2010 minimizing separately the sum of the square error sse between field counts and model predictions of newborns on one hand and of pooled juvenile and adult classes on the other hand the latter procedure was used because the field identification between juveniles and adults wasn t as reliable as that of the newborns the pool of the juvenile and adult classes was made exclusively for the purpose of having a more consistent goodness of fit measure and does preclude the use of a three stage projection matrix model and because it results in a more accurate fecundity estimation a pool of juvenile and adult females in one stage class leading to a 2 2 stage matrix population model would under estimate the fecundity because juveniles are a non reproductive class since from a time series of t years only t 1 transition matrices are possible from our 41 years long time series we obtained 40 projection matrices the four matrix parameters of the 40 matrices were estimated simultaneously by the solver tool i e the 160 parameters were simultaneously modified in each iteration we used the generalized reduced gradient grg non linear option of solver which usually converged to a minimum sse in between one to five minutes of computing time we constrained the possible annual survival coefficient estimates to be 0 99 and the adult female fertility estimates to be 0 5 because they are the biological maxima for these parameters during the time period of the field guanaco population data series there were 13 seven events of adult guanaco harvests years 1980 1982 1999 2003 2005 2006 2010 2015 and 2017 with harvests of 100 100 69 1700 2000 2000 1500 1461 2176 2220 1804 401 and 988 individuals respectively to include the harvest events in our model we subtracted the number of field harvested adult individuals from the modelled adult population at simulated time t 1 because in the field the population is sampled before it is harvested so that the effects of the harvest become manifest in the population when sampled at the following year 2 4 2 sensitivity and elasticity analysis we carried out a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of the each of the four matrix model parameters on the finite population growth rate λ because transition probabilities and fertility are measured on different scales we also conducted an elasticity analysis to measure proportional sensitivity caswell 2001 the elasticity analysis was carried out for each annual projection matrix to evaluate possible elasticity changes among years using the poptools application for excel version 2010 2 5 density dependent and climatic factors to test our hypothesis that density dependent processes and climatic factors regulate and limit guanaco population size respectively we used the point estimates of the annual projection matrix coefficients and tested statistically their possible relationship with total annual guanaco density estimates the sheep presence and climatic factors the projection matrix coefficients cannot follow a normal distribution because they are asymmetric and also truncated on both tails we therefore checked the underlying statistical distribution of all four matrix coefficients we fitted the 40 years of the projection matrix coefficient estimates to four statistical distributions the normal distribution and three non symmetric distributions weibull gamma and lognormal using the fitdistrplus package in r delignette muller and dutang 2015 with a special modification to account for the particular case of truncated data c dutang personal communication using the truncdits package in r novomestky et al 2016 when more than one statistical model resulted in a statistically significant fit we selected the best one based on the akaike information criterion aic we evaluated the possible effect of density and or climate on the projection matrix coefficients by a multiple multivariate regression analysis mmra and a multivariate analysis of variance manova to account for correlations among responses friendly 2007 mmra fixes experiment wide error rates and the significance level α is adjusted to account for simultaneous testing of many variables to maintain the overall α at the level set by the researcher rencher 2002 to determine if the inter annual variation of the matrix coefficients was related to density and or climate variables we used the stage specific matrix coefficients as dependent variables and as independent variables we selected the following total guanaco population size sheep abundance annual precipitation annual and winter temperature annual precipitation with a lag of 1 year annual and winter temperature with a lag of 1 year 2 yr average annual precipitation 3 yr average annual precipitation and total guanaco population size with a lag of 1 year the winter period was from june to august because the population data come from a post breeding survey february april and annual climatic data were taken from january to december we considered the lags in climatic effects as affecting the population counts in the following year sheep abundance data were based on the time series shown in zubillaga et al 2014 and the series was extended until 2016 using information provided by the agriculture and livestock service of chile fifteen years of data were available 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2006 2008 2016 with sheep abundances of 45 000 43 000 41 000 26 000 35 000 37 000 37 227 25 789 45 370 45 360 19 900 24 215 26 075 33 100 30 025 and 27 271 animals respectively in 1995 an extremely harsh winter resulted in the death of 15 000 sheep in addition to the standing sheep count for 1995 so we corrected the 1995 sheep count to 41 000 sheep 26 000 sheep in 1995 plus 15 000 winter killed sheep additionally sheep numbers changed smoothly between years personal information by mr dalmiro guineo 2011 administrator of cameron ranch kevin mac lean 2009 administrator of cameron ranch and chilean statistics of agriculture and livestock service 2006 we used the baboon package in r meinfelder et al 2015 to conduct a bayesian bootstrap predictive mean matching multiple and single imputation algorithm a procedure considered to be more efficient than parametric methods for discrete data when missing data are very abundant we imputed the missing data between years with baboon package sheep estimates we used 29 years of climactic data 1974 2002 for the cameron ranch from the climatic research unit cru ts 2 1 database compiled by the tyndall centre cru school of environmental sciences of the university of east anglia united kingdom http www cru uea ac uk cru data hrg htm because the cru data ended in 2002 we completed that time series from 2003 to 2017 with data from punta arenas chile the closest meteorological station to cameron ranch 340 km away these data were downloaded from the meteorological service of chile http www meteochile gob cl the mmra method assumes no collinearity among the independent variables friendly 2007 we checked for collinearity among the independent variables using the software statistica statsoft inc 2009 version 9 0 www statsoft com we implemented the mmra modelling using the package candisc friendly 2007 in r and used the statistically significant relationships obtained with the mmra to select the independent variables correlated with the projection s matrix coefficients as multiplicative factors given that since 2010 the harvest was an annual except for 2016 and with increased offtakes we decided to carry out the analysis by time segments in order to avoid the offtake masking the possible effect of density dependence or of climate a first segment was 34 year long 1977 2010 and a second segment included the last 15 years as the response variables do not have normal distribution a log odds transformation was applied to the matrix coefficients fertility and survival of newborns juveniles and adults anticipating that the guanaco population could be regulated by the total guanaco population size we considered the effect of density dependence using seven different candidate functions bellows 1981 and found that the ullyett function ullyett 1950 provided the most flexible sigmoid form of density dependence this function was implemented replacing nt population size by the variable dpk eq 2 2 d d f 1 1 e d p k a b where ddf is the density dependent factor 0 ddf 1 dpk is the density of the guanaco population expressed as a proportion of its carrying capacity k and a and b are parameters to be estimated as an estimate of k we used the result obtained by zubillaga et al 2014 for the guanaco population of cameron ranch k 46 563 guanacos which represents the average carrying capacity around which the population size fluctuates to incorporate the effects of climatic factors clf in the simulation model we used a linear regression through the origin eq 3 3 c l f c c v a r where c is a parameter to be estimated and cvar are the climatic variables precipitation or temperature we expressed cvar as a relative proportion calculated as cvar 1 annual value of the climatic variable long term average of the annual climatic variable long term average of the annual climatic variable our definition of cvar sums a value of 1 to the relative proportion to avoid negative numbers and allows it to be used as a multiplicative factor this format also provides more generalizability to the climatic effects i e it can be applied to a new location we estimated the a b and c parameters of the density dependent and climatic factor equations using the solver utility of excel applied to the average of the 40 values of the estimated matrix coefficients in order to obtain a single set of values of the parameters a b and c which in the simulations is annually affected by the inter annual variation of the model s covariates total population density and precipitation or temperature we calculated confidence intervals for these estimated parameters using a monte carlo simulation method as proposed by lambert et al 2012 3 results 3 1 data analysis 3 1 1 outlier analysis we found two outliers in the population time series total population sizes of 33 125 guanacos for year 2007 and 56 973 guanacos for 2011 and we replaced them by the new values 56 895 and 45 073 guanacos respectively table s1 in supporting information 3 2 population matrix model 3 2 1 population matrix parameter estimation the estimated values of the 160 matrix coefficients four coefficients for each of the 40 matrices are given in table s1 in the supporting information table 1 shows the average and coefficient of variation of fertility and annual survival of newborns juveniles and adults resulting in an intrinsic rate of natural increase of r 0 051 and the population finite rate of growth was λ 1 052 for this guanaco population 3 2 2 sensitivity and elasticity analysis using the average value of the matrix coefficients the one with the highest impact on λ was adult survival 0 69 while juvenile survival newborn survival and fertility had the same much lower impact 0 10 when using each of the 40 estimated annual transition matrices adult survival also had the strongest effect on λ table s2 in supporting information 3 3 density dependent and climatic factors 3 3 1 collinearity analysis winter temperature with and without lags and precipitation with and without lags and total guanaco population size were not collinear and were kept in the mmr analysis table s3 in supporting information sheep abundance was significantly and negatively correlated with guanaco abundance r² 0 5 p 0 0001 we decided to keep the guanaco density as the independent variable for the mmra because 1 we wanted to evaluate the effect of the guanaco density on demographic parameters 2 we didn t find any literature supporting the idea that sheep abundance causes a change in guanaco survival or fertility and 3 the negative correlation between guanaco and sheep is likely to be related to guanaco avoidance of sheep and human activity rather than to a change in guanaco survival or fertility marino et al 2016 3 3 2 multiple multivariate regression analysis the manova pillai test statistic indicated for the first segment of the time series 1977 2010 that guanaco population size n was significantly p 0 044 test statistic 0 314 approx f 2 86 correlated to sn p 0 035 and sa p 0 016 annual precipitation a pp was significantly correlated to f p 0 026 effect of population size on juvenile survival sj p 0 90 was considered too weak and was not included for the final segment of the time series 2011 2017 no statistically significant effect of any independent variable was obtained ddf was incorporated as affecting newborn and adult survivals and clf affecting the fertility so we fitted five parameters two for each ddf and one for clf the monte carlo estimates of the parameters ddf function were a1 median 1 79 lower ci 1 47 upper ci 2 03 and b1 median 14 34 lower ci 12 09 upper ci 16 08 a2 median 1 16 lower ci 1 09 upper ci 1 35 and b2 median 22 51 lower ci 13 49 upper ci 50 99 and the precipitation effect in the clf function was c median 1 27 lower ci 1 18 upper ci 1 36 the final non linear stage specific population projection matrix with density dependence and climate effects was a 0 0 0 24 c l f 0 73 d d f 1 0 0 0 0 86 0 91 d d f 2 predictions from this population model conformed well to the observed guanaco population with population size fluctuating around the average carrying capacity fig 1 the range of clf was 0 98 and 1 78 between all years resulting in an increase in fertility by up to 78 highest precipitation values and a decrease by down to 2 lowest precipitation values the effective fertility i e average fertility clf oscillated between 0 24 and 0 43 due to the effect of precipitation the estimated ddf ranged between 0 81 and 1 leading to an adult survival decrease of 19 at high population densities 4 discussion analyses of vital rates and factors that affect them are often made by univariate methods even if more than one dependent variable is evaluated univariate and multivariate analyses may give different results and lead to different conclusions friendly 2007 mmra is more appropriate than univariate multiple regression analysis for assessing potential relationships among several dependent and several independent variables and determining which of the independent variables should be incorporated in the final model this is the first application of mmra to a mammal population regulation analysis we recommend this type of analysis to be applied to other mammalian populations analysis whenever several population parameters and various extrinsic conditions are available as time series data for the same period there is a body of theory showing that the relationship between the guanaco counts and the matrix coefficients reflects a genuine relationship doak et al 2005 wisdom et al 2000 modelling the coefficients with part of the series and using the other part for validation purposes was initially considered but two factors persuaded us against it a the time series for parameter estimation and prediction verification would become too short and b during those 40 years of data there is a marked trend from a very small initial population to a fairly large population oscillating around its carrying capacity by splitting this time series in two parts would make impossible carried out the coefficients validation and would make impossible the detection of the observed trend from a small population with an almost exponential population growth rate to a high density population oscillating near its carrying capacity the demographic parameters estimated in our study seem to conform well to values available in the literature in a guanaco study carried out in the san pablo de valdés reserve chubut province argentina adult survival was 0 97 around 0 86 0 87 for newborns and the average recruitment was 0 26 0 18 and 0 32 marino et al 2016 likewise franklin and fritz 1991 found that in torres del paine national park southern chile the annual survival of newborns juveniles and adults was 0 74 0 86 and 0 91 respectively almost identical to the results of our matrix coefficient estimates for the cameron ranch 0 73 0 86 and 0 91 respectively however their estimate of the fecundity female newborns per female was higher 0 34 than the fecundity estimated at the cameron ranch 0 24 between 1991 and 1992 gustafson et al 1998 found that also in torres del paine national park within the first 10 days of life the average survival of guanaco newborns was 0 85 which is a plausible value before reaching a lower survival of 0 74 after one year of life as newborns however we should remark that the main cause of mortality found by gustafson et al 1998 was the puma which is not present in the cameron ranch our results also conform well with the generalization that environmental variation and density dependence co occur and have similar effects on various fitness components for large herbivore populations galliard et al 2000 interestingly this pattern is independent of body mass taxonomic group and ecological conditions our results also conform well with the general conclusions of galliard et al 2000 that adult female survival should show little year to year variation with cv 10 yearling survival should show moderate year to year variation with cv 20 and fertility should show strong variation with cv 30 however our cv estimated for juvenile survival was 8 7 while galliard et al 2000 indicated the cv for juvenile survival is often 30 this difference indicates a that survival of guanaco newborns seems more stable than in other ungulates maybe as a result of the lack of important predators the puma is absent in the cameron ranch and the human offtake is regulated to a relatively low level more field studies particularly with marked individuals are necessary to evaluate the effect of these events on the guanaco population and elucidate this departure from theoretical expected results some of the differences between our results and those found in some of the ungulate literature possibly reflect the difficulty in isolating climatic factors from density dependent effects a serious problem encountered by weladji et al 2002 in the analysis of rangifer tarandus and other ungulates we believe that the relation between precipitation and guanaco fertility is well founded since precipitation affects directly primary productivity and therefore on the availability of foraging resources and the nutritional state condition of females raedeke 1979 franklin 1982 additionally marino et al 2016 suggest that there is no density dependence on fertility the effect of density on adult survival has also been recorded in other large mammalian herbivore populations in three african ungulates the effect of density on adult survival was evident above some threshold density owen smith 2006 in our study density dependence was detected only at high densities roughly above 14 guanaco km² because the ddf factor only differed from 1 when the population abundance was near its carrying capacity as observed in other species such as the black rhino cromsigt et al 2002 moreover our result that density dependence affected mainly the female adult survival conforms well with another of our results that the guanaco population rate of growth is by far most sensitive to the guanaco female adult survival from a biological and ecological standpoint this seems reasonable because adults are a class involving individuals up to 15 20 years of age while the newborn and juvenile stages are composed of a one year age class each the function we used to represent the density dependence process conforms well with non linear density dependent functions in population matrix models such as the inverted logistic for survival pennycuick et al 1968 beddington 1974 also flexible functions of this type have been widely used to describe the effect of density on different features of the life history watt 1960 the average carrying capacity of the guanaco population of the cameron ranch based upon the last 17 years when the population seemed to stabilize was 46 694 guanacos 9384 std dev which is quite similar to the 46 563 guanacos estimated in zubillaga et al 2014 using a non structured mathematical model the estimation of this parameter is of importance for it is part of the density dependent equation see eq 2 it should be noted that this estimation of carrying capacity is a bcc biological carrying capacity and not a ccc cultural carrying capacity sensu minnis and peyton 1995 which was applied to the guanaco sheep conflict by hernández et al 2017 our exclusion of sheep abundance from the mmra analysis doesn t mean that sheep management is not important for guanaco conservation guanaco abundance is likely to have a stronger effect than sheep abundance on guanaco demographic parameters because there is a spatial segregation between guanacos and domestic herbivores schroeder et al 2013 hernández et al 2017 we believe that the negative correlation between sheep and guanaco may reflect avoidance by guanacos of sites used by sheep rather than a possible effect of sheep on guanaco demographic parameters this assumption is in accordance with the findings of pedrana et al 2010 who using species distribution modelling methods found that the probability of guanaco occurrence decreased in places with moderate to high values of sheep abundance additionally messier 1994 showed that in the north american moose alces alces there is a complex combined effect between density dependent food competition and predation by wolves resulting in two density equilibrium conditions the absence on the cameron ranch of the puma the main guanaco predator simplified our analysis because we would not expect multiple equilibra guanacos are known to behave both as sedentary animals as well as dispersing ones for example iranzo et al 2018 found that in torres del paine national park and its surroundings in southern chile guanaco abundance significantly declined with increasing distance from the center of the local distribution and marginally with predation risk and that social structures showed only minor differences between areas pointing to a diffusive dispersal pattern these results suggest that the population in torres del paine national park is already well established and we believe that the cameron ranch is in a similar condition on the other hand there are also seasonal movements novaro et al 2009 estimated the seasonal abundance of guanacos and livestock using transect counts during 2005 2009 in the 450 000 ha payunia reserve of mendoza argentina and observed that 63 out of 17 individuals of radio collared guanacos migrated seasonally between summer and winter ranges neither of these two conditions would affect the population matrix model here used because the population estimates were made in the same month every year and any potential individuals lost by dispersal would be compensated by potential individuals added also by dispersal we didn t take into account senescence a decline of survival with increasing age bleu et al 2015 found in two chamois populations that senescence responded differently to environmental variation in different age classes suggesting that senescence patterns are not fixed within a species this process was also found in wild boar sus scrofa females gamelon et al 2014 these authors concluded that in evolutionary terms in ungulates the timing of senescence not its rate is associated with the magnitude of fertility this is probably the situation for guanacos with females showing a delayed onset of senescence and relatively low fertility although possibly data to test this process directly at our study site might exist because of the annually harvested animals that data was not available to us but we would expect the same pattern in guanacos because guanaco individuals can obtain only a limited amount of energy and thus cannot maximize both reproductive output and survival law 1979 and as guanacos are considered reproductive throughout all their life raedeke 1979 they may not have a reproductive senescent period the are several advantages of our stage structured matrix model if it were applied to guanaco population management the identification of age groups makes the model more amenable to include other factors such as predation by puma and foxes that attack more frequently the newborns a selective offtake e g harvesting only adults or only adults and juveniles and poaching that usually go after adults the largest individuals for their weight in meat additionally for the same reasons of being age group specific our model is also more amenable to an adaptive management framework because testing refining and eventually improving the model s performance is facilitated by the age group structure of the model because those age groups are easily identifiable in the field in summary we were able to disentangle the role of weather and density dependence in the population regulation of guanacos on the cameron ranch chile our results add a new example of the various ways in which ungulate species have responded to selection to their environment and evolved to maximize their fitness under climate uncertainty acknowledgments this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in
