11675,traditional human health risk assessment hhra methods are now being replaced with advanced codes in the present study herisk code and water pollution index wpi were employed for hhra and water quality characterization of umunya a suburban in nigeria this study stands out from previous hhras performed in the region by applying the novel herisk code which evaluates health risk for nine human populations the goal of this study was to provide a comprehensive report that will enlighten inhabitants and policymakers on the potential dermal and oral risks associated with the use of metal contaminated water resources for various age brackets in the region standard methods were employed with respect to measured physicochemical parameters the wpi revealed that 66 7 of the water resources were unsuitable for human use based on the herisk code potentially toxic elements ptes increased cancer risks in the following order ni pb cr total non carcinogenic risks of drinking the water was found to be moderate however the cumulative risks due to dermal absorption of the contaminated water were negligible the overall trend observed from the hhra showed that older human populations in the area are less susceptible than younger populations nevertheless it was detected that humans between ages 21 and 65 were less vulnerable than those older than 65 years the findings of the herisk code and wpi had a strong agreement as water samples deemed less fit for human use by the wpi proved to have more health concerns the wpi and herisk code indicated that the most influential ptes in the water were pb and ni respectively thus both ptes expose water users to a higher risk of developing cancer via water ingestion graphical abstract image 1 keywords cancer risk drinking water assessment human health risk assessment hhra potentially toxic elements water quality data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction throughout the history of human life safe water has been a primary need however as the years go by factors that threaten the availability of safe water are on the rise in light of the rising issue developed nations have achieved substantial advancements by purifying polluted water sources to a significant proportion therefore making ample clean water available for citizens subba rao et al 2022a adelodun et al 2021 on the other side many developing nations such as nigeria continue to fall short in these areas resulting in disease outbreaks and in some cases mortality among the disadvantaged as a result of ingesting polluted water high concentrations of potentially toxic elements ptes in water sources are amongst factors that degrade the quality of water some of the ptes commonly found in water include zinc zn cadmium cd iron fe chromium cr arsenic as lead pb nitrate no3 manganese mn amongst others gugulothu et al 2022 subba rao et al 2022b 2021 dippong et al 2020 2018 ro»ôca et al 2020 ptes are usually categorized into carcinogens and non carcinogens carcinogenic ptes include as cd cr pb ni no3 etc whereas non carcinogenic ptes include fe mn zn etc some of the health concerns linked to ptes include abdominal discomfort anemia constipation cramping in the abdomen exhaustion headache irritability low blood pressure mild mood swings nausea pain in the hands feet muscles or joints and a rapid heartbeat shrestha 2018 frith et al 2005 sood et al 2002 studies have identified associations between ptes and cancer some of which include nitrate and colorectal cancer richards et al 2022 nickel and respiratory tract cancer chen et al 2017 lead and cancers of the brain kidney and lung steenland and boffetta 2000 hexavalent chromium cr vi and lung cancer suh et al 2019 cadmium and cancers of the breast lung pancreas and urinary bladder huff et al 2007 and inorganic arsenic and cancers of the liver prostate and kidney benbrahim tallaa and waalkes 2008 due to various impairments induced by intake of polluted water scientists have adopted different strategies for risk assessment of water resources the primary purpose of risk assessment is to preserve not just the health of individuals who live in touch with water either directly or indirectly e g drinking water dietary intake of foods irrigated with water but also the aquatic natural ecosystems geissen et al 2015 traditionally measuring the ecological risk of substances involved comparing its concentrations in environmental compartments with amounts below which detrimental impacts on organisms were unlikely to occur lepper 2002 the techniques for hhra differs slightly in that human exposure through various routes is evaluated prior to comparison with threshold levels geissen et al 2015 hhra is viewed by the united states environmental protection agency us epa as a systematic technique to analyzing the possible health impacts of exposure to specific dangerous compounds in contaminated ecological systems such as water resources golaki et al 2022 in other words human health risk assessment is a systematic methodology for defining the detrimental impacts of exposure to dangerous chemicals golaki et al 2022 according to neris et al 2021 the deterministic technique which includes using a predetermined value to evaluate the hazards associated with chemical pollutant exposure is used by the majority of hhra methodologies in efforts to address these limitations innovative algorithms for evaluating ecological radiological and human health risks have been developed the herisk code is a new code which has been utilized for hhra in different countries studies that have utilized the herisk code express that it offers a more detailed report than other risk assessment tools egbueri et al 2022 neris et al 2021 tenebe et al 2022 umunya is a suburban region located in southeastern nigeria west africa being situated as a suburb industrial and agricultural activities are at their peak in umunya these human activities require the use of water in large amounts for multiple purposes thus it is essential for periodic risk assessment to ensure short and long term wellbeing of human and natural resources previous hhra in umunya and environs focused on two age groups children and adults therefore the current study evaluates the risk of exposure to ptes in water on nine age brackets 1 to less than 2 years 2 to less than 3 years 3 to less than 6 years 6 to less than 11 years 11 to less than 16 years 16 to less than 18 years 18 to less than 21 years 21 to less than 65 years and above 65 years in umunya and environs this was achieved by employing the novel herisk code which different studies have confirmed fit for efficient and effective hhra this research particularly aims to 1 ascertain safety levels of water resources in the region using the water pollution index wpi and 2 conduct a comprehensive hhra on water resources in the study region with focus on two exposure routes oral and dermal for nine human populations using the herisk code it is anticipated that the findings of this study will provide a new perspective for governmental and non governmental agencies in charge of public health management in the region in addition it is hoped that the methodologies findings and research gaps presented in the study will spur future research with the common goal of sustaining human lives and natural waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study region umunya lies within latitude 6 12 34 n and longitude 6 54 51 e in the oyi local government area central anambra state and it shares borders with five major towns and is less than 18 km from the state capital awka the nteje streams and nkwelle ezunaka heath form the northern boundary the umudioka and ifite dunu streams form the southern boundary the ogbunike streams form the western boundary and the awkuzu streams form the eastern boundary the estimated land size of umunya is 4844 sq km being situated in southeastern nigeria umunya and environs are part of the tropical rainforest there are two major seasons experienced within the study region rainy and dry the season with high amount of rainfall lasts from april october with its peak between june and september while the season with low rainfall begins from november march agbasi and egbueri et al 2022 the month with little or no rainfall is december which comes with very dry and cold weather the trade winds are responsible for the seasonal changes experienced within umunya and environs the tropical continental air mass which is commonly referred to as the north east trade wind blows fine cool air and dust from the sahara desert in north africa down to the south and is responsible for the dry season it brings about the harmattan haze which can be likened to fog this usually happens annually from late november to march the south west trade wind commonly referred to as the tropical maritime air mass blows warm air and carries water moisture along with it from the south atlantic ocean into nigeria from april to october and this brings about the rainy season based on the nigerian national census the population of umunya was estimated in 2006 to be 700 000 people however it is anticipated that the human population may have tripled due to increased anthropogenic activities in the study area over time the area is very fertile which encourages agricultural practices the major source of income for the people is agriculture the people of the region are mainly farmers traders and artisan craftsmen people from all over the state come to umunya for fruit and cattle business umunya has the biggest cattle market in the whole of anambra state the town also has one of the biggest abattoirs in central anambra as a result of the large cattle market in the region people come from far and near to buy cattle as this is the most sought after meat in this region the busiest period in umunya is during festivities which sees strangers come from all around the neighborhood to buy cattle for festive celebrations in a day at least 10 cattle are slaughtered in umunya by butchers for consumption umunya and environs lie within the eastern niger delta basin it is underlain by the imo formation and overlain by the paralic ogwashi asaba formation odumodu and mode 2014 according to ogbe and osokpor 2021 the geologic units encountered within umunya and environs are predominantly the nanka formation sands eocene which belongs to the ameki group usually fine to coarse grains of lateritic top soils friable to semi consolidated in nature the eocene nanka formation is very friable and easily gullied the friable nature of the formation is one of the major causes of gully sites in anambra state within the formation are thin mud rock layers shale which may be acting as a sealing unit for the fine to coarse grain sand which serves as a reservoir it has been reported that the nanka formation is of lateral equivalence with the agbada formation of the niger delta basin odumodu and mode 2014 ogbe and osokpor 2021 the nanka formation outcropping in umunya has a ferruginous sandstone unit within different outcrop locations in umunya odumodu and mode 2014 the presence of these ferruginous sandstone layers has affected the quality of groundwater in the region the water table in umunya varies based on geographic location according to usman et al 2015 the groundwater table of nteje is between 21 5m and 102m and the aquifer thickness increases from nw to se some of the reservoirs within umunya are confined and form artisan wells due to the thin mudrock layer capping the reservoir tops 2 2 collection of water samples and laboratory analysis before sampling the probe was confirmed to be correctly calibrated to guarantee accurate and consistent data gathering water sampling followed similar procedure used by emenike et al 2018 the samples were obtained from densely populated areas as well as from key water sources used by the locals for drinking and other household needs the location of each sampling station was recorded using a global positioning system fig 1 a total of fifteen water samples were obtained spring water 1 stream water 2 pipe borne water borehole 12 prewashed 1 l polyethylene bottles were used to store the water samples following collection at each station the samples were properly tagged and stored in a cooler until being delivered to the laboratory for proper examination six metals fe zn mn pb cr and ni and two physiochemical parameters no3 and ph were considered the ph was checked on site using a portable probe while the metals were analyzed using bulk scientific 210 vgp the no3 concentrations were evaluated using titrimetric technique the field activities and sample methods were guided by the criteria of american public health association apha 2012 2005 furthermore during laboratory analysis standard detection limits reagent blanks and routine monitoring were used 2 3 water quality indexing water quality describes the physical biological and chemical status of water usually with respect to their suitability for a particular purpose such as drinking agriculture swimming etc considering numerous indicators used to judge water quality researchers adopted water quality indices wqis these indices incorporate the data of water quality parameters and assign scores values to water samples the assigned values are interpreted using the unique classification scheme of the index and it gives a clear picture of the water wqis identifies whether water is suitable or unsuitable for a predetermined purpose computation of wqis is achieved by comparing data of analyzed water indicators with standards recommended by government authorities the common standards used to evaluate monitor and assess water quality expresses the condition of drinking water the safety of human use and the wellbeing of all in scenarios where significant water quality parameters exceed the accepted limits the water is likely to be unsafe for consumption mukate et al 2019 wqis are one of the most effective techniques to evaluate the quality of water resources for stakeholders involved in the utility of water overtime wqis have become an authoritative tool for the assessment and management of water toma 2012 2 3 1 water pollution index wpi the wpi is a water quality index proposed by hossain and patra 2020 and later followed by ravindra et al 2022 this method is flexible has varied applications and wider usage considering existing water quality standards wpi also offers fundamental information on the condition of water for multipurpose the wpi unlike other indices is not limited to a particular water quality indicator physiochemical metals or water source surface groundwater and can accommodate unlimited water quality indicators in its computation hossain and patra 2020 additionally the wpi does not make use of assigned weights which usually introduces bias to the evaluation of water resources the wpi computation was performed following two easy steps described by hossain and patra 2020 and is as follows first pollution load pli of ith indicator is estimated 1 p l i 1 c i s i s i where c i represents the analyzed value of ith indicator s i represents the recommended limit for the indicator according to guidelines used in the present study eight water quality indicators ph no3 fe zn mn pb cr ni were considered and the who 2017 guidelines for drinking water were adhered to for pli computation of ph it is advised to use a different approach the recommended equation for water samples with ph less than 7 is found in eq 2 2 p l i c i 7 s i a 7 where si a stands for the minimum who acceptable ph value given as 6 5 the suggested equation is presented in eq 3 if the water sample has a ph greater than 7 3 p l i c i 7 s i b 7 si b stands for the maximum who acceptable ph value given as 8 5 finally wpi score of a water sample is computed by summation of the pli of individual parameters and dividing by the number of parameters considered note that in a scenario where the analyzed value of an indicator parameters is zero the parameter ought not be added to the number of parameters n for that case sample 4 w p i 1 n i 1 n p l i 2 4 oral and dermal risk assessment to humans 2 4 1 herisk code computation the herisk code aided spatiotemporal risk evaluation of ptes in water samples collected from the study region the novel code accomplishes space time evaluation by varying the values of age dependent parameters over the period of exposure tenebe et al 2022 more details about the space time evaluation of the herisk code could be found in neris et al 2021 the innovative algorithm was created by customizing the equations from the us epa the algorithm assesses the dangers of pollutants on various initial ages ia 1 2 3 6 11 16 18 21 and 65 years selection of the ias was on the foundation of age brackets recognized by us epa 2011 and was the framework used by the innovative algorithm for generating input variables based on occupant age per time the current research considered two methods of pte pb cr

hubbard and sheridan 1989 low concentration of nitrate might be a result of denitrification dilution plant absorption and precipitation thus moderate no3 found in the present study may be due to the abundance of vegetation which accelerates denitrification low amounts of nitrates and nitrites provide health benefits such as artery stability blood pressure regulation and cardiovascular system protection parvizishad et al 2017 3 1 3 iron fe fe is a trace element which boosts energy supports blood production and helps women have healthy pregnancies a deficiency of iron in the human body could result in anaemia ayejoto et al 2022 moreover excessive levels of fe in water can create a number of issues like arteriosclerosis diabetes liver damage and a range of other neurological diseases in humans bhaskar et al 2010 brewer 2010 in the present study three analyzed water samples ws11 ws12 and ws13 had elevated iron concentrations table 1 3 1 4 zinc zn the bulk of zn infiltrates water systems via man made channels like fertilizer in agricultural fields spin offs from steel production and coal and waste fired power plants ayejoto et al 2022 zn is important in the human body for acceleration of enzymic functions dohare et al 2014 nonetheless its buildup in the human body causes problems such as anemia nausea stomach pains and vomiting reda 2016 zinc readings in the current investigation indicated that all examined samples respected the standard limit this means that the residents are safe from health risks associated with high zinc levels in water supplies 3 1 5 manganese mn mn is a mineral found in the earth s crust mn can be dissolved by water percolating through soil and rock mn concentrations in groundwater are often higher than in surface water thomas et al 1994 anthropogenic activities such as fungicide usage de joode et al 2016 excavation and effluents from wasteyards frisbie et al 2012 are also potential sources of manganese in water studies have found a link between high manganese levels in potable water and development of children s nervous system as well as their conduct and academic success khan et al 2012 2014 oulhote et al 2014 bouchard et al 2011 the content of mn in the examined water samples is significantly below who limit of 0 4 mg l this implies that the inhabitants are free from health concerns attributed to elevated manganese levels in water 3 1 6 lead pb lead is a toxic chemical that can cause harm to humans ayejoto et al 2022 plants proshad et al 2021 and aquatic life egbueri and agbasi 2022 human activities such as indiscriminate garbage disposal electronic device waste and the usage of batteries in vehicle mechanic shops air conditioning and industrial facilities have been identified as the leading source of lead in water supplies egbueri et al 2020 egbueri 2018 lead poisoning can cause attention deficit disorder cognitive impairment hypertension and renal impairment egbueri 2020 in the present study the who 2017 bound of lead in water was surpassed by about 53 33 8 15 of analyzed samples this implies that consumers of the water sources identified as having lead pollution are at risk of several health issues 3 1 7 chromium cr chromium occurs naturally in tiny concentrations in rocks and soils chromium enters the aquatic environment through natural and anthropogenic mechanisms cr ingestion in tiny levels may improve wellness and alleviate encephalopathy and neuropathy muhammad et al 2013 nonetheless depression short term memory loss difficulties concentrating and delayed child cognitive development are linked with high chromium levels wise et al 2022 the level of chromium in the analyzed water sources were found within to be acceptable this implies that the inhabitants are safe from health concerns attributed to chromium pollution in water 3 1 8 nickel ni many experts believe nickel is an immunotoxin and a carcinogen chen et al 2017 the main source of nickel in groundwater and surface waters is the disintegration of nickel bearing rocks ayejoto et al 2022 nickel may also be found in water as a result of human activity such as fossil fuel burning and leaching from dumpsites that contain nickel batteries heavy chemicals cables and electronics egbueri 2020 chervona et al 2012 excessive nickel consumption or contact can lead to cancer cardiovascular disease dermatitis renal and lung problems egbueri 2020 okogbue and ukpai 2013 this research found elevated level of nickel in some water sources table 1 this implies that water users of the sources identified with nickel pollution are at risk of several health issues 3 2 water quality indexing using the wpi the wpi judged the analyzed samples based on human intake according to hossain and patra 2020 the wpi classification scheme splits water into four groups wpi 0 50 excellent water wpi in the range of 0 50 0 75 good water wpi in the range of 0 75 1 00 fairly polluted water and wpi 1 00 extremely polluted water pli and wpi values obtained in this study are presented in table 2 according to the pli scores pb was the most influential parameter the water samples with the highest and lowest wpi values were ws7 and ws2 respectively based on the wpi scores the analyzed water samples can be identified as excellent 20 good 13 33 fairly contaminated 6 67 and extremely polluted 60 in summary the index revealed that majority of the water sources are not suitable for humans this might be attributed to numerous anthropogenic activities in the study site 3 3 oral and dermal risk assessment of human population 3 3 1 daily dosage hazard quotient and cancer risk of ptes the key indices used for assessing human health risk are hiagg hitot cragg and crtot nevertheless dia hq and cr findings are essential for understanding the impacts of ptes the comprehensive results of hhra are presented in the auxiliary material tables s1 s27 while the summary is in table 3 the findings of the daily dosage consumption via oral and dermal methods detected that the water sources identified by the wpi as excellent ws4 ws7 and ws15 and good water ws3 and ws8 have less cause for concern compared to those identified as moderately contaminated ws1 and extremely polluted ws2 ws5 ws6 ws9 ws10 ws11 ws12 ws13 and ws14 tables s1 s27 in addition the ptes appear to follow different pattern for all age groups in terms of hazard quotients tables s1 s27 likewise the impacts of the carcinogens pb cr and ni to cancer risk differed among the age brackets via the oral and cutaneal pathways tables s1 s27 carcinogenic risks increased in the order of ni pb cr generally it was discovered that the risks of oral intake of the water sources by different age brackets in the study ranged from negligible to high however across all age groups the dermal absorption route was associated with negligible to low risks in terms of dia hq and cr these findings indicate that residents of the study region are more vulnerable to risks through ingesting than through the dermal route 3 3 2 oral risk assessment of human population extent of exposure to non carcinogenic health dangers has been ascertained using the hazard index hi as follows negligible hi 0 1 low 1 hi 0 1 medium 4 hi 1 and high risk hi 4 according to us epa 1989 table 4 contains the results of aggregated hiagg and cumulative total hitot non carcinogenic health risks of drinking the water sources the interpretation expressed that there is negligible to low chronic risks for the human population in the study region that takes in the analyzed water sources orally the trend of the hiagg non cancer risk via ingestion route reveals that the older human population in the study region is less susceptible than the younger population fig 2 a nevertheless there is a little disarray as it was detected that the human population between 21 and 65 years were less susceptible than those older than 65 years according to neris et al 2021 the higher vulnerability of the younger human population may be a result of their lower body weights and slower ingestion rates on the other hand the lower vulnerability of the older human population may be a result of an advanced immune system higher body weights and a faster ingestion rate the findings of the hitot indicated that the analyzed water sources do not expose the users to high risks through drinking nevertheless some of the samples expose the inhabitants to low ws9 and ws10 and medium risks ws2 ws5 ws6 ws11 and ws14 the trend of the total or cumulative non carcinogenic risks of drinking the water sources could be visualized in fig 2b extent of exposure to carcinogenic health dangers has been ascertained using the cancer risk cr as follows negligible cr 1 10 6 low 1 10 4 cr 1 10 6 and high cr 1 10 4 according to egbueri and mgbenu 2020 li et al 2014 and us epa 1989 furthermore high cancer risk cr 1 10 4 signifies that out of every ten thousand occupants in a region more than one is at risk of developing cancer tenebe et al 2022 the results of cragg and crtot expressed that there is negligible to high risk for the human population in the study region that takes in the analyzed water sources orally table 5 the trend of the aggregated carcinogenic health risk via the ingestion route reveals that the older human population in the study region is less susceptible than the younger population fig 2c nevertheless there is a little disarray as it was detected that the human population between 21 and 65 years of age was less susceptible than those older than 65 years the findings of the crtot indicated that 33 ws3 ws4 ws7 ws12 and ws13 47 ws1 ws5 ws8 ws9 ws10 ws14 and ws15 and 20 ws2 ws6 and ws11 of the water sources debunk the human population to negligible low and high cancer risk via the ingestion pathway respectively the trend of the total or cumulative carcinogenic risk of drinking from the water sources could be visualized in fig 2d 3 3 3 dermal risk assessment of human population table 6 contains the results of hiagg and hitot risks of absorbing the analyzed water sources dermally the interpretation expressed that there is negligible chronic risk for the human population in the study region that take in the analyzed water sources dermally different from the observations of the ingestion pathway the trend of aggregated non carcinogenic health risks via the dermal route was complex fig 2e nonetheless the overall trend revealed that the younger human population in the study region is more vulnerable than the older population similar to the observations made for non carcinogenic health risks via the ingestion route the human population between 21 and 65 years of age was less susceptible to non carcinogenic health risks via dermal absorption than those older than 65 years in comparison with the observations made for health risk via the ingestion pathway it was observed that exposure of humans to ptes via dermal absorption is less detrimental than oral ingestion the trend of the total or cumulative non carcinogenic risk of dermally absorbing the water sources could be visualized in fig 2f the results of aggregated cragg and total crtot cancer risks showed that there is negligible chronic risk for the human population in the study region that absorb the analyzed water sources dermally table 7 the observed values of cragg were found to be lower for the dermal route this implies that the risk of developing cancer is lower through dermal absorption of the water samples compared to oral ingestion different from the observations of the ingestion pathway the trend of aggregated carcinogenic health risk via the dermal route was complex fig 2g nonetheless the overall trend revealed that the younger human population in the study region is more vulnerable than the older population similar to the observations made for cr through drinking water the human population older than 65 years was more susceptible to cr from cutaneal assimilation when compared to those between 21 and 65 years of age the trend of the total or cumulative cr of dermally absorbing the water sources could be visualized in fig 2h 3 4 comparison of the present study with literature data the findings of the wpi and herisk code were compared with previous studies that have utilized similar methods based on wpi scores agbasi and egbueri 2023 deemed 65 of water samples collected from ojoto and environs nigeria fit for drinking hossain and patra 2020 reported that only about 33 of water samples from birbhum district west bengal india were undesirable for human use in khyber pakhtunkhwa province pakistan none of the analyzed water samples were found suitable for human consumption nawab et al 2022 similar findings were reported in guntur district andhra pradesh india by ravindra et al 2022 in the present study 66 67 of water sources in the study region are not suitable for human use the variations in the findings of the abovementioned studies are considered to be as a result of different activities past and present in the regions in addition the number of considered parameters may have also influenced the reports the summary of the findings is presented in table 8 studies on hhra that employed the herisk code showed consistency with regard to risk levels found in different age brackets that is higher level of risks in infants and ageing populations egbueri et al 2022 tenebe et al 2022 neris et al 2021 this reaffirms that the herisk code is a reliable model in the present study chromium was identified as the most detrimental element in the water samples previous studies found cobalt in bahia brazil neris et al 2021 arsenic and cadmium in southeastern nigeria egbueri et al 2022 and copper in edo state nigeria tenebe et al 2022 to have contributed most to potential human health risks in the regions negligible to moderate non carcinogenic risks were ascertained in water samples analyzed in the present study neris et al 2021 discovered low to high risks to humans in water samples collected from a nickel mining region in bahia brazil in nigeria egbueri et al 2022 detected elevated risks to humans in groundwater samples picked from southeastern nigeria while low to high risks were found in rainwater samples from ekpoma edo state tenebe et al 2022 similar inferences drawn from comparison of studies that utilized the wpi are conceived to have influenced the herisk findings 4 conclusions and recommendations water pollution indexing revealed that merely around 33 of primary water sources in the region of study are suitable for human consumption hhra found ws2 ws6 and ws11 with the most concern as they expose water users to a high chronic risk of developing cancer when taken in orally according to the wpi and herisk code the most influential ptes in the water sources were lead and nickel respectively some water sources ws8 and ws15 deemed suitable for human consumption were associated with low cancer risks when assimilated orally the dangers associated with the analyzed water sources in the region are not understood by majority thus there is a pressing need for proper education of the people on the dangers colligated with using the water resources in addition the water users should be enlightened on simple techniques used for the purification of water to mitigate the hazards sample collection was targeted on primary water sources in the region and over 66 7 were unsuitable for human consumption this indicates that there is a need for an alternative source of water in the study region previous studies have reported that developing countries have not made substantial efforts to curb outbreaks of diseases resulting from the consumption of contaminated water therefore it is well advised that the authorities responsible for the sustainability of humans and natural water bodies in the region should take immediate action to enlighten the water users purify the water sources and provide alternative sources of water for the inhabitants future studies are encouraged to develop and implement new methods of hhra declarations ethical approval not applicable

11675,traditional human health risk assessment hhra methods are now being replaced with advanced codes in the present study herisk code and water pollution index wpi were employed for hhra and water quality characterization of umunya a suburban in nigeria this study stands out from previous hhras performed in the region by applying the novel herisk code which evaluates health risk for nine human populations the goal of this study was to provide a comprehensive report that will enlighten inhabitants and policymakers on the potential dermal and oral risks associated with the use of metal contaminated water resources for various age brackets in the region standard methods were employed with respect to measured physicochemical parameters the wpi revealed that 66 7 of the water resources were unsuitable for human use based on the herisk code potentially toxic elements ptes increased cancer risks in the following order ni pb cr total non carcinogenic risks of drinking the water was found to be moderate however the cumulative risks due to dermal absorption of the contaminated water were negligible the overall trend observed from the hhra showed that older human populations in the area are less susceptible than younger populations nevertheless it was detected that humans between ages 21 and 65 were less vulnerable than those older than 65 years the findings of the herisk code and wpi had a strong agreement as water samples deemed less fit for human use by the wpi proved to have more health concerns the wpi and herisk code indicated that the most influential ptes in the water were pb and ni respectively thus both ptes expose water users to a higher risk of developing cancer via water ingestion graphical abstract image 1 keywords cancer risk drinking water assessment human health risk assessment hhra potentially toxic elements water quality data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction throughout the history of human life safe water has been a primary need however as the years go by factors that threaten the availability of safe water are on the rise in light of the rising issue developed nations have achieved substantial advancements by purifying polluted water sources to a significant proportion therefore making ample clean water available for citizens subba rao et al 2022a adelodun et al 2021 on the other side many developing nations such as nigeria continue to fall short in these areas resulting in disease outbreaks and in some cases mortality among the disadvantaged as a result of ingesting polluted water high concentrations of potentially toxic elements ptes in water sources are amongst factors that degrade the quality of water some of the ptes commonly found in water include zinc zn cadmium cd iron fe chromium cr arsenic as lead pb nitrate no3 manganese mn amongst others gugulothu et al 2022 subba rao et al 2022b 2021 dippong et al 2020 2018 ro»ôca et al 2020 ptes are usually categorized into carcinogens and non carcinogens carcinogenic ptes include as cd cr pb ni no3 etc whereas non carcinogenic ptes include fe mn zn etc some of the health concerns linked to ptes include abdominal discomfort anemia constipation cramping in the abdomen exhaustion headache irritability low blood pressure mild mood swings nausea pain in the hands feet muscles or joints and a rapid heartbeat shrestha 2018 frith et al 2005 sood et al 2002 studies have identified associations between ptes and cancer some of which include nitrate and colorectal cancer richards et al 2022 nickel and respiratory tract cancer chen et al 2017 lead and cancers of the brain kidney and lung steenland and boffetta 2000 hexavalent chromium cr vi and lung cancer suh et al 2019 cadmium and cancers of the breast lung pancreas and urinary bladder huff et al 2007 and inorganic arsenic and cancers of the liver prostate and kidney benbrahim tallaa and waalkes 2008 due to various impairments induced by intake of polluted water scientists have adopted different strategies for risk assessment of water resources the primary purpose of risk assessment is to preserve not just the health of individuals who live in touch with water either directly or indirectly e g drinking water dietary intake of foods irrigated with water but also the aquatic natural ecosystems geissen et al 2015 traditionally measuring the ecological risk of substances involved comparing its concentrations in environmental compartments with amounts below which detrimental impacts on organisms were unlikely to occur lepper 2002 the techniques for hhra differs slightly in that human exposure through various routes is evaluated prior to comparison with threshold levels geissen et al 2015 hhra is viewed by the united states environmental protection agency us epa as a systematic technique to analyzing the possible health impacts of exposure to specific dangerous compounds in contaminated ecological systems such as water resources golaki et al 2022 in other words human health risk assessment is a systematic methodology for defining the detrimental impacts of exposure to dangerous chemicals golaki et al 2022 according to neris et al 2021 the deterministic technique which includes using a predetermined value to evaluate the hazards associated with chemical pollutant exposure is used by the majority of hhra methodologies in efforts to address these limitations innovative algorithms for evaluating ecological radiological and human health risks have been developed the herisk code is a new code which has been utilized for hhra in different countries studies that have utilized the herisk code express that it offers a more detailed report than other risk assessment tools egbueri et al 2022 neris et al 2021 tenebe et al 2022 umunya is a suburban region located in southeastern nigeria west africa being situated as a suburb industrial and agricultural activities are at their peak in umunya these human activities require the use of water in large amounts for multiple purposes thus it is essential for periodic risk assessment to ensure short and long term wellbeing of human and natural resources previous hhra in umunya and environs focused on two age groups children and adults therefore the current study evaluates the risk of exposure to ptes in water on nine age brackets 1 to less than 2 years 2 to less than 3 years 3 to less than 6 years 6 to less than 11 years 11 to less than 16 years 16 to less than 18 years 18 to less than 21 years 21 to less than 65 years and above 65 years in umunya and environs this was achieved by employing the novel herisk code which different studies have confirmed fit for efficient and effective hhra this research particularly aims to 1 ascertain safety levels of water resources in the region using the water pollution index wpi and 2 conduct a comprehensive hhra on water resources in the study region with focus on two exposure routes oral and dermal for nine human populations using the herisk code it is anticipated that the findings of this study will provide a new perspective for governmental and non governmental agencies in charge of public health management in the region in addition it is hoped that the methodologies findings and research gaps presented in the study will spur future research with the common goal of sustaining human lives and natural waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study region umunya lies within latitude 6 12 34 n and longitude 6 54 51 e in the oyi local government area central anambra state and it shares borders with five major towns and is less than 18 km from the state capital awka the nteje streams and nkwelle ezunaka heath form the northern boundary the umudioka and ifite dunu streams form the southern boundary the ogbunike streams form the western boundary and the awkuzu streams form the eastern boundary the estimated land size of umunya is 4844 sq km being situated in southeastern nigeria umunya and environs are part of the tropical rainforest there are two major seasons experienced within the study region rainy and dry the season with high amount of rainfall lasts from april october with its peak between june and september while the season with low rainfall begins from november march agbasi and egbueri et al 2022 the month with little or no rainfall is december which comes with very dry and cold weather the trade winds are responsible for the seasonal changes experienced within umunya and environs the tropical continental air mass which is commonly referred to as the north east trade wind blows fine cool air and dust from the sahara desert in north africa down to the south and is responsible for the dry season it brings about the harmattan haze which can be likened to fog this usually happens annually from late november to march the south west trade wind commonly referred to as the tropical maritime air mass blows warm air and carries water moisture along with it from the south atlantic ocean into nigeria from april to october and this brings about the rainy season based on the nigerian national census the population of umunya was estimated in 2006 to be 700 000 people however it is anticipated that the human population may have tripled due to increased anthropogenic activities in the study area over time the area is very fertile which encourages agricultural practices the major source of income for the people is agriculture the people of the region are mainly farmers traders and artisan craftsmen people from all over the state come to umunya for fruit and cattle business umunya has the biggest cattle market in the whole of anambra state the town also has one of the biggest abattoirs in central anambra as a result of the large cattle market in the region people come from far and near to buy cattle as this is the most sought after meat in this region the busiest period in umunya is during festivities which sees strangers come from all around the neighborhood to buy cattle for festive celebrations in a day at least 10 cattle are slaughtered in umunya by butchers for consumption umunya and environs lie within the eastern niger delta basin it is underlain by the imo formation and overlain by the paralic ogwashi asaba formation odumodu and mode 2014 according to ogbe and osokpor 2021 the geologic units encountered within umunya and environs are predominantly the nanka formation sands eocene which belongs to the ameki group usually fine to coarse grains of lateritic top soils friable to semi consolidated in nature the eocene nanka formation is very friable and easily gullied the friable nature of the formation is one of the major causes of gully sites in anambra state within the formation are thin mud rock layers shale which may be acting as a sealing unit for the fine to coarse grain sand which serves as a reservoir it has been reported that the nanka formation is of lateral equivalence with the agbada formation of the niger delta basin odumodu and mode 2014 ogbe and osokpor 2021 the nanka formation outcropping in umunya has a ferruginous sandstone unit within different outcrop locations in umunya odumodu and mode 2014 the presence of these ferruginous sandstone layers has affected the quality of groundwater in the region the water table in umunya varies based on geographic location according to usman et al 2015 the groundwater table of nteje is between 21 5m and 102m and the aquifer thickness increases from nw to se some of the reservoirs within umunya are confined and form artisan wells due to the thin mudrock layer capping the reservoir tops 2 2 collection of water samples and laboratory analysis before sampling the probe was confirmed to be correctly calibrated to guarantee accurate and consistent data gathering water sampling followed similar procedure used by emenike et al 2018 the samples were obtained from densely populated areas as well as from key water sources used by the locals for drinking and other household needs the location of each sampling station was recorded using a global positioning system fig 1 a total of fifteen water samples were obtained spring water 1 stream water 2 pipe borne water borehole 12 prewashed 1 l polyethylene bottles were used to store the water samples following collection at each station the samples were properly tagged and stored in a cooler until being delivered to the laboratory for proper examination six metals fe zn mn pb cr and ni and two physiochemical parameters no3 and ph were considered the ph was checked on site using a portable probe while the metals were analyzed using bulk scientific 210 vgp the no3 concentrations were evaluated using titrimetric technique the field activities and sample methods were guided by the criteria of american public health association apha 2012 2005 furthermore during laboratory analysis standard detection limits reagent blanks and routine monitoring were used 2 3 water quality indexing water quality describes the physical biological and chemical status of water usually with respect to their suitability for a particular purpose such as drinking agriculture swimming etc considering numerous indicators used to judge water quality researchers adopted water quality indices wqis these indices incorporate the data of water quality parameters and assign scores values to water samples the assigned values are interpreted using the unique classification scheme of the index and it gives a clear picture of the water wqis identifies whether water is suitable or unsuitable for a predetermined purpose computation of wqis is achieved by comparing data of analyzed water indicators with standards recommended by government authorities the common standards used to evaluate monitor and assess water quality expresses the condition of drinking water the safety of human use and the wellbeing of all in scenarios where significant water quality parameters exceed the accepted limits the water is likely to be unsafe for consumption mukate et al 2019 wqis are one of the most effective techniques to evaluate the quality of water resources for stakeholders involved in the utility of water overtime wqis have become an authoritative tool for the assessment and management of water toma 2012 2 3 1 water pollution index wpi the wpi is a water quality index proposed by hossain and patra 2020 and later followed by ravindra et al 2022 this method is flexible has varied applications and wider usage considering existing water quality standards wpi also offers fundamental information on the condition of water for multipurpose the wpi unlike other indices is not limited to a particular water quality indicator physiochemical metals or water source surface groundwater and can accommodate unlimited water quality indicators in its computation hossain and patra 2020 additionally the wpi does not make use of assigned weights which usually introduces bias to the evaluation of water resources the wpi computation was performed following two easy steps described by hossain and patra 2020 and is as follows first pollution load pli of ith indicator is estimated 1 p l i 1 c i s i s i where c i represents the analyzed value of ith indicator s i represents the recommended limit for the indicator according to guidelines used in the present study eight water quality indicators ph no3 fe zn mn pb cr ni were considered and the who 2017 guidelines for drinking water were adhered to for pli computation of ph it is advised to use a different approach the recommended equation for water samples with ph less than 7 is found in eq 2 2 p l i c i 7 s i a 7 where si a stands for the minimum who acceptable ph value given as 6 5 the suggested equation is presented in eq 3 if the water sample has a ph greater than 7 3 p l i c i 7 s i b 7 si b stands for the maximum who acceptable ph value given as 8 5 finally wpi score of a water sample is computed by summation of the pli of individual parameters and dividing by the number of parameters considered note that in a scenario where the analyzed value of an indicator parameters is zero the parameter ought not be added to the number of parameters n for that case sample 4 w p i 1 n i 1 n p l i 2 4 oral and dermal risk assessment to humans 2 4 1 herisk code computation the herisk code aided spatiotemporal risk evaluation of ptes in water samples collected from the study region the novel code accomplishes space time evaluation by varying the values of age dependent parameters

pollution are at risk of several health issues 3 2 water quality indexing using the wpi the wpi judged the analyzed samples based on human intake according to hossain and patra 2020 the wpi classification scheme splits water into four groups wpi 0 50 excellent water wpi in the range of 0 50 0 75 good water wpi in the range of 0 75 1 00 fairly polluted water and wpi 1 00 extremely polluted water pli and wpi values obtained in this study are presented in table 2 according to the pli scores pb was the most influential parameter the water samples with the highest and lowest wpi values were ws7 and ws2 respectively based on the wpi scores the analyzed water samples can be identified as excellent 20 good 13 33 fairly contaminated 6 67 and extremely polluted 60 in summary the index revealed that majority of the water sources are not suitable for humans this might be attributed to numerous anthropogenic activities in the study site 3 3 oral and dermal risk assessment of human population 3 3 1 daily dosage hazard quotient and cancer risk of ptes the key indices used for assessing human health risk are hiagg hitot cragg and crtot nevertheless dia hq and cr findings are essential for understanding the impacts of ptes the comprehensive results of hhra are presented in the auxiliary material tables s1 s27 while the summary is in table 3 the findings of the daily dosage consumption via oral and dermal methods detected that the water sources identified by the wpi as excellent ws4 ws7 and ws15 and good water ws3 and ws8 have less cause for concern compared to those identified as moderately contaminated ws1 and extremely polluted ws2 ws5 ws6 ws9 ws10 ws11 ws12 ws13 and ws14 tables s1 s27 in addition the ptes appear to follow different pattern for all age groups in terms of hazard quotients tables s1 s27 likewise the impacts of the carcinogens pb cr and ni to cancer risk differed among the age brackets via the oral and cutaneal pathways tables s1 s27 carcinogenic risks increased in the order of ni pb cr generally it was discovered that the risks of oral intake of the water sources by different age brackets in the study ranged from negligible to high however across all age groups the dermal absorption route was associated with negligible to low risks in terms of dia hq and cr these findings indicate that residents of the study region are more vulnerable to risks through ingesting than through the dermal route 3 3 2 oral risk assessment of human population extent of exposure to non carcinogenic health dangers has been ascertained using the hazard index hi as follows negligible hi 0 1 low 1 hi 0 1 medium 4 hi 1 and high risk hi 4 according to us epa 1989 table 4 contains the results of aggregated hiagg and cumulative total hitot non carcinogenic health risks of drinking the water sources the interpretation expressed that there is negligible to low chronic risks for the human population in the study region that takes in the analyzed water sources orally the trend of the hiagg non cancer risk via ingestion route reveals that the older human population in the study region is less susceptible than the younger population fig 2 a nevertheless there is a little disarray as it was detected that the human population between 21 and 65 years were less susceptible than those older than 65 years according to neris et al 2021 the higher vulnerability of the younger human population may be a result of their lower body weights and slower ingestion rates on the other hand the lower vulnerability of the older human population may be a result of an advanced immune system higher body weights and a faster ingestion rate the findings of the hitot indicated that the analyzed water sources do not expose the users to high risks through drinking nevertheless some of the samples expose the inhabitants to low ws9 and ws10 and medium risks ws2 ws5 ws6 ws11 and ws14 the trend of the total or cumulative non carcinogenic risks of drinking the water sources could be visualized in fig 2b extent of exposure to carcinogenic health dangers has been ascertained using the cancer risk cr as follows negligible cr 1 10 6 low 1 10 4 cr 1 10 6 and high cr 1 10 4 according to egbueri and mgbenu 2020 li et al 2014 and us epa 1989 furthermore high cancer risk cr 1 10 4 signifies that out of every ten thousand occupants in a region more than one is at risk of developing cancer tenebe et al 2022 the results of cragg and crtot expressed that there is negligible to high risk for the human population in the study region that takes in the analyzed water sources orally table 5 the trend of the aggregated carcinogenic health risk via the ingestion route reveals that the older human population in the study region is less susceptible than the younger population fig 2c nevertheless there is a little disarray as it was detected that the human population between 21 and 65 years of age was less susceptible than those older than 65 years the findings of the crtot indicated that 33 ws3 ws4 ws7 ws12 and ws13 47 ws1 ws5 ws8 ws9 ws10 ws14 and ws15 and 20 ws2 ws6 and ws11 of the water sources debunk the human population to negligible low and high cancer risk via the ingestion pathway respectively the trend of the total or cumulative carcinogenic risk of drinking from the water sources could be visualized in fig 2d 3 3 3 dermal risk assessment of human population table 6 contains the results of hiagg and hitot risks of absorbing the analyzed water sources dermally the interpretation expressed that there is negligible chronic risk for the human population in the study region that take in the analyzed water sources dermally different from the observations of the ingestion pathway the trend of aggregated non carcinogenic health risks via the dermal route was complex fig 2e nonetheless the overall trend revealed that the younger human population in the study region is more vulnerable than the older population similar to the observations made for non carcinogenic health risks via the ingestion route the human population between 21 and 65 years of age was less susceptible to non carcinogenic health risks via dermal absorption than those older than 65 years in comparison with the observations made for health risk via the ingestion pathway it was observed that exposure of humans to ptes via dermal absorption is less detrimental than oral ingestion the trend of the total or cumulative non carcinogenic risk of dermally absorbing the water sources could be visualized in fig 2f the results of aggregated cragg and total crtot cancer risks showed that there is negligible chronic risk for the human population in the study region that absorb the analyzed water sources dermally table 7 the observed values of cragg were found to be lower for the dermal route this implies that the risk of developing cancer is lower through dermal absorption of the water samples compared to oral ingestion different from the observations of the ingestion pathway the trend of aggregated carcinogenic health risk via the dermal route was complex fig 2g nonetheless the overall trend revealed that the younger human population in the study region is more vulnerable than the older population similar to the observations made for cr through drinking water the human population older than 65 years was more susceptible to cr from cutaneal assimilation when compared to those between 21 and 65 years of age the trend of the total or cumulative cr of dermally absorbing the water sources could be visualized in fig 2h 3 4 comparison of the present study with literature data the findings of the wpi and herisk code were compared with previous studies that have utilized similar methods based on wpi scores agbasi and egbueri 2023 deemed 65 of water samples collected from ojoto and environs nigeria fit for drinking hossain and patra 2020 reported that only about 33 of water samples from birbhum district west bengal india were

district andhra pradesh india by ravindra et al 2022 in the present study 66 67 of water sources in the study region are not suitable for human use the variations in the findings of the abovementioned studies are considered to be as a result of different activities past and present in the regions in addition the number of considered parameters may have also influenced the reports the summary of the findings is presented in table 8 studies on hhra that employed the herisk code showed consistency with regard to risk levels found in different age brackets that is higher level of risks in infants and ageing populations egbueri et al 2022 tenebe et al 2022 neris et al 2021 this reaffirms that the herisk code is a reliable model in the present study chromium was identified as the most detrimental element in the water samples previous studies found cobalt in bahia brazil neris et al 2021 arsenic and cadmium in southeastern nigeria egbueri et al 2022 and copper in edo state nigeria tenebe et al 2022 to have contributed most to potential human health risks in the regions negligible to moderate non carcinogenic risks were ascertained in water samples analyzed in the present study neris et al 2021 discovered low to high risks to humans in water samples collected from a nickel mining region in bahia brazil in nigeria egbueri et al 2022 detected elevated risks to humans in groundwater samples picked from southeastern nigeria while low to high risks were found in rainwater samples from ekpoma edo state tenebe et al 2022 similar inferences drawn from comparison of studies that utilized the wpi are conceived to have influenced the herisk findings 4 conclusions and recommendations water pollution indexing revealed that merely around 33 of primary water sources in the region of study are suitable for human consumption hhra found ws2 ws6 and ws11 with the most concern as they expose water users to a high chronic risk of developing cancer when taken in orally according to the wpi and herisk code the most influential ptes in the water sources were lead and nickel respectively some water sources ws8 and ws15 deemed suitable for human consumption were associated with low cancer risks when assimilated orally the dangers associated with the analyzed water sources in the region are not understood by majority thus there is a pressing need for proper education of the people on the dangers colligated with using the water resources in addition the water users should be enlightened on simple techniques used for the purification of water to mitigate the hazards sample collection was targeted on primary water sources in the region and over 66 7 were unsuitable for human consumption this indicates that there is a need for an alternative source of water in the study region previous studies have reported that developing countries have not made substantial efforts to curb outbreaks of diseases resulting from the consumption of contaminated water therefore it is well advised that the authorities responsible for the sustainability of humans and natural water bodies in the region should take immediate action to enlighten the water users purify the water sources and provide alternative sources of water for the inhabitants future studies are encouraged to develop and implement new methods of hhra declarations ethical approval not applicable

produced about 14 3 km3 wastewater in 2021 while the capacity of municipal wastewater treatment was only 0 3 km3 year including detergent wastewater from domestic and industrial activities suprijandani et al 2021 widyarani et al 2020 based on the indonesian government regulation no 21 of 2021 the maximum concentration of detergent in rivers is 0 2 ppm while based on minister of environment regulation republic of indonesia no 5 of 2014 concerning to wastewater quality standards the maximum level of detergent allowed in some industrial activities is 2 10 ppm detergent s main component is surfactant that consists of non polar hydrophobic part and polar hydrophilic part kurrey et al 2019 surfactant can be classified into several types based on their type structure and properties ji et al 2021 the classification of surfactant is explained futher in table 1 from various types of surfactant the most commonly used anionic surfactants are sds and sdbs kaczerewska et al 2020 zhu et al 2022 the content of sds and sdbs at toxicity level can threaten the life of aquatic biotic organisms in water moreover it can cause irritation for skin eyes and human digestive tract viitala et al 2020 sakai et al 2017 kaida et al 2021 several anionic surfactant processing methods have been carried out such as biological treatment flocculation coagulation advanced oxidation adsorption electrolysis photodegradation azizi et al 2021 hua et al 2012 photodegradation is applicated for energy production asiri et al 2021 co2 reduction gupta et al 2021 antibacterial agent rokicka konieczna et al 2020 photocatalytic degradation for textile and pharmaceutical wastewater asiri et al 2022 chakraborty et al 2017 sarkar et al 2015 etc in order to support the photodegradation process a metal oxide such as tio2 or fe are used as catalyst kuzminski et al 2018 titanium dioxide tio2 has several advantages than other semiconductor photocatalysts such as good absorbent of ultraviolet light inert non toxic and ability to degrade organic compounds from surfactant to co2 and h2o which are relatively harmless and stable in a long term tahya et al 2019 pansa ngat et al 2017 lindu et al 2013 tio2 has a good photodegradation efficiency value under uv irradiation but it has low efficiency under visible light irradiation vis due to its large band gap cardona et al 2022 deng et al 2019 ghrib et al 2021 purnawan et al 2016 tio2 can be modified using some additives to increase the photodegradation efficiency some additives that can be used are carbon semiconductor metal oxide awfa et al 2018 tio2 zncr2o4 salehi et al 2019 tio2 wood charcoal luo et al 2015 tio2 carbon nitride crake et al 2019 etc one of metal oxide that can modify tio2 is lead metal pb lead as an oxide is widely used as a photocatalyst material because it has high conductivity and small band gap energy that can absorb visible light ajibade et al 2021 pascariu et al 2022 derivatives of tio2 as pbtio3 compounds with smaller band gaps allow easier electrons excitation from the valence band to the conduction band so that photocatalytic ability will be increased pbtio3 is widely used for many application such as dye photodegradation abirami et al 2021 electromechanical application zhang and li 2012 sobhani nasab et al 2015 transducer application zhang et al 2013 and surfactant degradation preparation of pbtio3 plays an important role in crystallinity crystal structure surface morphology and specific surface area tang et al 2021 the synthesis of photocatalysts can be carried out by solid state reaction methods hydrothermal methods sol gel co precipitation microemulsion mechanochemical synthesis etc fouzia and rabah 2021 ouerghi et al 2021 most of the methods for preparing pbtio3 use large amounts of solvent moreover they are expensive and produce large particles with a low surface area photocatalytic materials with small size usually perform better photocatalytic activity due to the high surface area that initiates a faster reaction hydrothermal is a simple inexpensive and safe method that implements the principle of green chemistry zavala et al 2017 liu et al 2014 synthesis using hydrothermal method can effectively modulate particle size and morphology li et al 2014 the characteristic and photocatalytic activity of pbtio3 will be influenced by several factors such as the composition of tio2 pbo koh concentration ph temperature and synthesis time lee et al 2014 mamaghani et al 2019 yang et al 2022 the aim of this research is to study the photocatalytic activity of pbtio3 prepared by hydrothermal method for sds and sdbs degradation under visible light irradiation in this study we also studied the effect of composition ti and pb and ph on the surfactant degradation performance furthermore this research can be developed in indonesia because the application of the photodegradation method is still limited 2 experimental 2 1 materials titanium

pbtio3 compounds were carried out by the hydrothermal method the variations of tio2 and pbo composition produced different colors of pbtio3 as shown in table 2 pbtio3 with ratio tio2 pbo 1 3 and 1 2 are more dominant in yellow because of the dominance of pbo compounds pbtio3 with ratio tio2 pbo 1 1 2 1 and 3 1 have yellowish and white which are dominated by tio2 compounds fig 1 shows the diffractogram of the pbtio3 by hydrothermal method the diffractogram has a good match with the pbtio3 peaks according to jcpds no 74 2495 however there is another peak that indicates the presence of tio2 2…µ 25 according to jcpds no 86 1157 the peaks of tio2 appeared at the composition of tio2 pbo 1 1 2 1 3 1 the high concentration of tio2 caused the peak intensity at 2…µ 25 increased this indicates that the remaining tio2 did not react with pbo the excess amount of tio2 produced the rest of tio2 which did not react with pbo the ratio of tio2 pbo 1 2 does not show peak of tio2 at 2…µ 25 indicating that this composition is the optimum ratio the ratio of tio2 pbo 1 3 produced impurity which was indicated by the appearance of a peak at 2…µ 26 83 28 54 29 82 and 31 41 based on the diffractogram analysis the highest crystallinity and the smallest crystal size was obtained by pbtio3 with ratio tio2 pbo 1 2 this confirms that the ratio of tio2 pbo 1 2 w w is the optimum mole ratio in this reaction the optimum mole composition caused the atomic order of pbtio3 to increase and produce smaller crystal size and greater crystallinity a smaller crystal size produces better crystallinity than a larger crystal size this was confirmed by the sharper peaks of the diffractogram and the higher the intensity analysis of crystallinity and crystal size is shown in table 3 the determination of the band gap energy eg was carried out by the kubelka munk equation to describe in terms the relationship between the band gap energy eg and f r hv 2 based on fig 2 the synthesized pbtio3 catalyst has a smaller band gap energy than the tio2 the smallest bandgap energy of pbtio3 is 2 73 ev with ratio tio2 pbo 1 2 it is due to the high order of the crystal arrangement and the small crystal size the smaller band gap causes the photocatalyst to be active with visible light irradiation so that the excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band produced electron holes in addition the lower band gap energy leads to easier excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band faster electron excitation causes better photocatalytic activity photocatalyst with good crystallinity has better atomic structure regularity it also causes regularity in the valence band and conduction band so that the band gap energy becomes smaller the ftir spectra of tio2 and pbtio3 compounds is shown in fig 3 ftir spectra of tio2 shows the absorption of the ohstr group at a wave number of 3409 33 cm 1 originating from h2o molecules adsorbed on the surface of the tio2 the absorption of the ti o ti group is shown at wavenumber 548 77 414 71 cm 1 and the ohbend group absorption from ti oh is shown at wavenumber 1630 8 cm 1 the ftir spectra of pbtio3 indicates that there were several shiftings from ti o ti groups at wave numbers 540 09 506 22 cm 1 ohstr at wave numbers 3536 90 3167 25 cm 1 ohbend at wave numbers 1658 85 1574 63 cm 1 the peak of pb o groups shows at wave numbers 1445 71 1331 31 cm 1 in addition there is a new peak at a wave number of around 770 750 cm 1 due to the formation of pb o ti the surface morphology of the pbtio3 crystals using 20 000 times magnification is as shown in fig 4 the morphology of tio2 is shaped like an irregular sphere while the morphology of pbtio3 is shaped like an irregular cube particle the percentages of pb ti and o metals of pbtio3 with ratio tio2 pbo 1 2 were 75 31 10 02 and 14 68 while pbtio3 with ratio tio2 pbo 1 3 are 74 28 9 52 and 16 20 respectively data from fig 5 shows that the tio2 compound consists of ti and o elements ti has a high weight percentage 64 65 while o has the lower percentage 35 35 pbtio3 compound consists of pb ti and o elements as shown in fig 6 the percentages of pbtio3 compound elements with ratio 1 2 are 75 31 pb 10 02 ti and 14 68 o meanwhile in the tio2 compound pb was not found 3 2 photodegradation sds and sdbs surfactants with variation composition of pbtio3 catalyst photodegradation of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate sdbs surfactants with pbtio3 catalyst synthesized by hydrothermal method has been carried out the catalytic process was carried out using visible light for 30 min the results are shown in fig 7 the degradation of sds and sdbs surfactants using pbtio3 using the hydrothermal method has an optimum point at the ratio of tio2 pbo 1 2 with degradation percentages of 70 42 and 84 84 respectively the results of photodegradation of sds and sdbs surfactants can be influenced by pbtio3 characters such as crystallinity crystal size and band gap energy it is proven by the degradation percentage of sds and sdbs using pbtio3 this is in accordance with the theory that the ratio of reactants can affect the structure and photocatalyst ability of the product hli et al 2015 nguyen phan et al 2009 pbtio3 with ratio tio2 pbo 1 2 has the highest percentage of degradation due to the high crystallinity small crystal size and small band gap energy the pbtio3 catalyst with greater crystallinity smaller crystal size and smaller bandgap energy will increase its photocatalytic activity the smaller band gap energy causes the excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band becomes easier so that it causes better photocatalytic activity based on the results of degradation the percentage of sdbs degradation is higher than sds degradation due to the different chemical structure sdbs has an aromatic ring that is more easily degraded sds and sdbs structure are shown in fig 8 according to yuan et al 2019 linear chains are difficult to break and maintain their chemical structure in the oxidation process against radicals oh so the degradation of sds compounds takes longer time than sdbs compounds 3 3 photodegradation sds and sdbs surfactants with variation ph photodegradation of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate sdbs surfactants with pbtio3 catalyst with ph variation is shown in fig 9 fig 9 shows that at low ph sds and sdbs photodegradation is less effective but photodegradation effectiveness increases at ph 5 this shows that the ph value can affect the effectiveness of the photocatalytic process alahiane et al 2020 the photodegradation process of sds anionic surfactant with pbtio3 ratio tio2 pbo 1 2 reaches optimum conditions at ph 5 of 85 69 at ph 5 the tio2 semiconductor becomes positively charged while the surfactant compound is anionic this causes the interaction between the anionic surfactant and tio2 to be stronger due to the difference in charge between the two compounds photodegradation at ph 3 is not very effective because at acidic ph anionic surfactants have the possibility to be protonated sds and sdbs are protonated more so that it can inhibit the photodegradation process while at a ph more than 5 basic ph effectiveness of anionic surfactant photodegradation decreases due to the tio2 semiconductor being negatively charged this causes photodegradation to become less effective because of a weak interaction between photocatalysts and anionic surfactants based on research paramanik et al 2019 the photocatalytic mechanism using a pbtio3 photocatalyst with a higher energy than the pbtio3 band gap causes the excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band it produces hole h and electron e that can react with h2o and o2 then forming radical compounds during the irradiation process hydroxyl radicals superoxide radicals and hydroperoxyl radicals will be formed continuously the radical forming mechanism can be seen in the reaction below pbtio3 s hv e cb h vb h vb h2o l oh h e cb o2 o2 o2 h ooh these three radical compounds have great ability to degrade sodium dodecyl sulfate sds by reacting with c12h25oso3 ion and forming degraded products the mechanism of photodegradation reaction is shown below c12h25oso3na c12h25oso3 na oh c12h25oso3 degraded product h2o co2 so3 2 ooh c12h25oso3 degraded product h2o co2 so3 2 o2 c12h25oso3 degraded product h2o co2 so3 2 based on research wahyuni et al 2016 if the reaction runs perfectly the photodegradation of the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate using a tio2 sio2 catalyst will produce co2 gas h2o gas so4 2 ions and so3 2 ions the reaction equation is written as follows oh ads c12h25oso3 aq co2 aq h2o l so3 2 aq so4 2 aq according to dong et al 2017 the stages of the photodegradation process of sdbs anionic surfactants include adsorption of sdbs anionic surfactants on the semiconductor surface formation of electron holes radicals and slow dynamic stages in the slow dynamic stage the aromatic ring opens and there are the formation of hydroxyl intermediates peroxides the formation of aldehydes the formation of carboxylic acids and the formation of co2 h2o and other organic acids the reaction mechanism that may occur in the photodegradation process of sdbs anionic surfactants with pbtio3 refers to vilardi et al 2018 4 conclusion pbtio3 can be synthesized from tio2 and pbo using hydrothermal method and it produces photocatalytic materials with high efficiency for surfactant degradation the data obtained shows that the composition ratio of tio2 pbo 1 2 has a low bandgap value of 2 73 ev it also has the optimum sds and sdbs degradation efficiency of 70 42 and 84 84 respectively pbtio3 with a composition ratio of tio2 pbo 1 2 has a fairly high crystallinity of 75 82 and a crystal size of 24 37 nm the surfactant degradation efficiency using pbtio3 photocatalyst is affected by ph photodegradation at ph 5 shows the highest efficiency of sds and sdbs degradation that are 85 69 and 85 56 respectively declaration of competing interest

pbtio3 compounds were carried out by the hydrothermal method the variations of tio2 and pbo composition produced different colors of pbtio3 as shown in table 2 pbtio3 with ratio tio2 pbo 1 3 and 1 2 are more dominant in yellow because of the dominance of pbo compounds pbtio3 with ratio tio2 pbo 1 1 2 1 and 3 1 have yellowish and white which are dominated by tio2 compounds fig 1 shows the diffractogram of the pbtio3 by hydrothermal method the diffractogram has a good match with the pbtio3 peaks according to jcpds no 74 2495 however there is another peak that indicates the presence of tio2 2…µ 25 according to jcpds no 86 1157 the peaks of tio2 appeared at the composition of tio2 pbo 1 1 2 1 3 1 the high concentration of tio2 caused the peak intensity at 2…µ 25 increased this indicates that the remaining tio2 did not react with pbo the excess amount of tio2 produced the rest of tio2 which did not react with pbo the ratio of tio2 pbo 1 2 does not show peak of tio2 at 2…µ 25 indicating that this composition is the optimum ratio the ratio of tio2 pbo 1 3 produced impurity which was indicated by the appearance of a peak at 2…µ 26 83 28 54 29 82 and 31 41 based on the diffractogram analysis the highest crystallinity and the smallest crystal size was obtained by pbtio3 with ratio tio2 pbo 1 2 this confirms that the ratio of tio2 pbo 1 2 w w is the optimum mole ratio in this reaction the optimum mole composition caused the atomic order of pbtio3 to increase and produce smaller crystal size and greater crystallinity a smaller crystal size produces better crystallinity than a larger crystal size this was confirmed by the sharper peaks of the diffractogram and the higher the intensity analysis of crystallinity and crystal size is shown in table 3 the determination of the band gap energy eg was carried out by the kubelka munk equation to describe in terms the relationship between the band gap energy eg and f r hv 2 based on fig 2 the synthesized pbtio3 catalyst has a smaller band gap energy than the tio2 the smallest bandgap energy of pbtio3 is 2 73 ev with ratio tio2 pbo 1 2 it is due to the high order of the crystal arrangement and the small crystal size the smaller band gap causes the photocatalyst to be active with visible light irradiation so that the excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band produced electron holes in addition the lower band gap energy leads to easier excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band faster electron excitation causes better photocatalytic activity photocatalyst with good crystallinity has better atomic structure regularity it also causes regularity in the valence band and conduction band so that the band gap energy becomes smaller the ftir spectra of tio2 and pbtio3 compounds is shown in fig 3 ftir spectra of tio2 shows the absorption of the ohstr group at a wave number of 3409 33 cm 1 originating from h2o molecules adsorbed on the surface of the tio2 the absorption of the ti o ti group is shown at wavenumber 548 77 414 71 cm 1 and the ohbend group absorption from ti oh is shown at wavenumber 1630 8 cm 1 the ftir spectra of pbtio3 indicates that there were several shiftings from ti o ti groups at wave numbers 540 09 506 22 cm 1 ohstr at wave numbers 3536 90 3167 25 cm 1 ohbend at wave numbers 1658 85 1574 63 cm 1 the peak of pb o groups shows at wave numbers 1445 71 1331 31 cm 1 in addition there is a new peak at a wave number of around 770 750 cm 1 due to the formation of pb o ti the surface morphology of the pbtio3 crystals using 20 000 times magnification is as shown in fig 4 the morphology of tio2 is shaped like an irregular sphere while the morphology of pbtio3 is shaped like an irregular cube particle the percentages of pb ti and o metals of pbtio3 with ratio tio2 pbo 1 2 were 75 31 10 02 and 14 68 while pbtio3 with ratio tio2 pbo 1 3 are 74 28 9 52 and 16 20 respectively data from fig 5 shows that the tio2 compound consists of ti and o elements ti has a high weight percentage 64 65 while o has the lower percentage 35 35 pbtio3 compound consists of pb ti and o elements as shown in fig 6 the percentages of pbtio3 compound elements with ratio 1 2 are 75 31 pb 10 02 ti and 14 68 o meanwhile in the tio2 compound pb was not found 3 2 photodegradation sds and sdbs surfactants with variation composition of pbtio3 catalyst photodegradation of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate sdbs surfactants with pbtio3 catalyst synthesized by hydrothermal method has been carried out the catalytic process was carried out using visible light for 30 min the results are shown in fig 7 the degradation of sds and sdbs surfactants using pbtio3 using the hydrothermal method has an optimum point at the ratio of tio2 pbo 1 2 with degradation percentages of 70 42 and 84 84 respectively the results of photodegradation of sds and sdbs surfactants can be influenced by pbtio3 characters such as crystallinity crystal size and band gap energy it is proven by the degradation percentage of sds and sdbs using pbtio3 this is in accordance with the theory that the ratio of reactants can affect the structure and photocatalyst ability of the product hli et al 2015 nguyen phan et al 2009 pbtio3 with ratio tio2 pbo 1 2 has the highest percentage of degradation due to the high crystallinity small crystal size and small band gap energy the pbtio3 catalyst with greater crystallinity smaller crystal size and smaller bandgap energy will increase its photocatalytic activity the smaller band gap energy causes the excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band becomes easier so that it causes better photocatalytic activity based on the results of degradation the percentage of sdbs degradation is higher than sds degradation due to the different chemical structure sdbs has an aromatic ring that is more easily degraded sds and sdbs structure are shown in fig 8 according to yuan et al 2019 linear chains are difficult to break and maintain their chemical structure in the oxidation process against radicals oh so the degradation of sds compounds takes longer time than sdbs compounds 3 3 photodegradation sds and sdbs surfactants with variation ph photodegradation of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate sdbs surfactants with pbtio3 catalyst with ph variation is shown in fig 9 fig 9 shows that at low ph sds and sdbs photodegradation is less effective but photodegradation effectiveness increases at ph 5 this shows that the ph value can affect the effectiveness of the photocatalytic process alahiane et al 2020 the photodegradation process of sds anionic surfactant with pbtio3 ratio tio2 pbo 1 2 reaches optimum conditions at ph 5 of 85 69 at ph 5 the tio2 semiconductor becomes positively charged while the surfactant compound is anionic this causes the interaction between the anionic surfactant and tio2 to be stronger due to the difference in charge between the two compounds photodegradation at ph 3 is not very effective because at acidic ph anionic surfactants have the possibility to be protonated sds and sdbs are protonated more so that it can inhibit the photodegradation process while at a ph more than 5 basic ph effectiveness of anionic surfactant photodegradation decreases due to the tio2 semiconductor being negatively charged this causes photodegradation to become less effective because of a weak interaction between photocatalysts and anionic surfactants based on research paramanik et al 2019 the photocatalytic mechanism using a pbtio3 photocatalyst with a higher energy than the pbtio3 band gap causes the excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band it produces hole h and electron e that can react with h2o and o2 then forming radical compounds during the irradiation process hydroxyl radicals superoxide radicals and hydroperoxyl radicals will be formed continuously the radical forming mechanism can be seen in the reaction below pbtio3 s hv e cb h vb h vb h2o l oh h e cb o2 o2 o2 h ooh these three radical compounds have great ability to degrade sodium dodecyl sulfate sds by reacting with c12h25oso3 ion and forming degraded products the mechanism of photodegradation reaction is shown below c12h25oso3na c12h25oso3 na oh c12h25oso3 degraded product h2o co2 so3 2 ooh c12h25oso3 degraded product h2o co2 so3 2 o2 c12h25oso3 degraded product h2o co2 so3 2 based on research wahyuni et al 2016 if the reaction runs perfectly the photodegradation of the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate using a tio2 sio2 catalyst will produce co2 gas h2o gas so4 2 ions and so3 2 ions the reaction equation is written as follows oh ads c12h25oso3 aq co2 aq h2o l so3 2 aq so4 2 aq according to dong et al 2017 the stages of the photodegradation process of sdbs anionic surfactants include adsorption of sdbs anionic surfactants on the semiconductor surface formation of electron holes radicals and slow dynamic stages in the slow dynamic stage the aromatic ring opens and there are the formation of hydroxyl intermediates peroxides the formation of aldehydes the formation of carboxylic acids and the formation of co2 h2o and other organic acids the reaction mechanism that may occur in the photodegradation process of sdbs anionic surfactants with pbtio3 refers to vilardi et al 2018 4 conclusion pbtio3 can be synthesized from tio2 and pbo using hydrothermal method and it produces photocatalytic materials with high efficiency for surfactant degradation the data obtained shows that the composition ratio of tio2 pbo 1 2 has a low bandgap value of 2 73 ev it also has the optimum sds and sdbs degradation efficiency of 70 42 and 84 84 respectively pbtio3 with a composition ratio of tio2 pbo 1 2 has a fairly high crystallinity of 75 82 and a crystal size of 24 37 nm the surfactant degradation efficiency using pbtio3 photocatalyst is affected by ph photodegradation at ph 5 shows the highest efficiency of sds and sdbs degradation that are 85 69 and 85 56 respectively declaration of competing interest

11677,neighboring states sharing transboundary aquifers should carry out joint assessment of the common groundwater resources to fulfill the eu water framework directive s and water convention s aims therefore the establishment of a representative cross border groundwater monitoring network is essential the transboundary catchments of estonia ee and latvia lv are sparsely populated and feature a relatively scarce monitoring network springs are natural groundwater outflows that may represent a significantly greater catchment area than monitoring wells and their monitoring is more cost effective but a thorough evaluation is required to select the most representative springs for particular groundwater bodies transboundary aquifer systems in this study 59 springs were investigated in the ee lv transboundary area for 37 hydrochemical parameters additionally we assessed 32 monitoring wells to define the aquifer system end members in total 409 groundwater samples were analyzed the sampled springs were pre classified to one of the three aquifer systems quaternary q upper devonian d3 and middle upper devonian d2 significant differences among the pre classified groups in terms of spring elevation q thickness and discharge were detected multivariate and machine learning techniques implementing barium as a tracer were applied to link the studied springs to their main contributing aquifer systems this study shows that the application of diverse hydrochemical and statistical methods help to evaluate the sources of spring water in an area with relatively homogenous

unresearched springs in the transboundary area of estonia ee and latvia lv to the most likely contributing aquifer systems the study provides new insights on how groundwater monitoring networks can be improved in data scarce areas using springs and contributed to the development of a joint groundwater monitoring network between estonia and latvia required to fulfil the requirements of eu water framework directive and water convention 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was carried out in the transboundary area fig 1 of estonia ee and latvia lv the area is located in the central part of the baltic artesian basin bab fig 1 the hydrogeology of which has been described in more detail by perens and vallner 1997 luk≈°eviƒçs et al 2012 virbulis et al 2013 and kitter√∏d et al 2022 the bab consists of multiple bedrock aquifers that for aquifer systems some of which can range 135 352 m in thickness based on the hydrodynamics and chemical composition of groundwater the aquifers in the transboundary area are usually grouped into three aquifer systems fig 2 quaternary q upper devonian d3 and middle upper devonian d2 the q aquifers are formed of sand gravel and loam with complex layering while the dominant water bearing substrate in bedrock aquifers is cemented and somewhat fractured sandstone in d2 and fractured karstified carbonate rocks in d3 fig 2 individual aquifers can be separated by local aquitards formed of clay and siltstone or thick sections of semi permeable glacial till the regional narva aquitard formed of marl and clay separates the d2 system from the deeper aquifers the d2 and d3 aquifer systems are separated by the snetnaya gora amata aquitard composed of clay perens and vallner 1997 transboundary aquifers between estonia and latvia were mainly delineated based on the surface watersheds and then extended by expert judgement to include major towns and cities retike et al 2021 deeper aquifers were excluded as the eu water framework directive particularly address freshwater aquifers being used for drinking water solovey et al 2021 and retike et al 2021 identified significant transboundary groundwater flow in d2 and d3 aquifer systems between the two countries the most intensive groundwater flows were identified in the d2 aquifer system 3681 m3 d net flow from lv to ee in the eastern part of the transboundary area while in the d3 system about 1487 m3 d was estimated to flow from ee to lv previous studies have shown that groundwater in all three aquifer systems is primarily of ca hco3 type with the tds content of about 0

science spring observation database developed in the framework of the interreg wateract project https allikad info or https avoti info it already included information about approximately 2500 springs in estonia and latvia obtained from national groundwater monitoring various projects historical databases and new information added by volunteers a list of potential springs to be sampled was created and visited to verify their representativeness in the framework of this study 89 new water samples were collected from 53 springs and 5 monitoring wells in both countries from selected springs up to three separate samples were taken to account for seasonality the water samples were filtered in situ by using an in line 47 mm filter assembly with a 0 45 Œºm rc regenerated cellulose filter water

for parametrization in the present rf analysis sampling was random with replacement and bagging method was used to build the trees n 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 conceptualizing aquifer systems the hydrostratigraphic division of transboundary aquifers in the transboundary area of estonia and latvia as proposed by perens and vallner 1997 and retike et al 2021 served as the basis for this work fig 2 the individual aquifers of middle and upper devonian were aggregated as two bedrock aquifer systems the upper devonian pƒºavi≈Üas ogre aquifer system d3 composed of a variety of carbonate rocks and the middle upper devonian aruk√ºla amata aquifer system d2 primarily composed of sandstone the quaternary overburden primarily formed of sand gravel and loam constitutes the third quaternary aquifer system q the more clayey quaternary sediments predominantly glacial and limnoglacial may form weak to strong aquitards that can carry shallow perched aquifers 3 2 preliminary classification of springs to aquifer systems based on the bedrock geology map of the transboundary area fig 1 developed in the framework of eu waterres project retike et al 2021 and the quaternary cover thickness layer of the hydrogeological model of the baltic artesian basin bab virbulis et al 2013 the studied springs n 59 and wells n 32 were classified to one of the three aquifer systems q d2 or d3 table 1 in some cases field observations were taken into account to reclassify springs manually the d3 system was the least represented by springs partly due to its small proportion of outcrop in the transboundary area the representation of q system wells was also limited due to their low use in public water supply these factors also had a certain influence on the further conceptualization of water complexes the q aquifer springs were situated at the highest altitude on average table 1 this was because a significant number of q springs were located in the uplands where also the thickness of quaternary cover was also the greatest table 1 there was a statistically significant kruskal wallis test h 2 18 752 p 0 0001 difference in the quaternary cover thickness of the q and d2 d3 aquifers the d2 springs were located at the lowest elevations on average while the d3 springs were situated at about 35 m higher table 1 this might refer to the stratal structure of the outcropping aquifers as also supported by the statistically significant difference h 2 9 279 p 0 002 in spring elevations between the two bedrock aquifer systems d2 and d3 the characteristics of structure and porosity of the aquifers are also indicated by the statistically significant differences h 2 8 032 p 0 018 in discharges between the q and the bedrock aquifer systems table 1 3 3 general hydrochemistry the median and interquartile iqr values of hydrochemical variables of the pre classified springs and wells are shown in table s1 the sec values of the studied water samples ranged from 59 to 980 Œºs cm with the highest overall median values in d2 517 Œºs cm and d3 510 Œºs cm and the lowest in q 381 Œºs cm in the case of bedrock aquifer systems the median sec of springs were somewhat higher than in wells the opposite was true for the q systems fig 3 d table s1 however no fundamental conclusions could be drawn based on sec values alone fig 3d all studied water samples with three exceptions were of ca hco3 type showing the significant contribution of carbonate minerals in all three aquifers systems fig 3a in addition to the carbonate rocks in d3 carbonate minerals are also abundant in quaternary overburden and in the d2 sandstone in the form of cement as also found by koit et al 2021 in a previous study in the transboundary area the homogeneity of ion chemistry in all three aquifer systems was also highlighted by levins and gosk 2008 they explained this with the widespread distribution of carbonate minerals and similar redox reactions mixing processes and ion exchange reactions occurring in both aquifer systems the majority of the d2 and d3 samples were saturated or supersaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite as also previously discussed by koit et al 2021 groundwater in the region generally tends to feature a slightly higher saturation for dolomite than for calcite which most likely reflects the peculiarities of carbonate minerals in the host rocks about half of the q water samples were undersaturated with respect to both minerals fig 3b the redox conditions in spring water samples ranged from oxic oxidized to anoxic reducing in the d2 and q aquifer system while the d3 spring water samples were predominantly oxic fig 3c in contrast well samples in both bedrock aquifer systems d2 and d3 were characterized by anoxic conditions and by oxic suboxic conditions in the q aquifer system well samples fig 3c in the case of d2 wells the majority of the orp values indicated suitable conditions for sulphate reduction and hydrogen sulfide h2s formation orp range 50 to 250 mv due to the lowest median orp values d2 groundwater also featured the highest fe and mn values table 1s 3 4 identifying significant differences between the assigned aquifer systems kruskall wallis test with dunn s multiple pairwise comparison procedure was used to identify statistically significant differences in sample medians between the three presumed aquifer system groups in most cases the significant differences were observed between the q and the two bedrock aquifer systems d2 and d3 table s2 in the case of orp f ba rba ca rba sr fe mn elevation doc ca2 q thickness so4 2 rmn ca rsr ca ntot and no3 significant differences were found between the d2 and d3 aquifer systems the significant discriminatory power of barium and the relevant calculated ion elemental ratios was evident as seen in fig 4 the highest barium concentration was observed in the d2 aquifer system and in the sampling stations associated with the outcrop area of the gauja formation sandstones d3 d2gj while marandi et al 2004 and mokrik et al 2009 studied the barium anomaly in the cambrian vendian cm v aquifer system in northern estonia the occurrence of barium in the d2 and d3 aquifer systems in the ee lv transboundary area has been somewhat less studied koit et al 2021 found in a previous study that barium allowed to distinguish between the d2 and q groundwater in a spring fen in the transboundary area the high levels of barium in middle devonian d2 groundwater have been also previously highlighted by edmunds and shand 2008 and retike et al 2016 levins and gosk 2008 suggested that barium frequently occurring in significant concentrations in the lv shallow confined aquifers is likely originating from mineral dissolution due to extended residence time the mobility of barium in groundwater is controlled by the solubility of minerals enriched in barium commonly barite baso4 and witherite baco3 and the tendency to adsorb to clay minerals or to be bound to oxides and hydroxides jeske 2013 marandi et al 2004 while mokrik et al 2009 suggested that witherite is the source of barium in the cm v aquifer system barite has often been proposed as the prevailing source johnson et al 2017 gilkeson et al 1981 monnin et al 2001 barite is practically insoluble in oxidizing conditions and is highly resistant to weathering while the solubility increases as conditions become reducing jaritz 2004 johnson et al 2017 according to gilkeson et al 1981 high barium concentrations may occur only in groundwater that has a low concentration of dissolved so4 2 the latter is typically lost in groundwater due to so4 2 reduction resulting in hydrogen sulfide h2s production and increased alkalinity gilkeson et al 1981 as seen in fig 5 b the majority of the samples were supersaturated with respect to witherite it is clear that the samples with higher barium content also have a higher saturation with respect to witherite which contradicts the assumption of its dissolution being the primary source the insignificant association between the increased barium and hco3 content shown in fig 5d does not support the dissolution of witherite as the main source of barium in contrast the majority of samples were undersaturated or moderately saturated with respect to barite fig 5a the d2 samples featuring the highest barium concentrations were just near the saturation line of barite and reduced fig 5a the depletion of so4 2 is also evident in these samples likely indicating so4 2 reduction and the consequent dissolution of barite producing barium ions into the solution fig 5c this is also confirmed by the presence of the most negative orp values in the samples with the highest barium concentrations fig 5a and b a number of d2 spring samples deviated from the barite dissolution trend in wells fig 5a which could be due to the precipitation of barium as barite in groundwater being exposed to oxidizing conditions when nearing the spring at the outcrop as also discussed by edmunds and smedley 2000 as supported by higher orp values 3 5 justifying spring classification based on discriminant analysis and regression random forest the presumed spring aquifer system connections were tested by performing discriminant analysis da complemented by the regression random forest rf analysis variables with no missing values for the final 101 observations including the ones featuring significant differences between the assigned aquifer systems according to the kruskal wallis test were included in the da and rf analysis in addition to the quantitative variables the bedrock geology was included as a qualitative variable the factor f1 was responsible for discriminating between the d2 q and d3 clusters along the x axis as seen in fig 6 a whereas the qualitative d3pl bedrock geology index carbonate rocks featured the strongest correlation with f1 followed by mg2 sec alkalinity and cl with which the correlation strength was more modest table s2 the f2 correlated the most with ba rba sr f fetot mn and d2gj bedrock geology index and thus discriminated between d2 d3 and q clusters along the y axis as seen in fig 6a the d3 is discriminated from other clusters primarily due to the qualitative d3pl bedrock geology index and somewhat less because of elevated ca2 and mg2 ion concentrations presumably resulting from the dissolution of carbonate host rocks this supports the claim of overall homogeneity of ion chemistry in the studied aquifer systems as suggested by levins and gosk 2008 the q aquifer cluster observations primarily differed from other clusters because of thicker quaternary cover higher doc orp and al values there were some overlapping observations between d2 and q aquifer systems fig 6a in a few cases d2 observations 49 45 and 46 in table s3 were reclassified to q cluster based on the strong discriminating effect of bedrock geology indices the overlap of q d2 and d3 observations would have been theoretically somewhat greater if the indices would have not been used in the analysis this as could also be seen from the piper diagram fig 3 clearly indicates the relative hydrochemical similarity and the likely influence of mixing processes in the studied aquifer systems the da classified 96 of observations correctly while in the case of the cross validation sample the success rate was 87 table s4 the random forests stabilized at about 40 decision trees fig s1 with a few differences compared to the da observation classifications table s3 the overall outcome was the same the overall hit ratio of rf analysis was 86 14 table s4 similar to the results of the kruskal wallis test and da analysis the important role of ba mg2 and bedrock geology in the classification of observations is highlighted in the rf variable importance fig 7 table s2 the importance of rba sr rba ca doc f sr and na was also noteworthy while some nutrients no3 ptot ntot stable isotopes Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h and sicalcite were less important the lesser importance of nutrients and stable isotopes in the rf model suggests that local watershed specificities land use heterogeneity of local geology aquifer vulnerability etc could have a significant effect on the hydrochemical signature of the spring regardless of the aquifer system 3 6 conceptual model for spring and aquifer connectivity based on hydrochemical signatures although the ion chemistry and dominant water type was similar in both bedrock aquifer systems d2 and d3 the noticeable differences in selected variables made it possible to distinguish between springs more closely related to either aquifer system the evolution of the aforementioned hydrochemical differences could be explained under the assumption that the two bedrock aquifer systems are in theory separated by the snetnaya gora amata aquitard figs 2 and 8 b thereby causing the divergence in the evolution of the hydrochemical signatures while the contribution of higher order flow component is evident in the majority of the springs related to d3 aquifer system as indicated by the elevated sec and mg2 rmg ca sicalcite and sidolomite median values de filippi et al 2021 edmunds and smedley 2000 the effect of local flow component appears to be more important in d3 than in case of d2 fig 8a and b this is likely the reason for the higher no3 ntot cl and so4 2 concentrations as well as the greater iqr range of Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values in d3 aquifer system fig 8b the somewhat elevated so4 2 could originate from pyrite oxidation by dissolved oxygen denitrification but also agricultural fertilizers p√§rn et al 2018 schwientek et al 2008 koit et al 2021 anomalous cl levels can often be caused by anthropogenic activities like road salting and agriculture adriano and doner 1983 koit et al 2021 in summary however the d3 groundwater was perhaps the least distinctive of the three aquifer systems which could be partly due to the effect of mixing and cross formational flow even more so as the snetnaya gora amata aquitard separating it from the d2 aquifer system is considered to be weak medium in efficiency perens and vallner 1997 in the d2 aquifer system a greater overall contribution of the regional flow component with a longer residence time was indicated by the low orp doc ntot and no3 concentrations as well as the low iqr range in stable isotope values Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h indicating less influence from short term meteoric fluctuations fig 8a the claim is also supported by the higher content of certain trace elements ba sr fetot mn rba sr rmn ca rsr ca rba ca and si in d2 groundwater table s1 which generally indicate groundwater with a longer residence time that has developed in a confined and reducing aquifer environment representative d2 springs for example spring no 20 in fig 6 and table s3 type 1 in fig 8a were primarily discharging from confined and anoxic aquifer sections sometimes forming spring groups consisting of multiple discrete point outflows and their water was characterized by higher barium concentrations and showed little reference to anthropogenic impacts there were a few exceptions for example springs no 11 12 and 50 in table s3 where thinner quaternary cover could be suspected allowing a greater contribution of the local component type 2 in fig 8a such springs flowed from partially unconfined conditions as indicated by elevated orp do no3 and ntot values although the d2 sandstone aquifers are generally considered as a terrigenous porous unit converged cave streams and groups of point springs clearly exemplify the significant role of fractures joints faults facilitating groundwater flow in the aquifer system as also discussed by koit et al 2021 in a previous study in the region by retike et al 2016a four different types of quaternary groundwater were identified using major ions nutrients ph and total dissolved solids as input also in this study because of the heterogeneous geology the q aquifer system springs featured great variability in water quality this is reflected in the great range of sec values while the mean and median values were the lowest fig 3d table 2 characteristic to the q aquifer system were elevated doc and al concentrations and orp values table 2 as previously also discussed by koit et al 2021 this reflects the effect of infiltration processes and the rather short residence time of the groundwater aluminum is known to form organometallic complexes with organic matter which enhances its mobility budd et al 1981 consequently it can be generalized that the q springs are dominated by the local flow component as reflected by for example the low content of trace elements fig 8c there were springs discharging from the outcropping d2 sandstones featuring water quality more similar to that of the q cluster springs such springs generally occur at outcrops of d2 bedrock and are locally recharged in many cases these samples fell in the overlapping part of the q and d2 clusters in the da results fig 6a overall the results of the statistical analyses were consistent and vividly reflected the previously identified geochemical processes edmunds and shand 2008 kalvƒÅns et al 2021b karro et al 2020 kitter√∏d et al 2022 koit et al 2021 levins and gosk 2008 mokrik et al 2009 retike et al 2016 occurring in the studied devonian aquifer systems 4 conclusions this study investigated the links between springs and aquifer systems in the transboundary area of estonia ee and latvia lv using multivariate and machine learning methods often cross border territories are characterized as data scarce areas due to concentration of groundwater monitoring wells around national interests and local scale groundwater problems springs could fill the gaps in existing groundwater monitoring networks and facilitate the implementation of several international legal acts and agreements such as eu water framework directive or water convention cost effectively however for their introduction into existing monitoring networks the links between springs and aquifer systems needed to be clarified to find out which groundwater body or transboundary aquifer system they represent we investigated 59 springs and 32 monitoring wells in the ee lv transboundary area to characterize the chemical composition of spring water and to define the aquifer system end members the study focused on the shallow aquifer systems in the transboundary area quaternary q upper devonian d3 and middle upper devonian d2 the pre classified spring groups showed significant differences between elevation thickness of quaternary overburden and discharge as all samples featured relatively homogenous ion chemistry discriminant and regression random forest analysis were applied to identify links between the springs and aquifer systems differences in trace element and selected trace element concentrations and their ratios e g ba sr f rba sr rba ca rmn ca rsr ca together with redox sensitive dissolved substances e g doc ntot no3 fetot mn gave the best results in establishing that link generally these differences are related to the longer residence time and more strongly reducing conditions of groundwater in the d2 aquifer system in contrast to d3 and q aquifer systems in the latter shorter residence time and occasional anthropogenic influence in groundwater chemistry e g nutrients showed the dominance or significant impact of local flow component the study serves as an example how the application of diverse hydrochemical and statistical methods may help to evaluate the sources of spring water in an area with relatively homogenous groundwater chemistry the selection of representative springs for transboundary groundwater monitoring should be based on the goals of the monitoring identifying and controlling impacts and pressures on transboundary aquifers springs should be screened using appropriate geochemical indicators in the case of this study homogeneous sedimentary aquifers in temperate climate these turned out to be certain trace elements coupled with major ions that allowed to establish links between aquifers in temperate climate conditions with homogeneous sedimentary aquifers seasonality should be considered when determining sampling frequency for shallow aquifers the results will be used to establish a joint transboundary groundwater monitoring network between estonia and latvia and implement the requirements of eu water framework directive and water convention

11677,neighboring states sharing transboundary aquifers should carry out joint assessment of the common groundwater resources to fulfill the eu water framework directive s and water convention s aims therefore the establishment of a representative cross border groundwater monitoring network is essential the transboundary catchments of estonia ee and latvia lv are sparsely populated and feature a relatively scarce monitoring network springs are natural groundwater outflows that may represent a significantly greater catchment area than monitoring wells and their monitoring is more cost effective but a thorough evaluation is required to select the most representative springs for particular groundwater bodies transboundary aquifer systems in this study 59 springs were investigated in the ee lv transboundary area for 37 hydrochemical parameters additionally we assessed 32 monitoring wells to define the aquifer system end members in total 409 groundwater samples were analyzed the sampled springs were pre classified to one of the three aquifer systems quaternary q upper devonian d3 and middle upper devonian d2 significant differences among the pre classified groups in terms of spring elevation q thickness and discharge were detected multivariate and machine learning techniques implementing barium as a tracer were applied to link the studied springs to their main contributing aquifer systems this study shows that the application of diverse hydrochemical and statistical methods help to evaluate the sources of spring water in an area with relatively homogenous

unresearched springs in the transboundary area of estonia ee and latvia lv to the most likely contributing aquifer systems the study provides new insights on how groundwater monitoring networks can be improved in data scarce areas using springs and contributed to the development of a joint groundwater monitoring network between estonia and latvia required to fulfil the requirements of eu water framework directive and water convention 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was carried out in the transboundary area fig 1 of estonia ee and latvia lv the area is located in the central part of the baltic artesian basin bab fig 1 the hydrogeology of which has been described in more detail by perens and vallner 1997 luk≈°eviƒçs et al 2012 virbulis et al 2013 and kitter√∏d et al 2022 the bab consists of multiple bedrock aquifers that for aquifer systems some of which can range 135 352 m in thickness based on the hydrodynamics and chemical composition of groundwater the aquifers in the transboundary area are usually grouped into three aquifer systems fig 2 quaternary q upper devonian d3 and middle upper devonian d2 the q aquifers are formed of sand gravel and loam with complex layering while the dominant water bearing substrate in bedrock aquifers is cemented and somewhat fractured sandstone in d2 and fractured karstified carbonate rocks in d3 fig 2 individual aquifers can be separated by local aquitards formed of clay and siltstone or thick sections of semi permeable glacial till the regional narva aquitard formed of marl and clay separates the d2 system from the deeper aquifers the d2 and d3 aquifer systems are separated by the snetnaya gora amata aquitard composed of clay perens and vallner 1997 transboundary aquifers between estonia and latvia were mainly delineated based on the surface watersheds and then extended by expert judgement to include major towns and cities retike et al 2021 deeper aquifers were excluded as the eu water framework directive particularly address freshwater aquifers being used for drinking water solovey et al 2021 and retike et al 2021 identified significant transboundary groundwater flow in d2 and d3 aquifer systems between the two countries the most intensive groundwater flows were identified in the d2 aquifer system 3681 m3 d net flow from lv to ee in the eastern part of the transboundary area while in the d3 system about 1487 m3 d was estimated to flow from ee to lv previous studies have shown that groundwater in all three aquifer systems is primarily of ca hco3 type with the tds content of about 0

science spring observation database developed in the framework of the interreg wateract project https allikad info or https avoti info it already included information about approximately 2500 springs in estonia and latvia obtained from national groundwater monitoring various projects historical databases and new information added by volunteers a list of potential springs to be sampled was created and visited to verify their representativeness in the framework of this study 89 new water samples were collected from 53 springs and 5 monitoring wells in both countries from selected springs up to three separate samples were taken to account for seasonality the water samples were filtered in situ by using an in line 47 mm filter assembly with a 0 45 Œºm rc regenerated cellulose filter water

different discriminant analysis da and regression random forest analysis rf were used to test the spring assignments to aquifer systems da is a multivariate statistical method used to classify observations into assigned groups based on a set of independent variables vaselli et al 1997 first observations with missing values were removed from the dataset leaving 101 observations prior to the da analysis the data was tested for normality using the shapiro wilk anderson darling lilliefors and jarque bera tests in the case of non normal distribution the data was log square square root or cube root transformed depending on the skew and standardized as follows 1 x s x d Œº d œÉ d where x s is the standardized variable x d is the original variable Œº d is the mean of the data series and œÉ d is the standard deviation of the data series rf is a nonlinear and nonparametric machine learning algorithm based method used for classification variable selection and for evaluation of variable importance breiman 2001 tyralis et al 2019 rf draws multiple random samples from the analyzed data set and builds a classification and regression tree cart the results of all these trees are combined

for parametrization in the present rf analysis sampling was random with replacement and bagging method was used to build the trees n 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 conceptualizing aquifer systems the hydrostratigraphic division of transboundary aquifers in the transboundary area of estonia and latvia as proposed by perens and vallner 1997 and retike et al 2021 served as the basis for this work fig 2 the individual aquifers of middle and upper devonian were aggregated as two bedrock aquifer systems the upper devonian pƒºavi≈Üas ogre aquifer system d3 composed of a variety of carbonate rocks and the middle upper devonian aruk√ºla amata aquifer system d2 primarily composed of sandstone the quaternary overburden primarily formed of sand gravel and loam constitutes the third quaternary aquifer system q the more clayey quaternary sediments predominantly glacial and limnoglacial may form weak to strong aquitards that can carry shallow perched aquifers 3 2 preliminary classification of springs to aquifer systems based on the bedrock geology map of the transboundary area fig 1 developed in the framework of eu waterres project retike et al 2021 and the quaternary cover thickness layer of the hydrogeological model of the baltic artesian basin bab virbulis et al 2013 the studied springs n 59 and wells n 32 were classified to one of the three aquifer systems q d2 or d3 table 1 in some cases field observations were taken into account to reclassify springs manually the d3 system was the least represented by springs partly due to its small proportion of outcrop in the transboundary area the representation of q system wells was also limited due to their low use in public water supply these factors also had a certain influence on the further conceptualization of water complexes the q aquifer springs were situated at the highest altitude on average table 1 this was because a significant number of q springs were located in the uplands where also the thickness of quaternary cover was also the greatest table 1 there was a statistically significant kruskal wallis test h 2 18 752 p 0 0001 difference in the quaternary cover thickness of the q and d2 d3 aquifers the d2 springs were located at the lowest elevations on average while the d3 springs were situated at about 35 m higher table 1 this might refer to the stratal structure of the outcropping aquifers as also supported by the statistically significant difference h 2 9 279 p 0 002 in spring elevations between the two bedrock aquifer systems d2 and d3 the characteristics of structure and porosity of the aquifers are also indicated by the statistically significant differences h 2 8 032 p 0 018 in discharges between the q and the bedrock aquifer systems table 1 3 3 general hydrochemistry the median and interquartile iqr values of hydrochemical variables of the pre classified springs and wells are shown in table s1 the sec values of the studied water samples ranged from 59 to 980 Œºs cm with the highest overall median values in d2 517 Œºs cm and d3 510 Œºs cm and the lowest in q 381 Œºs cm in the case of bedrock aquifer systems the median sec of springs were somewhat higher than in wells the opposite was true for the q systems fig 3 d table s1 however no fundamental conclusions could be drawn based on sec values alone fig 3d all studied water samples with three exceptions were of ca hco3 type showing the significant contribution of carbonate minerals in all three aquifers systems fig 3a in addition to the carbonate rocks in d3 carbonate minerals are also abundant in quaternary overburden and in the d2 sandstone in the form of cement as also found by koit et al 2021 in a previous study in the transboundary area the homogeneity of ion chemistry in all three aquifer systems was also highlighted by levins and gosk 2008 they explained this with the widespread distribution of carbonate minerals and similar redox reactions mixing processes and ion exchange reactions occurring in both aquifer systems the majority of the d2 and d3 samples were saturated or supersaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite as also previously discussed by koit et al 2021 groundwater in the region generally tends to feature a slightly higher saturation for dolomite than for calcite which most likely reflects the peculiarities of carbonate minerals in the host rocks about half of the q water samples were undersaturated with respect to both minerals fig 3b the redox conditions in spring water samples ranged from oxic oxidized to anoxic reducing in the d2 and q aquifer system while the d3 spring water samples were predominantly oxic fig 3c in contrast well samples in both bedrock aquifer systems d2 and d3 were characterized by anoxic conditions and by oxic suboxic conditions in the q aquifer system well samples fig 3c in the case of d2 wells the majority of the orp values indicated suitable conditions for sulphate reduction and hydrogen sulfide h2s formation orp range 50 to 250 mv due to the lowest median orp values d2 groundwater also featured the highest fe and mn values table 1s 3 4 identifying significant differences between the assigned aquifer systems kruskall wallis test with dunn s multiple pairwise comparison procedure was used to identify statistically significant differences in sample medians between the three presumed aquifer system groups in most cases the significant differences were observed between the q and the two bedrock aquifer systems d2 and d3 table s2 in the case of orp f ba rba ca rba sr fe mn elevation doc ca2 q thickness so4 2 rmn ca rsr ca ntot and no3 significant differences were found between the d2 and d3 aquifer systems the significant discriminatory power of barium and the relevant calculated ion elemental ratios was evident as seen in fig 4 the highest barium concentration was observed in the d2 aquifer system and in the sampling stations associated with the outcrop area of the gauja formation sandstones d3 d2gj while marandi et al 2004 and mokrik et al 2009 studied the barium anomaly in the cambrian vendian cm v aquifer system in northern estonia the occurrence of barium in the d2 and d3 aquifer systems in the ee lv transboundary area has been somewhat less studied koit et al 2021 found in a previous study that barium allowed to distinguish between the d2 and q groundwater in a spring fen in the transboundary area the high levels of barium in middle devonian d2 groundwater have been also previously highlighted by edmunds and shand 2008 and retike et al 2016 levins and gosk 2008 suggested that barium frequently occurring in significant concentrations in the lv shallow confined aquifers is likely originating from mineral dissolution due to extended residence time the mobility of barium in groundwater is controlled by the solubility of minerals enriched in barium commonly barite baso4 and witherite baco3 and the tendency to adsorb to clay minerals or to be bound to oxides and hydroxides jeske 2013 marandi et al 2004 while mokrik et al 2009 suggested that witherite is the source of barium in the cm v aquifer system barite has often been proposed as the prevailing source johnson et al 2017 gilkeson et al 1981 monnin et al 2001 barite is practically insoluble in oxidizing conditions and is highly resistant to weathering while the solubility increases as conditions become reducing jaritz 2004 johnson et al 2017 according to gilkeson et al 1981 high barium concentrations may occur only in groundwater that has a low concentration of dissolved so4 2 the latter is typically lost in groundwater due to so4 2 reduction resulting in hydrogen sulfide h2s production and increased alkalinity gilkeson et al 1981 as seen in fig 5 b the majority of the samples were supersaturated with respect to witherite it is clear that the samples with higher barium content also have a higher saturation with respect to witherite which contradicts the assumption of its dissolution being the primary source the insignificant association between the increased barium and hco3 content shown in fig 5d does not support the dissolution of witherite as the main source of barium in contrast the majority of samples were undersaturated or moderately saturated with respect to barite fig 5a the d2 samples featuring the highest barium concentrations were just near the saturation line of barite and reduced fig 5a the depletion of so4 2 is also evident in these samples likely indicating so4 2 reduction and the consequent dissolution of barite producing barium ions into the solution fig 5c this is also confirmed by the presence of the most negative orp values in the samples with the highest barium concentrations fig 5a and b a number of d2 spring samples deviated from the barite dissolution trend in wells fig 5a which could be due to the precipitation of barium as barite in groundwater being exposed to oxidizing conditions when nearing the spring at the outcrop as also discussed by edmunds and smedley 2000 as supported by higher orp values 3 5 justifying spring classification based on discriminant analysis and regression random forest the presumed spring aquifer system connections were tested by performing discriminant analysis da complemented by the regression random forest rf analysis variables with no missing values for the final 101 observations including the ones featuring significant differences between the assigned aquifer systems according to the kruskal wallis test were included in the da and rf analysis in addition to the quantitative variables the bedrock geology was included as a qualitative variable the factor f1 was responsible for discriminating between the d2 q and d3 clusters along the x axis as seen in fig 6 a whereas the qualitative d3pl bedrock geology index carbonate rocks featured the strongest correlation with f1 followed by mg2 sec alkalinity and cl with which the correlation strength was more modest table s2 the f2 correlated the most with ba rba sr f fetot mn and d2gj bedrock geology index and thus discriminated between d2 d3 and q clusters along the y axis as seen in fig 6a the d3 is discriminated from other clusters primarily due to the qualitative d3pl bedrock geology index and somewhat less because of elevated ca2 and mg2 ion concentrations presumably resulting from the dissolution of carbonate host rocks this supports the claim of overall homogeneity of ion chemistry in the studied aquifer systems as suggested by levins and gosk 2008 the q aquifer cluster observations primarily differed from other clusters because of thicker quaternary cover higher doc orp and al values there were some overlapping observations between d2 and q aquifer systems fig 6a in a few cases d2 observations 49 45 and 46 in table s3 were reclassified to q cluster based on the strong discriminating effect of bedrock geology indices the overlap of q d2 and d3 observations would have been theoretically somewhat greater if the indices would have not been used in the analysis this as could also be seen from the piper diagram fig 3 clearly indicates the relative hydrochemical similarity and the likely influence of mixing processes in the studied aquifer systems the da classified 96 of observations correctly while in the case of the cross validation sample the success rate was 87 table s4 the random forests stabilized at about 40 decision trees fig s1 with a few differences compared to the da observation classifications table s3 the overall outcome was the same the overall hit ratio of rf analysis was 86 14 table s4 similar to the results of the kruskal wallis test and da analysis the important role of ba mg2 and bedrock geology in the classification of observations is highlighted in the rf variable importance fig 7 table s2 the importance of rba sr rba ca doc f sr and na was also noteworthy while some nutrients no3 ptot ntot stable isotopes Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h and sicalcite were less important the lesser importance of nutrients and stable isotopes in the rf model suggests that local watershed specificities land use heterogeneity of local geology aquifer vulnerability etc could have a significant effect on the hydrochemical signature of the spring regardless of the aquifer system 3 6 conceptual model for spring and aquifer connectivity based on hydrochemical signatures although the ion chemistry and dominant water type was similar in both bedrock aquifer systems d2 and d3 the noticeable differences in selected variables made it possible to distinguish between springs more closely related to either aquifer system the evolution of the aforementioned hydrochemical differences could be explained under the assumption that the two bedrock aquifer systems are in theory separated by the snetnaya gora amata aquitard figs 2 and 8 b thereby causing the divergence in the evolution of the hydrochemical signatures while the contribution of higher order flow component is evident in the majority of the springs related to d3 aquifer system as indicated by the elevated sec and mg2 rmg ca sicalcite and sidolomite median values de filippi et al 2021 edmunds and smedley 2000 the effect of local flow component appears to be more important in d3 than in case of d2 fig 8a and b this is likely the reason for the higher no3 ntot cl and so4 2 concentrations as well as the greater iqr range of Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values in d3 aquifer system fig 8b the somewhat elevated so4 2 could originate from pyrite oxidation by dissolved oxygen denitrification but also agricultural fertilizers p√§rn et al 2018 schwientek et al 2008 koit et al 2021 anomalous cl levels can often be caused by anthropogenic activities like road salting and agriculture adriano and doner 1983 koit et al 2021 in summary however the d3 groundwater was perhaps the least distinctive of the three aquifer systems which could be partly due to the effect of mixing and cross formational flow even more so as the snetnaya gora amata aquitard separating it from the d2 aquifer system is considered to be weak medium in efficiency perens and vallner 1997 in the d2 aquifer system a greater overall contribution of the regional flow component with a longer residence time was indicated by the low orp doc ntot and no3 concentrations as well as the low iqr range in stable isotope values Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h indicating less influence from short term meteoric fluctuations fig 8a the claim is also supported by the higher content of certain trace elements ba sr fetot mn rba sr rmn ca rsr ca rba ca and si in d2 groundwater table s1 which generally indicate groundwater with a longer residence time that has developed in a confined and reducing aquifer environment representative d2 springs for example spring no 20 in fig 6 and table s3 type 1 in fig 8a were primarily discharging from confined and anoxic aquifer sections sometimes forming spring groups consisting of multiple discrete point outflows and their water was characterized by higher barium concentrations and showed little reference to anthropogenic impacts there were a few exceptions for example springs no 11 12 and 50 in table s3 where thinner quaternary cover could be suspected allowing a greater contribution of the local component type 2 in fig 8a such springs flowed from partially unconfined conditions as indicated by elevated orp do no3 and ntot values although the d2 sandstone aquifers are generally considered as a terrigenous porous unit converged cave streams and groups of point springs clearly exemplify the significant role of fractures joints faults facilitating groundwater flow in the aquifer system as also discussed by koit et al 2021 in a previous study in the region by retike et al 2016a four different types of quaternary groundwater were identified using major ions nutrients ph and total dissolved solids as input also in this study because of the heterogeneous geology the q aquifer system springs featured great variability in water quality this is reflected in the great range of sec values while the mean and median values were the lowest fig 3d table 2 characteristic to the q aquifer system were elevated doc and al concentrations and orp values table 2 as previously also discussed by koit et al 2021 this reflects the effect of infiltration processes and the rather short residence time of the groundwater aluminum is known to form organometallic complexes with organic matter which enhances its mobility budd et al 1981 consequently it can be generalized that the q springs are dominated by the local flow component as reflected by for example the low content of trace elements fig 8c there were springs discharging from the outcropping d2 sandstones featuring water quality more similar to that of the q cluster springs such springs generally occur at outcrops of d2 bedrock and are locally recharged in many cases these samples fell in the overlapping part of the q and d2 clusters in the da results fig 6a overall the results of the statistical analyses were consistent and vividly reflected the previously identified geochemical processes edmunds and shand 2008 kalvƒÅns et al 2021b karro et al 2020 kitter√∏d et al 2022 koit et al 2021 levins and gosk 2008 mokrik et al 2009 retike et al 2016 occurring in the studied devonian aquifer systems 4 conclusions this study investigated the links between springs and aquifer systems in the transboundary area of estonia ee and latvia lv using multivariate and machine learning methods often cross border territories are characterized as data scarce areas due to concentration of groundwater monitoring wells around national interests and local scale groundwater problems springs could fill the gaps in existing groundwater monitoring networks and facilitate the implementation of several international legal acts and agreements such as eu water framework directive or water convention cost effectively however for their introduction into existing monitoring networks the links between springs and aquifer systems needed to be clarified to find out which groundwater body or transboundary aquifer system they represent we investigated 59 springs and 32 monitoring wells in the ee lv transboundary area to characterize the chemical composition of spring water and to define the aquifer system end members the study focused on the shallow aquifer systems in the transboundary area quaternary q upper devonian d3 and middle upper devonian d2 the pre classified spring groups showed significant differences between elevation thickness of quaternary overburden and discharge as all samples featured relatively homogenous ion chemistry discriminant and regression random forest analysis were applied to identify links between the springs and aquifer systems differences in trace element and selected trace element concentrations and their ratios e g ba sr f rba sr rba ca rmn ca rsr ca together with redox sensitive dissolved substances e g doc ntot no3 fetot mn gave the best results in establishing that link generally these differences are related to the longer residence time and more strongly reducing conditions of groundwater in the d2 aquifer system in contrast to d3 and q aquifer systems in the latter shorter residence time and occasional anthropogenic influence in groundwater chemistry e g nutrients showed the dominance or significant impact of local flow component the study serves as an example how the application of diverse hydrochemical and statistical methods may help to evaluate the sources of spring water in an area with relatively homogenous groundwater chemistry the selection of representative springs for transboundary groundwater monitoring should be based on the goals of the monitoring identifying and controlling impacts and pressures on transboundary aquifers springs should be screened using appropriate geochemical indicators in the case of this study homogeneous sedimentary aquifers in temperate climate these turned out to be certain trace elements coupled with major ions that allowed to establish links between aquifers in temperate climate conditions with homogeneous sedimentary aquifers seasonality should be considered when determining sampling frequency for shallow aquifers the results will be used to establish a joint transboundary groundwater monitoring network between estonia and latvia and implement the requirements of eu water framework directive and water convention

11678,climate change and increased demand for human needs have led to drinking water scarcity in the cities and towns located in the indian himalayan region this paper aims to address the challenge of drinking water security by proposing a model of water demand among households in ravangla town of south sikkim india our field survey results indicate that the water demand increases significantly due to the number of household members between the age of 18 and 60 further we find that the number of taps in the household is positively and significantly correlated with water demand number of water taps storage capacity and the water consumption are positively related however we did not find any such strong association with the number of toilets in the household the gis maps of south sikkim shows the areas with households that will soon face acute water stress and drinking water insecurity in order to address the scarcity of water in these regions policymakers may develop plans like rainwater harvesting to ameliorate the situation through a gis based decision support system graphical abstract image 1 keywords geographical information system decision support system water scarcity water demand sikkim data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drinking water is an important commodity that is required by all but significant portion of populations of india don t have access to water that is safe for drinking many of them are not even aware of the issue further water sources have reduced while population has risen leading to water scarcity in many regions in india and the problem is acute in the indian himalayan region thakur et al 2020 bal et al 2021 dutta et al 2022 in many parts water scarcity is increasing day by day due to shrinking of glaciers decreased temporal spread of rainfall due to climate change multiple uses of water e g car washing agriculture lack of storing capacity of rain water and improper and inefficient recycling of waste water have created a huge crisis in the supply and management of drinking water jasrotia et al 2009 scott et al 2015 singhai et al 2019 water demand water budget and conservation of urban water resources are characterised by price and non price determinants olmstead et al 2007 sahin et al 2018 whereas alternative price structure throughout the elasticity of water demand estimated through the household level estimation olmstead and stavins 2009 bal et al 2021 household water consumptions are determined by both price and non price factors there are complementarities between mean volumetric price of water and water saving behaviour based on a household survey covered for 10 countries and suggested volumetric water pricing as an effective policy measure compared to those price based approach promote economic efficiency thakur et al 2022 grafton et al 2011 in order to make water supply sustainable some of the factors which influences the household water consumption need to be estimated based on the correct evidence on the consumption of individual by taking four scenarios for urban water supply hussien et al 2016 thakur et al 2021 as for the policy perspectives elasticity and price response of residential water tariffs are two important characteristics to understand water saving behaviour through meta analysis bal et al 2021 marzano et al 2018 this study shows that the gis based models can be used as a tool to take a constructive decision on the consumption of drinking water it also suggests that a preliminary survey followed by a detailed survey is required to collect the important data on which drinking water consumption are dependent are extremely effective for the preparation of a dss finally a statistical analysis is already done to find out the water demand index which will be an extremely efficient parameter to get an idea about the water demand in ravangla south sikkim though water crisis problem is existing for years a proper solution has not been worked out we plan to bring in a modern approach to solve the persisting management problem of water in this paper we are envisaging a decision support system for to estimate water demand and management by harnessing the knowledge of local stakeholders and end users based on the gaps identified from the literature the objective of the paper is to address the challenge of drinking water security by proposing a model of water demand among households in ravangla town of south sikkim india the remaining paper is organised as follows section 2 presents the critical literature review section 3 discusses about the description of study area section 4 outlays the research methodology and the source of data section 5 outlays the results and analysis of the study this section also presents the discussions besides with the analysis of results the final section discusses the conclusions and findings of the study 2 literature review several methodological studies have been carried out on the development of dss and hydroeconomic modelling for water resource management and real time water demand management mysiak et al 2005 ponte et al 2016 p√©rez blanco et al 2021 for example a real time demand estimation was estimated for canal irrigation systems in india using gis and dss in distributaries rao et al 2004 however a few studies have been carried out in demand side management using dss abu bakar et al 2021 and such study may be very useful in improve the household efficiency and reduce the per capita household consumption statistical tools and techniques through innovative approaches are very useful to analyse water consumption data to study the relations among the various determinants of water use like demographics socio economic variables income climate variables water supply and hydrological variables panagopoulos 2014 the main hurdles the sustainable water resource management are the socio economics and socio environmental problems arise due to the inefficient allocation of water resources rezaee et al 2021 socio economic and demographic determinants positively influence the household water demand for example gender is positively associative with household s water demand whereas household income and size of the household are significantly affecting the determinants of water demand in some country like botswana motho et al 2022 climate change projection and mitigation on water resources at local levels are the key constraint and the current climate model doesn t include many important hydro climatic parameters rowshon et al 2019 to overcome these issue climate smart decision support system csdss is useful for increasing change in climate change for managing water resources and appropriate for promoting adaptation and mitigation strategies for sustainable water use at the farm level rowshon et al 2019 jaiswal et al 2021 froukh 2001 decision support system dss has been extensively used in developing countries for water supply technologies through user interface database for capacity requirement metric system dynamics and matching algorithm along with case studies and simulation for the performance evaluation zomorodian et al 2018 bouabid and louis 2021 capacity factor analysis model is an important aspect of dss to support water supply and sanitation support choices to develop infrastructure choices among the communities bouabid and louis 2015 a general framework model has been developed by using dss to measure the water resource management considering the diversity in various socio economic biochemical ecological environmental characteristics and hydrodynamic to measure five costal lagoons ecosystem in europe casini et al 2015 due to shortage in water resources and growing water demands information and communication technologies ict were used to develop dss using open source gis to provide and facilitate effective water demands in the egyptian agriculture sector they found that these tools are very helpful to model monitor and predict water demand ghareeb and seif 2020 water shortages are growing globally and the optimization models can be used to minimise the cost using economic and environmental cost abdulbaki et al 2017 due to climate variability huge cost on irrigation systems and farmer s view to improve the yield resulted an increase in the irrigated land in temperate zones hanna et al 2021 to evaluate the cost benefit of operational installation cost of irrigation soil and water assessment tool swat they develop a decision tool through economic module comprises various tools hanna et al 2021 there is a considerable mismatch of water supply and the demand for water in many regions in both developing and developed world to overcome the water scarcity a dss has been developed based on artificial neural network on water demand considering several factors such as water precipitation temperature socioeconomic profile population water uses and water supply locsin and ferolin 2018 the present study establishes a dss for sustainable residential water demand for ravangla south sikkim india the dss on a geographic information system gis platform is therefore envisaged here the dss will be strengthened through knowledge community participation and involvement of local stakeholders it will be useful to spread awareness among the people and to help them to sustain their present and future water scarcity with judicious and careful use of water resources a dss can be viewed as an integrated interactive computer system consisting of analytical tools and information management capabilities designed to aid decision makers in solving relatively large unstructured problems watkins and mckinney 1995 many dsss have been developed to address the problems of water resource management the need for a dss is clearly emergent as a result of the increasing complexity of the decision making situations caused by the numerous conflicting often spatially related objectives and the dissimilarity of stakeholders involved mysiak et al 2005 though the rainfall is moderate to severe in most of the himalayan part of india it faces water crisis firstly because of lack of proper planning and execution of water resource management and secondly due to the increasing population and economic growth urbanisation and changing climatic patterns haque et al 2014 in the present study we have developed a dss by using the water framework directive in europe junier and mostert 2014 dss has been used in valuing the ecosystem services and mostly used in the biodiversity laurans and mermet 2014 although the usefulness differs for various cases but dss increases the awareness to resolve mostly the issues in river basin management junier and mostert 2014 however a common platform on decision making process integrating social economic and environmental issues based on gis is helpful to optimize process like energy powered desalination plants zanuttigh et al 2014 vishnupriyan et al 2021 savun hekimoƒülu et al 2020 dss has also been developed on a gis platform to highlight an area with water problem and it will be helpful to the policy makers junier and mostert 2014 a sustainable water supply management system can be developed based on the water consumption data of house hold and factors influencing the water consumption to forecast future water demand as done in hussien et al 2016 they analysed household characteristics behaviour and intensity of water and indoor and outdoor water users of 763 households for domestic household water consumption and they found average water consumption 117 0 35 8 l day in rural india singh and turkiya 2013 increasing demand in domestic water consumption indicates the need to forecast the domestic water demand the forecasting model can be developed using a static microsimulation technique starting from the regulatory point of view and minimizing the environmental impacts like water abstraction water quality and the water cost williamson et al 2002 gis technique was also adopted for a watershed development program to identify the different sites for water conservation where different types of structure can be constructed varade et al 2017 they have identified potential zones for water conservation structures by carrying out integrated analysis of all the maps and their respective weightage in gis platform was evolved a map showing and their appropriate measures varade et al 2017 gis zoning maps through spatial distribution and water quality index wqi are used to assess the groundwater quality in developing countries for irrigation in arid regions batarseh et al 2021 recently wqi index are applied to evaluate and determine the acceptability of drinking water in the eastern himalayan region of south sikkim through testing monitoring and analysing eight parameters for water quality dutta et al 2022 the study showed that iron contamination in drinking water may be an issue in some region of sikkim and such study may be helpful to the authority for setting up purification plant dutta et al 2022 in many other places multi criteria analysis has been extensively used for groundwater recharging zone through gis to integrate various layers of information incorporating rainfall data watershed drainage density geological and aquifer conditions in the maknassy basin from tunisia chenini et al 2010 gis and remote sensing are useful for estimation of water resources through water balance assessment approach in the water scarce kandi region of jammu where there is an acute shortage of drinking water jasrotia et al 2009 due to change in the environmental quality managing demand and supply side of water resources is an import aspect in developing and developed countries residential water demand developed through gis based spatial dss and determinants which affects the water demand included income household size elderly person over 65 years and the availability of swimming pools jayarathna et al 2017 rainwater harvesting and the identification of the suitable available locations through the help of gis based multi criteria analysis could be a probable and feasible sustainable solution to water scarcity issues and the methodology could be adopted in the arid and semi arid environment in a cost effective manner tiwari et al 2018 singhai et al 2019 scott et al 2015 mckinney and cai 2002 this can be extended for sustainable water supply through identifying the probable water harvesting and potential sites through artificial recharge singh et al 2017 3 study area the indian state of sikkim lies within the indian himalayan region it is divided into four administrative districts the south sikkim district is one of the most important trading and transportation centres in the state the area is covered with endless terraces of farmland and stepped slopes dotted with evergreen spring forests waterfalls and majestic mountains it is bounded by the latitude 27 14 20 n and longitude 88 18 15 e with an area of about 750 km2 the elevation of the land varies between 400 and 2000 m census 2011b as per the 2011 census report the total population of the south sikkim district was 1 46 742 census 2011a there are three main seasons summer april to june rainy season july to september and winter october to march with an average annual rainfall of 162 5 cm households in the south sikkim district are mainly concentrated across five major areas ravangla melli temi jorethang and namchi we randomly sampled households across these areas for water availability and usage we noticed that most households rely on water access from natural springs and wells either through their own means or private piped connections this means that they rely on water flowing from the source to their house via gravity as a result most of the households are susceptible to seasonal reductions in water discharges from natural springs and aquifers we noticed that most households do not get enough water to meet all their daily needs while government provided piped water will be the most beneficial to most families the cost of providing this access is quite significant across mountain terrain while there are several initiatives are taken by the government to improve the water availability through prevention of surface water run off increasing forest cover digging pits to recharge water aquifers as well as building of storage tanks and reservoirs we may need more initiatives to meet household increasing water demand the study area is shown in fig 1 4 data sources and methodology 4 1 data sources in order to collect household data a detailed questionnaire was prepared and it is with the authors and can be produced upon request a multiple choice format was used to get the answers of some questions the questions on the household characteristics such as number of children elders adult males and females household type garden area number of toilets number of taps and showers and average monthly expenditure were included furthermore questions regarding the type of storage duration of use and frequency of filling the storage to get an idea about the volume of water consumed per capita per day were also included in the questionnaire fig 2 shows the locations of the survey 4 2 methodology 4 2 1 ordinary least square ols method we have used the ols method to establish the water demand functions for ravangla south sikkim we have minimized the errors and considered all residuals diagnostics of the model the advantage of use of the ols model can be explained in three ways firstly the ols method can predict the water demand in the long run secondly it is very helpful to find out the important factor which significantly influences the water demand finally it is useful to test the theory in a robust manner hence this method can be applied to identify the factors which significantly affect the water demand in ravangla south sikkim we are interested to measure the elasticity of the independent variables the ols method can be useful to show the important factors which determine the water demand and it can be useful to take better decision in case of water demand finally the forecasting model for water demand can be given as follows 1 w d t Œ± t Œ≤ 1 18 60 t Œ≤ 2 a g e 16 t Œ≤ 2 a g e 60 t Œ≤ 4 t l t Œ≤ 5 t p t Œ≤ 6 m e t Œ≤ 1

number of toilets t p t total number of taps m e t monthly expenditure of households s c t storage capacity of households Œ± t intercept term of households e t error terms 4 2 2 ardl framework we have implemented the bound test auto regressive distributed lag ardl model to test the robustness of our results pesaran et al 2001 this model shows the dynamic effect of explanatory variable on the water demand of ravangla south district of sikkim over the household it also provides the effect of marginal changes of explanatory variable on the change of water demand for household halicioglu 2007 there are mainly four reasons for choosing ardl approach in our study firstly this method is appropriate when the data length is small pesaran et al 2001 secondly it identifies the important factors which influence the water demand for both short and long run thirdly this model is also able to predict efficiently for short data period finally this approach provides the stable and robust results the study has taken care of uncertainty in data that arises due to the primary survey we have used the ols method and for the robustness of our result we have used the ardl approach the uncertainty data may be captured in the error term of the model we have taken care of all residual diagnostics of the model i e autocorrelation heteroscedastic and multicollinearity our result satisfied all the residual diagnostics and confirmed that the result is reliable and can be used for constructing the water demand index further we have used the ardl method which supports our results one of the criteria for conducting the ardl approach is to choose the optimum lag of the data set so we have used the unrestricted vector autoregression var of order p for the growth function thoma 2008 it is presented in equation 2 2 x t Œ∑ j 1 k Œ≤ j x t j Œµ t where x t a g e 18 60 t a g e 16 t a g e 60 t t l t t p t m e t s c t Œ∑ is intercept term and Œ≤j is the slope coefficients and Œµ t is the error term once we have selected the optimum lag in the next step we have calculate the speed of adjustment and the short run equilibrium coefficient by using the vector error correction approach this is presented in equation 3 3 x t Œ∑ x t 1 Œª j 1 k 1 Œª j Œ¥ x t j Œµ t where Œ¥ is first difference and Œª is the slope coefficients 4 Œª Œª y y Œª y x Œª x y Œª x x the precondition of ardl approach is decided from the result of f statistics the null hypothesis of the test is no long run relationship of the water demand it can be written in equation 5 5 h 0 Œ≤ 1 Œ≤ 2 Œ≤ 3 Œ≤ 4 0 a n d h 1 Œ≤ 1 Œ≤ 2 Œ≤ 3 Œ≤ 4 0 we have compared the results of f value of the critical value of both lower and upper bound the null hypothesis is rejected when the calculated f value is greater than both the lower and upper bound of critical value if the calculated f value is within the limit of both lower and upper bound then it is coming under inconclusive region the flow chart of the study is specified in fig 3 5 results and discussions the summary of the statistical analysis is presented in table 1 the results shows that the average daily water consumption is 323 l and the mid value of the water consumption of the residential water demand of ravangla is 250 lt the standard deviation is 195 69 l which implies that the deviation from mean large further the maximum value and the minimum value are 1000 l and 100 l respectively the value of skewness sk shows that the distribution is positively skewed and having leptokurtic curve the jarque bera j b value clearly indicates that the distribution of water consumption is not normal similarly the summary statistics of other selected variables are explained in table 1 in the next step we have conducted the stationary test in order to avoid the problems of spurious relationship among them we have used the augmented dickey fuller test dickey and fuller 1979 and the result of stationary test is presented in table 2 the null hypothesis of the test is that a unit root is present in the series it indicates that if the series is having unit root then the lagged value of the series cannot able to predict the change in present value of the series the results show that all the variables are stationary at level form once we confirmed the form of stationary test of the variables we have used the ordinary least square model for establishing the relationship between the water consumptions with the selected variables before conducting the ols model we have presented the wald test the null hypothesis of the test is there is no long run relationship among them the result is presented in table 3 we have compared the critical value of both narayan 2005 and pesaran et al 2001 for 1 5 and 10 percent level of significance respectively the result shows that the calculated f value is more than the critical value of both narayan 2005 and pesaran et at 2001 in this context we are able to reject the null hypothesis at 1 percent level of significance in the next step we have used the ols model and the results are presented in table 4 we find that the age of more than 18 years and less than 60 years variables is significant and positive this implies that one percent change in such age categories leads to increase the daily water consumption of about 13 more specifically addition of one person of this age group leads to raise the water consumption per day of about 13 l similarly we find a positive and significant relationship between the age group of above 60 and daily consumption of water this implies that one percentage change in the above age group of 60 leads to raise the consumption of about 11 therefore altogether these age groups lead to increase the daily consumption of water of about 25 as the population ravangla of south sikkim of the age groups 18 60 will definitely increase over time the demand for daily per capita consumption of water may raise to 25 in near future in order to estimate water demand in sikkim in near future government of sikkim may conduct such study and it will help them to formulate a workable policy to solve the water crisis in sikkim in near future every year sikkim hosts a large number tourist and water consumption by them is an important factor to be included in the model to assess the water demand due to unavailability of tourist data during the covid 19 pandemic we can t able it in the model in future such analysis can be carried out with tourist data therefore the study shows that ravangla needs sufficient supply of water to meet the basic need of the people it is pertinent to mention that our study did not find any significant relationship between below the age group of 16 years and daily water consumption further our study shows the positive correlation between number of waters taps and the quantity of daily water consumption it is obvious from the fact that the greater number of water taps indicates the more usage of water further there are many side businesses such as tea shops snacks point and very small hotels that require significant amount of water as the consumption of water in the above activities can be converted in terms of use of water tap and hence the variable is included in our model we find that there is a positive and significant relationship between water taps and water consumption the analysis shows that the water consumption increases of about 0 05 l per day due to increase of one tap as ravangla is one of the favourite tourist destinations over the time the flow of tourist may increase and this leads to raise the daily consumption of water in ravangla the number of toilets is another the important variables which influence the daily consumption of water however our study did not find any significant relationship between them similarly the average monthly expenditure is not significantly influencing the daily consumption of water our study finds a positive and significant relationship between storage capacity of the household and daily water consumption finally we have conducted residual diagnostic test such as normality presence of heteroscedasticity and auto correlation in the model the results clearly show that our model is robust and free from such problems more specifically our d w statistics is about 1 75 and further we have conducted the correlogram and the different value of q statistics are presented in table 4 and the results concluded that the model is free from the problem of auto correlation in order to checked the normality and heteroscedasticity we have conducted the jarque bera and arch lm test respectively the results shows that the model stratify the normality condition as well as the homoscedasticity the r square and adjusted r square value are 0 54 and 0 48 respectively this implies that our independent variables are explaining about 53 and 48 percentage levels to the dependant variable 5 1 robustness analysis based on the results from ols model we have given weight and constructed the residential water demand index wdi we have taken into consideration those variables which are significant and influencing the water demand of ravangla we have presented wdi in fig 3 the result shows that the water demand is highly volatile over the different household the stability tests of residuals are shown in fig 4 a and b subsequently we have constructed the long term trend of the residential wdi it is presented in fig 5 the long term result shows that the future residential water demand is highly increasing in the next step we have conducted the ardl model for robustness of our results it shows that we find a similar kind of results and it is presented in table 5 further we have conducted the stability test by using cusum and cusum square test it clearly shows that our model is stable a major limitation of our study is the inability to record the inflow of water at each household because the spring sources are also not consistent and depend on snowmelt and rain water run off into crevices ezbakhe and p√©rez foguet 2019 households cannot predict the availability of water each day and mostly rely on storage tanks due to the unavailability of micro level data and using the aggregate variable data may be caused the misspecification error of the study the limitation of the study is due to the use of proxy variables such as the number of toilets storage capacity etc for measuring the water demand index in our study we have used the ols method and for the robustness of the result the study has used the ardl model however machine learning and artificial intelligence method may improvise the results and can have a better water demand index given that we have surveyed a mountainous region with sparsely populated households there can be issues concerning uncertainties in the data we understand this limitation and therefore we argue that our paper gives a range of the water demand index of households in the region knowing the range of the index will be helpful for the policymaker to account for meeting water demand in the region we recommend more future studies in this region to augment our understanding of water demand in the region 6 conclusion this paper establishes the gis based dss by considering the major factors that determine the residential water demand in case of ravangla south sikkim india in this context we have employed the primary survey method and used the ols framework our study concluded that the age of more than 18 years and less than 60 years are significant and positively determine the residential water demand similarly we concluded that the number of taps water storage capacity is significant and influencing the residential water demand however we find an insignificant relationship between the number of toilets average monthly expenditure and the age group of 16 years on the residential water demand respectively further this paper conducted the ardl approach for robustness analysis we concluded that our model satisfies the robustness condition the results from cusum and cusum square also support the stability of the model subsequently the rwdi was developed by considering those variables which significantly determine the decision process of residential water demand we have integrated the rwdi with gis so that a better and effective policy framework can be designed it is particularly useful in case of ravangla south sikkim and awareness may be created among the people of ravangla save of the water the government of sikkim should take certain steps towards the promotion of rain water harvesting system as alternative water supply declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

11678,climate change and increased demand for human needs have led to drinking water scarcity in the cities and towns located in the indian himalayan region this paper aims to address the challenge of drinking water security by proposing a model of water demand among households in ravangla town of south sikkim india our field survey results indicate that the water demand increases significantly due to the number of household members between the age of 18 and 60 further we find that the number of taps in the household is positively and significantly correlated with water demand number of water taps storage capacity and the water consumption are positively related however we did not find any such strong association with the number of toilets in the household the gis maps of south sikkim shows the areas with households that will soon face acute water stress and drinking water insecurity in order to address the scarcity of water in these regions policymakers may develop plans like rainwater harvesting to ameliorate the situation through a gis based decision support system graphical abstract image 1 keywords geographical information system decision support system water scarcity water demand sikkim data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drinking water is an important commodity that is required by all but significant portion of populations of india don t have access to water that is safe for drinking many of them are not even aware of the issue further water sources have reduced while population has risen leading to water scarcity in many regions in india and the problem is acute in the indian himalayan region thakur et al 2020 bal et al 2021 dutta et al 2022 in many parts water scarcity is increasing day by day due to shrinking of glaciers decreased temporal spread of rainfall due to climate change multiple uses of water e g car washing agriculture lack of storing capacity of rain water and improper and inefficient recycling of waste water have created a huge crisis in the supply and management of drinking water jasrotia et al 2009 scott et al 2015 singhai et al 2019 water demand water budget and conservation of urban water resources are characterised by price and non price determinants olmstead et al 2007 sahin et al 2018 whereas alternative price structure throughout the elasticity of water demand estimated through the household level estimation olmstead and stavins 2009 bal et al 2021 household water consumptions are determined by both price and non price factors there are complementarities between mean volumetric price of water and water saving behaviour based on a household survey covered for 10 countries and suggested volumetric water pricing as an effective policy measure compared to those price based approach promote economic efficiency thakur et al 2022 grafton et al 2011 in order to make water supply sustainable some of the factors which influences the household water consumption need to be estimated based on the correct evidence on the consumption of individual by taking four scenarios for urban water supply hussien et al 2016 thakur et al 2021 as for the policy perspectives elasticity and price response of residential water tariffs are two important characteristics to understand water saving behaviour through meta analysis bal et al 2021 marzano et al 2018 this study shows that the gis based models can be used as a tool to take a constructive decision on the consumption of drinking water it also suggests that a preliminary survey followed by a detailed survey is required to collect the important data on which drinking water consumption are dependent are extremely effective for the preparation of a dss finally a statistical analysis is already done to find out the water demand index which will be an extremely efficient parameter to get an idea about the water demand in ravangla south sikkim though water crisis problem is existing for years a proper solution has not been worked out we plan to bring in a modern approach to solve the persisting management problem of water in this paper we are envisaging a decision support system for to estimate water demand and management by harnessing the knowledge of local stakeholders and end users based on the gaps identified from the literature the objective of the paper is to address the challenge of drinking water security by proposing a model of water demand among households in ravangla town of south sikkim india the remaining paper is organised as follows section 2 presents the critical literature review section 3 discusses about the description of study area section 4 outlays the research methodology and the source of data section 5 outlays the results and analysis of the study this section also presents the discussions besides with the analysis of results the final section discusses the conclusions and findings of the study 2 literature review several methodological studies have been carried out on the development of dss and hydroeconomic modelling for water resource management and real time water demand management mysiak et al 2005 ponte et al 2016 p√©rez blanco et al 2021 for example a real time demand estimation was estimated for canal irrigation systems in india using gis and dss in distributaries rao et al 2004 however a few studies have been carried out in demand side management using dss abu bakar et al 2021 and such study may be very useful in improve the household efficiency and reduce the per capita household consumption statistical tools and techniques through innovative approaches are very useful to analyse water consumption data to study the relations among the various determinants of water use like demographics socio economic variables income climate variables water supply and hydrological variables panagopoulos 2014 the main hurdles the sustainable water resource management are the socio economics and socio environmental problems arise due to the inefficient allocation of water resources rezaee et al 2021 socio economic and demographic determinants positively influence the household water demand for example gender is positively associative with household s water demand whereas household income and size of the household are significantly affecting the determinants of water demand in some country like botswana motho et al 2022 climate change projection and mitigation on water resources at local levels are the key constraint and the current climate model doesn t include many important hydro climatic parameters rowshon et al 2019 to overcome these issue climate smart decision support system csdss is useful for increasing change in climate change for managing water resources and appropriate for promoting adaptation and mitigation strategies for sustainable water use at the farm level rowshon et al 2019 jaiswal et al 2021 froukh 2001 decision support system dss has been extensively used in developing countries for water supply technologies through user interface database for capacity requirement metric system dynamics and matching algorithm along with case studies and simulation for the performance evaluation zomorodian et al 2018 bouabid and louis 2021 capacity factor analysis model is an important aspect of dss to support water supply and sanitation support choices to develop infrastructure choices among the communities bouabid and louis 2015 a general framework model has been developed by using dss to measure the water resource management considering the diversity in various socio economic biochemical ecological environmental characteristics and hydrodynamic to measure five costal lagoons ecosystem in europe casini et al 2015 due to shortage in water resources and growing water demands information and communication technologies ict were used to develop dss using open source gis to provide and facilitate effective water demands in the egyptian agriculture sector they found that these tools are very helpful to model monitor and predict water demand ghareeb and seif 2020 water shortages are growing globally and the optimization models can be used to minimise the cost using economic and environmental cost abdulbaki et al 2017 due to climate variability huge cost on irrigation systems and farmer s view to improve the yield resulted an increase in the irrigated land in temperate zones hanna et al 2021 to evaluate the cost benefit of operational installation cost of irrigation soil and water assessment tool swat they develop a decision tool through economic module comprises various tools hanna et al 2021 there is a considerable mismatch of water supply and the demand for water in many regions in both developing and developed world to overcome the water scarcity a dss has been developed based on artificial neural network on water demand considering several factors such as water precipitation temperature socioeconomic profile population water uses and water supply locsin and ferolin 2018 the present study establishes a dss for sustainable residential water demand for ravangla south sikkim india the dss on a geographic information system gis platform is therefore envisaged here the dss will be strengthened through knowledge community participation and involvement of local stakeholders it will be useful to spread awareness among the people and to help them to sustain their present and future water scarcity with judicious and careful use of water resources a dss can be viewed as an integrated interactive computer system consisting of analytical tools and information management capabilities designed to aid decision makers in solving relatively large unstructured problems watkins and mckinney 1995 many dsss have been developed to address the problems of water resource management the need for a dss is clearly emergent as a result of the increasing complexity of the decision making situations caused by the numerous conflicting often spatially related objectives and the dissimilarity of stakeholders involved mysiak et al 2005 though the rainfall is moderate to severe in most of the himalayan part of india it faces water crisis firstly because of lack of proper planning and execution of water resource management and secondly due to the increasing population and economic growth urbanisation and changing climatic patterns haque et al 2014 in the present study we have developed a dss by using the water framework directive in europe junier and mostert 2014 dss has been used in valuing the ecosystem services and mostly used in the biodiversity laurans and mermet 2014 although the usefulness differs for various cases but dss increases the awareness to resolve mostly the issues in river basin management junier and mostert 2014 however a common platform on decision making process integrating social economic and environmental issues based on gis is helpful to optimize process like energy powered desalination plants zanuttigh et al 2014 vishnupriyan et al 2021 savun hekimoƒülu et al 2020 dss has also been developed on a gis platform to highlight an area with water problem and it will be helpful to the policy makers junier and mostert 2014 a sustainable water supply management system can be developed based on the water consumption data of house hold and factors influencing the water consumption to forecast future water demand as done in hussien et al 2016 they analysed household characteristics behaviour and intensity of water and indoor and outdoor water users of 763 households for domestic household water consumption and they found average water consumption 117 0 35 8 l day in rural india singh and turkiya 2013 increasing demand in domestic water consumption indicates the need to forecast the domestic water demand the forecasting model can be developed using a static microsimulation technique starting from the regulatory point of view and minimizing the environmental impacts like water abstraction water quality and the water cost williamson et al 2002 gis technique was also adopted for a watershed development program to identify the different sites for water conservation where different types of structure can be constructed varade et al 2017 they have identified potential zones for water conservation structures by carrying out integrated analysis of all the maps and their respective weightage in gis platform was evolved a map showing and their appropriate measures varade et al 2017 gis zoning maps through spatial distribution and water quality index wqi are used to assess the groundwater quality in developing countries for irrigation in arid regions batarseh et al 2021 recently wqi index are applied to evaluate and determine the acceptability of drinking water in the eastern himalayan region of south sikkim through testing monitoring and analysing eight parameters for water quality dutta et al 2022 the study showed that iron contamination in drinking water may be an issue in some region of sikkim and such study may be helpful to the authority for setting up purification plant dutta et al 2022 in many other places multi criteria analysis has been extensively used for groundwater recharging zone through gis to integrate various layers of information incorporating rainfall data watershed drainage density geological and aquifer conditions in the maknassy basin from tunisia chenini et al 2010 gis and remote sensing are useful for estimation of water resources through water balance assessment approach in the water scarce kandi region of jammu where there is an acute shortage of drinking water jasrotia et al 2009 due to change in the environmental quality managing demand and supply side of water resources is an import aspect in developing and developed countries residential water demand developed through gis based spatial dss and determinants which affects the water demand included income household size elderly person over 65 years and the availability of swimming pools jayarathna et al 2017 rainwater harvesting and the identification of the suitable available locations through the help of gis based multi criteria analysis could be a probable and feasible sustainable solution to water scarcity issues and the methodology could be adopted in the arid and semi arid environment in a cost effective manner tiwari et al 2018 singhai et al 2019 scott et al 2015 mckinney and cai 2002 this can be extended for sustainable water supply through identifying the probable water harvesting and potential sites through artificial recharge singh et al 2017 3 study area the indian state of sikkim lies within the indian himalayan region it is divided into four administrative districts the south sikkim district is one of the most important trading and transportation centres in the state the area is covered with endless terraces of farmland and stepped slopes dotted with evergreen spring forests waterfalls and majestic mountains it is bounded by the latitude 27 14 20 n and longitude 88 18 15 e with an area of about 750 km2 the elevation of the land varies between 400 and 2000 m census 2011b as per the 2011 census report the total population of the south sikkim district was 1 46 742 census 2011a there are three main seasons summer april to june rainy season july to september and winter october to march with an average annual rainfall of 162 5 cm households in the south sikkim district are mainly concentrated across five major areas ravangla melli temi jorethang and namchi we randomly sampled households across these areas for water availability and usage we noticed that most households rely on water access from natural springs and wells either through their own means or private piped connections this means that they rely on water flowing from the source to their house via gravity as a result most of the households are susceptible to seasonal reductions in water discharges from natural springs and aquifers we noticed that most households do not get enough water to meet all their daily needs while government provided piped water will be the most beneficial to most families the cost of providing this access is quite significant across mountain terrain while there are several initiatives are taken by the government to improve the water availability through prevention of surface water run off increasing forest cover digging pits to recharge water aquifers as well as building of storage tanks and reservoirs we may need more initiatives to meet household increasing water demand the study area is shown in fig 1 4 data sources and methodology 4 1 data sources in order to collect household data a detailed questionnaire was prepared and it is with the authors and can be produced upon request a multiple choice format was used to get the answers of some questions the questions on the household characteristics such as number of children elders adult males and females household type garden area number of toilets number of taps and showers and average monthly expenditure were included furthermore questions regarding the type of storage duration of use and frequency of filling the storage to get an idea about the volume of water consumed per capita per day were also included in the questionnaire fig 2 shows the locations of the survey 4 2 methodology 4 2 1 ordinary least square ols method we have used the ols method to establish the water demand functions for ravangla south sikkim we have minimized the errors and considered all residuals diagnostics of the model the advantage of use of the ols model can be explained in three ways firstly the ols method can predict the water demand in the long run secondly it is very helpful to find out the important factor which significantly influences the water demand finally it is useful to test the theory in a robust manner hence this method can be applied to identify the factors which significantly affect the water demand in ravangla south sikkim we are interested to measure the elasticity of the independent variables the ols method can be useful to show the important factors which determine the water demand and it can be useful to take better decision in case of water demand finally the forecasting model for water demand can be given as follows 1 w d t Œ± t Œ≤ 1 18 60 t Œ≤ 2 a g e 16 t Œ≤ 2 a g e 60 t Œ≤ 4 t l t Œ≤ 5 t p t Œ≤ 6 m e t Œ≤ 1 s c t e t where w d t water demand for households a g e 18 60 t age between greater than 18 but less than 60 of households a g e 16 t age of 16 a g e 60 t age greater than 60 of households t l t total number of toilets t p t total number of taps m e t monthly expenditure of households s c t storage capacity of households Œ± t intercept term of households e t error terms 4 2 2 ardl framework we have implemented the bound test auto regressive distributed lag ardl model to test the robustness of our results pesaran et al 2001 this model shows the dynamic effect of explanatory variable on the water demand of ravangla south district of sikkim over the household it also provides the effect of marginal changes of explanatory variable on the change of water demand for household halicioglu 2007 there are mainly four reasons for choosing ardl approach in our study firstly this method is appropriate when the data length is small pesaran et al 2001 secondly it identifies the important factors which influence the water demand for both short and long run thirdly this model is also able to predict efficiently for short data period finally this approach provides the stable and robust results the study has taken care of uncertainty in data that arises due to the primary survey we have used the ols method and for the robustness of our result we have used the ardl approach the uncertainty data may be captured in the error term of the model we have taken care of all residual diagnostics of the model i e autocorrelation heteroscedastic and multicollinearity our result satisfied all the residual diagnostics and confirmed that the result is reliable and can be used for constructing the water demand index further we have used the ardl method which supports our results one of the criteria for conducting the ardl approach is to choose the optimum lag of the data set so we have used the unrestricted vector autoregression var of order p for the growth function thoma 2008 it is presented in equation 2 2 x t Œ∑ j 1 k Œ≤ j x t j Œµ t where x t a g e 18 60 t a g e 16 t a g e 60 t t l t t p t m e t s c t Œ∑ is intercept term and Œ≤j is the slope coefficients and Œµ t is the error term once we have selected the optimum lag in the next step we have calculate the speed of adjustment and the short run equilibrium coefficient by using the vector error correction approach this is presented in equation 3 3 x t Œ∑ x t 1 Œª j 1 k 1 Œª j Œ¥ x t j Œµ t where Œ¥ is first difference and Œª is the slope coefficients 4 Œª Œª y y Œª y x Œª x y Œª x x the precondition of ardl approach is decided from the result of f statistics the null hypothesis of the test is no long run relationship of the water demand it can be written in equation 5 5 h 0 Œ≤ 1 Œ≤ 2 Œ≤ 3 Œ≤ 4 0 a n d h 1 Œ≤ 1 Œ≤ 2 Œ≤ 3 Œ≤ 4 0 we have compared the results of f value of the critical value of both lower and upper bound the null hypothesis is rejected when the calculated f value is greater than both the lower and upper bound of critical value if the calculated f value is within the limit of both lower and upper bound then it is coming under inconclusive region the flow chart of the study is specified in fig 3 5 results and discussions the summary of the statistical analysis is presented in table 1 the results shows that the average daily water consumption is 323 l and the mid value of the water consumption of the residential water demand of ravangla is 250 lt the standard deviation is 195 69 l which implies that the deviation from mean large further the maximum value and the minimum value are 1000 l and 100 l respectively the value of skewness sk shows that the distribution is positively skewed and having leptokurtic curve the jarque bera j b value clearly indicates that the distribution of water consumption is not normal similarly the summary statistics of other selected variables are explained in table 1 in the next step we have conducted the stationary test in order to avoid the problems of spurious relationship among them we have used the augmented dickey fuller test dickey and fuller 1979 and the result of stationary test is presented in table 2 the null hypothesis of the test is that a unit root is present in the series it indicates that if the series is having unit root then the lagged value of the series cannot able to predict the change in present value of the series the results show that all the variables are stationary at level form once we confirmed the form of stationary test of the variables we have used the ordinary least square model for establishing the relationship between the water consumptions with the selected variables before conducting the ols model we have presented the wald test the null hypothesis of the test is there is no long run relationship among them the result is presented in table 3 we have compared the critical value of both narayan 2005 and pesaran et al 2001 for 1 5 and 10 percent level of significance respectively the result shows that the calculated f value is more than the critical value of both narayan 2005 and pesaran et at 2001 in this context we are able to reject the null hypothesis at 1 percent level of significance in the next step we have used the ols model and the results are presented in table 4 we find that the age of more than 18 years and less than 60 years variables is significant and positive this implies that one percent change in such age categories leads to increase the daily water consumption of about 13 more specifically addition of one person of this age group leads to raise the water consumption per day of about 13 l similarly we find a positive and significant relationship between the age group of above 60 and daily consumption of water this implies that one percentage change in the above age group of 60 leads to raise the consumption of about 11 therefore altogether these age groups lead to increase the daily consumption of water of about 25 as the population ravangla of south sikkim of the age groups 18 60 will definitely increase over time the demand for daily per capita consumption of water may raise to 25 in near future in order to estimate water demand in sikkim in near future government of sikkim may conduct such study and it will help them to formulate a workable policy to solve the water crisis in sikkim in near future every year sikkim hosts a large number tourist and water consumption by them is an important factor to be included in the model to assess the water demand due to unavailability of tourist data during the covid 19 pandemic we can t able it in the model in future such analysis can be carried out with tourist data therefore the study shows that ravangla needs sufficient supply of water to meet the basic need of the people it is pertinent to mention that our study did not find any significant relationship between below the age group of 16 years and daily water consumption further our study shows the positive correlation between number of waters taps and the quantity of daily water consumption it is obvious from the fact that the greater number of water taps indicates the more usage of water further there are many side businesses such as tea shops snacks point and very small hotels that require significant amount of water as the consumption of water in the above activities can be converted in terms of use of water tap and hence the variable is included in our model we find that there is a positive and significant relationship between water taps and water consumption the analysis shows that the water consumption increases of about 0 05 l per day due to increase of one tap as ravangla is one of the favourite tourist destinations over the time the flow of tourist may increase and this leads to raise the daily consumption of water in ravangla the number of toilets is another the important variables which influence the daily consumption of water however our study did not find any significant relationship between them similarly the average monthly expenditure is not significantly influencing the daily consumption of water our study finds a positive and significant relationship between storage capacity of the household and daily water consumption finally we have conducted residual diagnostic test such as normality presence of heteroscedasticity and auto correlation in the model the results clearly show that our model is robust and free from such problems more specifically our d w statistics is about 1 75 and further we have conducted the correlogram and the different value of q statistics are presented in table 4 and the results concluded that the model is free from the problem of auto correlation in order to checked the normality and heteroscedasticity we have conducted the jarque bera and arch lm test respectively the results shows that the model stratify the normality condition as well as the homoscedasticity the r square and adjusted r square value are 0 54 and 0 48 respectively this implies that our independent variables are explaining about 53 and 48 percentage levels to the dependant variable 5 1 robustness analysis based on the results from ols model we have given weight and constructed the residential water demand index wdi we have taken into consideration those variables which are significant and influencing the water demand of ravangla we have presented wdi in fig 3 the result shows that the water demand is highly volatile over the different household the stability tests of residuals are shown in fig 4 a and b subsequently we have constructed the long term trend of the residential wdi it is presented in fig 5 the long term result shows that the future residential water demand is highly increasing in the next step we have conducted the ardl model for robustness of our results it shows that we find a similar kind of results and it is presented in table 5 further we have conducted the stability test by using cusum and cusum square test it clearly shows that our model is stable a major limitation of our study is the inability to record the inflow of water at each household because the spring sources are also not consistent and depend on snowmelt and rain water run off into crevices ezbakhe and p√©rez foguet 2019 households cannot predict the availability of water each day and mostly rely on storage tanks due to the unavailability of micro level data and using the aggregate variable data may be caused the misspecification error of the study the limitation of the study is due to the use of proxy variables such as the number of toilets storage capacity etc for measuring the water demand index in our study we have used the ols method and for the robustness of the result the study has used the ardl model however machine learning and artificial intelligence method may improvise the results and can have a better water demand index given that we have surveyed a mountainous region with sparsely populated households there can be issues concerning uncertainties in the data we understand this limitation and therefore we argue that our paper gives a range of the water demand index of households in the region knowing the range of the index will be helpful for the policymaker to account for meeting water demand in the region we recommend more future studies in this region to augment our understanding of water demand in the region 6 conclusion this paper establishes the gis based dss by considering the major factors that determine the residential water demand in case of ravangla south sikkim india in this context we have employed the primary survey method and used the ols framework our study concluded that the age of more than 18 years and less than 60 years are significant and positively determine the residential water demand similarly we concluded that the number of taps water storage capacity is significant and influencing the residential water demand however we find an insignificant relationship between the number of toilets average monthly expenditure and the age group of 16 years on the residential water demand respectively further this paper conducted the ardl approach for robustness analysis we concluded that our model satisfies the robustness condition the results from cusum and cusum square also support the stability of the model subsequently the rwdi was developed by considering those variables which significantly determine the decision process of residential water demand we have integrated the rwdi with gis so that a better and effective policy framework can be designed it is particularly useful in case of ravangla south sikkim and awareness may be created among the people of ravangla save of the water the government of sikkim should take certain steps towards the promotion of rain water harvesting system as alternative water supply declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

5 mg l can cause skeletal and dental fluorosis zhao et al 2015 surface water in several parts of the world does not meet the quality requirements of different sectors such as domestic agricultural and industrial sectors ahmad and bhattacharya 2021 bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 therefore groundwater serves as the major source of global freshwater bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 coomar and mukherjee 2021 mukherjee et al 2021 high concentrations of f have been reported in more than 35 countries of the world exposing approximately 200 million people at the risk of fluorosis ayoob et al 2008 ijumulana et al 2021 2022 in northern parts of tanzania the f concentrations in groundwater have been observed above 10 mg l including tanga arusha manyara and kilimanjaro regions these regions lack alternative sources of drinking water ijumulana et al 2021 ligate et al 2021 this situation calls for attention to mitigate the problem by lowering f concentration below the maximum allowable concentration nd√© tchoup√© et al 2015 several defluoridation techniques have been discussed in the literature e g nano filtration adsorption ion exchange coagulation reverse osmosis and electrochemical method maity et al 2018 each of these techniques has its strength and limitations for example ion exchange coagulation and electrochemical membrane methods require high installation and maintenance costs habuda staniƒá et al 2014 sivarajasekar et al 2017 on the other hand adsorption techniques require relatively modest investment and maintenance due to their simple design and availability of a wide range of materials that can be used as adsorbents bhatnagar et al 2011 however the applicability of some adsorbents is limited due to their low f removal capacity typically the selection of adsorbent materials depends on the removal capacity capital investment and running cost local availability of materials user preference and acceptance by the community kimambo et al 2019 bauxite is a naturally abundant mineral the current estimation of global bauxite resources range between 55 and 75 billion tons usgs 2021 bauxites are divided into two main categorizes which are lateritic and karst bauxites the main producers of lateritic bauxite are countries such as guinea india australia north and south america while most of karst bauxite is produced by countries such as jamaica greece france china russia and kazakhstan hache et al 2021 the countries with largest bauxite reserves are shown in table 1 bauxite contains aluminium oxide iron oxide silica and titanium oxides in variable amounts the composition of different bauxites differs as a result of differences in the production and formation process alhassan et al 2020 although raw bauxite can be used as an adsorbent for f removal from water it contains impurities that can interfere with the adsorption and may leach unwanted ions into the treated water alhassan et al 2020 sajidu et al 2012 the bauxite can be modified in order to improve its adsorption efficiency ability to regenerate adsorbent and the ph range in which it can adsorb f ions the modification of adsorbent can change its surface chemistry and or functional properties furthermore the bauxite can be modified by metal impregnation heating acidifying and crushing alhassan et al 2020 the impregnation using metals e g al3 increases the content of the gibbsite compared to hematite which increases f removal efficiency gibbsite being an aluminum based oxide that possesses higher defluoridation capabilities than hematite which is an iron based oxide salifu et al 2016 heating causes dehydroxylation which increases the surface area for binding nd√© tchoup√© et al 2015 and lowers the time to reach equilibrium alhassan et al 2020 crushing increases the f removal capacity by increasing the surface area for binding alhassan et al 2020 the f adsorption capacity of any adsorbent can be affected by several factors kimambo et al 2019 the adsorption capacity for f removal using bauxite at different experimental conditions is given in table 2 in tanzania large bauxite deposits are observed in mbeya and tanga regions the total estimate of bauxite reserves in kidundai magamba and mabughai mlomboza bauxite deposits in the tanga region is about 37 million tons mutakyahwa et al 2003 few studies on the application of bauxite from tanzania for the defluoridation of water have been carried out thole et al 2012a 2012b 2013 however only few parameters which affect the f removal from water were tested the current study aims to investigate the usability of bauxite from tanzania and the factors which can affect its f removal capacity the systematic batch experiment was performed and compared with modeling to better understand the removal of f by tanzanian bauxite the outcome this investigation intends to provide an effective and low cost method for f removal from water 2 materials and methods 2 1 geographical origins of the adsorbent and water samples the bauxite used in this study was obtained from bauxite mine located in lushoto district in tanga region northeastern tanzania fig 1 shows the sampling location for the studied bauxite and other districts with bauxite mines in tanzania the water sample used in this study was obtained from a natural spring supplementary figure sf1 in the arusha region which is one of the largest regional f hotspots in northern tanzania ijumulana et al 2020 water from this spring is used by the community as a drinking water source according to the national population census of 2012 approximately 25 of the northern development zone ndz population lives in the arusha region where only 30 of the groundwater sources are safe in terms of f levels for drinking purposes this percentage is not adequate to accommodate the large population forcing most of the communities to depend on f contaminated water as a consequence the majority of community members in this region are prone to dental skeletal and crippling fluorosis ijumulana et al 2021 2 2 preparations and characterization of adsorbent material the bauxite sample was ground and sieved until all the particles had a diameter of 0 075 mm the mineral phase composition was determined by btx ii x ray diffraction analyzer inxitu inc united states the measurement was done using co kŒ±1 over a range of 5 55 radiation at a wavelength of 1 78897 √• the chemical composition of bauxite material was determined by using an arl optim x xrf spectrometer thermo fisher scientific inc sweden 2 3 water sampling and analysis a total of 60 l of water sample was collected from the spring and packed in three 20 l polyethylene cans the gps receiver mobile mapper 20 was used to record the location of the sampling site the sampling procedures were followed during water sampling epa 2017 the samples were then transported to the water quality laboratory of the university and dar es salaam and stored at 14 c before the solution was mixed with the adsorbent the ph and f concentrations were measured by using hach potable water quality multimeter hq40d the ph calibration standards 4 7 and 10 and ion concentration calibration standard solution of f 1 5 and 10 mg l were usually applied accuracy 0 5 the concentration of anions cl no3 so4 2 hco3 were determined by using dionex dx 120 ion chromatography ic the concentration of cations al3 as3 ba2 ca2 cd2 cr3 cu2 fe2 na ni2 pb2 se2 v5 zn2 b3 were analyzed by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes the speciation of inorganic ions and complexes in water samples before and after defluoridation were done by using visual minteq 3 1 2 4 batch experiments bauxite with 0 075 mm diameter was calcined in a muffle furnace le 1 11 nabertherm germany at temperatures between 300 and 600 c for 2 h the batch experiments were designed to examine the effect of calcination temperature using 50 ml of 8 27 mg l 1 f raw water in conical flask mixed with 2 g of bauxite with a shaker speed of 200 rpm for 4 min at 30 c after 4 min the ph and f concentration in remaining solution was measured the calcination temperature which gave the highest adsorption capacity was used in subsequent experiments performed at different conditions i e contact time 1 10 min adsorbent dose 20 140 g l particle size 0 075 1 0 mm and temperature 30 50 c in order to determine the optimum conditions for the adsorption the anions and cations in the water sample treated at optimum condition and were analyzed by using dionex dx 120 ion chromatography ic and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes respectively the percent f removal from aqueous media was calculated using eq 1 izuagie et al 2015 1 f r e m o v a l c o c e c o 100 the amount of f adsorbed by 1 g of the adsorbent at equilibrium mg g was calculated using eq 2 maiti et al 2011 2 q e c o c e m v the amount of adsorption at time t q t mg g was calculated by eq 3 zhao et al 2015 3 q t c o c t m v 2 5 adsorption isotherms the two major adsorption models i e freundlich and langmuir adsorption isotherms were used to determine the mechanism and maximum adsorption capacity for f adsorption on bauxite surface 2 5 1 freundlich isotherm freundlich isotherm model uses to describe the behaviour between adsorbate and adsorbent maity et al 2018 freundlich adsorption isotherm assumes multilayer adsorption on the heterogeneous surface sujana and anand 2011 and the maximum adsorption occurs when the adsorbent surface is covered by adsorbate is given by eq 4 4 log q e log k f 1 n log c e the values of k f and 1 n are calculated from the intercept and slope of the plot of log q e against log c e chen et al 2010 the value of 1 n between 0 and 1 indicates the adsorption process was favourable gogoi and dutta 2015 2 5 2 langmuir isotherm langmuir isotherm model assumes monolayer adsorption on a homogeneous surface and there is no interaction between adsorbate molecules on adjacent sites this means the adsorption capacity is the maximum maity et al 2018 langmuir equation which is purely empirical is given by eq 5 5 c e q e 1 q o b c e q o the slope and intercept of the graph of c e q e against c e give the value of q o and b meenakshi and viswanathan 2007 in order to find the practicability of the isotherm the langmuir isotherm was expressed in terms of the equilibrium factor r l by using eq 6 6 r l 1 1 b c o the r l value between 0 and 1 indicates the adsorption is favourable masindi et al 2015 2 6 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics is one of the significant features of adsorbents which gives the awareness on the type and rate of adsorption haddad et al 2019 the two major types of kinetics models which are the reaction and diffusion based models were employed to study the kinetics of the adsorption process viswanathan et al 2009 2010 2 6 1 reaction based models the reaction based model is used to determine the rate of reaction kinetic adsorption constant for f adsorption on calcined bauxite surface which is important in drawing valid conclusions and performing accurate modeling hosseini bandegharaei and chao 2017 the reaction based models were used to study the adsorption of solutes from a liquid solution the pseudo first order means the rate of reaction is proportional to the concentration of only one reactant maity et al 2018 the pseudo first order kinetic model is given by eq 7 7 log q e q t log q e k a d 2 303 t the value of k a d was obtained from the slope of the graph of log q e q t against t viswanathan and meenakshi 2008a 2009 the pseudo second order means the rate of reaction is proportional to the square of reactant concentrations maity et al 2018 the linear pseudo second order is given by eq 8 8 t q t 1 h t q e the values of q e and h are obtained from the slope and intercept of the plot t q t against t the pseudo second order rate constant k g mg min is given by k s l o p e 2 i n t e r c e p t suneetha et al 2014 viswanathan et al 2010 2 6 2 diffusion based models in a solid liquid adsorption process the solute transfer is usually controlled by either particle or intra particle diffusion the contribution of diffusion on the rate of f adsorption on calcined bauxite surface was studied by using particle and intra particle diffusion models hosseini bandegharaei and chao 2017 the likelihood of the particle diffusion resistance affecting the adsorption behaviour was investigated using the particle diffusion kinetic model given by eq 9 9 ln 1 c t c e k p t the graph of ln 1 c t c e against t gives the straight line with the value of k p as the slope sundaram et al 2008 viswanathan and meenakshi 2008b the intra particle diffusion kinetic model was employed to study the contribution of intra particle diffusion on the adsorption behaviour using eq 10 10 q t k int t 1 2 c the plot of q t against t 1 2 gives the value of k int as a slope haddad et al 2019 2 7 thermodynamic parameters of adsorption the thermodynamic properties were studied by changing the temperature in the thermostat controlled shaker from 30 to 50 c 303 323 k the thermodynamic parameters Œ¥ g Œ¥ s and Œ¥ h associated with the adsorption were calculated in order to determine the nature of f adsorption process the Œ¥ g of the adsorption process is calculated from eq 11 sujana and anand 2011 11 Œ¥ g r t l n k c the Œ¥ g was also expressed in terms of Œ¥ h and Œ¥ s by using eq 12 12 Œ¥ g Œ¥ h t Œ¥ s the value of Œ¥ g for the reaction is used to predict whether the reaction can take place spontaneously Œ¥ g 0 or the application the energy is required in order to promote the reaction Œ¥ g 0 the adsorption distribution constant was expressed in terms of Œ¥ h and Œ¥ s as a function of temperature t using eq 13 13 ln k c Œ¥ h r t Œ¥ s r the values of Œ¥ h and Œ¥ s were calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot of ln k c against 1 t the negative and positive Œ¥ h indicates exothermic and endothermic reaction respectively the value of Œ¥ s 0 means the reaction irreversible and stable viswanathan and meenakshi 2008a 2 8 regeneration of bauxite the used bauxite was regenerated by shaking them in 0 015 mol l naoh solution for 2 h and filtered das et al 2005 the filtrate was then washed using distilled water in order to remove excessive naoh from the adsorbent the material was dried for 24 h at room temperature before oven dried at 105 c for 3 h the regenerated bauxite was used for f removal under optimum conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbent materials 3 1 1 chemical composition the data shows that the a l 2 o 3 f e 2 o 3 and s i o 2 were the major oxides in untreated and calcined bauxite table 3 however the percentages of the major oxides differ from that reported in another study a study by thole et al 2013 reported 30 33 a l 2 o 3 14 3 f e 2 o 3 and 15 0 s i o 2 3 1 2 mineralogical composition the xrd data indicate the gibbsite a l 2 o 3 3 h 2 o is the major constituent of raw bauxite fig 2 a the presence of the gibbsite is indicated by characteristic peaks at d values of 4 81 2 45 and 1 99 etc the other minerals which are present in raw bauxite are presented in supplementary table st1 the results were in positive agreement with those reported by mutakyahwa et al 2003 on calcination at 400 c gibbsite peaks disappeared fig 2b because of the loss of water molecules to form boehmite a l 2 o 3 h 2 o eq 14 and corundum a l 2 o 3 eq 15 supplementary table st2 loss of water can also be the reason for the disappearance of goethite peaks and the increase in the amount of hematite f e 2 o 3 in calcined bauxite eq 16 similar results were observed in the study by das et al 2005 14 a l 2 o 3 3 h 2 o a l 2 o 3 3 h 2 o 15 a l 2 o 3 h 2 o a l 2 o 3 h 2 o 16 2 f e o o h f e 2 o 3 h 2 o 3 2 raw water composition the ph and ionic status of the water are shown in supplementary table st3 the concentrations of f and ca2 as well as ph were observed above the who limit who 2011 and tbs standards tbs 2009 while that of cl no3 and so4 2 were below the standards 3 3 fluoride removal experiments 3 3 1 impact of calcination temperature the calcined bauxite showed different adsorption loading at different temperatures initially the adsorption loading increased with the increase in calcination temperature from 200 to 400 c fig 3 this occurred because gibbsite undergoes dehydroxylation processes to form boehmite 300 c followed by a l 2 o 3 above 300 c which increased the surface area of bauxite hence increase the uptake loading das et al 2005 after 400 c the adsorption loading started to decrease due to the sintering of materials and blockage of available pore space das et al 2005 reported a similar f adsorption trend the calcination temperature which gave the highest adsorption loading 400 c was fixed as the calcination temperature for the subsequent experiment 3 3 2 effect of contact time initially the adsorption loading increased with an increase in time fig 4 a the increase was caused by the fact that initially the large number of active sites were vacant and the solute concentration gradients were high which favored high mass transfer on the surface of the adsorbent singh et al 2018 after 8 min the f removal capacity remained constant that indicating the adsorption has attained the equilibrium therefore 8 min was fixed as the contact time for subsequent experiments this indicates the reaction between bauxite and f proceeds at high speed 3 3 3 effect of adsorbent dose initially the adsorption efficiency increased with an increase in adsorbent dose as shown in fig 4b this was caused by the increase in the number of active sites available for adsorption per unit weight of f treated singh et al 2018 after the dose of 40 g l there were no significant increases in the adsorption efficiency this is because of decrease in f to the available active sites ratio with an increase in the amount of the adsorbent fufa et al 2014 on the other hand the adsorption loading decreased with the increase in the adsorbent dose due to the overlapping of active sites as the amount of adsorbent increased per unit volume kumar et al 2007 rajkumar et al 2019 3 3 4 effect of particle size fig 4c shows the adsorption loading decreased with the increase in particle size a smaller particle size increases the f adsorption uptake by increasing the availability of reactive surface areas on the adsorbent surface these results are in accordance with thole et al 2012a and malakootian et al 2017 the 0 075 mm was fixed as the particle size for the subsequent experiment 3 3 5 temperature the adsorption was increased with the increase in temperature from 30 to 50 c fig 4d this can be caused by the decrease in thickness of the outer surface of the bauxite which increased the rate of diffusion of f across the internal pores and external boundary layer of the calcined bauxite suneetha et al 2014 also the kinetic energy of f increases due to the increase in temperature which can be the reason for the increase in f uptake kundu et al 2017 the increase of uptake with the increase in temperature indicated f adsorption on calcined bauxite is an endothermic reaction abe et al 2004 3 4 effect of adsorption on the quality of water the results from supplementary table st3 show the adsorption using calcined bauxite was able to lower the concentration of f and the ph of groundwater to the who and tbs standard levels after the adsorption the f concentration and the ph of water was lower from 8 27 to 1 02 mg l and 9 38 to 6 74 respectively bauxite was able to lower the ph of water because it contains a large amount of al2o3 which is an amphoteric character being amphoteric al2o3 has the ability to react as an acid in the basic water medium and lowers the ph by reducing the concentration of oh in water eq 17 17 a l 2 o 3 2 o h 3 h 2 o 2 a l o h 4 then following the adsorption process whereby protons are released to the surrounding medium hence decrease of water ph further eq 18 18 a l o h 4 f 2 h 2 o a l o h 2 f 3 h 3 o the presence of sulphite which is largely acidic can also cause decrease in ph during dissolution sulphite from bauxite bind water molecules and discharge protons to the surrounding medium which cause the ph of water to decrease thole et al 2013 eqs 19 and 20 19 s o 3 h 2 o o 2 s o h 2 20 o 2 s o h 2 h 2 o o 3 s o h h 3 o after treatment the concentration of some ions i e al3 and b3 increased in water however they were still within the allowed values the concentration of and cr3 and ca2 in water after treatment did not adhere to the upper who cr3 and ca2 limit 3 5 adsorption isotherms freundlich isotherm model was found to be the best fitting model for the adsorption of f on the adsorbent since it gives a straight line with the correlation coefficient close to unity fig 5 a and b this indicates multilayer adsorption on the heterogeneous surface the values 1 n and r l were found to be between 0 and 1 table 4 which shows that the adsorption process was favourable these results were in agreement with salifu et al 2016 atasoy et al 2013 and malakootian et al 2014 3 6 adsorption kinetics 3 6 1 reaction based models the correlation coefficient r in the pseudo second order model was higher than that of the pseudo first order model fig 6 a and b which indicates the applicability of the pseudo second order model viswanathan and meenakshi 2008a 2008b pseudo second order also has larger adsorption loading at equilibrium 0 180 mg g compared to the pseudo first order 0 008 mg g fluoride removal using calcined bauxite showed pseudo second order kinetic as best fitted than pseudo first order and diffusion models thus it can be stated that at room temperature fluoride bauxite interaction in an aqueous solution follows chemisorption the rate constants for pseudo first order and pseudo second order were observed to be 0 181 min 1 and 115 425 g mg min respectively these results agreed with the earlier studies by malakootian et al 2014 2015 2017 haddad et al 2019 and salifu et al 2016 3 6 2 diffusion based models the rate constants for particle and intra particle diffusion models were found to be 0 1813 min 1 and 0 0025 mg g min0 5 respectively fig 6c and d the higher correlation coefficient r values for intra particle diffusion models which indicate that the f diffusion on adsorbent follows intra particle diffusion models this observation for f adsorption is consistent with the findings by sujana and anand 2011 3 7 thermodynamic parameters the negative values of Œ¥ g table 5 obtained from fig 7 confirm the spontaneous nature of the adsorption process at all temperatures studied the value of Œ¥ g became more negative with the increase in temperature that indicates the f removal process is favored by the increase in temperature mourabet et al 2011 the results obtained from this study concur with those reported in earlier studies sujana and anand 2011 salifu et al 2016 where the spontaneous nature of f adsorption occurred on bauxite surface the value of Œ¥ g being between 0 and 20 kj mol indicates the physisorption on the bauxite surface salifu et al 2016 the Œ¥ g value of 5 44 kj mol was reported by sujana and anand 2011 the endothermic nature of f adsorption on calcined bauxite is indicated by the value of Œ¥ h 0 the positive value of Œ¥ s indicates good affinity of f towards bauxite and the randomness at the solid solution interface increased during the adsorption process maity et al 2018 mourabet et al 2011 3 8 speciation of inorganic ions and complexes in water sample the comparison between the concentration of species present in water before and after defluoridation is shown in supplementary table st4 the total concentrations of aluminofluoride alfx complexes in treated water are very low 5 18e 07 mg l means that its consumption cannot lead to chronic kidney disease ckd wasana et al 2015 3 9 regeneration of bauxite after the regeneration the f adsorption efficiency of calcined bauxite decreased from 87 67 to 78 23 the amount of f remained in water when bauxite was regenerated was 1 8 mg l which is slightly above the who standard 1 5 mg l the effectiveness f removal ability decreased after regeneration due to the fact that several chemical reactions take place on the bauxite surface during adsorption which caused some pores to collapse li et al 2020 4 cost analysis the cost of adsorbent preparation is very important in order to determine the overall cost for large scale applicability and economic feasibility of the process it is very difficult to select the adsorbent without cost estimation tirkey et al 2018 in this study low cost bauxite was proposed as the adsorbent for fluoride removal from water bauxite is locally available in several regions of tanzania and around the world the production cost of a unit of calcined bauxite depends on the collection and process cost which includes electricity consumption in the oven crusher sieve and muffle furnace which was found to be 8334 58 tsh 3 55 us kg 1 as on june 30 2022 at laboratory scale table 6 the cost of electricity consumption can be reduced 1 08 us kg 1 by drying the bauxite in sunlight but it will take more time to dry this cost is low as compared to technologies using other adsorbents available in the market e g the production of activation carbon is 8 40 us kg 1 sharma et al 2021 5 conclusion calcined bauxite offers a higher f removal efficiency than the raw bauxite due to phase changes that occurred during calcination which also increased the surface area of the bauxite the data from adsorption experiments fit well with the freundlich isotherm which indicates multilayer adsorption the adsorption kinetics model indicates f adsorption on bauxite surface follows intra particle diffusion and pseudo second order models the negative Œ¥ g positive Œ¥ h and positive Œ¥ s indicate the f adsorption on the bauxite surface was spontaneous endothermic and structural changes which occurred during the adsorption process the f adsorption capacity was lower than that reported in other literature this may be due to the higher ph which caused f to compete with oh for the sorption site on the bauxite surface the effectiveness of adsorbent for f removal is reduced after each regeneration the concentrations of inorganic ions and complexes present in treated water indicate that it complies with the drinking water standard the results obtained from this study revealed the potential usefulness of calcined bauxite for f removal from water however the disposal the f loaded calcined bauxite is still a problem the overall cost benefit analysis reveals that the cost of calcined bauxite for safe water production is low as compared to other available adsorbents declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing

5 mg l can cause skeletal and dental fluorosis zhao et al 2015 surface water in several parts of the world does not meet the quality requirements of different sectors such as domestic agricultural and industrial sectors ahmad and bhattacharya 2021 bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 therefore groundwater serves as the major source of global freshwater bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 coomar and mukherjee 2021 mukherjee et al 2021 high concentrations of f have been reported in more than 35 countries of the world exposing approximately 200 million people at the risk of fluorosis ayoob et al 2008 ijumulana et al 2021 2022 in northern parts of tanzania the f concentrations in groundwater have been observed above 10 mg l including tanga arusha manyara and kilimanjaro regions these regions lack alternative sources of drinking water ijumulana et al 2021 ligate et al 2021 this situation calls for attention to mitigate the problem by lowering f concentration below the maximum allowable concentration nd√© tchoup√© et al 2015 several defluoridation techniques have been discussed in the literature e g nano filtration adsorption ion exchange coagulation reverse osmosis and electrochemical method maity et al 2018 each of these techniques has its strength and limitations for example ion exchange coagulation and electrochemical membrane methods require high installation and maintenance costs habuda staniƒá et al 2014 sivarajasekar et al 2017 on the other hand adsorption techniques require relatively modest investment and maintenance due to their simple design and availability of a wide range of materials that can be used as adsorbents bhatnagar et al 2011 however the applicability of some adsorbents is limited due to their low f removal capacity typically the selection of adsorbent materials depends on the removal capacity capital investment and running cost local availability of materials user preference and acceptance by the community kimambo et al 2019 bauxite is a naturally abundant mineral the current estimation of global bauxite resources range between 55 and 75 billion tons usgs 2021 bauxites are divided into two main categorizes which are lateritic and karst bauxites the main producers of lateritic bauxite are countries such as guinea india australia north and south america while most of karst bauxite is produced by countries such as jamaica greece france china russia and kazakhstan hache et al 2021 the countries with largest bauxite reserves are shown in table 1 bauxite contains aluminium oxide iron oxide silica and titanium oxides in variable amounts the composition of different bauxites differs as a result of differences in the production and formation process alhassan et al 2020 although raw bauxite can be used as an adsorbent for f removal from water it contains impurities that can interfere with the adsorption and may leach unwanted ions into the treated water alhassan et al 2020 sajidu et al 2012 the bauxite can be modified in order to improve its adsorption efficiency ability to regenerate adsorbent and the ph range in which it can adsorb f ions the modification of adsorbent can change its surface chemistry and or functional properties furthermore the bauxite can be modified by metal impregnation heating acidifying and crushing alhassan et al 2020 the impregnation using metals e g al3 increases the content of the gibbsite compared to hematite which increases f removal efficiency gibbsite being an aluminum based oxide that possesses higher defluoridation capabilities than hematite which is an iron based oxide salifu et al 2016 heating causes dehydroxylation which increases the surface area for binding nd√© tchoup√© et al 2015 and lowers the time to reach equilibrium alhassan et al 2020 crushing increases the f removal capacity by increasing the surface area for binding alhassan et al 2020 the f adsorption capacity of any adsorbent can be affected by several factors kimambo et al 2019 the adsorption capacity for f removal using bauxite at different experimental conditions is given in table 2 in tanzania large bauxite deposits are observed in mbeya and tanga regions the total estimate of bauxite reserves in kidundai magamba and mabughai mlomboza bauxite deposits in the tanga region is about 37 million tons mutakyahwa et al 2003 few studies on the application of bauxite from tanzania for the defluoridation of water have been carried out thole et al 2012a 2012b 2013 however only few parameters which affect the f removal from water were tested the current study aims to investigate the usability of bauxite from tanzania and the factors which can affect its f removal capacity the systematic batch experiment was performed and compared with modeling to better understand the removal of f by tanzanian bauxite the outcome this investigation intends to provide an effective and low cost method for f removal from water 2 materials and methods 2 1 geographical origins of the adsorbent and water samples the bauxite used in this study was obtained from bauxite mine located in lushoto district in tanga region northeastern tanzania fig 1 shows the sampling location for the studied bauxite and other districts with bauxite mines in tanzania the water sample used in this study was obtained from a natural spring supplementary figure sf1 in the arusha region which is one of the largest regional f hotspots in northern tanzania ijumulana et al 2020 water from this spring is used by the community as a drinking water source according to the national population census of 2012 approximately 25 of the northern development zone ndz population lives in the arusha region where only 30 of the groundwater sources are safe in terms of f levels for drinking purposes this percentage is not adequate to accommodate the large population forcing most of the communities to depend on f contaminated water as a consequence the majority of community members in this region are prone to dental skeletal and crippling fluorosis ijumulana et al 2021 2 2 preparations and characterization of adsorbent material the bauxite sample was ground and sieved until all the particles had a diameter of 0 075 mm the mineral phase composition was determined by btx ii x ray diffraction analyzer inxitu inc united states the measurement was done using co kŒ±1 over a range of 5 55 radiation at a wavelength of 1 78897 √• the chemical composition of bauxite material was determined by using an arl optim x xrf spectrometer thermo fisher scientific inc sweden 2 3 water sampling and analysis a total of 60 l of water sample was collected from the spring and packed in three 20 l polyethylene cans the gps receiver mobile mapper 20 was used to record the location of the sampling site the sampling procedures were followed during water sampling epa 2017 the samples were then transported to the water quality laboratory of the university and dar es salaam and stored at 14 c before the solution was mixed with the adsorbent the ph and f concentrations were measured by using hach potable water quality multimeter hq40d the ph calibration standards 4 7 and 10 and ion concentration calibration standard solution of f 1 5 and 10 mg l were usually applied accuracy 0 5 the concentration of anions cl no3 so4 2 hco3 were determined by using dionex dx 120 ion chromatography ic the concentration of cations al3 as3 ba2 ca2 cd2 cr3 cu2 fe2 na ni2 pb2 se2 v5 zn2 b3 were analyzed by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes the speciation of inorganic ions and complexes in water samples before and after defluoridation were done by using visual minteq 3 1 2 4 batch experiments bauxite with 0 075 mm diameter was calcined in a muffle furnace le 1 11 nabertherm germany at temperatures between 300 and 600 c for 2 h the batch experiments were designed to examine the effect of calcination temperature using 50 ml of 8 27 mg l 1 f raw water in conical flask mixed with 2 g of bauxite with a shaker speed of 200 rpm for 4 min at 30 c after 4 min the ph and f concentration in remaining solution was measured the calcination temperature which gave the highest adsorption capacity was used in subsequent experiments performed at different conditions i e contact time 1 10 min adsorbent dose 20 140 g l particle size 0 075 1 0 mm and temperature 30 50 c in order to determine the optimum conditions for the adsorption the anions and cations in the water sample treated at optimum condition and were analyzed by using dionex dx 120 ion chromatography ic and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes respectively the percent f removal from aqueous media was calculated using eq 1 izuagie et al 2015 1 f r e m o v a l c o c e c o 100 the amount of f adsorbed by 1 g of the adsorbent at equilibrium mg g was calculated using eq 2 maiti et al 2011 2 q e c o c e m v the amount of adsorption at time t q t mg g was calculated by eq 3 zhao et al 2015 3 q t c o c t m v 2 5 adsorption isotherms the two major adsorption models i e freundlich and langmuir adsorption isotherms were used to determine the mechanism and maximum adsorption capacity for f adsorption on bauxite surface 2 5 1 freundlich isotherm freundlich isotherm model uses to describe the behaviour between adsorbate and adsorbent maity et al 2018 freundlich adsorption isotherm assumes multilayer adsorption on the heterogeneous surface sujana and anand 2011 and the maximum adsorption occurs when the adsorbent surface is covered by adsorbate is given by eq 4 4 log q e log k f 1 n log c e the values of k f and 1 n are calculated from the intercept and slope of the plot of log q e against log c e chen et al 2010 the value of 1 n between 0 and 1 indicates the adsorption process was favourable gogoi and dutta 2015 2 5 2 langmuir isotherm langmuir isotherm model assumes monolayer adsorption on a homogeneous surface and there is no interaction between adsorbate molecules on adjacent sites this means the adsorption capacity is the maximum maity et al 2018 langmuir equation which is purely empirical is given by eq 5 5 c e q e 1 q o b c e q o the slope and intercept of the graph of c e q e against c e give the value of q o and b meenakshi and viswanathan 2007 in order to find the practicability of the isotherm the langmuir isotherm was expressed in terms of the equilibrium factor r l by using eq 6 6 r l 1 1 b c o the r l value between 0 and 1 indicates the adsorption is favourable masindi et al 2015 2 6 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics is one of the significant features of adsorbents which gives the awareness on the type and rate of adsorption haddad et al 2019 the two major types of kinetics models which are the reaction and diffusion based models were employed to study the kinetics of the adsorption process viswanathan et al 2009 2010 2 6 1 reaction based models the reaction based model is used to determine the rate of reaction kinetic adsorption constant for f adsorption on calcined bauxite surface which is important in drawing valid conclusions and performing accurate modeling hosseini bandegharaei and chao 2017 the reaction based models were used to study the adsorption of solutes from a liquid solution the pseudo first order means the rate of reaction is proportional to the concentration of only one reactant maity et al 2018 the pseudo first order kinetic model is given by eq 7 7 log q e q t log q e k a d 2 303 t the value of k a d was obtained from the slope of the graph of log q e q t against t viswanathan and meenakshi 2008a 2009 the pseudo second order means the rate of reaction is proportional to the square of reactant concentrations maity et al 2018 the linear pseudo second order is given by eq 8 8 t q t 1 h t q e the values of q e and h are obtained from the slope and intercept of the plot t q t against t the pseudo second order rate constant k g mg min is given by k s l o p e 2 i n t e r c e p t suneetha et al 2014 viswanathan et al 2010 2 6 2 diffusion based models in a solid liquid adsorption process the solute transfer is usually controlled by either particle or intra particle diffusion the contribution of diffusion on the rate of f adsorption on calcined bauxite surface was studied by using particle and intra particle diffusion models hosseini bandegharaei and chao 2017 the likelihood of the particle diffusion resistance affecting the adsorption behaviour was investigated using the particle diffusion kinetic model given by eq 9 9 ln 1 c t c e k p t the graph of ln 1 c t c e against t gives the straight line with the value of k p as the slope sundaram et al 2008 viswanathan and meenakshi 2008b the intra particle diffusion kinetic model was employed to study the contribution of intra particle diffusion on the adsorption behaviour using eq 10 10 q t k int t 1 2 c the plot of q t against t 1 2 gives the value of k int as a slope haddad et al 2019 2 7 thermodynamic parameters of adsorption the thermodynamic properties were studied by changing the temperature in the thermostat controlled shaker from 30 to 50 c 303 323 k the thermodynamic parameters Œ¥ g Œ¥ s and Œ¥ h associated with the adsorption were calculated in order to determine the nature of f adsorption process the Œ¥ g of the adsorption process is calculated from eq 11 sujana and anand 2011 11 Œ¥ g r t l n k c the Œ¥ g was also expressed in terms of Œ¥ h and Œ¥ s by using eq 12 12 Œ¥ g Œ¥ h t Œ¥ s the value of Œ¥ g for the reaction is used to predict whether the reaction can take place spontaneously Œ¥ g 0 or the application the energy is required in order to promote the reaction Œ¥ g 0 the adsorption distribution constant was expressed in terms of Œ¥ h and Œ¥ s as a function of temperature t using eq 13 13 ln k c Œ¥ h r t Œ¥ s r the values of Œ¥ h and Œ¥ s were calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot of ln k c against 1 t the negative and positive Œ¥ h indicates exothermic and endothermic reaction respectively the value of Œ¥ s 0 means the reaction irreversible and stable viswanathan and meenakshi 2008a 2 8 regeneration of bauxite the used bauxite was regenerated by shaking them in 0 015 mol l naoh solution for 2 h and filtered das et al 2005 the filtrate was then washed using distilled water in order to remove excessive naoh from the adsorbent the material was dried for 24 h at room temperature before oven dried at 105 c for 3 h the regenerated bauxite was used for f removal under optimum conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbent materials 3 1 1 chemical composition the data shows that the a l 2 o 3 f e 2 o 3 and s i o 2 were the major oxides in untreated and calcined bauxite table 3 however the percentages of the major oxides differ from that reported in another study a study by thole et al 2013 reported 30 33 a l 2 o 3 14 3 f e 2 o 3 and 15 0 s i o 2 3 1 2 mineralogical composition the xrd data indicate the gibbsite a l 2 o 3 3 h 2 o is the major constituent of raw bauxite fig 2 a the presence of the gibbsite is indicated by characteristic peaks at d values of 4 81 2 45 and 1 99 etc the other minerals which are present in raw bauxite are presented in supplementary table st1 the results were in positive agreement with those reported by mutakyahwa et al 2003 on calcination at 400 c gibbsite peaks disappeared fig 2b because of the loss of water molecules to form boehmite a l 2 o 3 h 2 o eq 14 and corundum a l 2 o 3 eq 15 supplementary table st2 loss of water can also be the reason for the disappearance of goethite peaks and the increase in the amount of hematite f e 2 o 3 in calcined bauxite eq 16 similar results were observed in the study by das et al 2005 14 a l 2 o 3 3 h 2 o a l 2 o 3 3 h 2 o 15 a l 2 o 3 h 2 o a l 2 o 3 h 2 o 16 2 f e o o h f e 2 o 3 h 2 o 3 2 raw water composition the ph and ionic status of the water are shown in supplementary table st3 the concentrations of f and ca2 as well as ph were observed above the who limit who 2011 and tbs standards tbs 2009 while that of cl no3 and so4 2 were below the standards 3 3 fluoride removal experiments 3 3 1 impact of calcination temperature the calcined bauxite showed different adsorption loading at different temperatures initially the adsorption loading increased with the increase in calcination temperature from 200 to 400 c fig 3 this occurred because gibbsite undergoes dehydroxylation processes to form boehmite 300 c followed by a l 2 o 3 above 300 c which increased the surface area of bauxite hence increase the uptake loading das et al 2005 after 400 c the adsorption loading started to decrease due to the sintering of materials and blockage of available pore space das et al 2005 reported a similar f adsorption trend the calcination temperature which gave the highest adsorption loading 400 c was fixed as the calcination temperature for the subsequent experiment 3 3 2 effect of contact time initially the adsorption loading increased with an increase in time fig 4 a the increase was caused by the fact that initially the large number of active sites were vacant and the solute concentration gradients were high which favored high mass transfer on the surface of the adsorbent singh et al 2018 after 8 min the f removal capacity remained constant that indicating the adsorption has attained the equilibrium therefore 8 min was fixed as the contact time for subsequent experiments this indicates the reaction between bauxite and f proceeds at high speed 3 3 3 effect of adsorbent dose initially the adsorption efficiency increased with an increase in adsorbent dose as shown in fig 4b this was caused by the increase in the number of active sites available for adsorption per unit weight of f treated singh et al 2018 after the dose of 40 g l there were no significant increases in the adsorption efficiency this is because of decrease in f to the available active sites ratio with an increase in the amount of the adsorbent fufa et al 2014 on the other hand the adsorption loading decreased with the increase in the adsorbent dose due to the overlapping of active sites as the amount of adsorbent increased per unit volume kumar et al 2007 rajkumar et al 2019 3 3 4 effect of particle size fig 4c shows the adsorption loading decreased with the increase in particle size a smaller particle size increases the f adsorption uptake by increasing the availability of reactive surface areas on the adsorbent surface these results are in accordance with thole et al 2012a and malakootian et al 2017 the 0 075 mm was fixed as the particle size for the subsequent experiment 3 3 5 temperature the adsorption was increased with the increase in temperature from 30 to 50 c fig 4d this can be caused by the decrease in thickness of the outer surface of the bauxite which increased the rate of diffusion of f across the internal pores and external boundary layer of the calcined bauxite suneetha et al 2014 also the kinetic energy of f increases due to the increase in temperature which can be the reason for the increase in f uptake kundu et al 2017 the increase of uptake with the increase in temperature indicated f adsorption on calcined bauxite is an endothermic reaction abe et al 2004 3 4 effect of adsorption on the quality of water the results from supplementary table st3 show the adsorption using calcined bauxite was able to lower the concentration of f and the ph of groundwater to the who and tbs standard levels after the adsorption the f concentration and the ph of water was lower from 8 27 to 1 02 mg l and 9 38 to 6 74 respectively bauxite was able to lower the ph of water because it contains a large amount of al2o3 which is an amphoteric character being amphoteric al2o3 has the ability to react as an acid in the basic water medium and lowers the ph by reducing the concentration of oh in water eq 17 17 a l 2 o 3 2 o h 3 h 2 o 2 a l o h 4 then following the adsorption process whereby protons are released to the surrounding medium hence decrease of water ph further eq 18 18 a l o h 4 f 2 h 2 o a l o h 2 f 3 h 3 o the presence of sulphite which is largely acidic can also cause decrease in ph during dissolution sulphite from bauxite bind water molecules and discharge protons to the surrounding medium which cause the ph of water to decrease thole et al 2013 eqs 19 and 20 19 s o 3 h 2 o o 2 s o h 2 20 o 2 s o h 2 h 2 o o 3 s o h h 3 o after treatment the concentration of some ions i e al3 and b3 increased in water however they were still within the allowed values the concentration of and cr3 and ca2 in water after treatment did not adhere to the upper who cr3 and ca2 limit 3 5 adsorption isotherms freundlich isotherm model was found to be the best fitting model for the adsorption of f on the adsorbent since it gives a straight line with the correlation coefficient close to unity fig 5 a and b this indicates multilayer adsorption on the heterogeneous surface the values 1 n and r l were found to be between 0 and 1 table 4 which shows that the adsorption process was favourable these results were in agreement with salifu et al 2016 atasoy et al 2013 and malakootian et al 2014 3 6 adsorption kinetics 3 6 1 reaction based models the correlation coefficient r in the pseudo second order model was higher than that of the pseudo first order model fig 6 a and b which indicates the applicability of the pseudo second order model viswanathan and meenakshi 2008a 2008b pseudo second order also has larger adsorption loading at equilibrium 0 180 mg g compared to the pseudo first order 0 008 mg g fluoride removal using calcined bauxite showed pseudo second order kinetic as best fitted than pseudo first order and diffusion models thus it can be stated that at room temperature fluoride bauxite interaction in an aqueous solution follows chemisorption the rate constants for pseudo first order and pseudo second order were observed to be 0 181 min 1 and 115 425 g mg min respectively these results agreed with the earlier studies by malakootian et al 2014 2015 2017 haddad et al 2019 and salifu et al 2016 3 6 2 diffusion based models the rate constants for particle and intra particle diffusion models were found to be 0 1813 min 1 and 0 0025 mg g min0 5 respectively fig 6c and d the higher correlation coefficient r values for intra particle diffusion models which indicate that the f diffusion on adsorbent follows intra particle diffusion models this observation for f adsorption is consistent with the findings by sujana and anand 2011 3 7 thermodynamic parameters the negative values of Œ¥ g table 5 obtained from fig 7 confirm the spontaneous nature of the adsorption process at all temperatures studied the value of Œ¥ g became more negative with the increase in temperature that indicates the f removal process is favored by the increase in temperature mourabet et al 2011 the results obtained from this study concur with those reported in earlier studies sujana and anand 2011 salifu et al 2016 where the spontaneous nature of f adsorption occurred on bauxite surface the value of Œ¥ g being between 0 and 20 kj mol indicates the physisorption on the bauxite surface salifu et al 2016 the Œ¥ g value of 5 44 kj mol was reported by sujana and anand 2011 the endothermic nature of f adsorption on calcined bauxite is indicated by the value of Œ¥ h 0 the positive value of Œ¥ s indicates good affinity of f towards bauxite and the randomness at the solid solution interface increased during the adsorption process maity et al 2018 mourabet et al 2011 3 8 speciation of inorganic ions and complexes in water sample the comparison between the concentration of species present in water before and after defluoridation is shown in supplementary table st4 the total concentrations of aluminofluoride alfx complexes in treated water are very low 5 18e 07 mg l means that its consumption cannot lead to chronic kidney disease ckd wasana et al 2015 3 9 regeneration of bauxite after the regeneration the f adsorption efficiency of calcined bauxite decreased from 87 67 to 78 23 the amount of f remained in water when bauxite was regenerated was 1 8 mg l which is slightly above the who standard 1 5 mg l the effectiveness f removal ability decreased after regeneration due to the fact that several chemical reactions take place on the bauxite surface during adsorption which caused some pores to collapse li et al 2020 4 cost analysis the cost of adsorbent preparation is very important in order to determine the overall cost for large scale applicability and economic feasibility of the process it is very difficult to select the adsorbent without cost estimation tirkey et al 2018 in this study low cost bauxite was proposed as the adsorbent for fluoride removal from water bauxite is locally available in several regions of tanzania and around the world the production cost of a unit of calcined bauxite depends on the collection and process cost which includes electricity consumption in the oven crusher sieve and muffle furnace which was found to be 8334 58 tsh 3 55 us kg 1 as on june 30 2022 at laboratory scale table 6 the cost of electricity consumption can be reduced 1 08 us kg 1 by drying the bauxite in sunlight but it will take more time to dry this cost is low as compared to technologies using other adsorbents available in the market e g the production of activation carbon is 8 40 us kg 1 sharma et al 2021 5 conclusion calcined bauxite offers a higher f removal efficiency than the raw bauxite due to phase changes that occurred during calcination which also increased the surface area of the bauxite the data from adsorption experiments fit well with the freundlich isotherm which indicates multilayer adsorption the adsorption kinetics model indicates f adsorption on bauxite surface follows intra particle diffusion and pseudo second order models the negative Œ¥ g positive Œ¥ h and positive Œ¥ s indicate the f adsorption on the bauxite surface was spontaneous endothermic and structural changes which occurred during the adsorption process the f adsorption capacity was lower than that reported in other literature this may be due to the higher ph which caused f to compete with oh for the sorption site on the bauxite surface the effectiveness of adsorbent for f removal is reduced after each regeneration the concentrations of inorganic ions and complexes present in treated water indicate that it complies with the drinking water standard the results obtained from this study revealed the potential usefulness of calcined bauxite for f removal from water however the disposal the f loaded calcined bauxite is still a problem the overall cost benefit analysis reveals that the cost of calcined bauxite for safe water production is low as compared to other available adsorbents declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing
