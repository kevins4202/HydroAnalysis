15940,the climate emergency and population growth threaten urban water security in cities worldwide growth urbanisation and changes to way of life have increased housing demand requiring cities such as london to increase their housing stock by more than 15 over the next 10 years these new urban developments will increase water demand urban flood risk and river water pollution levels therefore an integrated systems based approach to development and water management is needed water neutrality wn has emerged as a concept to frame the concerns about escalating water stresses in cities we frame wn as a planning process for new urban developments that aims to minimise impacts on urban water security and offset any remaining stresses by retrofitting existing housing stock in this work we present a novel systemic design framework for future urban planning called cityplan water which guides how wn might be achieved to tackle current and future water pressures at a city scale cityplan water integrates spatial data with an integrated urban water management model enabling urban design at a systems level and systematic assessment of future scenarios we define a water neutrality index that captures how successful a given urban planning scenario is in achieving wn and how multiple interventions could be combined at a city scale to improve wn results from cityplan water suggest that it will be necessary to retrofit almost the same number of existing homes with wn design options to completely offset the impact imposed by proposed new developments combining options such as water efficient appliances water reuse systems and social awareness campaigns can offset the impact of new development on water demand by 70 while to neutralise potential flood risk and water pollution at a city scale interventions such as rainwater harvesting and blue green infrastructure need to be added both in new urban developments and 432 000 existing london households we see cityplan water as a tool that can support the transition of urban planning towards using data driven analysis to effectively design water neutral housing and drive sustainable development graphical abstract image

increasing pressures on housing in cities worldwide united nations 2014 colenbrander et al 2019 committee on climate change 2019 cohen 2020 taylor o brien and o keefe 2020 and causing adverse effects on the urban water cycle rauch et al 2017 water uk 2019 zubaidi et al 2020 one of the biggest challenges for future planning will be managing the impact of new housing developments on water sustainability brown et al 2009 jones 2014a hurlimann and wilson 2018 understanding the interactions between land use processes water infrastructure and water quality will require integrated urban planning and will be essential to manage the impact of housing growth on the urban water cycle carmona et al 2010 ford et al 2019 medeiros and van der zwet 2020 to address the complexity of the built natural environment interdependences a systems approach has been proposed which integrates design and evaluation with criteria that are used to inform the level of sustainability of an urban development puchol salort et al 2021 in the literature there are several approaches to integrate urban planning with water management which can address some of the aspects of the systems approach for instance yang et al 2016 present a conceptual framework for urban water sustainability that evaluate socioeconomic and environmental interactions furlong et al 2017 study the benefits and opportunities of integrated urban water management plans ford et al 2019 develop an urban integrated assessment framework that provides a multi scale analysis of climate change impacts on cities and medeiros and van der zwet 2020 integrate strategies for sustainable urban development and evaluate them qualitatively in two european cities however there is still a need to integrate the entire planning process with design solutions and quantitative evaluation which we address in this paper by adapting the urban planning sustainability framework upsuf puchol salort et al 2021 to water land system analysis in upsuf systems thinking is defined as an engineering approach that integrates blue green urban design modelling and analysis of land and building planning options to enable stakeholders coordination and a holistic vision of the urban system systemic design is an emerging approach that has evolved in recent decades it combines traditional design and systems thinking taking a holistic and complete account of the urban form elements that constitute a complex system jones and kijima 2018 battistoni et al 2019 bijl brouwer and malcolm 2020 following systemic design principles all physical elements in a given space e g an urban development borough city etc define a series of layers that together constitute the entire urban system jones 2014b ryan 2014 de la rosa and hovanesian 2019 therefore systemic design sees the planning process as a whole and considers urban water infrastructure as one of the layers in the design of cities shin et al 2018 moravej et al 2021 in this study we are introducing the systemic design approach to urban planning and water management guided by upsuf an emerging concept in urban water management is water neutrality wn kemlo and lawson 2009 nel et al 2009 hoekstra 2018 traditionally wn was defined as an approach to offset a predicted increase in water demand produced by a new urban development by reducing the existing demand somewhere inside the region environment agency 2009 the concept was then extended to include demand offsetting by increasing water efficiency and reducing water consumption hoekstra 2008 hoekstra et al 2011 makin et al 2021 however wn should not solely imply the need to have net zero water consumption but also to prioritise minimising the impacts of new development and offsetting the remaining environmental and social impacts wu et al 2020 makin et al 2021 these impacts could be evaluated through the concept of urban water security uws which integrates water demand with flood risk and water quality assessments hoekstra et al 2018 nazemi and madani 2018 van ginkel et al 2018 aboelnga et al 2019 su et al 2020 in this study we consider that achieving wn will require not only to maintain the same post development water demand but also to maintain existing flood risk and water quality uws indicators we also allow for the wn target to be set by the decision makers with net zero water target 100 water neutral developments as a default recommendation finally to maintain existing uws indicators and efficiently implement wn at the planning phase of a new urban development a range of wn design options will be needed either inside or outside the development area these design options include for example blue green infrastructure bgi efficient appliances rainwater harvesting water reuse systems and demand management social campaigns dieu hang et al 2017 sheth 2017 ferrans et al 2018 lu 2019 amongst others we argue that applying upsuf to wn will support the integration of sustainable design solutions and simulation models to achieve implementation of systemic design for urban systems planning although there are some valuable examples of water management evaluation models combined with spatial representation such as the dance4water model from rauch et al 2017 or the suwmba method from morajev et al 2021 there is no clear evidence of the wn concept being applied in urban systems and there is still a lack of an integrated method that accurately measures wn indicators combined with spatial configurations for urban planning in this paper we present the novel concept of cityplan conceived as an operational version of upsuf we envisage that the cityplan can be applied to different areas of urban sustainability i e water air biodiversity urban microclimate etc here we develop a proof of concept focused on wn evaluation cityplan water hereafter there are three key contributions in this work first we develop the wn concept for future urban planning from a systemic design perspective second we present the novel cityplan water framework where wn assessment is provided by the integrated urban water management model citywat dobson and mijic 2020 which we combine with a spatial analysis of key urban form parameters with the focus on london uk cityplan water could be applied at different urban scales which is defined by the spatial extent and the resolution of the simulation model used in this study the wn evaluation for london is performed at a city lumped scale cityplan water provides a quantitative assessment for a series of wn design options through the novel water neutrality index wni third we demonstrate opportunities to achieve wn at a city scale depending on different scenarios and levels of offsetting the impacts of new urban development inside versus outside the development area finally implications of the work potential future scope and overall conclusions are discussed 2 cityplan water case study the city of london unavoidable pressures on water systems such as fluvial flooding pluvial flooding droughts or river water quality degradation are projected to become more frequent in the uk due to climate change and increased urbanisation garner hannah watts 2017 miller and hutchins 2017 these pressures are very significant in london environment agency 2009 clark et al 2018 the city s population is projected to increase by 70 000 people per year reaching 10 8 million citizens by 2041 committee on climate change 2019 gla 2021 this will require an average increase of 66 000 new homes per year for at least twenty years and around 50 of these homes being affordable if londoners needs are to be met gla 2021 london is divided into 32 boroughs which are sub divided for statistical purposes into smaller zones called lower layer super output areas lsoas london s urban pattern depicts a distorted grid radiating from the city centre to the city boundaries changing in scale and density central areas follow traditional georgian planning and are generally more compact with concentrated and large green spaces while suburbs present a more sprawl distribution surrounded by metropolitan open land and a green belt gla 2021 based on the new london plan gla 2021 the 10 year predicted target for net housing completion in the city will be 522 870 new homes by 2030 currently the city presents a strong potential for urban regeneration as large areas are reliant on ageing infrastructure and will benefit from redevelopment and investment opportunities the greater london authority gla has already identified several opportunity areas oas in each borough which present an effective development capacity to accommodate new housing commercial activities and public infrastructure and are linked to existing or potential improvements in public transport connectivity gla 2021 3 methodology evaluating water neutrality at different scales influencing planning decisions and guiding stakeholders towards water neutral developments is the key purpose of cityplan water its functionality is based on upsuf and integrates three key components fig 1 which includes representation of the cityplan water process and operation blue cluster in fig 1 the systemic design solutions green cluster and the urban water security uws evaluation toolkit overview purple cluster in this work upsuf is refined to support water neutrality evaluation for new urban developments developing the proof of concept for cityplan water 3 1 water neutrality systemic design concept the methodology of cityplan water follows an iterative process that uses a defined target for water neutrality as a measure of the urban water security through a spatial representation in gis the results from cityplan water will determine if a new urban development with proposed wn design options can be considered water neutral under a specific target and spatial assessment scale as with upsuf this iterative process provides a defined set of steps that takes the user from an initial baseline to new water neutral development scenarios including the requirements of environment and regulatory bodies new developments increase the existing urban water impacts in cities and decrease uws levels mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 jensen and wu 2018 to define a new interpretation of the wn concept from a systemic design approach it is necessary to evaluate this increase under different urban design scenarios fig 2 in our work the development impact di from new urban developments is calculated as an addition to the existing pre development impacts i e baseline thereafter to provide a comprehensive assessment of the wn concept we consider two types of urban design scenarios business as usual bau scenario left column in fig 2 and wn scenarios right column in fig 2 3 1 1 water neutrality index the bau scenario represents the project that is developed and built with traditional construction and design primarily including hard and impervious surfaces and artificial materials puchol salort et al 2021 under the bau option no wn design options are implemented and the di is at its maximum level to offset the impacts wn scenarios are developed as design options that reduce the urban water impacts these scenarios provide different levels of impact reduction depending on the scale and size of the intervention the wn options can be applied inside the development area new buildings and land or outside existing infrastructure retrofit we define the remaining impact of new developments on the urban water system of the city once wn options are implemented as a water neutrality development impact wndi hence if wndi is zero the proposed wn options fully offset the impacts of the new development and wn will be fully achieved threshold marked by the blue line in fig 2 it is useful to introduce a water neutrality index wni which measures the relative difference between development impact di in the bau scenario and the water neutrality development impact wndi in the wn scenarios 1 wni di wndi di 100 the wni needs to be 100 to achieve full wn and to maintain uws at the pre development levels in case the wni is higher than 100 the existing uws levels will be improved creating an environment positive urban development 3 2 spatial data to understand water neutrality urban form analysis of london s urban form properties is needed to understand the existing urban water system i e pre development baseline we have selected a series of urban form properties based on their direct relationship with the uws indicators and the wn concept table 1 roof area blue and green area and total pervious impervious area are obtained from a proprietary 2m land cover raster dataset provided by the british geological survey bgs while population and size of housing are obtained from the uk census 2011 in this work we study london s urban form properties and its spatial attributes following lsoa boundaries because they are publicly available from the uk census api and feature consistently sized statistical units at the highest resolution the bgs landcover raster data is not publicly available but a similar analysis could be performed with open source datasets such as the ordnance survey os open data uk 2019 or the london openstreetmap among others we use the urban form data in two ways firstly we introduce it in the citywat model to ensure the accuracy of the input data secondly we create a series of density maps defined via oke et al 2017 2 λ x a x a t where a x is the surface area of land cover type x in the lsoa see last column in table 2 and a t is the total surface area a summary of selected urban form properties their total area percentages and average area fraction indexes is in the table a1 in appendices 3 3 systemic design solutions one of the strengths of the systemic design approach is its flexibility to be implemented at different spatial scales jones 2020 an urban planner can implement systemic design solutions from an urban development to a whole city scale battistoni et al 2019 pereno and barbero 2020 in this work the citywat model assesses the urban water system of london as a whole in a lumped approach so we perform a scenario development exercise at a city scale the evaluation of the wn scenarios will measure the effectiveness of the wn design options listed in table 2 which can be implemented either inside or outside the new development area as retrofit solutions 3 3 1 urban water security indicators selected wn design options interact differently with uws indicators for instance bgi reduces flood risk and improves water quality but has no significant effect on consumer demand unless the water reuse functionality is introduced efficient appliances however have a positive impact on consumer demand and water quality but do not impact flood risk in addition to conceptually understanding the influence of each proposed intervention on uws indicators it is also important to highlight the different involvement from urban stakeholders in the wn design implementation table 2 for example efficient appliances and social campaigns both affect consumer demand and water quality but are responsibility of different stakeholders i e efficient appliances depend on developers and citizens while social campaigns rely on central and local government water companies and ultimately citizens to holistically assess the impacts on the urban water system for all relevant stakeholders puchol salort et al 2021 we select three key indicators for urban water security uws these uws indicators are a urban consumer demand measured by the average daily total water supplied to consumers across london in megalitres per day ml day b urban flood risk measured by the average of excess stormwater runoff in megalitres per day ml day and c river water quality measured by the average daily phosphorus content in the river thames in milligrams per litre mg l urban consumer demand is primarily relevant to water companies urban flood risk for local planning authorities and river water quality for the england s environment agency ea 3 4 water neutrality evaluation the impact of wn scenarios is evaluated in terms of uws indicators in the third step of the cityplan water process fig 1 cityplan water combines the citywat urban water management integrated model dobson and mijic 2020 with qgis quantum geographical information system 2019 both citywat see appendix a and qgis are open source which enables data to be transferable and shared with relevant stakeholders to accurately assess the uws indicators within a single evaluation framework we apply the integrated urban water management model citywat dobson and mijic 2020 citywat is lumped at a city level and coded in python citywat facilitates holistic modelling of the urban water cycle and simulates the flow and quality of water through mass balance equations it has been validated against historical data in london and so can provide reliable uws projections when applied at a city or wastewater zone semi distributed scale dobson and mijic 2020 dobson et al 2021 after introducing numerical parameters from the urban form properties into citywat such as the total number of households total population roof area percent impermeable total green area etc table a1 appendices the uws indicators of the existing impacts baseline are obtained via simulation next looking at the predicted housing growth at the city scale and its projected population in the next 10 years from public reports and city s planning documents different combinations of wn design options table 2 are implemented to obtain the wn scenarios fig 2 once we have created the wn design options to accommodate new developments we use citywat simulations to verify whether the retrofitting fully offsets the new impacts of urban consumer demand and flood risk in this simulation step design options are modelled as changes to the urban form parameters that are used in citywat new urban developments will influence the rainwater harvesting capacity increase the consumer demand based on the total projected population decrease the percent of impermeable area etc see section 4 2 in this work citywat is run at a daily timestep and uws indicators are reported as at average daily values finally uws values are processed to obtain the novel water neutrality index wni as explained in section 3 1 1 and obtain wni metrics in percentages ultimately if results from the wni indicate that the proposed development achieves a specific wn target this will be the final stage of the process but if metrics suggest that the new development is far from the target it will be necessary to either provide a series of planning recommendations or move back to the systemic design solutions stage and implement new wn options until water neutrality is achieved step five in fig 1 4 results systemic design for water neutrality is developed at a city scale and is based on the future predicted housing growth in london where 522 870 new households are aimed to be built during the next 10 years gla 2021 as the citywat model is lumped at a city scale we cannot specify spatially where these new households will be located however the results show the aggregated effect of the impact of new development and the scale of interventions needed for impact mitigation 4 1 analysis and visualisation of london s urban form properties the area fraction equation equation 2 oke et al 2017 is used in this work to visualise london s urban form properties objectively the density maps fig 3 inform about the heterogeneity of each urban form in london and will help decision makers to perceive which parts of the city are in more need of certain wn design options the plan area fraction indices in each lsoa unit vary considerably from one urban form property to other while roof area maximum value is 0 61 and minimum 0 01 with an average across london of 0 22 fig 3a the blue and green area ranges from 0 011 to 0 909 with an average across london of 0 45 fig 3b while the total impervious area percentage is around 37 of the city table a1 appendices the average plan area indexes of the pervious and impervious areas are almost equivalent around 0 5 each in addition some lsoa units show a maximum of 0 98 of impervious area fraction which reveals that there are london areas which are dramatically impervious while others are very permeable especially in the outskirts of the city area density down to 0 035 fig 3d finally london s average population is 5 195 people per km2 although this can go up from 15 924 p km2 to 92 722 p km2 in the most densely populated lsoa zones fig 3e regarding household size the average in london is at 2 5 bedrooms per household although most of the central lsoa areas present between 1 4 and 2 2 bedroom per household and houses in residential outskirts go up to 4 1 bedrooms in average per household fig 3f the urban form area fraction maps indicate that most of the building and impervious surfaces are concentrated in the central london presenting major risks for flooding and the most significant challenges for urban wn although london is considered a green city there are still some areas in the city centre that suffer from a lack of green space and a large percentage of impermeable surfaces in parallel to this a larger number of citizens are concentrated in the city centre where also the average household size is smaller than in the city boundaries this might produce highly localised water demand patterns and severe issues of wastewater production and sewage overflow although these localised issues cannot be captured with the citywat model they could be evaluated in more detail with semi distributed water management models dobson et al 2021 or other finer resolution evaluation tools 4 2 water neutrality scenarios and systemic design options the scenario development process starts with the baseline and the bau simulations which do not include any wn design option the baseline includes the impact from 3 266 170 existing households and a total population of 8 961 989 people uk census 2011 while the 10 year housing projection for the london bau scenario adds up to 3 789 040 homes and 9 800 000 people gla 2021 other input variables such as building green and impervious area in each scenario are summarised in the table a2 in appendices next to develop the wn scenarios the design options explained in the section 2 2 table 1 are implemented to introduce water efficiency millock and nauges 2010 we consider installing appliances with an average of 35 water use reduction jorge and covas 2017 callejas moncaleano et al 2021 in all new 522 870 households scenario a next we implement bgi solutions to the new building infrastructure bozovic et al 2017 kabisch et al 2017 nesshöver et al 2017 zaid et al 2018 keeler et al 2019 ferrans et al 2022 all new homes are equipped with 80 of green roof area in scenario b liu et al 2022 finally social awareness campaigns are assumed to affect the behaviour of all citizens living in new homes and reduce their demand by 4 mortazavi naeini et al 2019 which defines scenario c the total number of citizens in new homes is calculated by the average number of people per household in london estimated at 2 5 uk census 2011 and multiplied by the number of new predicted homes gla 2021 this is different to the expected population growth of the city as some citizens are expected to be relocated from existing areas rainwater harvesting design li et al 2009 assumes a 400 litre tank installed in each new household this volume is calculated by averaging the 1 000 litre tanks commonly used for individual households and considering a smaller capacity for flat buildings per household scenario d to enhance the water reuse capacity a gwr reuse system campisano et al 2017 that assumes a 50 greywater recycle is installed in all new 522 870 new homes in scenario e finally scenario f is set by aggregating all the wn design options from scenarios a to e all the scenarios developed in this systemic design process are summarised in the table 3 once the options for new homes are defined scenarios for retrofitting existing homes and urban infrastructure are developed by implementing the wn design options outside the development area it is predicted with citywat simulations that 432 500 existing homes is the minimum amount to fully offset the impacts in urban consumer demand hence the scenario g will implement efficient appliances of 35 consumer reduction in all these 432 500 existing homes the first retrofit stage scenario j will aggregate all the wn options in new homes scenario f with the scenario g as scenario j does not offset flooding risk or river quality in scenario h we install rwh systems of 400 litre tanks in all retrofit households next the second retrofit stage scenario k aggregates scenario h with scenario j the citywat simulations also showed that 19 km2 of impermeable land needs to be made permeable in the existing london s surface to completely offset the impacts in urban flood risk by new projected development hence in scenario i several solutions of bgi all of them being permeable are added to the city to reduce the total existing impervious area in the end all scenarios both in new and existing retrofit solutions are aggregated in the third and final retrofit stage scenario l in which the impacts on the urban water system by new developments are aimed to be offset 4 3 urban water neutrality of london after following the systemic design process explained above the urban water security uws evaluation step is developed with the citywat model the simulations from the citywat model provide raw values for each uws indicator and each scenario table a3 appendices these raw values may be useful for water companies and environmental regulators such as the uk environment agency but might be hard to interpret by other stakeholders the percentage increase in uws indicators with the bau scenario compared to the baseline is 12 for the consumer urban demand 56 for the urban flood risk and 10 for the river water quality based on the raw values and following equation 1 we calculate the scores for the water neutrality index wni for each uws indicators table 4 demonstrates that urban consumer demand is not completely neutralised wni 100 until scenario j which implies to fully implement all the wn design solutions inside development area and retrofit 432 500 existing homes with water efficient appliances outside the development urban flood risk is more difficult to be neutralised and does not achieve a score of wni 100 until scenario l which means to implement all the previous wn options and add 19 km2 of bgi to the existing london s land finally water quality achieves a maximum score of wni 99 with scenario l too other intermediate scores for the wni for each wn scenario are found in table 4 5 discussion in this study we focus on three key contributions to wn urban design we first developed a wn concept for systemic design of new urban developments and then proposed a cityplan water framework and the water neutrality index from the results in table 4 we observe that some wn design options are multi functional and have a significant effect on all the uws indicators i e rwh systems while others only affect one or two indicators e g green roofs or gwr systems based on the results obtained from the wni in london for the level of options implemented we note that it will be necessary to retrofit a considerable number of existing households outside the development area to achieve wn of new urban developments at a city scale in london these results of wn concept are based on the wni value of 100 but this target could be scale specific e g water neutrality at a borough or wastewater zone level or set at a different wn level e g 80 water neutral developments although the value of water in london urban developments might be similar for being part of the same city this might not always be the case and some trade offs between the costs and the benefits of the wn solution per unit of water could emerge too finally the selection of uws indicators and target value for each indicator may vary depending on the urban context and the decision makers involved the targets for each urban water security indicator might change depending on the urban area studied and its own properties e g an area more prone to urban flooding could have a higher target for the urban flood risk indicator compared to consumer demand or river water quality in order to be considered water neutral in this study we have examined three often competing objectives water supply quality and flooding however there may be cases where the value of a unit of water supply is different in different locations if these locations can be made commensurate by a weighting determined by the decision maker then the cityplan water framework can proceed as presented in this study if they cannot then additional metrics for different locations can instead be introduced allowing the decision maker to contextualise the trade offs between locations alongside the trade offs between quality supply flooding the work also contributes to the analysis of achieving the water neutrality at a city scale although incorporating wn design options in new urban developments is cost effective and cheaper than retrofitting at a later stage allen et al 2020 the total number of new homes represent a small share of the total housing stock in london uk census 2011 offsetting outside the development area will be often necessary to achieve wn but this might present a series of challenges and opportunities two clear challenges are the current climate crisis and the dependency of the wn success on the change of the water demand patterns to address this proposed wn design options must be adaptable not only to climate change mitigation and resilience but also to cultural and societal needs therefore future stages of the work should introduce climate change scenarios and predicted population patterns as input data for the model evaluation in addition to this there are also physical and economic challenges such as retrofitting ageing infrastructure which is always more costly and complicated to execute than a new construction simpson et al 2021 retrofitting existing infrastructure however presents great opportunities as well london planning authorities might need regional cross borough plans to develop integrated water management strategies and the systemic design process inside cityplan water could be key to succeed on future water neutrality implementation next steps of the work could study london s opportunity areas in more detail to analyse potential locations and how the retrofit options might be practically implemented systemic design is aimed to connect all the multi scale boundaries inside the city and facilitate new models for collaborative water management and decision making the systemic design process could be enhanced by analysing the city s urban form through a more detailed mapping exercise which would identify additional features of the urban system in relation to the defined purpose to achieve water neutral developments features that might provide new scenario configurations include information on city s developable land availability compactness of the city s urban pattern around the development area predicted future climate conditions historical citizens willingness to change their behaviour towards environmental causes availability of public funds towards retrofitting options relationship between the local planning authorities and urban developers in a particular council etc these additional features combined with a refined information of the new urban developments distribution will increase the accuracy of the wni results moreover a participatory involvement from different types of urban stakeholders will provide a valuable input to validate further the cityplan water framework another potential direction for future work could be to develop a digital tool that can process and map the data automatically linking the gis datasets with the integrated urban water management model i e citywat this pre processing tool could be in the form of a plugin inside the qgis software or formalised as a python package in addition specifically defining the type of bgi in terms of water management function infiltration storage or treatment to the wn design options will increase the accuracy of the uws results future studies could evaluate the existing efficiency levels of each zone inside the city based on the buildings age and population patterns this could be used to support water consumption predictions and develop a generic water performance certificate at a city or national scale finally the findings from the wni are based on city scale targets following the citywat model s scope but other case studies and scales might be considered in future stages in this work we presented the proof of concept of cityplan water and the use of spatial data is taken from the bgs dataset in large resolution and divided by the lsoa boundaries but next stages might include more publicly available datasets or different boundaries i e london boroughs or wards large urban developments in london are scheduled for the next 20 30 years e g thamesmead waterfront development plan in greenwich or meridian water development in enfield which will create an important impact into the overall water system of the city and could be studied individually or in conjunction inside cityplan water as previously mentioned the future studies on water neutral developments could be done in collaboration with the local planning authorities of each borough and public private housing developers in a participatory way 6 conclusion this paper introduced a novel approach for the water neutrality concept for new urban developments it applied the wn concept to the urban planning sustainability framework upsuf and developed a new operational framework called cityplan water the framework combines wn options from a systemic design perspective and evaluates urban water security at a city scale all being spatially represented in a gis dataset using the proposed water neutrality index a series of urban design scenarios could be explored and different levels of wn based on the 10 year housing projection in london can be developed providing a valuable information on the scale of implementation needed to minimise impacts of new developments on urban water security the knowledge from this work and the application of the cityplan water to the wn concept points to valuable potential to change how we design our cities to achieve urban water security cityplan water is aligned with the united nations sustainable development goal 6 sdg 6 that advocates for clean water and sanitation for all but future versions of cityplan might be relevant to other sdgs too e g affordable and clean energy sustainable cities and communities or climate action among others the framework has a strong potential for digitally enhanced decision making at different scales combining design and evaluation will guide different groups of stakeholders some of those being housing developers local planning authorities or water companies among others in the end the results from cityplan water show a great potential of the framework to guide urban planners and policymakers from early stages of the planning process towards sustainability and urban

15940,the climate emergency and population growth threaten urban water security in cities worldwide growth urbanisation and changes to way of life have increased housing demand requiring cities such as london to increase their housing stock by more than 15 over the next 10 years these new urban developments will increase water demand urban flood risk and river water pollution levels therefore an integrated systems based approach to development and water management is needed water neutrality wn has emerged as a concept to frame the concerns about escalating water stresses in cities we frame wn as a planning process for new urban developments that aims to minimise impacts on urban water security and offset any remaining stresses by retrofitting existing housing stock in this work we present a novel systemic design framework for future urban planning called cityplan water which guides how wn might be achieved to tackle current and future water pressures at a city scale cityplan water integrates spatial data with an integrated urban water management model enabling urban design at a systems level and systematic assessment of future scenarios we define a water neutrality index that captures how successful a given urban planning scenario is in achieving wn and how multiple interventions could be combined at a city scale to improve wn results from cityplan water suggest that it will be necessary to retrofit almost the same number of existing homes with wn design options to completely offset the impact imposed by proposed new developments combining options such as water efficient appliances water reuse systems and social awareness campaigns can offset the impact of new development on water demand by 70 while to neutralise potential flood risk and water pollution at a city scale interventions such as rainwater harvesting and blue green infrastructure need to be added both in new urban developments and 432 000 existing london households we see cityplan water as a tool that can support the transition of urban planning towards using data driven analysis to effectively design water neutral housing and drive sustainable development graphical abstract image

increasing pressures on housing in cities worldwide united nations 2014 colenbrander et al 2019 committee on climate change 2019 cohen 2020 taylor o brien and o keefe 2020 and causing adverse effects on the urban water cycle rauch et al 2017 water uk 2019 zubaidi et al 2020 one of the biggest challenges for future planning will be managing the impact of new housing developments on water sustainability brown et al 2009 jones 2014a hurlimann and wilson 2018 understanding the interactions between land use processes water infrastructure and water quality will require integrated urban planning and will be essential to manage the impact of housing growth on the urban water cycle carmona et al 2010 ford et al 2019 medeiros and van der zwet 2020 to address the complexity of the built natural environment interdependences a systems approach has been proposed which integrates design and evaluation with criteria that are used to inform the level of sustainability of an urban development puchol salort et al 2021 in the literature there are several approaches to integrate urban planning with water management which can address some of the aspects of the systems approach for instance yang et al 2016 present a conceptual framework for urban water sustainability that evaluate socioeconomic and environmental interactions furlong et al 2017 study the benefits and opportunities of integrated urban water management plans ford et al 2019 develop an urban integrated assessment framework that provides a multi scale analysis of climate change impacts on cities and medeiros and van der zwet 2020 integrate strategies for sustainable urban development and evaluate them qualitatively in two european cities however there is still a need to integrate the entire planning process with design solutions and quantitative evaluation which we address in this paper by adapting the urban planning sustainability framework upsuf puchol salort et al 2021 to water land system analysis in upsuf systems thinking is defined as an engineering approach that integrates blue green urban design modelling and analysis of land and building planning options to enable stakeholders coordination and a holistic vision of the urban system systemic design is an emerging approach that has evolved in recent decades it combines traditional design and systems thinking taking a holistic and complete account of the urban form elements that constitute a complex system jones and kijima 2018 battistoni et al 2019 bijl brouwer and malcolm 2020 following systemic design principles all physical elements in a given space e g an urban development borough city etc define a series of layers that together constitute the entire urban system jones 2014b ryan 2014 de la rosa and hovanesian 2019 therefore systemic design sees the planning process as a whole and considers urban water infrastructure as one of the layers in the design of cities shin et al 2018 moravej et al 2021 in this study we are introducing the systemic design approach to urban planning and water management guided by upsuf an emerging concept in urban water management is water neutrality wn kemlo and lawson 2009 nel et al 2009 hoekstra 2018 traditionally wn was defined as an approach to offset a predicted increase in water demand produced by a new urban development by reducing the existing demand somewhere inside the region environment agency 2009 the concept was then extended to include demand offsetting by increasing water efficiency and reducing water consumption hoekstra 2008 hoekstra et al 2011 makin et al 2021 however wn should not solely imply the need to have net zero water consumption but also to prioritise minimising the impacts of new development and offsetting the remaining environmental and social impacts wu et al 2020 makin et al 2021 these impacts could be evaluated through the concept of urban water security uws which integrates water demand with flood risk and water quality assessments hoekstra et al 2018 nazemi and madani 2018 van ginkel et al 2018 aboelnga et al 2019 su et al 2020 in this study we consider that achieving wn will require not only to maintain the same post development water demand but also to maintain existing flood risk and water quality uws indicators we also allow for the wn target to be set by the decision makers with net zero water target 100 water neutral developments as a default recommendation finally to maintain existing uws indicators and efficiently implement wn at the planning phase of a new urban development a range of wn design options will be needed either inside or outside the development area these design options include for example blue green infrastructure bgi efficient appliances rainwater harvesting water reuse systems and demand management social campaigns dieu hang et al 2017 sheth 2017 ferrans et al 2018 lu 2019 amongst others we argue that applying upsuf to wn will support the integration of sustainable design solutions and simulation models to achieve implementation of systemic design for urban systems planning although there are some valuable examples of water management evaluation models combined with spatial representation such as the dance4water model from rauch et al 2017 or the suwmba method from morajev et al 2021 there is no clear evidence of the wn concept being applied in urban systems and there is still a lack of an integrated method that accurately measures wn indicators combined with spatial configurations for urban planning in this paper we present the novel concept of cityplan conceived as an operational version of upsuf we envisage that the cityplan can be applied to different areas of urban sustainability i e water air biodiversity urban microclimate etc here we develop a proof of concept focused on wn evaluation cityplan water hereafter there are three key contributions in this work first we develop the wn concept for future urban planning from a systemic design perspective second we present the novel cityplan water framework where wn assessment is provided by the integrated urban water management model citywat dobson and mijic 2020 which we combine with a spatial analysis of key urban form parameters with the focus on london uk cityplan water could be applied at different urban scales which is defined by the spatial extent and the resolution of the simulation model used in this study the wn evaluation for london is performed at a city lumped scale cityplan water provides a quantitative assessment for a series of wn design options through the novel water neutrality index wni third we demonstrate opportunities to achieve wn at a city scale depending on different scenarios and levels of offsetting the impacts of new urban development inside versus outside the development area finally implications of the work potential future scope and overall conclusions are discussed 2 cityplan water case study the city of london unavoidable pressures on water systems such as fluvial flooding pluvial flooding droughts or river water quality degradation are projected to become more frequent in the uk due to climate change and increased urbanisation garner hannah watts 2017 miller and hutchins 2017 these pressures are very significant in london environment agency 2009 clark et al 2018 the city s population is projected to increase by 70 000 people per year reaching 10 8 million citizens by 2041 committee on climate change 2019 gla 2021 this will require an average increase of 66 000 new homes per year for at least twenty years and around 50 of these homes being affordable if londoners needs are to be met gla 2021 london is divided into 32 boroughs which are sub divided for statistical purposes into smaller zones called lower layer super output areas lsoas london s urban pattern depicts a distorted grid radiating from the city centre to the city boundaries changing in scale and density central areas follow traditional georgian planning and are generally more compact with concentrated and large green spaces while suburbs present a more sprawl distribution surrounded by metropolitan open land and a green belt gla 2021 based on the new london plan gla 2021 the 10 year predicted target for net housing completion in the city will be 522 870 new homes by 2030 currently the city presents a strong potential for urban regeneration as large areas are reliant on ageing infrastructure and will benefit from redevelopment and investment opportunities the greater london authority gla has already identified several opportunity areas oas in each borough which present an effective development capacity to accommodate new housing commercial activities and public infrastructure and are linked to existing or potential improvements in public transport connectivity gla 2021 3 methodology evaluating water neutrality at different scales influencing planning decisions and guiding stakeholders towards water neutral developments is the key purpose of cityplan water its functionality is based on upsuf and integrates three key components fig 1 which includes representation of the cityplan water process and operation blue cluster in fig 1 the systemic design solutions green cluster and the urban water security uws evaluation toolkit overview purple cluster in this work upsuf is refined to support water neutrality evaluation for new urban developments developing the proof of concept for cityplan water 3 1 water neutrality systemic design concept the methodology of cityplan water follows an iterative process that uses a defined target for water neutrality as a measure of the urban water security through a spatial representation in gis the results from cityplan water will determine if a new urban development with proposed wn design options can be considered water neutral under a specific target and spatial assessment scale as with upsuf this iterative process provides a defined set of steps that takes the user from an initial baseline to new water neutral development scenarios including the requirements of environment and regulatory bodies new developments increase the existing urban water impacts in cities and decrease uws levels mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 jensen and wu 2018 to define a new interpretation of the wn concept from a systemic design approach it is necessary to evaluate this increase under different urban design scenarios fig 2 in our work the development impact di from new urban developments is calculated as an addition to the existing pre development impacts i e baseline thereafter to provide a comprehensive assessment of the wn concept we consider two types of urban design scenarios business as usual bau scenario left column in fig 2 and wn scenarios right column in fig 2 3 1 1 water neutrality index the bau scenario represents the project that is developed and built with traditional construction and design primarily including hard and impervious surfaces and artificial materials puchol salort et al 2021 under the bau option no wn design options are implemented and the di is at its maximum level to offset the impacts wn scenarios are developed as design options that reduce the urban water impacts these scenarios provide different levels of impact reduction depending on the scale and size of the intervention the wn options can be applied inside the development area new buildings and land or outside existing infrastructure retrofit we define the remaining impact of new developments on the urban water system of the city once wn options are implemented as a water neutrality development impact wndi hence if wndi is zero the proposed wn options fully offset the impacts of the new development and wn will be fully achieved threshold marked by the blue line in fig 2 it is useful to introduce a water neutrality index wni which measures the relative difference between development impact di in the bau scenario and the water neutrality development impact wndi in the wn scenarios 1 wni di wndi di 100 the wni needs to be 100 to achieve full wn and to maintain uws at the pre development levels in case the wni is higher than 100 the existing uws levels will be improved creating an environment positive urban development 3 2 spatial data to understand water neutrality urban form analysis of london s urban form properties is needed to understand the existing urban water system i e pre development baseline we have selected a series of urban form properties based on their direct relationship with the uws indicators and the wn concept table 1 roof area blue and green area and total pervious impervious area are obtained from a proprietary 2m land cover raster dataset provided by the british geological survey bgs while population and size of housing are obtained from the uk census 2011 in this work we study london s urban form properties and its spatial attributes following lsoa boundaries because they are publicly available from the uk census api and feature consistently sized statistical units at the highest resolution the bgs landcover raster data is not publicly available but a similar analysis could be performed with open source datasets such as the ordnance survey os open data uk 2019 or the london openstreetmap among others we use the urban form data in two ways firstly we introduce it in the citywat model to ensure the accuracy of the input data secondly we create a series of density maps defined via oke et al 2017 2 λ x a x a t where a x is the surface area of land cover type x in the lsoa see last column in table 2 and a t is the total surface area a summary of selected urban form properties their total area percentages and average area fraction indexes is in the table a1 in appendices 3 3 systemic design solutions one of the strengths of the systemic design approach is its flexibility to be implemented at different spatial scales jones 2020 an urban planner can implement systemic design solutions from an urban development to a whole city scale battistoni et al 2019 pereno and barbero 2020 in this work the citywat model assesses the urban water system of london as a whole in a lumped approach so we perform a scenario development exercise at a city scale the evaluation of the wn scenarios will measure the effectiveness of the wn design options listed in table 2 which can be implemented either inside or outside the new development area as retrofit solutions 3 3 1 urban water security indicators selected wn design options interact differently with uws indicators for instance bgi reduces flood risk and improves water quality but has no significant effect on consumer demand unless the water reuse functionality is introduced efficient appliances however have a positive impact on consumer demand and water quality but do not impact flood risk in addition to conceptually understanding the influence of each proposed intervention on uws indicators it is also important to highlight the different involvement from urban stakeholders in the wn design implementation table 2 for example efficient appliances and social campaigns both affect consumer demand and water quality but are responsibility of different stakeholders i e efficient appliances depend on developers and citizens while social campaigns rely on central and local government water companies and ultimately citizens to holistically assess the impacts on the urban water system for all relevant stakeholders puchol salort et al 2021 we select three key indicators for urban water security uws these uws indicators are a urban consumer demand measured by the average daily total water supplied to consumers across london in megalitres per day ml day b urban flood risk measured by the average of excess stormwater runoff in megalitres per day ml day and c river water quality measured by the average daily phosphorus content in the river thames in milligrams per litre mg l urban consumer demand is primarily relevant to water companies urban flood risk for local planning authorities and river water quality for the england s environment agency ea 3 4 water neutrality evaluation the impact of wn scenarios is evaluated in terms of uws indicators in the third step of the cityplan water process fig 1 cityplan water combines the citywat urban water management integrated model dobson and mijic 2020 with qgis quantum geographical information system 2019 both citywat see appendix a and qgis are open source which enables data to be transferable and shared with relevant stakeholders to accurately assess the uws indicators within a single evaluation framework we apply the integrated urban water management model citywat dobson and mijic 2020 citywat is lumped at a city level and coded in python citywat facilitates holistic modelling of the urban water cycle and simulates the flow and quality of water through mass balance equations it has been validated against historical data in london and so can provide reliable uws projections when applied at a city or wastewater zone semi distributed scale dobson and mijic 2020 dobson et al 2021 after introducing numerical parameters from the urban form properties into citywat such as the total number of households total population roof area percent impermeable total green area etc table a1 appendices the uws indicators of the existing impacts baseline are obtained via simulation next looking at the predicted housing growth at the city scale and its projected population in the next 10 years from public reports and city s planning documents different combinations of wn design options table 2 are implemented to obtain the wn scenarios fig 2 once we have created the wn design options to accommodate new developments we use citywat simulations to verify whether the retrofitting fully offsets the new impacts of urban consumer demand and flood risk in this simulation step design options are modelled as changes to the urban form parameters that are used in citywat new urban developments will influence the rainwater harvesting capacity increase the consumer demand based on the total projected population decrease the percent of impermeable area etc see section 4 2 in this work citywat is run at a daily timestep and uws indicators are reported as at average daily values finally uws values are processed to obtain the novel water neutrality index wni as explained in section 3 1 1 and obtain wni metrics in percentages ultimately if results from the wni indicate that the proposed development achieves a specific wn target this will be the final stage of the process but if metrics suggest that the new development is far from the target it will be necessary to either provide a series of planning recommendations or move back to the systemic design solutions stage and implement new wn options until water neutrality is achieved step five in fig 1 4 results systemic design for water neutrality is developed at a city scale and is based on the future predicted housing growth in london where 522 870 new households are aimed to be built during the next 10 years gla 2021 as the citywat model is lumped at a city scale we cannot specify spatially where these new households will be located however the results show the aggregated effect of the impact of new development and the scale of interventions needed for impact mitigation 4 1 analysis and visualisation of london s urban form properties the area fraction equation equation 2 oke et al 2017 is used in this work to visualise london s urban form properties objectively the density maps fig 3 inform about the heterogeneity of each urban form in london and will help decision makers to perceive which parts of the city are in more need of certain wn design options the plan area fraction indices in each lsoa unit vary considerably from one urban form property to other while roof area maximum value is 0 61 and minimum 0 01 with an average across london of 0 22 fig 3a the blue and green area ranges from 0 011 to 0 909 with an average across london of 0 45 fig 3b while the total impervious area percentage is around 37 of the city table a1 appendices the average plan area indexes of the pervious and impervious areas are almost equivalent around 0 5 each in addition some lsoa units show a maximum of 0 98 of impervious area fraction which reveals that there are london areas which are dramatically impervious while others are very permeable especially in the outskirts of the city area density down to 0 035 fig 3d finally london s average population is 5 195 people per km2 although this can go up from 15 924 p km2 to 92 722 p km2 in the most densely populated lsoa zones fig 3e regarding household size the average in london is at 2 5 bedrooms per household although most of the central lsoa areas present between 1 4 and 2 2 bedroom per household and houses in residential outskirts go up to 4 1 bedrooms in average per household fig 3f the urban form area fraction maps indicate that most of the building and impervious surfaces are concentrated in the central london presenting major risks for flooding and the most significant challenges for urban wn although london is considered a green city there are still some areas in the city centre that suffer from a lack of green space and a large percentage of impermeable surfaces in parallel to this a larger number of citizens are concentrated in the city centre where also the average household size is smaller than in the city boundaries this might produce highly localised water demand patterns and severe issues of wastewater production and sewage overflow although these localised issues cannot be captured with the citywat model they could be evaluated in more detail with semi distributed water management models dobson et al 2021 or other finer resolution evaluation tools 4 2 water neutrality scenarios and systemic design options the scenario development process starts with the baseline and the bau simulations which do not include any wn design option the baseline includes the impact from 3 266 170 existing households and a total population of 8 961 989 people uk census 2011 while the 10 year housing projection for the london bau scenario adds up to 3 789 040 homes and 9 800 000 people gla 2021 other input variables such as building green and impervious area in each scenario are summarised in the table a2 in appendices next to develop the wn scenarios the design options explained in the section 2 2 table 1 are implemented to introduce water efficiency millock and nauges 2010 we consider installing appliances with an average of 35 water use reduction jorge and covas 2017 callejas moncaleano et al 2021 in all new 522 870 households scenario a next we implement bgi solutions to the new building infrastructure bozovic et al 2017 kabisch et al 2017 nesshöver et al 2017 zaid et al 2018 keeler et al 2019 ferrans et al 2022 all new homes are equipped with 80 of green roof area in scenario b liu et al 2022 finally social awareness campaigns are assumed to affect the behaviour of all citizens living in new homes and reduce their demand by 4 mortazavi naeini et al 2019 which defines scenario c the total number of citizens in new homes is calculated by the average number of people per household in london estimated at 2 5 uk census 2011 and multiplied by the number of new predicted homes gla 2021 this is different to the expected population growth of the city as some citizens are expected to be relocated from existing areas rainwater harvesting design li et al 2009 assumes a 400 litre tank installed in each new household this volume is calculated by averaging the 1 000 litre tanks commonly used for individual households and considering a smaller capacity for flat buildings per household scenario d to enhance the water reuse capacity a gwr reuse system campisano et al 2017 that assumes a 50 greywater recycle is installed in all new 522 870 new homes in scenario e finally scenario f is set by aggregating all the wn design options from scenarios a to e all the scenarios developed in this systemic design process are summarised in the table 3 once the options for new homes are defined scenarios for retrofitting existing homes and urban infrastructure are developed by implementing the wn design options outside the development area it is predicted with citywat simulations that 432 500 existing homes is the minimum amount to fully offset the impacts in urban consumer demand hence the scenario g will implement efficient appliances of 35 consumer reduction in all these 432 500 existing homes the first retrofit stage scenario j will aggregate all the wn options in new homes scenario f with the scenario g as scenario j does not offset flooding risk or river quality in scenario h we install rwh systems of 400 litre tanks in all retrofit households next the second retrofit stage scenario k aggregates scenario h with scenario j the citywat simulations also showed that 19 km2 of impermeable land needs to be made permeable in the existing london s surface to completely offset the impacts in urban flood risk by new projected development hence in scenario i several solutions of bgi all of them being permeable are added to the city to reduce the total existing impervious area in the end all scenarios both in new and existing retrofit solutions are aggregated in the third and final retrofit stage scenario l in which the impacts on the urban water system by new developments are aimed to be offset 4 3 urban water neutrality of london after following the systemic design process explained above the urban water security uws evaluation step is developed with the citywat model the simulations from the citywat model provide raw values for each uws indicator and each scenario table a3 appendices these raw values may be useful for water companies and environmental regulators such as the uk environment agency but might be hard to interpret by other stakeholders the percentage increase in uws indicators with the bau scenario compared to the baseline is 12 for the consumer urban demand 56 for the urban flood risk and 10 for the river water quality based on the raw values and following equation 1 we calculate the scores for the water neutrality index wni for each uws indicators table 4 demonstrates that urban consumer demand is not completely neutralised wni 100 until scenario j which implies to fully implement all the wn design solutions inside development area and retrofit 432 500 existing homes with water efficient appliances outside the development urban flood risk is more difficult to be neutralised and does not achieve a score of wni 100 until scenario l which means to implement all the previous wn options and add 19 km2 of bgi to the existing london s land finally water quality achieves a maximum score of wni 99 with scenario l too other intermediate scores for the wni for each wn scenario are found in table 4 5 discussion in this study we focus on three key contributions to wn urban design we first developed a wn concept for systemic design of new urban developments and then proposed a cityplan water framework and the water neutrality index from the results in table 4 we observe that some wn design options are multi functional and have a significant effect on all the uws indicators i e rwh systems while others only affect one or two indicators e g green roofs or gwr systems based on the results obtained from the wni in london for the level of options implemented we note that it will be necessary to retrofit a considerable number of existing households outside the development area to achieve wn of new urban developments at a city scale in london these results of wn concept are based on the wni value of 100 but this target could be scale specific e g water neutrality at a borough or wastewater zone level or set at a different wn level e g 80 water neutral developments although the value of water in london urban developments might be similar for being part of the same city this might not always be the case and some trade offs between the costs and the benefits of the wn solution per unit of water could emerge too finally the selection of uws indicators and target value for each indicator may vary depending on the urban context and the decision makers involved the targets for each urban water security indicator might change depending on the urban area studied and its own properties e g an area more prone to urban flooding could have a higher target for the urban flood risk indicator compared to consumer demand or river water quality in order to be considered water neutral in this study we have examined three often competing objectives water supply quality and flooding however there may be cases where the value of a unit of water supply is different in different locations if these locations can be made commensurate by a weighting determined by the decision maker then the cityplan water framework can proceed as presented in this study if they cannot then additional metrics for different locations can instead be introduced allowing the decision maker to contextualise the trade offs between locations alongside the trade offs between quality supply flooding the work also contributes to the analysis of achieving the water neutrality at a city scale although incorporating wn design options in new urban developments is cost effective and cheaper than retrofitting at a later stage allen et al 2020 the total number of new homes represent a small share of the total housing stock in london uk census 2011 offsetting outside the development area will be often necessary to achieve wn but this might present a series of challenges and opportunities two clear challenges are the current climate crisis and the dependency of the wn success on the change of the water demand patterns to address this proposed wn design options must be adaptable not only to climate change mitigation and resilience but also to cultural and societal needs therefore future stages of the work should introduce climate change scenarios and predicted population patterns as input data for the model evaluation in addition to this there are also physical and economic challenges such as retrofitting ageing infrastructure which is always more costly and complicated to execute than a new construction simpson et al 2021 retrofitting existing infrastructure however presents great opportunities as well london planning authorities might need regional cross borough plans to develop integrated water management strategies and the systemic design process inside cityplan water could be key to succeed on future water neutrality implementation next steps of the work could study london s opportunity areas in more detail to analyse potential locations and how the retrofit options might be practically implemented systemic design is aimed to connect all the multi scale boundaries inside the city and facilitate new models for collaborative water management and decision making the systemic design process could be enhanced by analysing the city s urban form through a more detailed mapping exercise which would identify additional features of the urban system in relation to the defined purpose to achieve water neutral developments features that might provide new scenario configurations include information on city s developable land availability compactness of the city s urban pattern around the development area predicted future climate conditions historical citizens willingness to change their behaviour towards environmental causes availability of public funds towards retrofitting options relationship between the local planning authorities and urban developers in a particular council etc these additional features combined with a refined information of the new urban developments distribution will increase the accuracy of the wni results moreover a participatory involvement from different types of urban stakeholders will provide a valuable input to validate further the cityplan water framework another potential direction for future work could be to develop a digital tool that can process and map the data automatically linking the gis datasets with the integrated urban water management model i e citywat this pre processing tool could be in the form of a plugin inside the qgis software or formalised as a python package in addition specifically defining the type of bgi in terms of water management function infiltration storage or treatment to the wn design options will increase the accuracy of the uws results future studies could evaluate the existing efficiency levels of each zone inside the city based on the buildings age and population patterns this could be used to support water consumption predictions and develop a generic water performance certificate at a city or national scale finally the findings from the wni are based on city scale targets following the citywat model s scope but other case studies and scales might be considered in future stages in this work we presented the proof of concept of cityplan water and the use of spatial data is taken from the bgs dataset in large resolution and divided by the lsoa boundaries but next stages might include more publicly available datasets or different boundaries i e london boroughs or wards large urban developments in london are scheduled for the next 20 30 years e g thamesmead waterfront development plan in greenwich or meridian water development in enfield which will create an important impact into the overall water system of the city and could be studied individually or in conjunction inside cityplan water as previously mentioned the future studies on water neutral developments could be done in collaboration with the local planning authorities of each borough and public private housing developers in a participatory way 6 conclusion this paper introduced a novel approach for the water neutrality concept for new urban developments it applied the wn concept to the urban planning sustainability framework upsuf and developed a new operational framework called cityplan water the framework combines wn options from a systemic design perspective and evaluates urban water security at a city scale all being spatially represented in a gis dataset using the proposed water neutrality index a series of urban design scenarios could be explored and different levels of wn based on the 10 year housing projection in london can be developed providing a valuable information on the scale of implementation needed to minimise impacts of new developments on urban water security the knowledge from this work and the application of the cityplan water to the wn concept points to valuable potential to change how we design our cities to achieve urban water security cityplan water is aligned with the united nations sustainable development goal 6 sdg 6 that advocates for clean water and sanitation for all but future versions of cityplan might be relevant to other sdgs too e g affordable and clean energy sustainable cities and communities or climate action among others the framework has a strong potential for digitally enhanced decision making at different scales combining design and evaluation will guide different groups of stakeholders some of those being housing developers local planning authorities or water companies among others in the end the results from cityplan water show a great potential of the framework to guide urban planners and policymakers from early stages of the planning process towards sustainability and urban

climatological factors and riverine nutrient supply on habs in lakes ho and michalak 2019 michalak et al 2013 on the one hand warming temperature and light harvesting stimulate the growth of harmful algae relative to other species and exacerbate habs pathway 1 in fig 1 carey et al 2012 on the other hand changing climatic conditions could alter nutrient loadings in lacustrine systems high temperature and intensive mixing processes increase internal nutrient loadings by increasing nutrient release from sediment diffusion and resuspension pathway 2 in fig 1 matisoff et al 2016 qin et al 2004 meanwhile enhanced precipitation increases the runoff to bring more riverine nutrient loadings to lakes or to accelerate nutrient attenuations in lakes by fast flushing velocities pathway 3 in fig 1 reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 sinha and michalak 2016 the tight interplays among climatological forcings hydrological regimes and water quality of inland water bodies have been gradually recognized michalak 2016 as one of the essential components of hydrologic cycles groundwater is expected to be crucial in regulating habs in the aquatic systems studies focused on coastal groundwater have demonstrated the predominant role of groundwater borne nutrients in causing eutrophication and triggering habs hu et al 2006 laroche et al 1997 luo and jiao 2016 lacustrine groundwater discharge lgd refers to groundwater flowing to a lake and is a significant conveyor of external chemical loadings to lakes posing profound effects on the lake water quality and ecosystem sustainability lewandowski et al 2015 groundwater can be highly enriched in nutrients due to mineralization of natural organic matters and additional anthropogenic sources fertilizer manure or sewage lewandowski et al 2015 nutrient enriched groundwater enables lgd to deliver large nutrient loadings knights et al 2017 previous studies also have found that the lgd derived nutrient loadings defined as lgd nutrient loadings exhibit high spatial heterogeneity by a range of one order of magnitude which is responsible for the hotspots of eutrophic states and algal biomasses within the same lake hagerthey and kerfoot 1998 sun et al 2021 moreover the substantial p supply from lgd alters n p ratios and regulates algal proliferation in lakes hagerthey and kerfoot 1998 meinikmann et al 2015 when exceeding the thresholds of ecological resilience of lakes groundwater borne nutrients are expected to raise eutrophication and trigger habs in lakes ommen et al 2012 but the underlying mechanisms on the synergistic controls of nutrient states and habs from a combined viewpoint of climatology hydrology and biogeochemistry are unclear fig 1 descy et al 2016 the dynamic of lgd is highly dependent on various topographical hydrogeological and climatological parameters rosenberry et al 2015 hence it is always difficult to straightforwardly quantify lgd with these complicated parameters shallow lakes characterized by flat topographical and simple hydrogeological settings may be under minor controls of near shore hydraulic gradients induced by differences of altitude salinity heat etc burnett et al 2003 rosenberry et al 2015 in addition groundwater flow regimes in the lakeshore aquifers are always sensitive to dynamics of precipitation and evapotranspiration rosenberry and winter 1997 and climatological forcings are more likely to dominate lgd in shallow lakes temporal variability of lgd could further lead to seasonality of lgd nutrient loadings which potentially cause nutrient state shifts and habs in these lakes wang et al 2012 however the examination of the direct interplay between climatic forcings and lgd is greatly inhibited due to the difficulty in obtaining long term lgd data tristram et al 2015 comparatively climatological parameters of precipitation and evaporation are mostly readily accessible baldocchi et al 2001 huffman et al 2007 martens et al 2017 thus lgd can be effectively extrapolated if the reliable correlation between climatological parameters and lgd is established thereafter the biogeochemical and ecological significance of lgd under climatic forcings can be explored as well pathway 4 in fig 1 lake taihu is a famous eutrophic shallow lake in the world with over 50 million inhabitants lake taihu watershed is one of the most densely populated areas in china wu et al 2018 and the lake is important for water supply agriculture aquaculture fisheries tourism and other economic activities qin et al 2007a unfortunately eutrophication and habs in the lake have been observed since 1980s guo 2007 the severest habs were recorded in 2007 during which a highly publicized drinking water crisis occurred and drinking water supply was cut off for 2 million inhabitants qin et al 2010 the government annually spent 10 billion cny 1 4 billion usd to prevent eutrophication and habs in lake taihu in the past decades qin et al 2019 a series of countermeasures such as wastewater treatment algae salvage sediment dredging and water diversion have been employed to reduce nutrient loadings and improve water quality of the lake after decadal investment and restoration nutrient concentrations in the lake water and habs occurrences have not significantly decreased as expected xu et al 2014 many studies have conducted to identify the causative factors of eutrophication building on extensive climatological biogeochemical and ecological monitoring huang et al 2019 li et al 2019 stone 2011 various external and internal nutrient sources have been blamed for the lake eutrophication and habs xu et al 2021 studies also give clues that warming climate along with favorable nutrient conditions are causing factors for habs of the lake deng et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 the seasonal variability of n p ratios in the lake is believed to be one of the major regulators of habs janssen et al 2017 xu et al 2010 and some latest studies found that the external nutrient loadings were less responsible for the seasonality of n p ratios compared to the internal process of sediment release wang et al 2019 however there is still a lack of studies considering the roles of groundwater bonne nutrients in n p ratio seasonality thereby delineating the coeffects of groundwater climatological and biogeochemical dynamics on the occurrence of eutrophication and habs in lake taihu in this study we hypothesize that climatological forcings i e precipitation and evaporation will primarily drive lgd dynamics in shallow lakes and further regulate nutrient states and habs in these lakes fig 1 to examine our hypothesis we perform intensive seasonal and inter annual lgd estimates by natural tracer of radon 222rn in lake taihu the correlations between lgd and precipitation evaporation are examined in the lake and validated against lgd versus climatological observations in other shallow lakes globally we further use this correlation with readily accessible historical climatological data to extrapolate lgd of lake taihu from 2007 to 2017 contemporary lgd nutrient loadings are estimated and discussed with decadal observations of nutrient states and habs we finally delineate how groundwater climatological and biogeochemical forcings jointly control eutrophication and habs our aim is to explore key mechanism on nutrient state shifts and habs occurrence in the shallow eutrophic lake and give a new vision on water quality protection and ecological restoration in shallow lakes worldwide 2 materials and methods

well mixed and steady lentic system radon has reached a state of dynamic equilibrium with radon inputs balanced by its losses burnett et al 2013 dimova and burnett 2011 generally 222rn can originate from lgd water sediment diffusion and radioactive input from its parent isotope 226ra in lake water but can be lost by atmospheric evasion and radioactive decay the equation of the 222rn mass balance model is expressed as dimova et al 2013 luo et al 2018 1 f l g d a f d i f f a i 226 r a λ 222 r n f a t m a i 222 r n λ 222 r n 0 f l g d f d i f f and f a t m bq m 2 d 1 are 222rn fluxes of lgd sediment diffusion and atmospheric evasion respectively λ 222 r n is the 222rn decay constant with the value of 0 186 d 1 i 226 r a and i 222 r n bq represent the inventories of 226ra and 222rn in the lake water body respectively and can be estimated based on the activity bq m 3 in lake water and water volume m3 which is calculated by water depth m multiplied by surface area a m2 additionally in the lake which connected to complicated fluvial network with large amount of surface runoff the influences of rivers should be specifically considered and the equation is modified to 2 f l g d a f d i

adjustable parameters which are 76 14 120 36 31 26 0 2631 0 1673 and 0 0270 respectively luo et al 2016 schubert et al 2012 t and s are assigned to be the average values of lake water temperature and salinity respectively κ m d 1 is the gas transfer velocity which is the key parameter to control the radon evasion fluxes and is influenced by the physical processes at water air interface such as turbulence kinematic viscosity of the water and the molecular diffusion coefficient of 222rn d m the empirical equation is written as hartman and hammond 1985 9 κ 0 45 w 10 1 6 s c 600 0 5 for w 3 6 m

listed in appendix i in supplementary materials the mean 222rn values in different water endmembers were taken as representative values seasonal runoffs and wind speeds were retrieved from the taihu basin authority of ministry of water resource jiang et al 2021 tortuosity of sediments is calculated based on density and water content of lakebed sediments sampled in different parts of the lake yang et al 2008 for 226ra production 12 8 bq kg 1 of 238u in sediments liu et al 2020 and 60 0 mg l 1 of suspended sediments zhou et al 2018 can produce the maximum amount of 0 8 bq m 3 226ra in the lake water when the secular equilibrium between 238u and 226ra is assumed data of precipitation and evaporation are obtained from the estimation of satellite data based on the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa and the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam respectively huffman et al 2007 martens et al 2017 2 5 uncertainty analyzes the uncertainty of the model mainly stems from measuring processes 222rn s t etc and observed data a w qriver etc used in the model the parameter values of sediments and suspending solids taken from the literature may also lead to errors but sediment diffusion and 226ra production are relatively low in this system table s2 2 therefore are expected to produce minor uncertainty on final results the average uncertainty of 222rn measurement is about 34 leading to the final uncertainty range of 23 9 35 2 in lgd estimates after the uncertainty propagation involved in eq 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 lgd estimates in lake taihu according to the results of basin wide campaigns of lake taihu during 2018 2021 222rn activities in groundwater are generally 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than those in surface water fig s2 1 securing 222rn applicability as effective groundwater tracer to estimate lgd in the lake 222rn activities in lake water present seasonal variation and spatial segmentation but generally the north and northeast areas show consistent high 222rn and the east area present low 222rn s2 in supplementary materials lake taihu can be generally regarded as a lentic system with insignificant vertical gradient in shallow setting and long residence time of hundred days which is two orders of magnitude longer than the half life of 222rn 3 8 days the net river inflow or outflow regimes could influence the establishment of radon mass balance model thus we regrouped the five sub basins into three segments l1 l3 considering their similar net inflow or outflow conditions table s2 1 l1 is highly influenced by water diversion project with almost equal inflow and outflow jiang et al 2021 yang et al 2008 l2 has a large net outflow while l3 has a large net inflow fig s1 1 the division is overall consistent with the observed the segmentations of 222rn distributions in the lake water in winter and summer seasons fig s2 2 thus we use this division to establish more reliable radon model considering the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological and hydrogeological regimes radon mass balance model was established to estimate lgd of each segment briefly l1 has the highest lgd rate among the three segments with a range of 9 4 3 0 51 8 13 1 mm d 1 lgd of the entire lake is larger in wet seasons than dry seasons with values of 22 4 7 2 mm d 1 5 2 107 m3 d 1 and 41 6 10 4 mm d 1 9 7 107 m3 d 1 in spring and summer respectively and 10 2 2 5 mm d 1 2 4 107 m3 d 1 and 5 4 1 7 mm d 1 1 3 107 m3 d 1 in autumn and winter respectively table s2 2 by ensuring the water budget of the lake we found lgd is 34 1 67 1 of the total water inflow table s2 3 suggesting that lgd is significant in local hydrologic cycling and can be a potential conveyor between land and lake water 3 2 evaporation as the primary driving force of shallow lake lgd due to the limited topographic and hydrogeological control around lake taihu seasonal variations of lgd can be more likely a result of hydro meteorological dynamics we compared the lgd in each segment with the corresponding precipitation and evaporation fig 3 a and found that lgd is highly correlated with evaporation r 0 80 p 0 01 but uncoupled with precipitation r 0 03 thus evaporation rather than precipitation is regarded as the primary driving force for lgd in the lake this finding is physically reasonable local rainwater can cause a prompt response of surface water level fig s3 1 but undergoes infiltration and horizontal subsurface flow before it finally enters the lake via lgd and the low relief settings and high permeability of the fluvial and lacustrine sediments cause a much longer residence time of groundwater and the further uncoupling between precipitation and lgd while lake taihu is a well mixed shallow lake and tends to have high evaporation rates due to high availability of thermal energy finch and calver 2008 the rapid water loss by evaporation should be promptly balanced by river runoff and lgd however river inflow a type of point water source is unable to balance the evaporative water loss as indicated by the uncoupling between net river inflow rates versus evaporation rates fig s3 2 comparably lgd is a continuous and ubiquitous water pathway and can rapidly compensate for the evaporative water loss in the lake leading to the observed significantly positive correlation between lgd and evaporation thus evaporation is believed to be the primary driving force for the lgd variability in this large shallow lake lgd highly driven by evaporation is a global phenomenon we compiled lgd and evaporation of global shallow lakes 5 m in depth from previous studies fig 3b to minimize the methodological biases 41 lakes with lgd estimated by geo tracer models similar to this study are finally screened these shallow lakes have surface area from 3 4 103 to 4 4 109 m2 and lgd ranging from 0 1 to 240 mm d 1 appendix iii in supplementary materials we further retrieved the evaporation data of these shallow lakes by gleam and data at the concurrent time with lgd estimates were collected despite differences in topography hydrogeology climate and lake geometry we found that lgd exhibits overall linear correlation with evaporation r 0 4 ɑ 0 05 p 0 0001 fig 3c although the complied lgd may not be inclusive the overall positive correlation between lgd and evaporation still indicates that evaporation could be a major driving force of lgd in shallow lakes globally therefore we conclude that evaporation is a determinant factor of lgd in shallow lakes from both local and global perspective 3 3 groundwater as a substantial regulator of lake water n p ratios the major forms of n and p in groundwater around lake taihu are din and srp respectively chen et al 2010 thus we consider that lgd mainly loads din and srp which further get involved in the biogeochemical processes of n and p in the lake as shown in fig 4 din and srp in groundwater are 1 2 magnitudes higher than surface water fig 4a and nutrient concentrations and n p ratios of all the water endmembers exhibit seasonal fluctuations fig 4b similar to previous study wang et al 2019 lake water is observed to be p limited n p 16 in spring and winter but in summer and autumn the ratios approach near to and even over 16 1 transferring to n limited n p 16 groundwater is found to be p limited in winter and spring and some of them are significantly above the 16 1 line and manifested as n limited in summer and autumn which is overall in line with that in lake water while river water of different seasons is mostly p limited to verify the impact of lgd nutrient loadings on lake nutrient states we calculated nutrient inputs from lgd and river runoff by multiplying mean nutrient concentrations by water flow rates and the results of din loading are 1 1 108 kg yr 1 and 1 4 107 kg yr 1 and srp loading are 3 9 106 kg yr 1 and 5 0 105 kg yr 1 for lgd and river runoff respectively table s4 1 lgd nutrient loadings of din and srp are annually 7 7 and 7 9 times of riverine loadings respectively by adapting the nutrient sources sinks and retentions from 2005 to 2018 in previous study xu et al 2021 we updated the nutrient budget in lake taihu by considering groundwater borne nutrients results show that lgd nutrient loadings predominantly account for 68 2 of external n loadings and 63 2 of external p loadings table s4 2 the significantly high lgd nutrient loadings substantially regulate n p ratios in lake water making the ratio values similar to those of groundwater habs commonly occur in summer and autumn with adequate p in lake water paerl et al 2011 and the large amount of lgd with low n p ratios of groundwater borne din and srp defined as lgd n p ratios hereafter is considered to be responsible for the p supply the finding implicates that dynamics of nutrient states and habs should be tightly relative to fluctuations of lgd nutrient loadings 3 4 the extrapolated decadal lgd and its regulations on nutrient state and habs we have illustrated evaporation to be the major driving force of lgd dynamic in this large shallow lake the obtained significantly good correlation y 0 39x 6 40 r 0 92 insert of fig 3a between evaporation and lgd in the entire lake area during 2018 2021 allows us to extrapolate decadal lgd 2007 2017 with readily accessible evaporation data the radon estimated lgd and extrapolated lgd are presented in fig 5 a lgd exhibits almost identical temporal variation to that of evaporation and significant high lgd is observed during the wet seasons spring and summer compared to the dry seasons autumn and winter the loadings and ratios of groundwater borne din and srp in the past decade are calculated based on lgd rates and the mean nutrient concentrations in groundwater of each season peaks of lgd nutrient loadings generally occur in late spring and autumn lgd din loadings increase to the peak value of about 9 4 105 kg d 1 0 4 g m 2 d 1 in late spring and much smaller peak with the value around 4 7 105 kg d 1 0 2 g m 2 d 1 in autumn and lgd srp loadings exhibit two peaks of very similar values of around 4 7 104 kg d 1 0 02 g m 2 d 1 in late spring and autumn by contrast in summer lgd din and srp loadings decrease to 1 9 105 kg d 1 0 08 g m 2 d 1 and 2 3 104 kg d 1 0 01 g m 2 d 1 respectively and the loadings are even lower in winter fig 5b significantly high lgd n p ratios are mostly observed in spring and winter n p 23 8 41 2 1 compared to those in summer and autumn n p 10 5 11 5 1 fig 5c we compared the extrapolated lgd nutrient loadings and n p ratios with lake nutrient concentrations and n p ratios of the past decade 2007 2016 wang et al 2019 and found relevant temporal variations between lgd nutrient loadings and lake nutrient states with months of time lag fig 5b and c we also present habs areas of lake taihu from 2007 to 2015 yang et al 2016 fig 5d and lgd nutrient loadings are generally high as habs areas approach to the peaks while lgd n p ratios exhibit exactly opposite temporal distribution high lgd nutrient loadings with low lgd n p ratios or adequate p supply are found to be responsible for the high intensity of habs while low lgd nutrients loadings with high lgd n p ratios or insufficient p supply account for the depression periods of habs meanwhile lake nutrient concentrations and n p ratios present an overall lag compared to the fluctuation of habs areas the peaks of lgd nutrient loadings in spring are ascribed to the enhanced nutrient concentrations in groundwater increasing lgd nutrient loadings and decreasing lgd n p ratios in spring directly contribute to algal proliferation fig 5b d the moderate lgd n p ratios provide excess din but relatively limited srp to fuel the algae as a consequence of algal consumption din preserved in lake increases slowly and srp decreases thereby lake n p ratios are increased in the spring lgd in the summer is highest among four seasons but nutrient concentrations of groundwater are much declined leading to a slightly decrease of lgd nutrient loadings in summer fig 5b lgd n p ratios n p 10 5 11 5 1 is low in summer and the continuous groundwater borne nutrients input with adequate p trigger and intensify habs causing large nutrient consumption and reduction in lake till autumn during the period nutrient consumptions mitigate as the ease of habs thus lgd nutrient loading are gradually accumulated and preserved in lake water and lake n p ratios decrease to the similar ranges of lgd n p ratios with 2 3 months time lagged behind fig 5c in winter lgd decreases significantly and high lgd n p ratios n p 23 8 41 2 1 with limited p supply further depress habs intensity consistent algal mortality minimizes consumptions of groundwater borne nutrients hence groundwater borne nutrient are well persevered and accumulated and high lgd n p ratios are promptly manifested in lake n p ratios without observable time lag fig 5c to our best knowledge such time lag between lgd nutrient loadings and lake nutrient state in this study has not been observed elsewhere probably due to difficulties in obtaining long term time series of lgd and the derived nutrient loadings the time lag between nutrient states and habs however has been observed in other aquatic environments i e habs were believed to be initiated by fore enhancement of high nutrient loadings delivered by river runoff and submarine groundwater discharge glibert et al 2008 hu et al 2006 laroche et al 1997 the limitation of the current study mainly lies in the extrapolation only four sampling campaigns were conducted in four seasons spanning 3 5 years there may exist seasonal and annual changes in lgd and lgd nutrient loadings however lake taihu undergoes very regular seasonal and inter annual variability in hydrological limnollogical and biogeochemical conditions fig s3 1 jiang et al 2021 yang et al 2016 nutrient state in lake water also present regular patterns across years fig 5 wang et al 2019 therefore it is reasonable to assume much regular seasonality of lgd and lgd nutrient loadings to put forward the extrapolation 3 5 conceptual model on lgd dynamics and the regulation on nutrient states and habs in shallow lakes a conceptual model is built to delineate the mechanism of evaporation driven lgd dynamics in regulating the nutrient state and habs in shallow lakes fig 6 the model consists of three sub components namely physical biogeochemical and ecological units the physical process couples the lake evaporation and lgd evaporation is illustrated to be the primary driving force of lgd dynamics in shallow lakes with flat topographic conditions and simple hydrogeological settings fig 6a high evaporation in wet seasons leads to large lgd and vice versa for low evaporation in dry seasons this seasonal oscillation of lgd modulates lgd nutrient loadings biogeochemical processes encapsulate lgd nutrient loadings into nutrient budgets of the lake nutrient sources in the lake can be dominated by lgd nutrient loadings with additional loadings from riverine input sedimentary fluxes etc fig 6b nutrient sinks in the lake are dominated by retention processes i e preservation in lake and sedimentary burials physical process of lgd bridges the biogeochemical and ecological processes by lgd nutrient loadings and n p ratios which immediately impact the habs dynamics and modulate the lake water n p ratios fig 6c nutrients in the lake accumulate with the increasing lgd since spring and the warming temperature sustains the growth of algae during wet and hot summer adequate lgd borne p much lower lgd n p ratios and favorable temperature expand habs areas in the lake after the summer algal blooming insufficient groundwater borne nutrients especially for p and decline of water temperature accelerate algal mortality and lead to gradual shrinking of habs areas during the autumn along with the ease of habs less groundwater borne nutrients are consumed by algal growth consequently lgd nutrient loadings with lower n p ratios are readily preserved in the lake leading to the decrease of lake n p ratios with months of time lag relative to lgd n p ratios in the cold periods of winter and early spring lgd nutrient loadings especially p loadings cannot sufficiently fuel habs and the reductions of habs areas minimized nutrient consumption as a result lgd nutrient loadings and n p ratios can be preserved in the lake water as indicated by relatively high lgd and the lake n p ratios without time lag during early spring and winter seasons it is concluded that lgd is a significant pathway to provide continuous and ubiquitous external nutrient loadings and serve as the predominant nutrient source for regulating nutrient state and habs 4 conclusion and strategic planning in the future in this study we find lgd seasonality is predominately driven by evaporation fluctuations the corresponding variability of lgd nutrient loadings and the n p ratios are significant but less recognized factor to modulate nutrient state and regulate habs in shallows lakes the findings of our study based on the largest shallow eutrophic lake in china are probably applicable for lakes of similar settings elsewhere therefore it is advocated that the prevention of eutrophication and ecosystem restoration in large eutrophic lakes should seriously consider and manage the lgd derived nutrient loadings in the future this time lag of lake n p ratios related to groundwater n p ratio paves the possible way for early warning of abnormal nutrient state and eutrophication in the lake water by monitoring lakeshore groundwater nutrient states decreased lgd n p ratios and lgd srp loadings may simultaneously occur with intensified habs implying the possibility of diagnosing habs from the perspective of groundwater and climatic monitoring credit authorship contribution statement xiaoyan shi

15941,as global threats to freshwater lakes eutrophication and harmful algal blooms habs are governed by various biogeochemical climatological and anthropogenic processes groundwater is key to join these processes in regulating habs but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear here we leveraged basin wide field data of lake taihu china s largest eutrophic lake and global archives and demonstrate the dominance of evaporation on lacustrine groundwater discharge lgd in shallow lakes we extrapolated decadal lgd and the derived nutrient loadings and found that habs promptly consume ubiquitous groundwater borne nutrients leading lake water n p ratios 2 3 months time lagged behind lgd n p ratios we conclude that evaporation dominated lgd is an unraveled but crucial regulator of nutrient states and habs in shallow lakes which advocates synergistical studies from both climatological and hydrogeological perspective when restoring lake ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords evaporation lacustrine groundwater discharge large shallow lakes eutrophication algal blooms 1 introduction shallow lakes with a depth 5 m are the most common lake type globally downing et al 2006 verpoorter et al 2014 compared to deep and stratified lakes shallow lakes are generally more productive due to intensive transmission of solar energy and external nutrients wetzel 2001 and therefore are more vulnerable to nutrient states and harmful algal blooms habs ho et al 2019 qin et al 2020 nutrients in the forms of dissolved inorganic nitrogen dinno3 nh4 no2 and soluble reactive phosphate srp h3po4 h2po4 hpo4 2 po4 3 can commonly limit the autotrophic and heterotrophic productivity in the fresh aquatic environments harvey et al 2011 li et al 2017 nutrient state which can be reflected by nutrient concentration and ratio of nitrogen phosphorus n p ratio is the key to habs fig 1 oliver et al 2012 reynolds 2006 zou et al 2020 based on the algal ecology and redfield ratio c n p 106 16 1 n p ratios for habs proliferation can be defined as p limited when n p 16 and n limited when n p 16 redfield 1958 furthermore a number of factors are hypothesized to influence habs frequency in shallow lakes but climate change has emerged as one of the most important factor paerl and huisman 2009 winder 2012 previous studies have examined the synergistic effects of climatological factors and riverine nutrient supply on habs in lakes ho and michalak 2019 michalak et al 2013 on the one hand warming temperature and light harvesting stimulate the growth of harmful algae relative to other species and exacerbate habs pathway 1 in fig 1 carey et al 2012 on the other hand changing climatic conditions could alter nutrient loadings in lacustrine systems high temperature and intensive mixing processes increase internal nutrient loadings by increasing nutrient release from sediment diffusion and resuspension pathway 2 in fig 1 matisoff et al 2016 qin et al 2004 meanwhile enhanced precipitation increases the runoff to bring more riverine nutrient loadings to lakes or to accelerate nutrient attenuations in lakes by fast flushing velocities pathway 3 in fig 1 reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 sinha and michalak 2016 the tight interplays among climatological forcings hydrological regimes and water quality of inland water bodies have been gradually recognized michalak 2016 as one of the essential components of hydrologic cycles groundwater is expected to be crucial in regulating habs in the aquatic systems studies focused on coastal groundwater have demonstrated the predominant role of groundwater borne nutrients in causing eutrophication and triggering habs hu et al 2006 laroche et al 1997 luo and jiao 2016 lacustrine groundwater discharge lgd refers to groundwater flowing to a lake and is a significant conveyor of external chemical loadings to lakes posing profound effects on the lake water quality and ecosystem sustainability lewandowski et al 2015 groundwater can be highly enriched in nutrients due to mineralization of natural organic matters and additional anthropogenic sources fertilizer manure or sewage lewandowski et al 2015 nutrient enriched groundwater enables lgd to deliver large nutrient loadings knights et al 2017 previous studies also have found that the lgd derived nutrient loadings defined as lgd nutrient loadings exhibit high spatial heterogeneity by a range of one order of magnitude which is responsible for the hotspots of eutrophic states and algal biomasses within the same lake hagerthey and kerfoot 1998 sun et al 2021 moreover the substantial p supply from lgd alters n p ratios and regulates algal proliferation in lakes hagerthey and kerfoot 1998 meinikmann et al 2015 when exceeding the thresholds of ecological resilience of lakes groundwater borne nutrients are expected to raise eutrophication and trigger habs in lakes ommen et al 2012 but the underlying mechanisms on the synergistic controls of nutrient states and habs from a combined viewpoint of climatology hydrology and biogeochemistry are unclear fig 1 descy et al 2016 the dynamic of lgd is highly dependent on various topographical hydrogeological and climatological parameters rosenberry et al 2015 hence it is always difficult to straightforwardly quantify lgd with these complicated parameters shallow lakes characterized by flat topographical and simple hydrogeological settings may be under minor controls of near shore hydraulic gradients induced by differences of altitude salinity heat etc burnett et al 2003 rosenberry et al 2015 in addition groundwater flow regimes in the lakeshore aquifers are always sensitive to dynamics of precipitation and evapotranspiration rosenberry and winter 1997 and climatological forcings are more likely to dominate lgd in shallow lakes temporal variability of lgd could further lead to seasonality of lgd nutrient loadings which potentially cause nutrient state shifts and habs in these lakes wang et al 2012 however the examination of the direct interplay between climatic forcings and lgd is greatly inhibited due to the difficulty in obtaining long term lgd data tristram et al 2015 comparatively climatological parameters of precipitation and evaporation are mostly readily accessible baldocchi et al 2001 huffman et al 2007 martens et al 2017 thus lgd can be effectively extrapolated if the reliable correlation between climatological parameters and lgd is established thereafter the biogeochemical and ecological significance of lgd under climatic forcings can be explored as well pathway 4 in fig 1 lake taihu is a famous eutrophic shallow lake in the world with over 50 million inhabitants lake taihu watershed is one of the most densely populated areas in china wu et al 2018 and the lake is important for water supply agriculture aquaculture fisheries tourism and other economic activities qin et al 2007a unfortunately eutrophication and habs in the lake have been observed since 1980s guo 2007 the severest habs were recorded in 2007 during which a highly publicized drinking water crisis occurred and drinking water supply was cut off for 2 million inhabitants qin et al 2010 the government annually spent 10 billion cny 1 4 billion usd to prevent eutrophication and habs in lake taihu in the past decades qin et al 2019 a series of countermeasures such as wastewater treatment algae salvage sediment dredging and water diversion have been employed to reduce nutrient loadings and improve water quality of the lake after decadal investment and restoration nutrient concentrations in the lake water and habs occurrences have not significantly decreased as expected xu et al 2014 many studies have conducted to identify the causative factors of eutrophication building on extensive climatological biogeochemical and ecological monitoring huang et al 2019 li et al 2019 stone 2011 various external and internal nutrient sources have been blamed for the lake eutrophication and habs xu et al 2021 studies also give clues that warming climate along with favorable nutrient conditions are causing factors for habs of the lake deng et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 the seasonal variability of n p ratios in the lake is believed to be one of the major regulators of habs janssen et al 2017 xu et al 2010 and some latest studies found that the external nutrient loadings were less responsible for the seasonality of n p ratios compared to the internal process of sediment release wang et al 2019 however there is still a lack of studies considering the roles of groundwater bonne nutrients in n p ratio seasonality thereby delineating the coeffects of groundwater climatological and biogeochemical dynamics on the occurrence of eutrophication and habs in lake taihu in this study we hypothesize that climatological forcings i e precipitation and evaporation will primarily drive lgd dynamics in shallow lakes and further regulate nutrient states and habs in these lakes fig 1 to examine our hypothesis we perform intensive seasonal and inter annual lgd estimates by natural tracer of radon 222rn in lake taihu the correlations between lgd and precipitation evaporation are examined in the lake and validated against lgd versus climatological observations in other shallow lakes globally we further use this correlation with readily accessible historical climatological data to extrapolate lgd of lake taihu from 2007 to 2017 contemporary lgd nutrient loadings are estimated and discussed with decadal observations of nutrient states and habs we finally delineate how groundwater climatological and biogeochemical forcings jointly control eutrophication and habs our aim is to explore key mechanism on nutrient state shifts and habs occurrence in the shallow eutrophic lake and give a new vision on water quality protection and ecological restoration in shallow lakes worldwide 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description lake taihu surface area 2338 1 km2 mean and maximum depths 1 9 m and 3 3 m lies in yangtze river delta fig 2 a the lake basin is a vast flat plain with a small elevation range of

180 309 days yang et al 2018 hundreds of rivers streams and channels are connected to the lake while the major inflow and outflow rivers are located in the west and southeast of the lake respectively and contribute 90 of water to total inflow and outflow qin et al 2007b quaternary aquifer aquitard systems composed by organic matter enriched fluvial and lacustrine deposits are well developed around

fig 2b lake water samples were taken from the depth of 0 5 m and river water samples were taken from the same depth below the water surface near the riverbank of the major rivers these major rivers account for 70 80 of the annual river inflow and outflow of the lake table s1 1 most groundwater samples were collected from shallow aquifers from private wells within the depth of 10 m for each site

hong kong 2 3 radon mass balance model radon mass balance model is an effective and widely used approach to quantify lgd burnett et al 2013 dimova et al 2013 luo et al 2018 the model assumes that in a well mixed and steady lentic system radon has reached a state of dynamic equilibrium with radon inputs balanced by its losses burnett et al 2013 dimova and burnett 2011 generally 222rn can originate from lgd water sediment diffusion and radioactive input from its parent isotope 226ra in lake water but can be lost by atmospheric evasion and radioactive decay the equation of the 222rn mass balance model is expressed as dimova et al 2013 luo et al 2018 1 f l g d a f d i f f a i 226 r a λ 222 r n f a t m a i 222 r n λ 222 r n 0 f l g d f d i f f and f a t m bq m 2 d 1 are 222rn fluxes of lgd sediment diffusion and atmospheric evasion respectively λ 222 r n is the 222rn decay constant with the value of 0 186 d 1 i 226 r a and i 222 r n bq represent the inventories of 226ra and 222rn in the lake water body respectively and can be estimated based on the activity bq m 3 in lake water and water volume m3 which is calculated by water depth m multiplied by surface area a m2 additionally in the lake which connected to complicated fluvial network with large amount of surface runoff the influences of rivers should be specifically considered and the equation is modified to 2 f l g d a f d i f f a i n r i v e r i 226 r a λ 222 r n f a t m a i 222 r n λ 222 r n 0 i n r i v e r is the 222rn input from rivers and can be calculated by i n r i v e r 222 r n r i v e r q r i v e r where 222 r n r i v e r is the 222rn activity bq m 3 in the river water and q r i v e r is the net river flow rate m3 d 1 with the obtained 222rn sources and losses in eq 2 the unknown f l g d can be solved and lgd can be finally estimated by dividing f l g d with the representative 222rn activity in the groundwater 222 r n g w bq m 3 f d i f f occurs at the water sediment interface and is an important radon source it is a function of the porosity of lakebed sediment and the temperature of overlaying water and can be expressed by the following equations boudreau 1996 dimova and burnett 2011 lee et al 2012

2016 schubert et al 2012 7 f a t m κ 222 r n l a k e α 222 r n a i r 222 r n a i r is radon activity in the air and the default value is 18 5 bq m 3 dimensionless α is ostwald s solubility coefficient which is temperature t k and salinity s psu dependent and can be expressed as 8 ln α a 1 a 2 100 t a 3 ln t 100 s b 1 b 2 t 100 b 3 t 100 2 where a 1 to a 3 and b 1 to b 3 refer to six non dimensional adjustable parameters which are 76 14 120 36 31 26 0 2631 0 1673 and 0 0270 respectively luo et al 2016 schubert et al 2012 t and s are assigned to be the average values of lake water temperature and salinity respectively κ m d 1 is the gas transfer velocity which is the key parameter to control the radon evasion fluxes and is influenced by the physical processes at water air interface such as turbulence kinematic viscosity of the water and the molecular diffusion coefficient of 222rn d m the empirical equation is written as hartman and hammond 1985 9 κ 0 45 w 10 1 6 s c 600 0 5 for w 3 6 m s 1 0 45 w 10 1 6 s c 600 0 6667 for w 3 6 m s 1 where w 10 m s 1 is wind speed at 10 m above the water surface and s c is dimensionless schmidt number wind speed w m s 1 is the major cause of turbulence at the water surface and w 10 can be estimated by the equation dimova and burnett 2011 10 w 10 w z a ln z 10 1 where w z m s 1 is wind speed of measured height z m and a is a constant with the value of 0 097 s c constrains the influence of kinematic viscosity and the molecular diffusion coefficient and can be expressed as 11 s c v d m μ ρ d m where d m m2 d 1 is the molecular diffusion coefficient which is defined as eq 6 and v m2 d 1 is the kinematic viscosity which equals the ratio of absolute viscosity μ kg m 1 d 1 to water density ρ kg m 3 at specific temperature for fresh water

listed in appendix i in supplementary materials the mean 222rn values in different water endmembers were taken as representative values seasonal runoffs and wind speeds were retrieved from the taihu basin authority of ministry of water resource jiang et al 2021 tortuosity of sediments is calculated based on density and water content of lakebed sediments sampled in different parts of the lake yang et al 2008 for 226ra production 12 8 bq kg 1 of 238u in sediments liu et al 2020 and 60 0 mg l 1 of suspended sediments zhou et al 2018 can produce the maximum amount of 0 8 bq m 3 226ra in the lake water when the secular equilibrium between 238u and 226ra is assumed data of precipitation and evaporation are obtained from the estimation of satellite data based on the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa and the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam respectively huffman et al 2007 martens et al 2017 2 5 uncertainty analyzes the uncertainty of the model mainly stems from measuring processes 222rn s t etc and observed data a w qriver etc used in the model the parameter values of sediments and suspending solids taken from the literature may also lead to errors but sediment diffusion and 226ra production are relatively low in this system table s2 2 therefore are expected to produce minor uncertainty on final results the average uncertainty of 222rn measurement is about 34 leading to the final uncertainty range of 23 9 35 2 in lgd estimates after the uncertainty propagation involved in eq 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 lgd estimates in lake taihu according to the results of basin wide campaigns of lake taihu during 2018 2021 222rn activities in groundwater are generally 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than those in surface water fig s2 1 securing 222rn applicability as effective groundwater tracer to estimate lgd in the lake 222rn activities in lake water present seasonal variation and spatial segmentation but generally the north and northeast areas show consistent high 222rn and the east area present low 222rn s2 in supplementary materials lake taihu can be generally regarded as a lentic system with insignificant vertical gradient in shallow setting and long residence time of hundred days which is two orders of magnitude longer than the half life of 222rn 3 8 days the net river inflow or outflow regimes could influence the establishment of radon mass balance model thus we regrouped the five sub basins into three segments l1 l3 considering their similar net inflow or outflow conditions table s2 1 l1 is highly influenced by water diversion project with almost equal inflow and outflow jiang et al 2021 yang et al 2008 l2 has a large net outflow while l3 has a large net inflow fig s1 1 the division is overall consistent with the observed the segmentations of 222rn distributions in the lake water in winter and summer seasons fig s2 2 thus we use this division to establish more reliable radon model considering the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological and hydrogeological regimes radon mass balance model was established to estimate lgd of each segment briefly l1 has the highest lgd rate among the three segments with a range of 9 4 3 0 51 8 13 1 mm d 1 lgd of the entire lake is larger in wet seasons than dry seasons with values of 22 4 7 2 mm d 1 5 2 107 m3 d 1 and 41 6 10 4 mm d 1 9 7 107 m3 d 1 in spring and summer respectively and 10 2 2 5 mm d 1 2 4 107 m3 d 1 and 5 4 1 7 mm d 1 1 3 107 m3 d 1 in autumn and winter respectively table s2 2 by ensuring the water budget of the lake we found lgd is 34 1 67 1 of the total water inflow table s2 3 suggesting that lgd is significant in local hydrologic cycling and can be a potential conveyor between land and lake water 3 2 evaporation as the primary driving force of shallow lake lgd due to the limited topographic and hydrogeological control around lake taihu seasonal variations of lgd can be more likely a result of hydro meteorological dynamics we compared the lgd in each segment with the corresponding precipitation and evaporation fig 3 a and found that lgd is highly correlated with evaporation r 0 80 p 0 01 but uncoupled with precipitation r 0 03 thus evaporation rather than precipitation is regarded as the primary driving force for lgd in the lake this finding is physically reasonable local rainwater can cause a prompt response of surface water level fig s3 1 but undergoes infiltration and horizontal subsurface flow before it finally enters the lake via lgd and the low relief settings and high permeability of the fluvial and lacustrine sediments cause a much longer residence time of groundwater and the further uncoupling between precipitation and lgd while lake taihu is a well mixed shallow lake and tends to have high evaporation rates due to high availability of thermal energy finch and calver 2008 the rapid water loss by evaporation should be promptly balanced by river runoff and lgd however river inflow a type of point water source is unable to balance the evaporative water loss as indicated by the uncoupling between net river inflow rates versus evaporation rates fig s3 2 comparably lgd is a continuous and ubiquitous water pathway and can rapidly compensate for the evaporative water loss in the lake leading to the observed significantly positive correlation between lgd and evaporation thus evaporation is believed to be the primary driving force for the lgd variability in this large shallow lake lgd highly driven by evaporation is a global phenomenon we compiled lgd and evaporation of global shallow lakes 5 m in depth from previous studies fig 3b to minimize the methodological biases 41 lakes with lgd estimated by geo tracer models similar to this study are finally screened these shallow lakes have surface area from 3 4 103 to 4 4 109 m2 and lgd ranging from 0 1 to 240 mm d 1 appendix iii in supplementary materials we further retrieved the evaporation data of these shallow lakes by gleam and data at the concurrent time with lgd estimates were collected despite differences in topography hydrogeology climate and lake geometry we found that lgd exhibits overall linear correlation with evaporation r 0 4 ɑ 0 05 p 0 0001 fig 3c although the complied lgd may not be inclusive the overall positive correlation between lgd and evaporation still indicates that evaporation could be a major driving force of lgd in shallow lakes globally therefore we conclude that evaporation is a determinant factor of lgd in shallow lakes from both local and global perspective 3 3 groundwater as a substantial regulator of lake water n p ratios the major forms of n and p in groundwater around lake taihu are din and srp respectively chen et al 2010 thus we consider that lgd mainly loads din and srp which further get involved in the biogeochemical processes of n and p in the lake as shown in fig 4 din and srp in groundwater are 1 2 magnitudes higher than surface water fig 4a and nutrient concentrations and n p ratios of all the water endmembers exhibit seasonal fluctuations fig 4b similar to previous study wang et al 2019 lake water is observed to be p limited n p 16 in spring and winter but in summer and autumn the ratios approach near to and even over 16 1 transferring to n limited n p 16 groundwater is found to be p limited in winter and spring and some of them are significantly above the 16 1 line and manifested as n limited in summer and autumn which is overall in line with that in lake water while river water of different seasons is mostly p limited to verify the impact of lgd nutrient loadings on lake nutrient states we calculated nutrient inputs from lgd and river runoff by multiplying mean nutrient concentrations by water flow rates and the results of din loading are 1 1 108 kg yr 1 and 1 4 107 kg yr 1 and srp loading are 3 9 106 kg yr 1 and 5 0 105 kg yr 1 for lgd and river runoff respectively table s4 1 lgd nutrient loadings of din and srp are annually 7 7 and 7 9 times of riverine loadings respectively by adapting the nutrient sources sinks and retentions from 2005 to 2018 in previous study xu et al 2021 we updated the nutrient budget in lake taihu by considering groundwater borne nutrients results show that lgd nutrient loadings predominantly account for 68 2 of external n loadings and 63 2 of external p loadings table s4 2 the significantly high lgd nutrient loadings substantially regulate n p ratios in lake water making the ratio values similar to those of groundwater habs commonly occur in summer and autumn with adequate p in lake water paerl et al 2011 and the large amount of lgd with low n p ratios of groundwater borne din and srp defined as lgd n p ratios hereafter is considered to be responsible for the p supply the finding implicates that dynamics of nutrient states and habs should be tightly relative to fluctuations of lgd nutrient loadings 3 4 the extrapolated decadal lgd and its regulations on nutrient state and habs we have illustrated evaporation to be the major driving force of lgd dynamic in this large shallow lake the obtained significantly good correlation y 0 39x 6 40 r 0 92 insert of fig 3a between evaporation and lgd in the entire lake area during 2018 2021 allows us to extrapolate decadal lgd 2007 2017 with readily accessible evaporation data the radon estimated lgd and extrapolated lgd are presented in fig 5 a lgd exhibits almost identical temporal variation to that of evaporation and significant high lgd is observed during the wet seasons spring and summer compared to the dry seasons autumn and winter the loadings and ratios of groundwater borne din and srp in the past decade are calculated based on lgd rates and the mean nutrient concentrations in groundwater of each season peaks of lgd nutrient loadings generally occur in late spring and autumn lgd din loadings increase to the peak value of about 9 4 105 kg d 1 0 4 g m 2 d 1 in late spring and much smaller peak with the value around 4 7 105 kg d 1 0 2 g m 2 d 1 in autumn and lgd srp loadings exhibit two peaks of very similar values of around 4 7 104 kg d 1 0 02 g m 2 d 1 in late spring and autumn by contrast in summer lgd din and srp loadings decrease to 1 9 105 kg d 1 0 08 g m 2 d 1 and 2 3 104 kg d 1 0 01 g m 2 d 1 respectively and the loadings are even lower in winter fig 5b significantly high lgd n p ratios are mostly observed in spring and winter n p 23 8 41 2 1 compared to those in summer and autumn n p 10 5 11 5 1 fig 5c we compared the extrapolated lgd nutrient loadings and n p ratios with lake nutrient concentrations and n p ratios of the past decade 2007 2016 wang et al 2019 and found relevant temporal variations between lgd nutrient loadings and lake nutrient states with months of time lag fig 5b and c we also present habs areas of lake taihu from 2007 to 2015 yang et al 2016 fig 5d and lgd nutrient loadings are generally high as habs areas approach to the peaks while lgd n p ratios exhibit exactly opposite temporal distribution high lgd nutrient loadings with low lgd n p ratios or adequate p supply are found to be responsible for the high intensity of habs while low lgd nutrients loadings with high lgd n p ratios or insufficient p supply account for the depression periods of habs meanwhile lake nutrient concentrations and n p ratios present an overall lag compared to the fluctuation of habs areas the peaks of lgd nutrient loadings in spring are ascribed to the enhanced nutrient concentrations in groundwater increasing lgd nutrient loadings and decreasing lgd n p ratios in spring directly contribute to algal proliferation fig 5b d the moderate lgd n p ratios provide excess din but relatively limited srp to fuel the algae as a consequence of algal consumption din preserved in lake increases slowly and srp decreases thereby lake n p ratios are increased in the spring lgd in the summer is highest among four seasons but nutrient concentrations of groundwater are much declined leading to a slightly decrease of lgd nutrient loadings in summer fig 5b lgd n p ratios n p 10 5 11 5 1 is low in summer and the continuous groundwater borne nutrients input with adequate p trigger and intensify habs causing large nutrient consumption and reduction in lake till autumn during the period nutrient consumptions mitigate as the ease of habs thus lgd nutrient loading are gradually accumulated and preserved in lake water and lake n p ratios decrease to the similar ranges of lgd n p ratios with 2 3 months time lagged behind fig 5c in winter lgd decreases significantly and high lgd n p ratios n p 23 8 41 2 1 with limited p supply further depress habs intensity consistent algal mortality minimizes consumptions of groundwater borne nutrients hence groundwater borne nutrient are well persevered and accumulated and high lgd n p ratios are promptly manifested in lake n p ratios without observable time lag fig 5c to our best knowledge such time lag between lgd nutrient loadings and lake nutrient state in this study has not been observed elsewhere probably due to difficulties in obtaining long term time series of lgd and the derived nutrient loadings the time lag between nutrient states and habs however has been observed in other aquatic environments i e habs were believed to be initiated by fore enhancement of high nutrient loadings delivered by river runoff and submarine groundwater discharge glibert et al 2008 hu et al 2006 laroche et al 1997 the limitation of the current study mainly lies in the extrapolation only four sampling campaigns were conducted in four seasons spanning 3 5 years there may exist seasonal and annual changes in lgd and lgd nutrient loadings however lake taihu undergoes very regular seasonal and inter annual variability in hydrological limnollogical and biogeochemical conditions fig s3 1 jiang et al 2021 yang et al 2016 nutrient state in lake water also present regular patterns across years fig 5 wang et al 2019 therefore it is reasonable to assume much regular seasonality of lgd and lgd nutrient loadings to put forward the extrapolation 3 5 conceptual model on lgd dynamics and the regulation on nutrient states and habs in shallow lakes a conceptual model is built to delineate the mechanism of evaporation driven lgd dynamics in regulating the nutrient state and habs in shallow lakes fig 6 the model consists of three sub components namely physical biogeochemical and ecological units the physical process couples the lake evaporation and lgd evaporation is illustrated to be the primary driving force of lgd dynamics in shallow lakes with flat topographic conditions and simple hydrogeological settings fig 6a high evaporation in wet seasons leads to large lgd and vice versa for low evaporation in dry seasons this seasonal oscillation of lgd modulates lgd nutrient loadings biogeochemical processes encapsulate lgd nutrient loadings into nutrient budgets of the lake nutrient sources in the lake can be dominated by lgd nutrient loadings with additional loadings from riverine input sedimentary fluxes etc fig 6b nutrient sinks in the lake are dominated by retention processes i e preservation in lake and sedimentary burials physical process of lgd bridges the biogeochemical and ecological processes by lgd nutrient loadings and n p ratios which immediately impact the habs dynamics and modulate the lake water n p ratios fig 6c nutrients in the lake accumulate with the increasing lgd since spring and the warming temperature sustains the growth of algae during wet and hot summer adequate lgd borne p much lower lgd n p ratios and favorable temperature expand habs areas in the lake after the summer algal blooming insufficient groundwater borne nutrients especially for p and decline of water temperature accelerate algal mortality and lead to gradual shrinking of habs areas during the autumn along with the ease of habs less groundwater borne nutrients are consumed by algal growth consequently lgd nutrient loadings with lower n p ratios are readily preserved in the lake leading to the decrease of lake n p ratios with months of time lag relative to lgd n p ratios in the cold periods of winter and early spring lgd nutrient loadings especially p loadings cannot sufficiently fuel habs and the reductions of habs areas minimized nutrient consumption as a result lgd nutrient loadings and n p ratios can be preserved in the lake water as indicated by relatively high lgd and the lake n p ratios without time lag during early spring and winter seasons it is concluded that lgd is a significant pathway to provide continuous and ubiquitous external nutrient loadings and serve as the predominant nutrient source for regulating nutrient state and habs 4 conclusion and strategic planning in the future in this study we find lgd seasonality is predominately driven by evaporation fluctuations the corresponding variability of lgd nutrient loadings and the n p ratios are significant but less recognized factor to modulate nutrient state and regulate habs in shallows lakes the findings of our study based on the largest shallow eutrophic lake in china are probably applicable for lakes of similar settings elsewhere therefore it is advocated that the prevention of eutrophication and ecosystem restoration in large eutrophic lakes should seriously consider and manage the lgd derived nutrient loadings in the future this time lag of lake n p ratios related to groundwater n p ratio paves the possible way for early warning of abnormal nutrient state and eutrophication in the lake water by monitoring lakeshore groundwater nutrient states decreased lgd n p ratios and lgd srp loadings may simultaneously occur with intensified habs implying the possibility of diagnosing habs from the perspective of groundwater and climatic monitoring credit authorship contribution statement xiaoyan shi

just east of the rr individual sampling sites were selected based on the ability to subdivide watersheds into distinct land use areas that had adequate streamflow at bridge crossings and lack of interference from lake effects due to limited streamflow and small geographic size the lpr watershed was assigned a single sampling site draining a 13 km2 area the sc watershed had two sampling sites

pellet any unwanted debris and glass beads the supernatant 400 μl was then transferred to a clean 1 5 ml microcentrifuge tube for a 3 min centrifugation at 12 000 g the supernatant was then transferred to a final 1 5 ml microcentrifuge tube and analyzed by nanodrop thermofischer ma usa to confirm the presence and estimated concentration of total dna whenever possible sample dna was analyzed the same day as dna extraction with the exception of qa qc failed runs which were rerun within 24 hours to avoid any unnecessary degradation of the dna due to multiple freeze thaws each dna

well using the red rare event detection setting strict quality control measures were followed for all ddpcr assays each assay plate was analyzed with three wells of non template controls ntc molecular grade dnase free water filtration blanks for each batch of samples and three positive control wells for each assay target assay results were only considered for further analysis if 10 000 accepted droplets were achieved in each sample well and within each control well in addition any positive ntc wells were considered indicative of possible contamination of the reaction master mixture and all sample results from that plate were rejected and the samples rerun samples were only considered true positives if 3 droplets were positive above reaction threshold for positive negative distinction samples were considered as positive if at least one technical replicate 1 3 were found to be positive and close to the calculated detection limit of the assay 354 gene copies gc 100 ml 1 the detection limit was determined by calculating the gene copies gc 100 ml 1 for three positive droplets the minimum number of positive droplets required to call a well positive in a reaction well of 20 000 accepted droplets the theoretical maximum number of droplets formed during ddpcr the reaction threshold for determining positive and negative droplets was set as previously described by nshimyimana et al 2018 at one standard deviation above the ntc droplets 2 5 landscape data hourly precipitation time series were obtained at the closest noaa land based stations to each sampling location national

15 days and 30 days the cumulative precipitation totals for each location are presented in fig a1 in the supplementary materials land cover proportions for each sampling location s drainage area were obtained by processing the cropland data layer cdl 2017 usda nass 2017 for details and the national land cover database nlcd for the general land covers tillage practice information was obtained from a national survey completed by the usgs spanning 1989 to 2004 baker 2011 the estimated number and density of septic systems per watershed area and tile drainage s proportions were obtained from luscz et al 2015 2017 2 6 statistical analysis multiple methods were utilized to investigate instream variables e g temperature dissolved oxygen do ph conductivity streamflow non purgable organic carbon npoc tdn na k mg ca cl so4 turbidity nh4 no3 don srp and tp and landscape variables e g prior precipitation land use tile drainage septic tank numbers septic tank density and tillage to help explain the levels of bacterial indicators of fecal pollution i e mst markers and e coli found in the five watersheds bacterial markers were considered as the response variables in all analyses with the geometric means of the log10 transformed technical replicates of each being used for statistical analysis non detect nd replicates were included and assigned the assay s detection limit 2 55 log10 gc

package in r kuhn 2020 was retained six variables i e tdn so4 ca mg cl and srp were found to be collinear with other variables and were thus removed from the dataset 2 6 1 spatial clustering the clustering analysis consisted of an agglomerative bottom up hierarchical approach using standardized euclidean distances and the ward s minimum variance method followed by a single k means clustering iteration using up to 3 clusters from the hierarchical approach this analysis was performed to explicitly account for spatial variability using the hclust and kmeans functions in r core team 2019 to identify the main factors driving this variability clusters of sampling locations were determined using six different criteria e coli and mst marker concentrations streamflow land use tillage tile

tp raw data were box cox transformed using the boxcoxtrans function from the caret package in r prior to being used for clustering kuhn 2020 to evaluate the uncertainty in the clustering analysis we used a scoring scheme to quantify the probability of each sample being a member of the resulting clusters for this purpose we considered a gaussian mixture model gmm with fixed variance components as a probabilistic generalization of the k means method the scoring scheme we employed is based on the sample s degree of membership to each cluster used by the soft k means algorithm eq 1 represents the responsibility a gmm fixed variance component i e k mean cluster takes for each data point zhu et al 2021 1 s i k exp β z c k x i j exp β z c j x i where s i k is the score for the i th sample k refers to the cluster of interest z c j x i is the normalized euclidean distance between the j th cluster centroid c j and the i th sample x i and β is a stiffness parameter defined in this study as unity the scores were computed separately for the clustering results obtained for each of the six criteria sets mentioned above correlation analysis was performed using pearson correlation r analysis using graphpad prism 8 graphpad software ca usa to ascertain if any significant relationships existed between the three mst markers and nutrient species these analyses were conducted in two ways first by using data from all the sites and samples and secondly by using data from the various sampling site clustering configurations fig 4 we reported 95 confidence intervals for each correlation factor based on fisher s z transform in this approach the correlation factors are transformed using eq 2 and then the lower and upper confidence limits of the transformed values are computed assuming a normal distribution with variance 1 n 3 where n is the number of samples used to estimate the correlation factor see eq 3 the aforementioned limits are transformed back to the correlation scale using the inverse transformations presented in eq 4 2 z r 1 2 ln 1 r 1 r 3 z l u z r z 1 α 2 1 n 3 4 r l u exp 2 z l u 1 exp 2 z l u 1 where z r is the transformed correlation factor r z l u is the lower l and upper u transformed confidence limits r l u are the lower and upper confidence limits for r z is the standard z score and α is the confidence level 3 results 3 1 watershed summary five watersheds from smallest to largest lpr 14 km2 sc 82 km2 mac 292 km2 kaw 582 km2 rr 2 683 km2 were sampled over three seasons spring summer and fall selected highlights of important water quality variables collected during this study are presented here with more information provided in supplemental materials the land uses for each sampling site are described in supplemental table a1 a detailed land use classification was used for clustering and statistical analysis as described in the materials and methods the areas drained by each sampling site ranged from 8 16 lpr1 to 76 37 mac4 agricultural land use supplemental table a1 average streamflow for all sites ranged from 0 10 m3 s in the lpr to 8 95 m3 s in the rr supplemental table a2 the rr watershed saw the maximum recorded streamflow at 87 50 m3 s in march 2018 while both the kaw and mac watersheds had streamflows as low as 0 m3 s at multiple sites kaw1 kaw2 mac1 mac4 during june july and august 2017 sampling dates overall streamflow was lowest during the summer sampling of 2017 and the highest during the spring sampling in 2017 and 2018 septic tank densities varied between and within watersheds the watersheds lpr sc mac kaw and rr had septic tank density ranges of 14 46 7 53 to 20 79 9 10 to 17 14 6 20 to 19 39 and 6 87 to 23 85 septic tanks km2 respectively the proportion of land within each watershed with tile drains ranged from 0 at lpr1 up to 0 64 at rr3 with the mac and rr watersheds having the highest proportions of tile drains on average the proportion of tile drains in lpr sc mac kaw and rr were 0 0 22 0 30 0 19 and 0 26 respectively summaries of measured nutrients mst markers and physical water quality variables are provided in supplemental materials tables a2 a5 tp concentrations ranged from 14 77 to 111 24 µg l while tdn ranged from 0 66 to 4 90 mg l across sites e coli b theta cowm2 and pig2bac concentrations ranged from 0 30 to 4 30 log10 mpn 100 ml 2 71 to 2 83 log10 gc 100 ml 2 60 to 2 77 log10 gc 100 ml 2 96 to 3 23 log10 gc 100 ml respectively 3 2 spatial and temporal trends in bacterial markers and nutrients individual sample concentrations for the three mst markers and indicator organism e coli two nitrogen species and the two phosphorus species were plotted on heat maps to visualize spatial or temporal trends in each dataset figs 2 and 3 the mst markers primarily revealed temporal trends in their datasets while the nutrient species showed spatial trends and some temporal trends a few high valued data points were omitted from the scaling on the heatmaps to allow for greater visual resolution of spatial and temporal trends that would have otherwise been camouflaged by scaling the entire range of values a general temporal trend was seen for e coli in fig 2a with high concentrations during summer july 2017 and low concentrations in spring march 2018 across the most of sites the human marker also showed temporal trends with higher concentrations during the spring and early summer months i e april may june and july 2017 as well as march 2018 and lower concentrations in the late summer august 2017 fall november 2017 and stayed low in the spring may of 2018 fig 2b the bovine marker had higher concentrations in june and november 2017 with its lowest concentrations in july and august 2017 coinciding with the driest lowest levels of prior precipitation and streamflow period throughout the study fig 2c the porcine marker also showed higher concentrations between april july 2017 and may 2018 with lower concentrations during august november 2017 and march 2018 fig 2d spatial and temporal trends were seen for all nitrogen and phosphorus species fig 3 the tdn results showed a temporal trend with lower concentrations during june and august 2017 and higher concentrations in november 2017 and march 2018 fig 3a there were also spatial trends with sites such as rr5 rr7 lpr1 and kaw1 that consistently had low tdn concentrations across all sampling events ammonium showed a different spatial trend with mac3 having considerably higher nh4 n concentrations than all the other sites through time fig 3b there was also a spike in ammonium concentrations across all sites in all watersheds in july 2017 tdn had similar spatial and temporal trends as in the nitrate heatmap but with lower average concentrations of ammonium vs nitrate the phosphorus species showed a spatial trend with the highest concentrations found in the mac sites for all individual species but when examining total phosphorus tp fig 3c and d most of the rr sites excluding rr7 had high phosphorus levels fig 3 there were also some temporal trends in the phosphorus species with higher concentrations of tp found in august 2017 and march 2018 fig 3c 3 3 statistical analysis 3 3 1 cluster analysis the data from individual sites in each watershed were separated by cluster analysis to examine the similarities between watershed sites by six variables including e coli mst marker concentrations streamflow land use tillage tile drain proportion and septic tank density the final cluster analysis resulted in five clustering schemes with land use and tillage producing identical clusters fig 4 clustering sites based on streamflow resulted in three clusters 1 2 and 3 representing low medium and high flows concentrations from all four markers e coli and mst b theta cowm2 pig2bac and e coli had 1 2 and 3 clusters with concentration ranges of 0 99 4 72 0 30 4 08 1 33 5 87 log10 mpn gc 100 ml respectively when cluster analysis was performed using tile drain proportions only two clusters were identified representing 0 0 172 and 0 221 proportion tile drains clusters 1 and 2 landuse tillage resulted in three clusters with low 25 50 with no tillage medium 10 to 25 with no tillage and high 0 10 with no tillage tillage practices finally septic tank density split into three clusters representing sites with 11 11 15 and 17 septic tanks km2 respectively since there was more variability in the streamflow and markers data there are multiple samples per site while land use tile drain and septic tank density are fixed over time the clustering results are more uncertain using these variables streamflow and markers as criteria thus it is likely that a sample potentially belongs to two or more clusters at the same time when using time varying measurements as criteria according to the results confidence in the clustering results is higher for land use tile drain and septic tank density whereas is moderately uncertain for streamflow and markers table 2 3 3 2 correlation results the human and bovine markers showed no significant relationships with any of the seven nutrient species when all of the sites were analyzed together the porcine marker however showed statistically significant correlations with all four phosphorus species i e tfp frp trp tp and ammonium with r values ranging from 0 22 95 ci 0 05 0 37 p 0 0091 for frp to 0 48 95 ci 0 34 0 60 p 0 0001 for ammonium correlation analysis using the three streamflow clusters showed significant correlations between bovine and porcine markers with nutrient species fig 4 in streamflow cluster 1 low flow the porcine marker was correlated with tfp frp tp and nh4 with r values of 0 26 95 ci 0 04 0 46 p 0 0192 0 26 95 ci 0 03 0 45 p 0 0250 0 31 95 ci 0 09 0 50 p 0 0072 0 54 95 ci 0 36 0 68 p 0 0001 respectively in cluster 2 the bovine marker was correlated with nitrate and tdn with r values of 0 37 95 ci 0 02 0 64 p 0 0372 and 0 37 95 ci 0 02 0 64 p 0 0376 respectively in cluster 3 however the porcine marker was negatively correlated with tfp r 0 48 95 ci 0 74 0 10 p 0 0166 only the porcine marker showed significant relationships with nutrients when clustering by e coli mst markers or land use tillage sites were clustered into only two clusters when using land use tillage in the first land use tillage cluster there were no significant correlations between any of the mst markers and

spatial clustering relationships between microbial contaminants and nutrients which would otherwise be masked can be observed in individual mixed use watersheds with unique spatial and temporal trends while our results were in line with previous research where microbial contamination trends are mainly temporal in nature they were also able to determine significant correlations between source specific microbial markers and nutrients thus strengthening our understanding of these relationships lee et al 2014 sowah et al 2017 nshimyimana et al 2018 badgley et al 2019 mckee et al 2020 hinojosa et al 2020 these trends are likely associated with the timing of manure applications and microbial transport through the watersheds seen with increased rainfall and overland flows nutrients were spatially segregated based on land use and management practices such as tillage and tile drainage the mac watershed in particular showed high phosphorus levels at all four sites over the course of the sampling period the phosphorus pollution in the mac watershed is linked to agricultural non point sources of pollution steinman et al 2018 our results showed correlations between our porcine marker and nutrient species when using the data from the mac watershed sites in multiple clustering schemes these results suggest that at least a portion of the nutrients entering the mac watershed are associated with manure application practices these high levels of phosphorus are unsurprising as lake macatawa which the watershed drains into has been hypereutrophic for over 40 years mwp 2012 a tmdl of 50 ug l was set for tp in lake macatawa in 1999 by the usepa with best management practices bmps aimed at runoff abatement implemented since 2012 to help alleviate nutrient pollution walterhouse 1999 holden 2014 steinman et al 2018 however these bmps have yet to produce the desired results with our study s finding an average total phosphorus concentration of 58 75 ug l in the streams draining into the lake this is consistent with the effects of land use legacy where changes to the landscape can take decades to propagate through the environment to surface water systems martin et al 2021 a particularly interesting result of our study is the application of sampling site clustering to elucidate masked correlations between mst markers and nutrients this is of significance because it shows that water quality monitoring by itself without considering similarities and differences between sampling sites may mask relationships between variables and potential contamination sources while we identified correlations the porcine marker and both phosphorus and nitrogen species the human and bovine markers were less frequently connected to nutrients the cow marker was not correlated with nutrients cow manure because of it s high solids content and lower water activity may release the cow marker at a much different rate compared to nutrients however this is speculative and no data has been generated to support this the higher solids content in bovine manure 265 lbs per 1 000 gals vs porcine manure 170 lbs per 1 000 gals changes the availability and uptake of nutrients by crops from the manure i e nitrogen availability in the first year after application from dairy cow manure is 50 to 70 and only 30 to 50 for swine lorimor et al 1980 zhang 2017 thus influencing the difference between the animal mst markers and nutrients the diffuse spreading of cow manure on pastures with grazing livestock or overland spreading of cow manure may have also diluted out the affect in addition fertilizer may be a greater source of nutrients compared to manure in these rural areas the human marker was correlated with nutrient species when sampling sites were clustered based on septic tank density suggesting that septic tanks are an important source of nutrients in watersheds that have higher septic tank densities fig 4 however the human bacterial marker may be transported through soil in a different time frame compared to nutrients the input from septic tanks to surface waters was more apparent during low flows where groundwater contributions to surface waters compared to overland flow are not masked the input of septic tanks to streams can also be identified during higher flowing during the spring months where the highest human marker concentrations were observed fig 2b if wastewater treatment plants were the main contributers to the human marker signal we would expect the signal to decrease during high flow events due to dilution these observations are in line with observations from previous studies by verhougstraete et al 2015 and sowah et al 2017 additionally joseph et al 2021 showed that human inputs were more highly correlated with stream contamination than bovine sources even in areas with high numbers of cattle another important aspect to consider when examining correlations between mst markers and nutrient levels is the persistence of each marker the persistence of the mst markers varies and influences the presence degradation of the markers the pig2bac marker t90 time for 90 decay ranges from 0 90 to 5 11 days while the human marker the b theta and cowm2 have reported t90 s of 1 8 and 3 14 days respectively korajkic et al 2018 he et al 2016 brooks et al 2015 ballesté et al 2018 the longer persistence of the porcine marker in water may allow for higher correlations with nutrient species this correlation is likely influenced by both the source transport and fate of the contaminants in nearly every cluster the porcine marker showed correlations with ammonium this suggests that when porcine manure is applied to the land a significant portion of the manure and accompanying nutrients make their way into the waterways this in turn along with the lack of bovine markers correlated with nutrients could mean that the method of application or the physical attributes of the manure sources are significant in the fate of nutrient and microbial contamination to streams additionally differences and uncertainty on manure application practices can inhibit our understanding of the mechanisms by which contamination is occurring the correlations between nutrients and mst markers when sampling sites were clustered by septic tank density suggest that septic tank density may help predict where higher levels of fecal pollution will occur for the human marker this is in line with a large scale study conducted by verhougstraete et al 2015 which identified a similar correlation between septic tank numbers in watersheds and an increase in the human marker it is not clear why the pig marker would correlate with nutrients based on septic tank density but it may be indicative of greater manure application to the available land in rural areas where septic tanks are more widely used while this study successfully identified relationships between mst markers and nutrient species no strong predictive relationships could be determined this suggests that while mst can help to identify contamination sources within watersheds there are too many variables in the accompanying water quality data to allow for a strong predictive model to be formed future studies attemping to further elucidate the connections between mst and nutrients within watersheds should aim to increase sampling frequency and sampling locations along waterways within each study watershed this would allow for a greater resolution of water quality conditions over time during periods of high agricultural activities e g planting growing and harvesting seasons our study strove to understand the differences between different mixed use watersheds and thus a greater number of sampling locations were chosen at the trade off of fewer temporal sampling events while our study was limited in temporal resolute the abundant correlations observed between the porcine marker and phosphorus and ammonium show that porcine manure is likely an important source of pollutants from agricultural land that is transported into streams that should be monitored more frequently pre and post applications to reach desired stream water quality particularly in problematic agriculturally intensive watersheds manure and septic tanks both need to be considered for control of microbials and nutrients 5 conclusions spatial clustering allows for a more accurate analysis of relationships of water quality variables in watersheds temporal contamination is primarily driven by precipitation and its associated variables e g streamflow turbidity overland flow while spatial contamination is driven by land uses e g septic tank density tile drain proportions and tillage porcine fecal contamination is more often correlated with nutrients in

used a scoring scheme to quantify the probability of each sample being a member of the resulting clusters for this purpose we considered a gaussian mixture model gmm with fixed variance components as a probabilistic generalization of the k means method the scoring scheme we employed is based on the sample s degree of membership to each cluster used by the soft k means algorithm eq 1 represents the

unity the scores were computed separately for the clustering results obtained for each of the six criteria sets mentioned above correlation analysis was performed using pearson correlation r analysis using graphpad prism 8 graphpad software ca usa to ascertain if any significant relationships existed between the three mst markers and nutrient species these analyses were conducted in two ways first by using data from all the sites and samples and secondly by using data from the various sampling site clustering configurations fig 4 we reported 95 confidence intervals for each correlation factor based on fisher s z transform in this approach the correlation factors are transformed using eq 2 and then the lower and upper confidence limits of the transformed values are computed assuming a normal distribution with variance 1 n 3 where n is the number of samples used to estimate the correlation factor see eq 3 the aforementioned limits are transformed back to the correlation scale using

coli two nitrogen species and the two phosphorus species were plotted on heat maps to visualize spatial or temporal trends in each dataset figs 2 and 3 the mst markers primarily revealed temporal trends in their datasets while the nutrient species showed spatial trends and some temporal trends a few high valued data points were omitted from the scaling on the heatmaps to allow for greater visual resolution of spatial and temporal trends that would have otherwise been camouflaged by scaling the entire range of values a general temporal trend was seen for e coli in fig 2a with high concentrations during summer july 2017 and low concentrations in spring march 2018 across the most of sites the human marker also showed temporal trends with higher concentrations during the spring and early summer months i e april may june and july 2017 as well as march 2018 and lower concentrations in the late summer august 2017 fall november 2017 and stayed low in the spring may of 2018 fig 2b the bovine marker had higher concentrations in june and november 2017 with its lowest concentrations in july and august 2017 coinciding with the driest lowest levels of prior precipitation and streamflow period throughout the study fig 2c the porcine marker also showed higher concentrations between april july 2017 and may 2018 with lower concentrations during august november 2017 and march 2018 fig 2d spatial and temporal trends were seen for all nitrogen and phosphorus species fig 3 the tdn results showed a temporal trend with lower concentrations during june and august 2017 and higher concentrations in november 2017 and march 2018 fig 3a there were also spatial trends with sites such as rr5 rr7 lpr1 and kaw1 that consistently had low tdn concentrations across all sampling events ammonium showed a different spatial trend with mac3 having considerably higher nh4 n concentrations than all the other sites through time fig 3b there was also a spike in ammonium concentrations across all sites in all watersheds in july 2017 tdn had similar spatial and temporal trends as in the nitrate heatmap but with lower average concentrations of ammonium vs nitrate the phosphorus species showed a spatial trend with the highest concentrations found in the mac sites for all individual species but when examining total phosphorus tp fig 3c and d most of the rr sites excluding rr7 had high phosphorus levels fig 3 there were also some temporal trends in the phosphorus species with higher concentrations of tp found in august 2017 and march 2018 fig 3c 3 3 statistical analysis 3 3 1 cluster analysis the data from individual sites in each watershed were separated by cluster analysis to examine the similarities between watershed sites by six variables including e coli mst marker concentrations streamflow land use tillage tile drain proportion and septic tank density the final cluster analysis resulted in five clustering schemes with land use and tillage producing identical clusters fig 4 clustering sites based on streamflow resulted in three clusters 1 2 and 3 representing low medium and high flows concentrations from all four markers e coli and mst b theta cowm2 pig2bac and e coli had 1 2 and 3 clusters with concentration ranges of 0 99 4 72 0 30 4 08 1 33 5 87 log10 mpn gc 100 ml respectively when cluster analysis was performed using tile drain proportions only two clusters were identified representing 0 0 172 and 0 221 proportion tile drains clusters 1 and 2 landuse tillage resulted in three clusters with low 25 50 with no tillage medium 10 to 25 with no tillage and high 0 10 with no tillage tillage practices finally septic tank density split into three clusters representing sites with 11 11 15 and 17 septic tanks km2 respectively since there was more variability in the streamflow and markers data there are multiple samples per site while land use tile drain and septic tank density are fixed over time the clustering results are more uncertain using these variables streamflow and markers as criteria thus it is likely that a sample potentially belongs to two or more clusters at the same time when using time varying measurements as criteria according to the results confidence in the clustering results is higher for land use tile drain and septic tank density whereas is moderately uncertain for streamflow and markers table 2 3 3 2 correlation results the human and bovine markers showed no significant relationships with any of the seven nutrient species when all of the sites were analyzed together the porcine marker however

p 0 0001 respectively the tile drainage clusters showed significant correlations for both the human and porcine markers in cluster 1 the human marker was correlated with tfp and frp with r values of 0 40 95 ci 0 12 0 62 p 0 0062 and 0 35 95 ci 0 06 0 58 p 0 0187 respectively the porcine marker was also correlated with frp in cluster 1 with an r value of 0 21 95 ci 0 002 0 54 p p 0 0485 in cluster 2

septic tank density clustering resulted in the most correlations between markers and nutrient species the human marker was correlated with tfp tp and nh4 in cluster 3 highest density with r values of

spatial clustering relationships between microbial contaminants and nutrients which would otherwise be masked can be observed in individual mixed use watersheds with unique spatial and temporal trends while our results were in line with previous research where microbial contamination trends are mainly temporal in nature they were also able to determine significant correlations between source specific microbial markers and nutrients thus strengthening our understanding of these relationships lee et al 2014 sowah et al 2017 nshimyimana et al 2018 badgley et al 2019 mckee et al 2020 hinojosa et al 2020 these trends are likely associated with the timing of manure applications and microbial transport through the watersheds seen with increased rainfall and overland flows nutrients were spatially segregated based on land use and management practices such as tillage and tile drainage the mac watershed in particular showed high phosphorus levels at all four sites over the course of the sampling period the phosphorus pollution in the mac watershed is linked to agricultural non point sources of pollution steinman et al 2018 our results showed correlations between our porcine marker and nutrient species when using the data from the mac watershed sites in multiple clustering schemes these results suggest that at least a portion of the nutrients entering the mac watershed are associated with manure application practices these high levels of phosphorus are unsurprising as lake macatawa which the watershed drains into has been hypereutrophic for over 40 years mwp 2012 a tmdl of 50 ug l was set for tp in lake macatawa in 1999 by the usepa with best management practices bmps aimed at runoff abatement implemented since 2012 to help alleviate nutrient pollution walterhouse 1999 holden 2014 steinman et al 2018 however these bmps have yet to produce the desired results with our study s finding an average total phosphorus concentration of 58 75 ug l in the streams draining into the lake this is consistent with the effects of land use legacy where changes to the landscape can take decades to propagate through the environment to surface water systems martin et al 2021 a particularly interesting result of our study is the application of sampling site clustering to elucidate masked correlations between mst markers and nutrients this is of significance because it shows that water quality monitoring by itself without considering similarities and differences between sampling sites may mask relationships between variables and potential contamination sources while we identified correlations the porcine marker and both phosphorus and nitrogen species the human and bovine markers were less frequently connected to nutrients the cow marker was not correlated with nutrients cow manure because of it s high solids content and lower water activity may release the cow marker at a much different rate compared to nutrients however this is speculative and no data has been generated to support this the higher solids content in bovine manure 265 lbs per 1 000 gals vs porcine manure 170 lbs per 1 000 gals changes the availability and uptake of nutrients by crops from the manure i e nitrogen availability in the first year after application from dairy cow manure is 50 to 70 and only 30 to 50 for swine lorimor et al 1980 zhang 2017 thus influencing the difference between the animal mst markers and nutrients the diffuse spreading of cow manure on pastures with grazing livestock or overland spreading of cow manure may have also diluted out the affect in addition fertilizer may be a greater source of nutrients compared to manure in these rural areas the human marker was correlated with nutrient species when sampling sites were clustered based on septic tank density suggesting that septic tanks are an important source of nutrients in watersheds that have higher septic tank densities fig 4 however the human bacterial marker may be transported through soil in a different time frame compared to nutrients the input from septic tanks to surface waters was more apparent during low flows where groundwater contributions to surface waters compared to overland flow are not masked the input of septic tanks to streams can also be identified during higher flowing during the spring months where the highest human marker concentrations were observed fig 2b if wastewater treatment plants were the main contributers to the human marker signal we would expect the signal to decrease during high flow events due to dilution these observations are in line with observations from previous studies by verhougstraete et al 2015 and sowah et al 2017 additionally joseph et al 2021 showed that human inputs were more highly correlated with stream contamination than bovine sources even in areas with high numbers of cattle another important aspect to consider when examining correlations between mst markers and nutrient levels is the persistence of each marker the persistence of the mst markers varies and influences the presence degradation of the markers the pig2bac marker t90 time for 90 decay ranges from 0 90 to 5 11 days while the human marker the b theta and cowm2 have reported t90 s of 1 8 and 3 14 days respectively korajkic et al 2018 he et al 2016 brooks et al 2015 ballesté et al 2018 the longer persistence of the porcine marker in water may allow for higher correlations with nutrient species this correlation is likely influenced by both the source transport and fate of the contaminants in nearly every cluster the porcine marker showed correlations with ammonium this suggests that when porcine manure is applied to the land a significant portion of the manure and accompanying nutrients make their way into the waterways this in turn along with the lack of bovine markers correlated with nutrients could mean that the method of application or the physical attributes of the manure sources are significant in the fate of nutrient and microbial contamination to streams additionally differences and uncertainty on manure application practices can inhibit our understanding of the mechanisms by which contamination is occurring the correlations between nutrients and mst markers when sampling sites were clustered by septic tank density suggest that septic tank density may help predict where higher levels of fecal pollution will occur for the human marker this is in line with a large scale study conducted by verhougstraete et al 2015 which identified a similar correlation between septic tank numbers in watersheds and an increase in the human marker it is not clear why the pig marker would correlate with nutrients based on septic tank density but it may be indicative of greater manure application to the available land in rural areas where septic tanks are more widely used while this study successfully identified relationships between mst markers and nutrient species no strong predictive relationships could be determined this suggests that while mst can help to identify contamination sources within watersheds there are too many variables in the accompanying water quality data to allow for a strong predictive model to be formed future studies attemping to further elucidate the connections between mst and nutrients within watersheds should aim to increase sampling frequency and sampling locations along waterways within each study watershed this would allow for a greater resolution of water quality conditions over time during periods of high agricultural activities e g planting growing and harvesting seasons our study strove to understand the differences between different mixed use watersheds and thus a greater number of sampling locations were chosen at the trade off of fewer temporal sampling events while our study was limited in temporal resolute the abundant correlations observed between the porcine marker and phosphorus and ammonium show that porcine manure is likely an important source of pollutants from agricultural land that is transported into streams that should be monitored more frequently pre and post applications to reach desired stream water quality particularly in problematic agriculturally intensive watersheds manure and septic tanks both need to be considered for control of microbials and nutrients 5 conclusions spatial clustering allows for a more accurate analysis of relationships of water quality variables in watersheds temporal contamination is primarily driven by precipitation and its associated variables e g streamflow turbidity overland flow while spatial contamination is driven by land uses e g septic tank density tile drain proportions and tillage porcine fecal contamination is more often correlated with nutrients in

15943,microbial electrosynthesis mes cells use renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide into valuable chemical products such as methane and acetate but chemical production rates are low and ph changes can adversely impact biocathodes to overcome these limitations an mes reactor was designed with a zero gap electrode configuration with a cation exchange membrane cem to achieve a low internal resistance and a vapor fed electrode to minimize ph changes liquid catholyte was pumped through a carbon felt cathode inoculated with anaerobic digester sludge with humidified n2 gas flowing over the abiotic anode ti or c with a pt catalyst to drive water splitting the ohmic resistance was 2 4 0 5 mω m2 substantially lower than previous bioelectrochemical systems 20 25 mω m2 and the catholyte ph remained near neutral 6 6 7 2 the mes produced a high methane production rate of 2 9 1 2 l l d 748 mmol m2 d 17 4 a m2 ti pt anode at a relatively low applied voltage of 3 1 v in addition acetate was produced at a rate of 940 250 mmol m2 d with 180 30 mmol m2 d for propionate the biocathode microbial community was dominated by the methanogens of the genus methanobrevibacter and the acetogen of the genus clostridium sensu stricto 1 these results demonstrate the utility of this zero gap cell and vapor fed anode design for increasing rates of methane and chemical production in mes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial electrosynthesis carbon capture and utilization zero gap electrode design vapor fed anode 1 introduction carbon dioxide a major greenhouse gas can be converted to valuable gaseous or liquid chemical products either using inorganic catalysts in abiotic reactors or using certain microorganisms in microbial electrosynthesis mes cells jourdin and burdyny 2021 wood et al 2021 mes is a nascent bioelectrochemical approach that has been used to convert co2 in the cathode chamber into methane gas or chemicals such as acetate propionate and other volatile fatty acids depending on the inoculum and operating conditions jiang et al 2019b li et al 2018 the reduction of co2 can occur via direct extracellular electron transfer eet by electrotrophic microorganisms using electrons obtained from the cathode or indirectly via abiotic or biocatalyzed h2 gas production bajracharya et al 2017 karthikeyan et al 2019 or through biochemical synthesis using enzymes produced by microorganisms lienemann et al 2018 the mes systems also can be applied to upgrade biogas produced from anaerobic digesters to higher methane content liu et al 2021 the mes platform has several advantages over abiotic electrosynthesis owing to higher selectivity of final products and versatility of microorganisms compared to metal catalysts as well as the renewable nature of biocatalysts due to cell growth rabaey and rozendal 2010 when methane is the only desired product of mes it is often referred to as a microbial methanogenesis cell mmc logan et al 2015 the production of biomethane from renewable electricity sources such as wind and solar is of great interest as the gas can be used without net co2 emissions locally or transported for use in natural gas pipelines one challenge for methane generation using mes is that production rates and current densities have been relatively low prévoteau et al 2020 one approach to increase rates has been to use various cathode treatments or pure cultures of microorganisms for example non precious metal catalysts have been added to the cathode such as titanium oxide rhodium copper zinc and nickel alqahtani et al 2018 baek et al 2022 s das et al 2021 jiang et al 2019a siegert et al 2014 using pt on the cathode can increase current densities relative to other metals at the same input energy due to the generation of h2 siegert et al 2014 but the use of precious metals may not be economically feasible or desirable pure cultures have also been used in mes cells and mmcs for example using different methanogens to obtain only methane beese vasbender et al 2015 kracke et al 2020 mayer et al 2019 or acetogens to produce volatile fatty acids vfas aryal et al 2017 batlle vilanova et al 2016 deutzmann and spormann 2017 to maximize current production very high voltages 5 0 v are often applied to the circuit yielding low energy efficiencies 40 defined as the electrical energy input into the system compared to the energy in the chemical product zhou et al 2021 2020 improving the energy efficiency of methane production in mes requires electrochemical cells with low internal resistance many mes and mmc tests have been conducted using two bottle reactors connected by sidearms baek et al 2022 kracke et al 2020 2019 rojas et al 2018b siegert et al 2014 this type of system has a very large internal resistance due to the large distances between the electrodes and the narrow cross sectional area of the sidearm rossi and logan 2020 reactors with closely spaced electrodes and the same cross sectional area for the electrodes and membrane between the electrodes which is used to avoid gas crossover between the electrodes can reduce ohmic resistances and thus enable higher current densities at lower applied voltages lavender et al 2022 a major challenge when using an ion exchange membrane between the electrodes is that this can lead to large ph changes in the solution due to preferential transport of salt ions rather than h produced at the anode or oh released from water dissociation at the cathode rozendal et al 2006 if a cation exchange membrane cem is used then na will be transported through the cem instead of h resulting in acidification of the anode and basification of the cathode due to the accumulation of oh ions an increased catholyte ph will adversely impact methanogens because they have a quite narrow optimal ph range 6 5 7 8 fang et al 2014 in several mes systems ph has been manually controlled by supplementing the catholyte with a strong acid liu et al 2017 rojas et al 2018b van eerten jansen et al 2015 or by using a specialized direct co2 delivery system using electrocatalytic conductive membranes needed to buffer the ph at the cathode surface bian et al 2021 otherwise the catholyte ph will increase to be in the range of 7 7 10 1 depending on the current density zhou et al 2021 2020 it was recently shown that performance of microbial fuel cells mfcs used to produce electricity and microbial electrolysis cells mecs for h2 production could be improved and ph changes could be mitigated using a combination of closely spaced electrodes an anion exchange membrane aem and a vapor fed cell rossi et al 2021a 2021b in the mecs the electrodes were placed in contact with the aem zero gap electrode design to reduce internal resistance and diminish the distance between where h and oh ions are produced and consumed to minimize the development of concentration gradient in the cell a buffered medium was pumped through the anode chamber to supply substrate for the exoelectrogenic biofilm no liquid was used for the cathode and instead a humidified gas was pumped through a cathode chamber to collect hydrogen gas and provide additional water needed for the hydrogen evolution reaction the lack of a liquid catholyte enhanced effective oh transport from the cathode to the anode resulting in minimal ph changes in the anolyte rossi et al 2021b in this study we examined the use of a zero gap reactor configuration modified from previous designs to accommodate an electrotrophic cathode biofilm in this reactor the anode chamber was designed to have a vapor gas feed enabling oxygen evolution at the anode with a liquid catholyte fed to the biocathode instead of using an aem as done in an mec to enable oh ion transport to the anode a cem was used to facilitate h transport from the anode to the cathode to maintain near neutral catholyte ph unlike previous mecs where h2 was produced at the vapor fed cathode under abiotic conditions this mes configuration results in h2 generation in the same chamber i e cathode chamber as the microorganisms this configuration provided selective enrichment for the growth of microorganisms that either use current directly from the cathode or chemical products evolved from the cathode in both cases the microbes must remain firmly attached to the electrode in the presence of methane gas generation and transport through the electrode the inoculation using a mixed anaerobic culture from a digester enabled the possibility of generation of methane as well as other chemicals such as formate acetate and other vfas in addition to hydrogen gas to work towards more optimal operating conditions for methane generation we explored different applied voltages and anode materials and examined their impact on current densities and stability over time 2 materials and methods 2 1 mes reactor construction duplicate two chambered mes reactors were constructed based on previous zero gap configurations rossi et al 2021b but with modifications the anodes were either carbon cloth fuel cell store coated with pt c or platinized titanium felt 0 2 0 3 mm thick porosity of 53 56 fuel cell store product code 592 800 a platinum catalyst was added onto the carbon cloth by spraying a mixture of pt c and nafion binder in isopropanol water onto the cloth using an air brush with a final pt loading of 2 mg cm2 and nafion binder loading of 2 mg cm2 platinum was used as the anode catalyst for convenience and cost considerations although iridium oxide is usually a preferred catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction the cathode was carbon felt 3 18 mm of thickness 0 6 m2 g of surface area alfa aesar and the cem was nafion 117 fuel cell store all electrodes and the membrane had an exposed projected surface area of 7 cm2 used to normalize the gas production rate based on the surface area to make a membrane electrode assembly mea pt c on carbon cloth or platinized ti felt was hot pressed 130 c at 3000 psi for 2 min to the cem the reactors were assembled using plastic end plates rubber gaskets a current collector titanium foil and plastic spacers the plastic spacers were inserted between the end plate and the anode to achieve a close contact between mea and the cathode as well as to allow gas flow past to the anode fig s1 the anode and cathode chambers had a thickness of 3 18 mm due to the width of the gaskets producing empty volume for both electrode chambers of 4 5 ml used to normalize the gas production rate generating 158 m2 m3 of surface area to volume ratio rossi et al 2021b the cathode chamber was completely occupied by the carbon felt cathode thus driving the liquid catholyte flow through the cathode 2 2 biocathode acclimation and mes reactor operation a biocathode was acclimated in single chamber mecs prior to transferring to mes reactors as previously described ragab et al 2019 the electrodes were first inoculated by amending the medium with effluent from lab scale mfcs 50 v v and anaerobic digester sludge from the pennsylvania state university wastewater treatment plant 1 v v to provide sources for both exoelectrogenic bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens the medium ph 7 0 contained nahco3 2 5 g l nh4cl 1 5 g l nah2po4 0 6 g l kcl 0 1 g l vitamin 10 ml l mineral solution 10 ml l and sodium acetate 2 g l as organic source the headspace and medium were sparged with co2 n2 20 80 v v gas for 10 min before every new cycle and 0 8 v of fixed voltage was applied between the anode and cathode using a potentiostat vmp2 biologic knoxville tn carbon felt was heated at 450 c for 30 min and used for the cathode and a carbon brush was used as the anode the biocathodes were acclimated for multiple fed batch cycles in the mecs until the methane content of the biogas exceeded that of the hydrogen 20 cycles the acclimated biocathodes were transferred to mes reactors abiotic anode and fed with same electrolyte used for acclimation but without sodium acetate the catholyte was recirculated from the storage bottle 500 ml to the cathode at a flow speed of 2 5 ml min fig 1 the medium in the bottle was completely replaced after each cycle and it was sparged with co2 n2 20 80 v v gas for 10 min prior to use the anode was fed with humidified gas 2 5 ml min from the headspace of the anode storage bottle filled with deionized water 500 ml and sparged with 100 n2 gas the anode inlet bottle was connected to the gasbag filled with 100 n2 gas to vent gas from the anode chamber produced by the oxygen evolution reaction and therefore to reduce oxygen intrusion into the cathode chamber fig 1c each batch cycle lasted 2 days except for the first cycle set at 5 days to provide a sufficient time for biocathode acclimation and the last cycle set at 6 days to test the impact of long term operation on catholyte ph the biogas was collected from the headspace of catholyte storage bottle and analyzed for gas concentrations all experiments were conducted at 30 c in the dark in duplicate a fixed voltage between anode and cathode 2 0 3 1 v was applied and the current produced was recorded every 5 min using potentiostat vmp2 biologic knoxville tn unfortunately the anode and cathode potentials could not be monitored because this reactor design did not have space to insert a reference electrode the cathode chamber was fully filled with carbon felt and there was no electrolyte in the anode chamber 2 3 chemical analyses and calculations methane qch4 and hydrogen qh2 production rates were calculated based on the biogas composition measured

systems the initial methane production rate using the carbon anode reached a maximum of 0 4 l l d in the second cycle 1 4 a m2 eap 2 0 v but declined to 0 1 l l d 0 5 a m2 by cycle 7 fig 2 a the production rates were similar to several previous mes experiments showing rates of 0 2 0 5 l l d jiang et al 2013 liu et al 2017 van eerten jansen et al 2015 however mes operation clearly resulted in oxidation of the carbon anode as shown by production of a dark colored liquid from the anode chamber fig s2 oxidation of carbon based anodes material has been noted in other mes systems using a set cathode potential of 0 9 v vs ag agcl baek et al 2022 although the anodic potential could not be monitored in this configuration a carbon electrode is known to be oxidized at lower anodic potential in the acidic than neutral condition yi et al 2017 the moisture on the carbon anode might be acidic due to a continuous operation providing a favorable condition for carbon oxidation to confirm that the decrease in performance over time was due to the anode the anode was replaced with a new pt c carbon cloth in cycle 8 fig 2a the methane production rate was immediately restored to 0 5 l l d but performance again subsequently decreased until cycle 11 qch4 0 3 l l d as a result of electrode oxidation the performance of the mes stabilized when the carbon cloth anodes were replaced with the platinized titanium felt and the applied voltage was increased to 2 5 v the titanium was stable for water splitting consistent with results of several other mes systems using this material van eerten jansen et al 2015 zhou et al 2021 the slightly higher applied voltage of eap 2 5 v did not appreciably increase methane production during cycles 14 16 averaging qch4 of 0 5 0 0 l l d with a current density of 1 9 0 0 a m2 increasing the applied voltage to eap 2 8 v for cycles 17 19 significantly improved the methane production rate to qch4 of 2 0 0 3 l l d and current density to 7 5 0 6 a m2 fig 2 when the eap was further increased to 3 1 v during cycles 20 22 there was no appreciable increase in the rate of methane production qch4 2 4 0 7 l l d during cycles 20 22 fig 2a despite a 3 1 increase in the current density to 23 6 7 3 a m2 fig 2b and fig s3 the percentage of methane recovery relative to the current production therefore decreased from 72 4 in cycle 19 to 12 5 in cycle 20 fig 2c the production of a higher current without an increase in methane resulted in the production of other products especially h2 gas at a rate of 52 19 l l d at cycle 20 this high production rate of h2 indicated that it was being produced faster than it could be consumed by methanogens or other microorganisms on the cathode werner et al 2016 when the applied voltage was reduced back to an eap 2 8 v in cycles 24 27 the methane production rate 1 1 0 2 l l d averaged only 54 of its rate in the previous cycles at this same applied voltage this reduction in performance suggested that the cathodic biofilm was damaged by the high h2 gas production rates a high h2 gas bubbling rate from the cathode has been used as a means of self cleaning the surface of a membrane in the membrane bioreactor to reduce biofouling katuri et al 2014 here vigorous h2 evolution could adversely impact mes performance by detaching the microorganisms and the extracellular polymeric matrix that form a biofilm on the electrode surfaces dargahi et al 2014 in addition low methane production rate could be due to that other microbial groups such as acidogens became dominant at high h2 production rate which will be discussed in later section 3 2 ph control the use of the vapor fed anode chamber combined with the zero gap electrode spacing successfully maintained the catholyte ph in the range of 6 6 7 2 under all test conditions and thus no ph adjustments were needed fig 3 to confirm the stability of this near neutral ph condition over a longer period of time the cycle length was extended to 6 days in an additional batch cycle and the catholyte ph did not increase 7 0 0 0 conventional mes systems using a membrane between the electrodes require additional ph control through addition of an acid to the catholyte liu et al 2017 van eerten jansen et al 2015 or a specialized co2 delivery system to buffer the ph of the biocathode bian et al 2021 otherwise the catholyte ph will became strongly alkaline 7 7 10 1 depending on the buffer concentration in these systems zhou et al 2021 2020 the stable ph of the medium in our system was due to the vapor fed anode configuration and use of cem between anode and cathode the vapor fed to the anode enabled a selective transport of protons from the anode rather than transport of other ions that would be present in a liquid anolyte such as sodium and potassium the small spacing between anode and cathode enabled effective transport the protons generated at the anode directly to the biocathode minimizing local ph changes and reducing mass transfer limitations maintaining a stable ph in the mes cells reduced the voltage required to drive the electrochemical reactions as a ph gradient will increase the required thermodynamic potential according to the nernst equation 3 3 vfa production and cathodic recovery there was no measurable vfa production in the initial cycles 2 8 but low concentrations of acetate and propionate were detected in cycle 10 fig 4 a the concentrations of acetate and propionate subsequently increased rapidly and reached their maximum production rates with 940 250 mmol m2 d in cycle 22 for acetate and 180 30 mmol m2 d in cycle 20 for propionate formate was detected only in cycle 20 with a production rate of 200 120 mmol m2 d the production of vfas and methane show that there was a competition for the production of these chemicals and that the production of vfas took a longer period of time to evolve the production rates observed in our systems were much higher than previously reported values 63 mmol formate m2 d 59 mmol acetate m2 d yu et al 2017 607 mmol acetate m2 d rojas et al 2018a acetate is one of the major products from mes systems and propionate can be produced at more negative cathodic potential than acetate because more electrons are needed 14 electrons for propionate and 8 electrons for acetate although we could not measure cathodic potential there are several mes systems where propionate was produced as one of the final products along with acetate butyrate and other chemicals in the catholyte at a cathodic potential of 0 6 to 1 0 v vs standard hydrogen electrode das et al 2018 2020 s das and ghangrekar 2021 modestra et al 2015 hydrogen gas was first detected when the applied potential was increased from 2 8 v to 3 1 v indicating that net hydrogen evolution occurred due to insufficient uptake by microorganisms on the cathode the overall cathodic recovery calculated based on methane hydrogen and vfa production was higher than 100 with production of vfas fig 4b cathodic recoveries of 100 have been previously reported in several mes studies siegert et al 2014 zhen et al 2016 with a very high value of 1200 obtained when carbon black was used as a cathode material in two chamber mmcs siegert et al 2014 in that study the authors suggested that high columbic efficiency might be due to a cathode corrosion via 2c0 3h2o ch4 hco3 h δg0 17 kj mol as there was no methane production from open circuit controls and methane production was greater than abiotic h2 production in controls with an applied voltage siegert et al 2014 thus it seems likely here that cathode corrosion contributed to providing additional electrons to be used for either vfa or methane production at least in part but there has been no well known mechanism to explain this high cathodic recovery the use of radio labelled co2 could be used as a way to investigate the source of the methane and vfas produced in these systems in future mes studies to confirm that current and chemical production were not due only to abiotic reactions the cathode was replaced with a new cathode no biofilm and 2 8 v was applied fig s4 when eap of 2 8 v was applied for each cycle the abiotic system had a current density of 1 5 0 2 a m2 indicating that abiotic reactions did contribute to current however this current was only 20 of the average current produced in the mes system of 8 2 0 1 a m2 methanogens are obligate anaerobes and therefore an oxygen scavenger 100 mg l of l cysteine hcl was added to the catholyte in the last batch cycle to see if any small amounts of oxygen leaking into the system might adversely impact chemical production fig s5 wang et al 2021 the current density was immediately increased from 4 4 a m2 to 6 2 a m2after l cysteine was added suggesting that the oxygen scavenging was beneficial to microorganisms in the cathode biofilm after 1 h of operation the catholyte was replaced with a fresh medium lacking l cystine and the higher current density was maintained during rest of cell operation time given that the conductivity of catholyte was not appreciably increased by the addition of l cysteine addition from 8 6 to 9 1 this suggests that the condition of the cathode biofilm once restored by the anoxic conditions could be maintained over time further studies on the effect of oxygen scavengers on system performance therefore are warranted as a method of improving system stability and performance 3 4 cathode biofilm community structure the biomass samples taken from the cathode of each mes system were analyzed for 16s rrna to investigate active microbial community a total of 187 687 of non chimeric quality filtered reads were obtained from two samples and they were clustered into 101 otus at 97 identity the most abundant 10 otus in each sample were shown in a heatmap with their relative abundance and taxonomic classification at the genus and phylum level table 1 the most abundantly enriched otu otu 1 35 7 belonged to the genus methanobrevibacter which is a well known hydrogenotrophic methanogen in anaerobic digestion ad yang et al 2019 many previous mes studies have shown that the genus methanobacterium has had the highest relative abundance in the cathode biofilms at lower current densities bian et al 2021 cheng et al 2009 marshall et al 2012 ragab et al 2020 siegert et al 2015a in addition this genus was abundant in studies where mecs were used in ad systems baek et al 2021 cai et al 2016 both cathode potentials and current densities can impact the abundance of different methanogens the relative abundance of methanobacterium and methanobrevibacter which belong to the same family of methanobacteraceae was found to be impacted by cathode potentials set at the start of an mes experiment li et al 2020 at startup using cathode potentials of 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 v produced an archaeal community almost exclusively dominated by methanobacterium while at more negative startup cathode potentials the relative abundance of methanobrevibacter increased to 9 at 1 0 v and then 74 at 1 1 v the authors proposed that the enrichment of methanobrevibacter at more negative cathode potentials was possibly because they have higher h2 thresholds 2 0 5 8 pa than those of methanobacterium 2 0 pa kim 2012 in another study methanobrevibacter had a much higher relative abundance 89 99 than methanobacterium with a higher current density and h2 production while its abundance decreased to 27 with a lower h2 production werner et al 2016 similarly methanobrevibacter predominated 86 100 on biocathodes using platinum coated cathode materials while the mes systems with other cathode materials e g plain carbon ni magnetite steel ferrihydrite fes and mos2 yielded biofilms enriched with methanobacterium siegert et al 2015b given that platinum is primarily used as a cathode catalyst for an efficient h2 production to reduce the high overpotential for proton reduction chae et al 2009 the emergence of active h2 production at the cathode in the later batch cycles might help to explain the predominance of methanobrevibacter for the bacterial community otu 2 belonging to the genus clostridium sensu stricto 1 had the highest relative abundance although it was only 10 9 the dominance of clostridium on the cathode in mes studies has have been previously reported although at higher relative abundances of 40 4 of the total bacterial community vidales et al 2021 clostridium are acetogenic bacteria which have been shown to convert co2 to acetate on electrodes logan et al 2019 nevin et al 2011 and their presence on the cathode here is consistent with the observation of acetate production in the later cycles fig 4 otus 3 and 5 belonged to genera eubacterium and azospira and showed distinct relative abundances between duplicate biocathodes members of the genus eubacterium are known as chemolithoautotrophs and have been found in biofilms on electrodes that were switched to operate as cathodes after functioning as anodes in sediment type mfcs pisciotta et al 2012 azospira is known to perform heterotrophic denitrification it was recently found to be abundant on the biocathode in a nitrogen removing bioelectrochemical system sun et al 2019 and this genus is known to use acetate as a carbon source under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions nam et al 2016 pseudomonas affiliated with otu 6 has been reported as a putative electrotroph that could uptake electrons from the cathode and survive on its surface li et al 2021 roy et al 2021 vidales et al 2021 alcaligenes were previously found from the anode biofilm but not from the cathode biofilm suggesting their minor role at the cathode in the mes process vidales et al 2021 the appearance of the genus gordonia might be due to possible oxygen leakage into the systems suggested by the result of l cystein test given that this genus is aerobic arenskötter et al 2004 the use of pure cultures of these or other microorganisms in the cathode chamber could lead to more effective controls on the specific chemical products propionate production from current density in bioelectrochemical systems is known to be performed by propionate producing bacteria such as members belonging to the genus propionibacterium emde and schink 1990 rabaey and rozendal 2010 although no species affiliated to propionibacterium were detected in our cathode biofilms two otus in our libraries were affiliated to the family propionibacteriaceae where the genus propionibacterium belong to both otus were not revealed at the genus level since the relative abundances of both otus were considerable 0 3 and 0 2 each data not shown they might be responsible for propionate production at the cathode 3 5 comparison of methane production rates to previous studies the methane production rate obtained here of 2 9 1 2 l l d platinized titanium felt anode fig 2 was larger than that in most previous reports and the applied voltage eap 3 1 v was also much lower than in these previous studies when reported for example in a study by zhou et al 2021 the methane production rate was 1 6 l l d our calculation based on 202 l m2 d and the reported cathode area with an applied voltage of eap 5 5 v compared to 3 1 v here zhou et al 2021 the use of set cathode potentials could be expected to improve methane production rates since the anode potential will vary to enable the set current however the use of very high cell voltages to produce this current would result in a reduction of energy efficiency in a study by kracke et al 2020 the methane production rate was indicated to be a record high of 1 4 l l d at a set current density of 10 a m2 kracke et al 2020 however the cell voltage used to obtain this result was not reported important differences between their study and ours includes their use of nimo catalyzed cathode a two bottle architecture and pure cultures of the hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanococcus maripaludis here we used no cathode catalyst and only anaerobic sludge as the inoculum in our reactor which had a much different architecture a higher volumetric methane production rate of 4 3 l l d was obtained by zhou et al 2020 with a set current density of 35 a m2 and cathodes made of granular activated carbon gac zhou et al 2020 however the methane production rate was only 1 0 l l d at the same current density of 10 a m2 used by kracke et al 2020 and the cell voltage needed to produce this current was not reported assuming a linear relationship between current and methane production this suggests the system used by zhou et al 2020 would have produced a smaller rate of 2 1 l l d at the same current density as that used here 17 4 a m2 the lack of data on cell voltages does not allow for direct comparisons of methane production relative to energy input the very low ohmic resistance of the vapor fed zero gap electrode system used here 2 4 0 5 mω m2 suggests that the methane production rates were superior to previous studies based on the energy needed to be added to achieve these high volumetric methane production rates the ohmic resistance measured in our study by the current interrupt method was 2 4 0 5 mω m2 which was much lower than that of conventional mecs made with cube cell or tubular design 20 25 mω m2 cario et al 2019 guo et al 2017 in addition the measured resistance showed similar values to those obtained for zero gap mecs 2 2 mω m2 rossi et al 2021a indicating that no space between anode and cathode i e the electrodes pressed against to the ion exchange membrane was a key to reduce the overall resistance and thus improve electrochemical performance although the experiment here was conducted in a small reactor size a novel design developed here could be up scaled for future applications there are several advantages of this reactor design for up scaling compared to the conventional mes systems using a liquid anolyte first it is not necessary to provide electrolyte into the anode chamber so we can reduce the energy and cost for preparing and pumping buffer solutions second there is lower possibility of unwanted reactions on the anode such as chemical precipitation catalyst leaching and dissolution and oxidation of chemical species because the anode does not directly contact with the liquid buffer rossi et al 2021a in addition an acidic anolyte and basic catholyte are not produced in this configuration that would require further treatment in contrast there are some possible challenges when this mes configuration becomes bigger since the catholyte flowed through the carbon felt in the current reactor design and thus there is always the potential for electrode clogging over time zhai and dong 2022 4 conclusions a newly designed zero gap and vapor fed mes reactor enabled one of the highest methane production rates of 2 9 1 2 l l d at an eap 3 1 v using electrodes as an electron donor and co2 as the carbon source the vapor fed anode pressed against a cem enabled selective transport of protons to the cathode as demonstrated by a catholyte ph that was maintained at a circumneutral ph of 6 6 7 2 over time the zero gap configuration enabled a low ohmic resistance of 2 4 0 5 mω m2 which is much lower than previous systems over multiple cycles vfas were also produced showing that competition for the electrons donated by the cathode to the biofilm resulted in production of multiple chemical products the cathode biofilm was mainly comprised of the hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanobrevibacter and the acetogenic bacterium clostridium sensu stricto 1 together suggesting their roles in producing both methane and vfas from co2 as final products some hydrogen was produced along with the other chemical products suggesting that the cathode design could be improved to avoid production of unwanted chemical products in these systems the novel reactor design here could lead to efficient chemical production from electrical current compared to previous systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

15943,microbial electrosynthesis mes cells use renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide into valuable chemical products such as methane and acetate but chemical production rates are low and ph changes can adversely impact biocathodes to overcome these limitations an mes reactor was designed with a zero gap electrode configuration with a cation exchange membrane cem to achieve a low internal resistance and a vapor fed electrode to minimize ph changes liquid catholyte was pumped through a carbon felt cathode inoculated with anaerobic digester sludge with humidified n2 gas flowing over the abiotic anode ti or c with a pt catalyst to drive water splitting the ohmic resistance was 2 4 0 5 mω m2 substantially lower than previous bioelectrochemical systems 20 25 mω m2 and the catholyte ph remained near neutral 6 6 7 2 the mes produced a high methane production rate of 2 9 1 2 l l d 748 mmol m2 d 17 4 a m2 ti pt anode at a relatively low applied voltage of 3 1 v in addition acetate was produced at a rate of 940 250 mmol m2 d with 180 30 mmol m2 d for propionate the biocathode microbial community was dominated by the methanogens of the genus methanobrevibacter and the acetogen of the genus clostridium sensu stricto 1 these results demonstrate the utility of this zero gap cell and vapor fed anode design for increasing rates of methane and chemical production in mes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial electrosynthesis carbon capture and utilization zero gap electrode design vapor fed anode 1 introduction carbon dioxide a major greenhouse gas can be converted to valuable gaseous or liquid chemical products either using inorganic catalysts in abiotic reactors or using certain microorganisms in microbial electrosynthesis mes cells jourdin and burdyny 2021 wood et al 2021 mes is a nascent bioelectrochemical approach that has been used to convert co2 in the cathode chamber into methane gas or chemicals such as acetate propionate and other volatile fatty acids depending on the inoculum and operating conditions jiang et al 2019b li et al 2018 the reduction of co2 can occur via direct extracellular electron transfer eet by electrotrophic microorganisms using electrons obtained from the cathode or indirectly via abiotic or biocatalyzed h2 gas production bajracharya et al 2017 karthikeyan et al 2019 or through biochemical synthesis using enzymes produced by microorganisms lienemann et al 2018 the mes systems also can be applied to upgrade biogas produced from anaerobic digesters to higher methane content liu et al 2021 the mes platform has several advantages over abiotic electrosynthesis owing to higher selectivity of final products and versatility of microorganisms compared to metal catalysts as well as the renewable nature of biocatalysts due to cell growth rabaey and rozendal 2010 when methane is the only desired product of mes it is often referred to as a microbial methanogenesis cell mmc logan et al 2015 the production of biomethane from renewable electricity sources such as wind and solar is of great interest as the gas can be used without net co2 emissions locally or transported for use in natural gas pipelines one challenge for methane generation using mes is that production rates and current densities have been relatively low prévoteau et al 2020 one approach to increase rates has been to use various cathode treatments or pure cultures of microorganisms for example non precious metal catalysts have been added to the cathode such as titanium oxide rhodium copper zinc and nickel alqahtani et al 2018 baek et al 2022 s das et al 2021 jiang et al 2019a siegert et al 2014 using pt on the cathode can increase current densities relative to other metals at the same input energy due to the generation of h2 siegert et al 2014 but the use of precious metals may not be economically feasible or desirable pure cultures have also been used in mes cells and mmcs for example using different methanogens to obtain only methane beese vasbender et al 2015 kracke et al 2020 mayer et al 2019 or acetogens to produce volatile fatty acids vfas aryal et al 2017 batlle vilanova et al 2016 deutzmann and spormann 2017 to maximize current production very high voltages 5 0 v are often applied to the circuit yielding low energy efficiencies 40 defined as the electrical energy input into the system compared to the energy in the chemical product zhou et al 2021 2020 improving the energy efficiency of methane production in mes requires electrochemical cells with low internal resistance many mes and mmc tests have been conducted using two bottle reactors connected by sidearms baek et al 2022 kracke et al 2020 2019 rojas et al 2018b siegert et al 2014 this type of system has a very large internal resistance due to the large distances between the electrodes and the narrow cross sectional area of the sidearm rossi and logan 2020 reactors with closely spaced electrodes and the same cross sectional area for the electrodes and membrane between the electrodes which is used to avoid gas crossover between the electrodes can reduce ohmic resistances and thus enable higher current densities at lower applied voltages lavender et al 2022 a major challenge when using an ion exchange membrane between the electrodes is that this can lead to large ph changes in the solution due to preferential transport of salt ions rather than h produced at the anode or oh released from water dissociation at the cathode rozendal et al 2006 if a cation exchange membrane cem is used then na will be transported through the cem instead of h resulting in acidification of the anode and basification of the cathode due to the accumulation of oh ions an increased catholyte ph will adversely impact methanogens because they have a quite narrow optimal ph range 6 5 7 8 fang et al 2014 in several mes systems ph has been manually controlled by supplementing the catholyte with a strong acid liu et al 2017 rojas et al 2018b van eerten jansen et al 2015 or by using a specialized direct co2 delivery system using electrocatalytic conductive membranes needed to buffer the ph at the cathode surface bian et al 2021 otherwise the catholyte ph will increase to be in the range of 7 7 10 1 depending on the current density zhou et al 2021 2020 it was recently shown that performance of microbial fuel cells mfcs used to produce electricity and microbial electrolysis cells mecs for h2 production could be improved and ph changes could be mitigated using a combination of closely spaced electrodes an anion exchange membrane aem and a vapor fed cell rossi et al 2021a 2021b in the mecs the electrodes were placed in contact with the aem zero gap electrode design to reduce internal resistance and diminish the distance between where h and oh ions are produced and consumed to minimize the development of concentration gradient in the cell a buffered medium was pumped through the anode chamber to supply substrate for the exoelectrogenic biofilm no liquid was used for the cathode and instead a humidified gas was pumped through a cathode chamber to collect hydrogen gas and provide additional water needed for the hydrogen evolution reaction the lack of a liquid catholyte enhanced effective oh transport from the cathode to the anode resulting in minimal ph changes in the anolyte rossi et al 2021b in this study we examined the use of a zero gap reactor configuration modified from previous designs to accommodate an electrotrophic cathode biofilm in this reactor the anode chamber was designed to have a vapor gas feed enabling oxygen evolution at the anode with a liquid catholyte fed to the biocathode instead of using an aem as done in an mec to enable oh ion transport to the anode a cem was used to facilitate h transport from the anode to the cathode to maintain near neutral catholyte ph unlike previous mecs where h2 was produced at the vapor fed cathode under abiotic conditions this mes configuration results in h2 generation in the same chamber i e cathode chamber as the microorganisms this configuration provided selective enrichment for the growth of microorganisms that either use current directly from the cathode or chemical products evolved from the cathode in both cases the microbes must remain firmly attached to the electrode in the presence of methane gas generation and transport through the electrode the inoculation using a mixed anaerobic culture from a digester enabled the possibility of generation of methane as well as other chemicals such as formate acetate and other vfas in addition to hydrogen gas to work towards more optimal operating conditions for methane generation we explored different applied voltages and anode materials and examined their impact on current densities and stability over time 2 materials and methods 2 1 mes reactor construction duplicate two chambered mes reactors were constructed based on previous zero gap configurations rossi et al 2021b but with modifications the anodes were either carbon cloth fuel cell store coated with pt c or platinized titanium felt 0 2 0 3 mm thick porosity of 53 56 fuel cell store product code 592 800 a platinum catalyst was added onto the carbon cloth by spraying a mixture of pt c and nafion binder in isopropanol water onto the cloth using an air brush with a final pt loading of 2 mg cm2 and nafion binder loading of 2 mg cm2 platinum was used as the anode catalyst for convenience and cost considerations although iridium oxide is usually a preferred catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction the cathode was carbon felt 3 18 mm of thickness 0 6 m2 g of surface area alfa aesar and the cem was nafion 117 fuel cell store all electrodes and the membrane had an exposed projected surface area of 7 cm2 used to normalize the gas production rate based on the surface area to make a membrane electrode assembly mea pt c on carbon cloth or platinized ti felt was hot pressed 130 c at 3000 psi for 2 min to the cem the reactors were assembled using plastic end plates rubber gaskets a current collector titanium foil and plastic spacers the plastic spacers were inserted between the end plate and the anode to achieve a close contact between mea and the cathode as well as to allow gas flow past to the anode fig s1 the anode and cathode chambers had a thickness of 3 18 mm due to the width of the gaskets producing empty volume for both electrode chambers of 4 5 ml used to normalize the gas production rate generating 158 m2 m3 of surface area to volume ratio rossi et al 2021b the cathode chamber was completely occupied by the carbon felt cathode thus driving the liquid catholyte flow through the cathode 2 2 biocathode acclimation and mes reactor operation a biocathode was acclimated in single chamber mecs prior to transferring to mes reactors as previously described ragab et al 2019 the electrodes were first inoculated by amending the medium with effluent from lab scale mfcs 50 v v and anaerobic digester sludge from the pennsylvania state university wastewater treatment plant 1 v v to provide sources for both exoelectrogenic bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens the medium ph 7 0 contained nahco3 2 5 g l nh4cl 1 5 g l nah2po4 0 6 g l kcl 0 1 g l vitamin 10 ml l mineral solution 10 ml l and sodium acetate 2 g l as organic source the headspace and medium were sparged with co2 n2 20 80 v v gas for 10 min before every new cycle and 0 8 v of fixed voltage was applied between the anode and cathode using a potentiostat vmp2 biologic knoxville tn carbon felt was heated at 450 c for 30 min and used for the cathode and a carbon brush was used as the anode the biocathodes were acclimated for multiple fed batch cycles in the mecs until the methane content of the biogas exceeded that of the hydrogen 20 cycles the acclimated biocathodes were transferred to mes reactors abiotic anode and fed with same electrolyte used for acclimation but without sodium acetate the catholyte was recirculated from the storage bottle 500 ml to the cathode at a flow speed of 2 5 ml min fig 1 the medium in the bottle was completely replaced after each cycle and it was sparged with co2 n2 20 80 v v gas for 10 min prior to use the anode was fed with humidified gas 2 5 ml min from the headspace of the anode storage bottle filled with deionized water 500 ml and sparged with 100 n2 gas the anode inlet bottle was connected to the gasbag filled with 100 n2 gas to vent gas from the anode chamber produced by the oxygen evolution reaction and therefore to reduce oxygen intrusion into the cathode chamber fig 1c each batch cycle lasted 2 days except for the first cycle set at 5 days to provide a sufficient time for biocathode acclimation and the last cycle set at 6 days to test the impact of long term operation on catholyte ph the biogas was collected from the headspace of catholyte storage bottle and analyzed for gas concentrations all experiments were conducted at 30 c in the dark in duplicate a fixed voltage between anode and cathode 2 0 3 1 v was applied and the current produced was recorded every 5 min using potentiostat vmp2 biologic knoxville tn unfortunately the anode and cathode potentials could not be monitored because this reactor design did not have space to insert a reference electrode the cathode chamber was fully filled with carbon felt and there was no electrolyte in the anode chamber 2 3 chemical analyses and calculations methane qch4 and hydrogen qh2 production rates were calculated based on the biogas composition measured

and reverse 806r tailed primers the detailed procedures to perform sequencing and data processing are described in the previous work baek et al 2021 3 results discussion 3 1 biogas production from mes systems the initial methane production rate using the carbon anode reached a maximum of 0 4 l l d in the second cycle 1 4 a m2 eap 2 0 v but declined to 0 1 l l d 0 5 a m2 by cycle 7 fig 2 a the production rates were similar to several previous mes experiments showing rates of 0 2 0 5 l l d jiang et al 2013 liu et al 2017 van eerten jansen et al 2015 however mes operation clearly resulted in oxidation of the carbon anode as shown by production of a dark colored liquid from the anode chamber fig s2 oxidation of carbon based anodes material has been noted in other mes systems using a set cathode potential of 0 9 v vs ag agcl baek et al 2022 although the anodic potential could not be monitored in this configuration a carbon electrode is known to be oxidized at lower anodic potential in the acidic than neutral condition yi et al 2017 the moisture on the carbon anode might be acidic due to a continuous operation providing a favorable condition for carbon oxidation to confirm that the decrease in performance over time was due to the anode the anode was replaced with a new pt c carbon cloth in cycle 8 fig 2a the methane production rate was immediately restored to 0 5 l l d but performance again subsequently decreased until cycle 11 qch4 0 3 l l d as a result of electrode oxidation the performance of the mes stabilized when the carbon cloth anodes were replaced with the platinized titanium felt and the applied voltage was increased to 2 5 v the titanium was stable for water splitting consistent with results of several other mes systems using this material van eerten jansen et al 2015 zhou et al 2021 the slightly higher applied voltage of eap 2 5 v did not appreciably increase methane production during cycles 14 16 averaging qch4 of 0 5 0 0 l l d with a current density of 1 9 0 0 a m2 increasing the applied voltage to eap 2 8 v for cycles 17 19 significantly improved the methane production rate to qch4 of 2 0 0 3 l l d and current density to 7 5 0 6 a m2 fig 2 when the eap was further increased to 3 1 v during cycles 20 22 there was no appreciable increase in the rate of methane production qch4 2 4 0 7 l l d during cycles 20 22 fig 2a despite a 3 1 increase in the current density to 23 6 7 3 a m2 fig 2b and fig s3 the percentage of methane recovery relative to the current production therefore decreased from 72 4 in cycle 19 to 12 5 in cycle 20 fig 2c the production of a higher current without an increase in methane resulted in the production of other products especially h2 gas at a rate of 52 19 l l d at cycle 20 this high production rate of h2 indicated that it was being produced faster than it could be consumed by methanogens or other microorganisms on the cathode werner et al 2016 when the applied voltage was reduced back to an eap 2 8 v in cycles 24 27 the methane production rate 1 1 0 2 l l d averaged only 54 of its rate in the previous cycles at this same applied voltage this reduction in performance suggested that the cathodic biofilm was damaged by the high h2 gas production rates a high h2 gas bubbling rate from the cathode has been used as a means of self cleaning the surface of a membrane in the membrane bioreactor to reduce biofouling katuri et al 2014 here vigorous h2 evolution could adversely impact mes performance by detaching the microorganisms and the extracellular polymeric matrix that form a biofilm on the electrode surfaces dargahi et al 2014 in addition low methane production rate could be due to that other microbial groups such as acidogens became dominant at high h2 production rate which will be discussed in later section 3 2 ph control the use of the vapor fed anode chamber combined with the zero gap electrode spacing successfully maintained the catholyte ph in the range of 6 6 7 2 under all test conditions and thus no ph adjustments were needed fig 3 to confirm the stability of this near neutral ph condition over a longer period of time the cycle length was extended to 6 days in an additional batch cycle and the catholyte ph did not increase 7 0 0 0 conventional mes systems using a membrane between the electrodes require additional ph control through addition of an acid to the catholyte liu et al 2017 van eerten jansen et al 2015 or a specialized co2 delivery system to buffer the ph of the biocathode bian et al 2021 otherwise the catholyte ph will became strongly alkaline 7 7 10 1 depending on the buffer concentration in these systems zhou et al 2021 2020 the stable ph of the medium in our system was due to the vapor fed anode configuration and use of cem between anode and cathode the vapor fed to the anode enabled a selective transport of protons from the anode rather than transport of other ions that would be present in a liquid anolyte such as sodium and potassium the small spacing between anode and cathode enabled effective transport the protons generated at the anode directly to the biocathode minimizing local ph changes and reducing mass transfer limitations maintaining a stable ph in the mes cells reduced the voltage required to drive the electrochemical reactions as a ph gradient will increase the required thermodynamic potential according to the nernst equation 3 3 vfa production and cathodic recovery there was no measurable vfa production in the initial cycles 2 8 but low concentrations of acetate and propionate were detected in cycle 10 fig 4 a the concentrations of acetate and propionate subsequently increased rapidly and reached their maximum production rates with 940 250 mmol m2 d in cycle 22 for acetate and 180 30 mmol m2 d in cycle 20 for propionate formate was detected only in cycle 20 with a production rate of 200 120 mmol m2 d the production of vfas and methane show that there was a competition for the production of these chemicals and that the production of vfas took a longer period of time to evolve the production rates observed in our systems were much higher than previously reported values 63 mmol formate m2 d 59 mmol acetate m2 d yu et al 2017 607 mmol acetate m2 d rojas et al 2018a acetate is one of the major products from mes systems and propionate can be produced at more negative cathodic potential than acetate because more electrons are needed 14 electrons for propionate and 8 electrons for acetate although we could not measure cathodic potential there are several mes systems where propionate was produced as one of the final products along with acetate butyrate and other chemicals in the catholyte at a cathodic potential of 0 6 to 1 0 v vs standard hydrogen electrode das et al 2018 2020 s das and ghangrekar 2021 modestra et al 2015 hydrogen gas was first detected when the applied potential was increased from 2 8 v to 3 1 v indicating that net hydrogen evolution occurred due to insufficient uptake by microorganisms on the cathode the overall cathodic recovery calculated based on methane hydrogen and vfa production was higher than 100 with production of vfas fig 4b cathodic recoveries of 100 have been previously reported in several mes studies siegert et al 2014 zhen et al 2016 with a very high value of 1200 obtained when carbon black was used as a cathode material in two chamber mmcs siegert et al 2014 in that study the authors suggested that high columbic efficiency might be due to a cathode corrosion via 2c0 3h2o ch4 hco3 h δg0 17 kj mol as there was no methane production from open circuit controls and methane production was greater than abiotic h2 production in controls with an applied voltage siegert et al 2014 thus it seems likely here that cathode corrosion contributed to providing additional electrons to be used for either vfa or methane production at least in part but there has been no well known mechanism to explain this high cathodic recovery the use of radio labelled co2 could be used as a way to investigate the source of the methane and vfas produced in these systems in future mes studies to confirm that current and chemical production were not due only to abiotic reactions the cathode was replaced with a new cathode no biofilm and 2 8 v was applied fig s4 when eap of 2 8 v was applied for each cycle the abiotic system had a current density of 1 5 0 2 a m2 indicating that abiotic reactions did contribute to current however this current was only 20 of the average current produced in the mes system of 8 2 0 1 a m2 methanogens are obligate anaerobes and therefore an oxygen scavenger 100 mg l of l cysteine hcl was added to the catholyte in the last batch cycle to see if any small amounts of oxygen leaking into the system might adversely impact chemical production fig s5 wang et al 2021 the current density was immediately increased from 4 4 a m2 to 6 2 a m2after l cysteine was added suggesting that the oxygen scavenging was beneficial to microorganisms in the cathode biofilm after 1 h of operation the catholyte was replaced with a fresh medium lacking l cystine and the higher current density was maintained during rest of cell operation time given that the conductivity of catholyte was not appreciably increased by the addition of l cysteine addition from 8 6 to 9 1 this suggests that the condition of the cathode biofilm once restored by the anoxic conditions could be maintained over time further studies on the effect of oxygen scavengers on system performance therefore are warranted as a method of improving system stability and performance 3 4 cathode biofilm community structure the biomass samples taken from the cathode of each mes system were analyzed for 16s rrna to investigate active microbial community a total of 187 687 of non chimeric quality filtered reads were obtained from two samples and they were clustered into 101 otus at 97 identity the most abundant 10 otus in each sample were shown in a heatmap with their relative abundance and taxonomic classification at the genus and phylum level table 1 the most abundantly enriched otu otu 1 35 7 belonged to the genus methanobrevibacter which is a well known hydrogenotrophic methanogen in anaerobic digestion ad yang et al 2019 many previous mes studies have shown that the genus methanobacterium has had the highest relative abundance in the cathode biofilms at lower current densities bian et al 2021 cheng et al 2009 marshall et al 2012 ragab et al 2020 siegert et al 2015a in addition this genus was abundant in studies where mecs were used in ad systems baek et al 2021 cai et al 2016 both cathode potentials and current densities can impact the abundance of different methanogens the relative abundance of methanobacterium and methanobrevibacter which belong to the same family of methanobacteraceae was found to be impacted by cathode potentials set at the start of an mes experiment li et al 2020 at startup using cathode potentials of 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 v produced an archaeal community almost exclusively dominated by methanobacterium while at more negative startup cathode potentials the relative abundance of methanobrevibacter increased to 9 at 1 0 v and then 74 at 1 1 v the authors proposed that the enrichment of methanobrevibacter at more negative cathode potentials was possibly because they have higher h2 thresholds 2 0 5 8 pa than those of methanobacterium 2 0 pa kim 2012 in another study methanobrevibacter had a much higher relative abundance 89 99 than methanobacterium with a higher current density and h2 production while its abundance decreased to 27 with a lower h2 production werner et al 2016 similarly methanobrevibacter predominated 86 100 on biocathodes using platinum coated cathode materials while the mes systems with other cathode materials e g plain carbon ni magnetite steel ferrihydrite fes and mos2 yielded biofilms enriched with methanobacterium siegert et al 2015b given that platinum is primarily used as a cathode catalyst for an efficient h2 production to reduce the high overpotential for proton reduction chae et al 2009 the emergence of active h2 production at the cathode in the later batch cycles might help to explain the predominance of methanobrevibacter for the bacterial community otu 2 belonging to the genus clostridium sensu stricto 1 had the highest relative abundance although it was only 10 9 the dominance of clostridium on the cathode in mes studies has have been previously reported although at higher relative abundances of 40 4 of the total bacterial community vidales et al 2021 clostridium are acetogenic bacteria which have been shown to convert co2 to acetate on electrodes logan et al 2019 nevin et al 2011 and their presence on the cathode here is consistent with the observation of acetate production in the later cycles fig 4 otus 3 and 5 belonged to genera eubacterium and azospira and showed distinct relative abundances between duplicate biocathodes members of the genus eubacterium are known as chemolithoautotrophs and have been found in biofilms on electrodes that were switched to operate as cathodes after functioning as anodes in sediment type mfcs pisciotta et al 2012 azospira is known to perform heterotrophic denitrification it was recently found to be abundant on the biocathode in a nitrogen removing bioelectrochemical system sun et al 2019 and this genus is known to use acetate as a carbon source under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions nam et al 2016 pseudomonas affiliated with otu 6 has been reported as a putative electrotroph that could uptake electrons from the cathode and survive on its surface li et al 2021 roy et al 2021 vidales et al 2021 alcaligenes were previously found from the anode biofilm but not from the cathode biofilm suggesting their minor role at the cathode in the mes process vidales et al 2021 the appearance of the genus gordonia might be due to possible oxygen leakage into the systems suggested by the result of l cystein test given that this genus is aerobic arenskötter et al 2004 the use of pure cultures of these or other microorganisms in the cathode chamber could lead to more effective controls on the specific chemical products propionate production from current density in bioelectrochemical systems is known to be performed by propionate producing bacteria such as members belonging to the genus propionibacterium emde and schink 1990 rabaey and rozendal 2010 although no species affiliated to propionibacterium were detected in our cathode biofilms two otus in our libraries were affiliated to the family propionibacteriaceae where the genus propionibacterium belong to both otus were not revealed at the genus level since the relative abundances of both otus were considerable 0 3 and 0 2 each data not shown they might be responsible for propionate production at the cathode 3 5 comparison of methane production rates to previous studies the methane production rate obtained here of 2 9 1 2 l l d platinized titanium felt anode fig 2 was larger than that in most previous reports and the applied voltage eap 3 1 v was also much lower than in these previous studies when reported for example in a study by zhou et al 2021 the methane production rate was 1 6 l l d our calculation based on 202 l m2 d and the reported cathode area with an applied voltage of eap 5 5 v compared to 3 1 v here zhou et al 2021 the use of set cathode potentials could be expected to improve methane production rates since the anode potential will vary to enable the set current however the use of very high cell voltages to produce this current would result in a reduction of energy efficiency in a study by kracke et al 2020 the methane production rate was indicated to be a record high of 1 4 l l d at a set current density of 10 a m2 kracke et al 2020 however the cell voltage used to obtain this result was not reported important differences between their study and ours includes their use of nimo catalyzed cathode a two bottle architecture and pure cultures of the hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanococcus maripaludis here we used no cathode catalyst and only anaerobic sludge as the inoculum in our reactor which had a much different architecture a higher volumetric methane production rate of 4 3 l l d was obtained by zhou et al 2020 with a set current density of 35 a m2 and cathodes made of granular activated carbon gac zhou et al 2020 however the methane production rate was only 1 0 l l d at the same current density of 10 a m2 used by kracke et al 2020 and the cell voltage needed to produce this current was not reported assuming a linear relationship between current and methane production this suggests the system used by zhou et al 2020 would have produced a smaller rate of 2 1 l l d at the same current density as that used here 17 4 a m2 the lack of data on cell voltages does not allow for direct comparisons of methane production relative to energy input the very low ohmic resistance of the vapor fed zero gap electrode system used here 2 4 0 5 mω m2 suggests that the methane production rates were superior to previous studies based on the energy needed to be added to achieve these high volumetric methane production rates the ohmic resistance measured in our study by the current interrupt method was 2 4 0 5 mω m2 which was much lower than that of conventional mecs made with cube cell or tubular design 20 25 mω m2 cario et al 2019 guo et al 2017 in addition the measured resistance showed similar values to those obtained for zero gap mecs 2 2 mω m2 rossi et al 2021a indicating that no space between anode and cathode i e the electrodes pressed against to the ion exchange membrane was a key to reduce the overall resistance and thus improve electrochemical performance although the experiment here was conducted in a small reactor size a novel design developed here could be up scaled for future applications there are several advantages of this reactor design for up scaling compared to the conventional mes systems using a liquid anolyte first it is not necessary to provide electrolyte into the anode chamber so we can reduce the energy and cost for preparing and pumping buffer solutions second there is lower possibility of unwanted reactions on the anode such as chemical precipitation catalyst leaching and dissolution and oxidation of chemical species because the anode does not directly contact with the liquid buffer rossi et al 2021a in addition an acidic anolyte and basic catholyte are not produced in this configuration that would require further treatment in contrast there are some possible challenges when this mes configuration becomes bigger since the catholyte flowed through the carbon felt in the current reactor design and thus there is always the potential for electrode clogging over time zhai and dong 2022 4 conclusions a newly designed zero gap and vapor fed mes reactor enabled one of the highest methane production rates of 2 9 1 2 l l d at an eap 3 1 v using electrodes as an electron donor and co2 as the carbon source the vapor fed anode pressed against a cem enabled selective transport of protons to the cathode as demonstrated by a catholyte ph that was maintained at a circumneutral ph of 6 6 7 2 over time the zero gap configuration enabled a low ohmic resistance of 2 4 0 5 mω m2 which is much lower than previous systems over multiple cycles vfas were also produced showing that competition for the electrons donated by the cathode to the biofilm resulted in production of multiple chemical products the cathode biofilm was mainly comprised of the hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanobrevibacter and the acetogenic bacterium clostridium sensu stricto 1 together suggesting their roles in producing both methane and vfas from co2 as final products some hydrogen was produced along with the other chemical products suggesting that the cathode design could be improved to avoid production of unwanted chemical products in these systems the novel reactor design here could lead to efficient chemical production from electrical current compared to previous systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

15944,effective removal of human pathogenic viruses is an indispensable yet rarely studied aspect for sustainable treatment of domestic wastewater by anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr in this study the interface behaviors and removal mechanisms of norovirus genogroup i gi genogroup ii gii and rotavirus a from domestic wastewater was systematically investigated in a one stage anmbr on average norovirus gi gii and rotavirus were reduced by 4 64 5 00 and 2 31 logs respectively viruses tended to be transferred to larger sized suspended solids from sewage influent to the mixed liquor and the weight specific concentration of the virus in 100 μm particles of the mixed liquor was significantly higher than that of sewage indicating a particle scale dependent affinity with the virus in series membrane filtration test showed the main contribution of the membrane retention which was dominated by the bio cake layer and the pristine membrane while the membrane and associated pore foulants can retain viruses in a filtration resistance efficient way an unsteady state mass balance model revealed that free viruses in the bulk liquid of anmbr were minimally attached to the cake layer but mainly retained by the membrane and pore foulants 99 in addition despite the small virus decay rates in the mixed liquor the associated contribution increased with run time due to the prolonged sludge retention time these insights into virus behaviors and removal mechanisms may provide novel regulation strategies for enhanced virus removal by anmbr graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biomass scale virus partitioning virus attachment model simulation multi layer retention virus decay 1 introduction anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr is becoming of research interest in sustainable domestic wastewater treatment since it can generate biomass energy and produce less sludge while achieving a similar quality of effluent to aerobic treatment mccarty et al 2011 shin and bae 2018 over the past decade many attempts in both lab scale and pilot scale studies have suggested its economic and environmental advantages pretel et al 2016 smith et al 2014 domestic wastewater harbors plenty of human pathogens among which viruses may be of primary health concern for water reuse due to its small size low infection dose and acute health consequences depending on the terminal reuse such as unrestricted irrigation and groundwater recharge targeted logarithm reduction values lrvs of viruses range from 6 to 12 for the wastewater reclamation process u s environmental protection agency 2017 world health organization 2006 to achieve the goal understanding the mechanism of virus removal in anmbr was key to improve performance however thus far little is known about the efficiency and associated mechanisms of the viral pathogen removal during domestic wastewater treatment by anmbr related studies have been mostly carried out in aerobic mbr aembr chaudhry et al 2015a chaudhry et al 2015b simmons et al 2011 wu et al 2010 zhu et al 2021 although both of them integrate the bioreactor with the membrane module they differ from each other in terms of the physiochemical environment microbial niche and ecology metabolic products and characteristics of membrane fouling da silva et al 2011 harb et al 2016 xiong et al 2016 yao et al 2020 thus direct extrapolation of the performance and mechanism of virus reduction from aembr may be inappropriate to guide the practice of anmbr for water reuse safety on the other hand virus aggregation and attachment to other particles can be influenced by its surface morphology and functional groups gerba and betancourt 2017 gutierrez et al 2010 gutierrez and nguyen 2012 a previous study has documented that the log reduction rate differed by up to 2 8 logs for viruses with a similar size and net negative charge in a bench scale mbr chaudhry et al 2015a therefore real pathogenic viruses not just widely used bacteriophage surrogates should be investigated to better understand their fate in anmbr regardless of mbr configuration mechanisms of virus removal are generally summarized as virus attachment to biomass retention by the membrane and associated surface foulants and inactivation in the mixed liquor viruses bound to the biomass which is normally larger than the ultrafiltration cut off limit can hardly pass the membrane while free viruses can be sequentially retained by the surface fouling layer and membrane pore foulants and the breakthrough part is responsible for the final permeate quality as far the interface behavior of viruses in membrane bioreactor has not been well understood microscopic characterization of the driving factors such as virus partitioning between the liquid and solid phases the associated preference regarding the biomass scale and contribution of each fouling component for virus retention is needed to guide virus removal application in the real world in this study the removal mechanisms of anmbr were systemically characterized for typical enteric viruses in domestic wastewater in particular virus behaviors on the solid liquid interface of the mixed liquor and interaction with the membrane foulants were explored to better inform anmbr potential for enhancing virus removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 anmbr bioreactor setup a bench scale submerged anmbr was constructed with polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane in the nominal pore size of 0 1 μm in the laboratory of a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp figure s1 the wastewater influent after the drum screen basket 0 2 1 mm mesh size of the wwtp was used as the influent substrate and treated with the hydrological retention time hrt of 8 h at room temperature 20 c the concentration of cod in the substrate feed was 484 82 mg l and 93 was removed via the anmbr the yield of biogas varied between 0 28 to 0 58 l l reactor d and methane accounted for 81 2 2 sample processing and rna extraction the concentrations of viruses including human rotavirus a and noroviruses of genogroup i gi and gii were routinely monitored for the anmbr influent effluent and mixed liquor in consideration of the mbr permeate yield and the potential virus decay along with the sampling duration 5 10 l of effluent were collected each time samples of sewage and the mixed liquor were centrifugated at the speed of 13 000 g for 1 h to characterize virus partitioning between liquid and solid phases the concentration of suspended solids ss g l was calculated by weighing the residue of the isolated pellets after oven drying for 24 h at 105 c samples of sewage influents the mixed liquor permeate effluents and aspirated supernatants from centrifugation were pre conditioned with mgcl2 solution at the final concentration of 0 1 m and then filtered through membrane filters with the nominal pore size of 0 22 um baird et al 2017 rna from both filters and solid pellets 1 5 g were extracted with water rna kit and soil rna kit mo bio laboratories ca respectively as per the instructions rna quality and concentrations were determined with microvolume uv vis spectrometer nanodrop ca rna aliquots were reverse transcribed into cdna with rt master kit takara japan and then stored at 80 c samples with potential amplification inhibition were identified and excluded with spiked salmon sperm dna as previously reported wu et al 2017 for direct comparison between the solid and liquid phases the amount of virus in the suspended solids was normalized with the liquid volume of the sample 2 3 reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr quantification of human rotavirus a and noroviruses of genogroup i gi and gii and genotype gii 4 were performed on abi 7500 applied biosystems ca for 45 thermal cycles with primers and probes as previously reported table s1 vergara et al 2015 zeng et al 2008 briefly rna standards of qpcr were acquired by in vitro transcription primescript rt master mix takara japan of synthesized dna sequence which contains t7 promoter and targeted sequence for each virus dilutions of the standards in ten fold series were reverse transcribed and amplified in triplicates for five experiment runs premix ex taq takara japan to generate a master standard curve for each virus rna samples cdna were detected in duplicates and the gene copy numbers were calculated with the cycle threshold values ct which were reported at the same fluorescence threshold set for the standard curve 2 4 virus partitioning in the mixed liquor to determine the size range of particles with which viruses were associated samples of sewage influent and the mixed liquor were filtered through a cascade of cellulose acetate filters with sequentially smaller cut off pore sizes of 100 μm 50 μm 25 μm 10 μm 5 μm 1 μm and 0 45 μm suspended solids larger than the pore size were considered to be screened out and those in the filtrates were in smaller sizes besides weight specific concentration of viruses bound to different sized particles was analyzed specifically low angle laser light scattering lalls was conducted to obtain the granulometric distribution with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer microtrac inc u s a the weight of particles between adjacent cut offs was estimated with the volume ratio and ss of the sample the weight specific concentration of particles of 10 μm was calculated in aggregate due to the difficulty in quantifying small sized particle weights 2 5 measurement of virus decay rate constants decay of viruses in the mixed liquor solid and liquid phases was investigated by incubating anmbr mixed liquor samples in serum bottles filled with nitrogen gas at room temperature two samples were retrieved at 0 6 9 12 19 and 30 d to measure the concentration in the mixed liquor and those in the solid and liquid fractions respectively the decay process was fitted with the pseudo first order model expressed as lo g 10 c t c 0 k d t d where t d is the time day d k d is the decay constant d 1 and c 0 and c t is the virus concentration at 0 d and t d genome copies per liter gc l 2 6 modeling of the anmbr in this study viruses from the wastewater were reduced in the anmbr by the rejection effect of the membrane and associated foulants retention accompanied decay and loss due to sludge discharge viruses bound to the biomass were assumed to be totally rejected before the membrane and build up in the bio cake layer along with the biomass deposition and free flowing viruses were assumed to be sequentially retained by the bio cake layer the membrane and pore foulants since the concentrations of the viruses were observed to gradually increase in the mixed liquor an unsteady state material balance was established as following 1 v d c d t q c infuent c permeate d w d t c s ss β fq c l β 1 f θ q c l k l c l v k s c s v q w c where c represents the virus concentration in the mixed liquor gc l v is the work volume of the bioreactor l t is the run time of the bioreactor d and q represents the flow rate of the feed influent and the permeate l d w is the dry weight of the cake layer foulants g which was assumed to be steadily developed through the deposition of the sludge biomass with a constant net deposition rate for simplification charfi et al 2017 k is the decay rate constant d 1 and subscripts l and s denote the liquid and solid phases respectively β is introduced to correct the change in the concentration of the free virus in the vicinity of membrane surface due to the potential concentration polarization and expressed as the concentration ratio of the free virus next to the cake layer to that in the bulk liquid rathore et al 2014 f and θ is the proportion of free viruses retained by the cake layer and subsequently the membrane and associated pore foulants respectively referred as to membrane retention factors hereafter and q w is the sludge discharge rate l d which represented the volume of the mixed liquor piped out per day the virus concentrations in the liquid and solid phases were represented as c l c p l and c s c p s respectively gc l with p denoting the proportion of viruses partitioned in the corresponding phase to characterize the rejection process of free viruses at the membrane interface the membrane retention factors were estimated specifically accumulation of the free virus in the bio cake was described as following 2 d c c a k e w d t q β f c l d w d t c s s s k s c c a k e w where c cake is the virus density in the bio cake gc g which was quantified by measuring the concentration in the rinsing solution and based on the definitions of the membrane retention factors the following equation is obtained 3 c p e r m e a t e β 1 f 1 θ c l by regressing with the virus measurements and combining eqs 1 3 the correction and retention factors of β f and θ were estimated 2 7 membrane contribution in series filtration test was conducted ex situ to estimate the lrv contribution of the fouled membrane wu et al 2010 specifically the fouled membrane was recovered from the bioreactor when the trans membrane pressure tmp sharply increased and then sequentially rinsed with pressured water to remove the bio cake layer immersed in 0 1 naclo solution for 24 h to remove organic foulants in the membrane pores and immersed in 10 g l citric acid solution for 4 h to remove inorganic foulants correspondingly sewage influent was sequentially filtered through the intact fouled membrane the physically cleaned membrane the membrane with pore organics removed the membrane with pore inorganics removed and a pristine membrane in each step virus concentrations in the feed and permeate were determined to calculate the corresponding lrv specific lrv contributed by the cake layer organic foulants inorganic foulants and irrecoverable foulants was obtained by subtracting the lrv during the latter step from that during the former one likewise deionized water was also filtered in each step to calculate the corresponding flux resistance m 1 as previously reported lee and kim 2014 li et al 2019 2 8 mechanism contribution to log removal the overall lrv and in series lrvs associated with the filtration experiment was calculated by the following equation 4 lrv lo g 10 c final c initial where c final and c initial gc l were the virus concentrations in the permeate effluent and feed influent samples respectively the lrv contribution due to virus attachment to sludge was calculated by subtracting those due to membrane retention from the overall lrv the lrv contributions due to decay of the virus in the liquid and solid phases and the mixed liquor were estimated by modifying the eq 4 as following 5 l r v decay lo g 10 c decay c n o d e c a y where c decay and c no decay were the hypothetical virus concentrations with or without the decay impact and they were predicted with eq 1 by setting the decay rate constant k to the experimental measurement and zero respectively chaudhry et al 2015b 2 9 data analysis the virus concentration of the permeate samples with no amplification signal during the routine monitoring was left censored to half of the limit of detection lod for reasonable estimation of lrv a parametric sensitivity analysis of the membrane retention factors to possible changes in the permeate concentration was conducted to examine the impact of this data manipulation to estimate the membrane retention factors and lrvs due to decay monte carlo simulation was employed to reduce the uncertainties induced by the virus decay constants k and the phase partitioning factor p by performing 10 000 trials for each test during each trial a random parameter value was drawn from the corresponding distribution table s2 3 results 3 1 virus fate through anmbr during the investigation period viruses were rarely detected in the effluent n 18 except for two samples for hunov gii and five samples for rotavirus whose ct values approached the limits of detection by assigning half of each lod to those negative samples the averaged overall lrvs were estimated to be 4 64 1 23 5 00 1 51 and 2 31 1 34 95 c i for norovirus gi gii and rotavirus a respectively viruses were considerably accumulated in the mixed liquor and predominantly enriched in the biomass fig 1 likewise the majority of the virus in sewage were associated with suspended solids on average 99 48 and 90 for hunov gi gii and rotavirus a respectively table s3 regardless of the virus state free or bound to suspended solids the corresponding concentration of the mixed liquor was higher than that of sewage 3 2 virus partitioning in the suspended solids viruses were universally dispersed in sewage particles of different sizes while in the mixed liquor they were bimodally concentrated in particles with equivalent diameters of 5 25 μm and 100 μm fig 2 although there was a similar distribution pattern of the particle size between the sewage and the mixed liquor figure s2 in particular about 30 of norovirus and 90 of rotavirus in the solid phase of the mixed liquor were associated to particles of 100 μm despite the small proportion of these particles figure s2 regarding the small sized particles viruses in particles of 5 μm only accounted for 3 in the mixed liquor in contrast to the number of 24 40 for the counterpart in the sewage the virus concentration normalized by the particle weight tended to decrease with the particle size for the small scaled suspended solids 100 μm in the sewage and mixed liquor with the highest concentration in the particles of 25 μm in the mixed liquor the weight specific concentrations of the norovirus in particles of 100 μm were comparable to those of 10 μm and the difference was even larger for the rotavirus 1 5 log furthermore the weight specific virus concentrations in 100 μm particles in the mixed liquor were significantly higher 1 1 6 log10 gc g than that in the sewage fig 3 3 3 virus decay and associated lrvs virus decay constants in the mixed liquor ranged from 0 016 to 0 176 d 1 table s4 viruses in the liquid fraction decayed faster than in the solid fraction the difference between the decay rates in the mixed liquor and the solid phase were not statistically significant for all the viruses p 0 05 data not shown probably owing to the high virus partitioning proportion in the suspended solids lrvs due to virus decay was found to increase with time and reached a plateau of 0 50 0 10 and 0 17 after running for 100 days fig 4 which was proportional to the virus decay rate virus decay in the matrix of the solid phase dominantly contributed to the overall lrv while the contribution of decay in the liquid phase was limited 3 4 free virus behavior at the membrane interface viruses were significantly enriched in the cake layer with averaged concentrations 0 83 1 34 log10 gc g 7 22 times higher than those in the sludge table s5 indicating accumulation of free viruses in the bio cake the concentration of the free virus at the membrane interface was not significantly changed from the bulk concentration suggesting that no evident diffusive boundary layer formed less than 8 free viruses were attached to the cake layer when flowing through however 99 free viruses lrv of 2 11 5 45 were retained by the membrane and associated pore foulants table 1 parametric analysis showed that possible virus concentrations of the effluent posed limited influence on the factors associated with the concentration polarization and bio cake layer retention while the pore retention factor θ increased with the lower effluent concentration figure s3 3 5 mechanism contribution to virus removal in series filtration test showed that the fouled membrane directly retained both free and bound viruses of the influent by 2 82 4 71 log10 which was followed by the lrv due to sludge attachment fig 5 a specifically viruses were mainly retained by the cake layer followed by the pristine membrane the cake layer contributed 0 6 lrv for rotavirus and up to 1 6 lrv for norovirus gii pristine membrane was showed to remove 2 01 2 45 and 1 81 log10 norovirus gi gii and rotavirus respectively the lrv for each part is positively correlated with the corresponding resistance figure s4 however the inorganic foulants in membrane pores had the highest specific lrv relative to the filtration resistance while the bio cake layer had the least one fig 5b 4 discussion in this study human pathogenic viruses were removed with a relatively high efficiency in the anmbr with rarely detected effluent samples during the investigation period we systematically investigated the removal mechanism due to membrane retention biomass attachment and decay inactivation to discriminate the contribution between membrane rejection and biomass attachment we used raw sewage as the feed in the in series filtration experiment the virus lrv due to sludge attachment has previously been calculated as the logarithm reduction between the concentration of the influent and that of the bulk liquid of the mixed liquor chaudhry et al 2015b shang et al 2005 ueda and horan 2000 which neglected the contribution of virus laden solid contents in the feed sewage and thus could overestimate the associated lrv indeed hirani et al 2010 documented that the reduction rate of indigenous bacteriophage ms2 was higher compared to seeded ms2 and was not liable to be influenced by the membrane pore size because of a higher degree of particle association of the indigenous coliphage in this study 48 99 of viruses were associated with the solid phase of sewage in sizes far larger than that of the membrane pore and up to 90 viruses were retained by the pristine membrane considering the intrinsic high partitioning rate of viruses in suspended solids of sewage using sewage as the feed influent in the in series membrane rejection test aid in better estimating the real contribution of sludge adsorption attachment of viruses to sludge 90 was elucidated to be one of the primary mechanisms of virus removal once fed in the bioreactor viruses were found to be enriched into larger sized particles in the mixed liquor especially in the particles of 100 μm in this study which is expected to further promote the membrane physical rejection of the bound viruses at the microscopic level virus attachment is determined by both the number of active binding sites and the interforce between virus and the particle surface which depend on the specific surface area ssa or the particle scale and the material surface property respectively here in this study a size level comparison between sewage and mixed liquor allowed differentiating between the two mechanisms of interaction since the weight specific virus concentration increased with the decreased particle size in the sewage and mixed liquor 100 μm ssa is the main contributor in this range however for larger particles 100 μm the attached virus amount in the biomass of the mixed liquor was comparable to the amount of 25 μm biomass and considerably higher than the counterpart in sewage this enhanced and ssa independent interaction is thereby attributed to the surface property of the biomass which is intrinsically different from the sewage counterpart in terms of composition sludge flocs were formed with cohesive microbial aggregates linked together by extracellular polymer substances eps among the components constituting eps polysaccharide may be of particular importance in binding with viruses as the human norovirus and rotavirus use glycans of histo blood group antigens as receptors coreceptors esseili et al 2012 hu et al 2012 since polysaccharide components of eps constitute the scaffold of the floc architecture flemming and wingender 2010 larger aggregates own more adhesive polysaccharides to maintain the mechanical stability of self structure shi and liu 2021 for instance a previous study wang et al 2014 has revealed that eps of active sludge owned a higher polysaccharide protein ratio in the floc level compared to that in the microcolony level therefore higher content of polysaccharide in large scale sludge flocs might lead to the enhanced enrichment of viruses the bimodal distribution of viruses in the biomass particles of 5 25 μm and 100 μm might be due to the superimposing effect of the dominant small particles of the anmbr mixed liquor medium φ41 μm figure s2 and the high virus affinity of 100 μm biomass from the perspective of anmbr operation regulation measures such as expanding the floc size is inferred to enhance the biotic effect of virus adhesion and thus improve the efficiency of virus removal in this study virus decay rates were limited particularly in the solid phase while previous studies in aembr showed much faster decay rate constants chaudhry et al 2015b wu et al 2010 in contrast to the aerobic condition anmbr provides an environment of low oxidation reduction potential orp suppressed predation and enzymatic decay barrios hernandez et al 2021 regarding the decay associated lrv the decay lrv increased with the run time and the corresponding median lrv reached up to 0 5 68 reduction for norovirus gi in the end this is achieved by the long sludge retention time srt due to the membrane retention which decouples the water and sludge flow and the high virus partitioning rate in the solid phase considering the enriched virus concentration of the mixed liquor the total number of decayed viruses inside the bioreactor was enormous thus despite the disadvantage of limited decay rate in anmbr the long srt and less residual production could decrease the ultimate health risk associated with sludge disposal since the virus decay was evaluated by rt qpcr detection targeting the virus capsid encapsulated rna the decay contribution is a conservative estimate of the virus inactivation here in this study it is also worthy of noting that the one stage bioreactor adopted in this study attains a relatively neutral ph a two stage system is anticipated to facilitate decay due to a lower ph and high ammonia concentration associated with the separate anaerobic digestion and methane generation stage respectively as free viruses in the liquid phase are prone to break through the membrane and responsible for the permeate quality their membrane interface behaviors were quantitatively interpreted in this study the higher virus concentration in the bio cake compared to that in the sludge indicated accumulation of free viruses apart from the deposition of virus laden sludge further analysis showed that about 4 8 of free viruses in the bulk liquid were immobilized in the bio cake layer in contrast 99 of free viruses were retained by the membrane and associated pore foulants which eventually guaranteed the permeate quality in series filtration test with feed sewage showed that they were primarily retained by the cake layer followed by the pristine membrane considering the low retention rate of the cake layer for free viruses the physical sieve of the high virus laden biomass was the predominant removal mechanism for the cake layer on the other hand despite this relatively high lrv contribution the cake layer showed the lowest resistance specific lrv while the membrane and pore foulants owned the highest ones implying a much higher virus rejection efficiency in terms of the permeate flux throughput the resistance specific lrv of the membrane was 8 12 times higher than that of the bio cake which probably resulted from the different rejection targets of bound and free viruses for the cake layer and the membrane and associated pore foulants respectively in general membrane fouling is regarded as detrimental to the permeate throughput and operational cost xiao et al 2019 the needs for alleviating the fouling and enhancing virus rejection apparently result in a paradox by analyzing the resistance specific lrv of individual fouling component a delicate balance between the acceptable flux throughput and the high rate of virus removal could be anticipated by regulating the fouling process in fact previous studies have showed that the pore fouling and bio cake layers are developed by initial deposition of soluble microbial products smp and latter microbial adhesion lei et al 2021 meng et al 2017 and dominance of either fouling type can be regulated by the organic loading rate olr chen et al 2017 future works on the dynamic relationships between virus rejection and resistance should be conducted when different kinds of membrane fouling develop limitations of the present study includes the uncertainties associated to the left censored virus concentrations for the effluent samples and variations in the lrv contribution due to the gradually increased membrane fouling the parametric sensitivity analysis showed that a lower effluent concentration suggested enhanced retention of free viruses however substitution with half of the lod for the non detects was probably a reasonable estimation here in this study since the concentrations of the partial positive detects of the effluent samples approached the lod regarding the lrv estimation dynamic contribution of the membrane foulants has been previously documented to increase with the operation time after backwashing membrane chaudhry et al 2015b during the fouling development the concentration polarization and retention factors of the membrane might change over time for example the introduction of smp in the pores of the cake deposits and the membrane can decrease the porosity and lead to a higher rejection rate the model estimates of those values for the free virus thus represented the averaged level throughout the study runtime meanwhile the lrv values measured with the filtration test in this study represented the high efficiency stage attributable to severe fouling as evidenced by the sharply increased tmp prior to demounting the membrane module after all by investigating the virus behaviors inside the anmbr and at the membrane interface this study provided an insight into potential regulation strategies of anmbr to ensure the safety of water reuse 5 conclusions virus removal was improved due to enrichment in the biomass of the mixed liquor which has a scale dependent affinity with viruses biomass particles of 100 μm had an extra virus binding capability probably owing to the high polysaccharide proportion of eps the removal of viruses in the anmbr was mainly achieved by the biomass attachment and the membrane retention of which the bio cake layer and the pristine membrane were the main drivers while the membrane and associated pore foulants worked in a resistance efficient way and the membrane was key to rejecting breakthrough prone free viruses in the bulk liquid to ensure final effluent quality viruses slowly decayed in the one stage anmbr but the prolonged sludge retention by the membrane improved the associated removal effect potential regulation strategies of anmbr should be investigated in

15944,effective removal of human pathogenic viruses is an indispensable yet rarely studied aspect for sustainable treatment of domestic wastewater by anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr in this study the interface behaviors and removal mechanisms of norovirus genogroup i gi genogroup ii gii and rotavirus a from domestic wastewater was systematically investigated in a one stage anmbr on average norovirus gi gii and rotavirus were reduced by 4 64 5 00 and 2 31 logs respectively viruses tended to be transferred to larger sized suspended solids from sewage influent to the mixed liquor and the weight specific concentration of the virus in 100 μm particles of the mixed liquor was significantly higher than that of sewage indicating a particle scale dependent affinity with the virus in series membrane filtration test showed the main contribution of the membrane retention which was dominated by the bio cake layer and the pristine membrane while the membrane and associated pore foulants can retain viruses in a filtration resistance efficient way an unsteady state mass balance model revealed that free viruses in the bulk liquid of anmbr were minimally attached to the cake layer but mainly retained by the membrane and pore foulants 99 in addition despite the small virus decay rates in the mixed liquor the associated contribution increased with run time due to the prolonged sludge retention time these insights into virus behaviors and removal mechanisms may provide novel regulation strategies for enhanced virus removal by anmbr graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biomass scale virus partitioning virus attachment model simulation multi layer retention virus decay 1 introduction anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr is becoming of research interest in sustainable domestic wastewater treatment since it can generate biomass energy and produce less sludge while achieving a similar quality of effluent to aerobic treatment mccarty et al 2011 shin and bae 2018 over the past decade many attempts in both lab scale and pilot scale studies have suggested its economic and environmental advantages pretel et al 2016 smith et al 2014 domestic wastewater harbors plenty of human pathogens among which viruses may be of primary health concern for water reuse due to its small size low infection dose and acute health consequences depending on the terminal reuse such as unrestricted irrigation and groundwater recharge targeted logarithm reduction values lrvs of viruses range from 6 to 12 for the wastewater reclamation process u s environmental protection agency 2017 world health organization 2006 to achieve the goal understanding the mechanism of virus removal in anmbr was key to improve performance however thus far little is known about the efficiency and associated mechanisms of the viral pathogen removal during domestic wastewater treatment by anmbr related studies have been mostly carried out in aerobic mbr aembr chaudhry et al 2015a chaudhry et al 2015b simmons et al 2011 wu et al 2010 zhu et al 2021 although both of them integrate the bioreactor with the membrane module they differ from each other in terms of the physiochemical environment microbial niche and ecology metabolic products and characteristics of membrane fouling da silva et al 2011 harb et al 2016 xiong et al 2016 yao et al 2020 thus direct extrapolation of the performance and mechanism of virus reduction from aembr may be inappropriate to guide the practice of anmbr for water reuse safety on the other hand virus aggregation and attachment to other particles can be influenced by its surface morphology and functional groups gerba and betancourt 2017 gutierrez et al 2010 gutierrez and nguyen 2012 a previous study has documented that the log reduction rate differed by up to 2 8 logs for viruses with a similar size and net negative charge in a bench scale mbr chaudhry et al 2015a therefore real pathogenic viruses not just widely used bacteriophage surrogates should be investigated to better understand their fate in anmbr regardless of mbr configuration mechanisms of virus removal are generally summarized as virus attachment to biomass retention by the membrane and associated surface foulants and inactivation in the mixed liquor viruses bound to the biomass which is normally larger than the ultrafiltration cut off limit can hardly pass the membrane while free viruses can be sequentially retained by the surface fouling layer and membrane pore foulants and the breakthrough part is responsible for the final permeate quality as far the interface behavior of viruses in membrane bioreactor has not been well understood microscopic characterization of the driving factors such as virus partitioning between the liquid and solid phases the associated preference regarding the biomass scale and contribution of each fouling component for virus retention is needed to guide virus removal application in the real world in this study the removal mechanisms of anmbr were systemically characterized for typical enteric viruses in domestic wastewater in particular virus behaviors on the solid liquid interface of the mixed liquor and interaction with the membrane foulants were explored to better inform anmbr potential for enhancing virus removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 anmbr bioreactor setup a bench scale submerged anmbr was constructed with polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane in the nominal pore size of 0 1 μm in the laboratory of a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp figure s1 the wastewater influent after the drum screen basket 0 2 1 mm mesh size of the wwtp was used as the influent substrate and treated with the hydrological retention time hrt of 8 h at room temperature 20 c the concentration of cod in the substrate feed was 484 82 mg l and 93 was removed via the anmbr the yield of biogas varied between 0 28 to 0 58 l l reactor d and methane accounted for 81 2 2 sample processing and rna extraction the concentrations of viruses including human rotavirus a and noroviruses of genogroup i gi and gii were routinely monitored for the anmbr influent effluent and mixed liquor in consideration of the mbr permeate yield and the potential virus decay along with the sampling duration 5 10 l of effluent were collected each time samples of sewage and the mixed liquor were centrifugated at the speed of 13 000 g for 1 h to characterize virus partitioning between liquid and solid phases the concentration of suspended solids ss g l was calculated by weighing the residue of the isolated pellets after oven drying for 24 h at 105 c samples of sewage influents the mixed liquor permeate effluents and aspirated supernatants from centrifugation were pre conditioned with mgcl2 solution at the final concentration of 0 1 m and then filtered through membrane filters with the nominal pore size of 0 22 um baird et al 2017 rna from both filters and solid pellets 1 5 g were extracted with water rna kit and soil rna kit mo bio laboratories ca respectively as per the instructions rna quality and concentrations were determined with microvolume uv vis spectrometer nanodrop ca rna aliquots were reverse transcribed into cdna with rt master kit takara japan and then stored at 80 c samples with potential amplification inhibition were identified and excluded with spiked salmon sperm dna as previously reported wu et al 2017 for direct comparison between the solid and liquid phases the amount of virus in the suspended solids was normalized with the liquid volume of the sample 2 3 reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr quantification of human rotavirus a and noroviruses of genogroup i gi and gii and genotype gii 4 were performed on abi 7500 applied biosystems ca for 45 thermal cycles with primers and probes as previously reported table s1 vergara et al 2015 zeng et al 2008 briefly rna standards of qpcr were acquired by in vitro transcription primescript rt master mix takara japan of synthesized dna sequence which contains t7 promoter and targeted sequence for each virus dilutions of the standards in ten fold series were reverse transcribed and amplified in triplicates for five experiment runs premix ex taq takara japan to generate a master standard curve for each virus rna samples cdna were detected in duplicates and the gene copy numbers were calculated with the cycle threshold values ct which were reported at the same fluorescence threshold set for the standard curve 2 4 virus partitioning in the mixed liquor to determine the size range of particles with which viruses were associated samples of sewage influent and the mixed liquor were filtered through a cascade of cellulose acetate filters with sequentially smaller cut off pore sizes of 100 μm 50 μm 25 μm 10 μm 5 μm 1 μm and 0 45 μm suspended solids larger than the pore size were considered to be screened out and those in the filtrates were in smaller sizes besides weight specific concentration of viruses bound to different sized particles was analyzed specifically low angle laser light scattering lalls was conducted to obtain the granulometric distribution with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer microtrac inc u s a the weight of particles between adjacent cut offs was estimated with the volume ratio and ss of the sample the weight specific concentration of particles of 10 μm was calculated in aggregate due to the difficulty in quantifying small sized particle weights 2 5 measurement of virus decay rate constants decay of viruses in the mixed liquor solid and liquid phases was investigated by incubating anmbr mixed liquor samples in serum bottles filled with nitrogen gas at room temperature two samples were retrieved at 0 6 9 12 19 and 30 d to measure the concentration in the mixed liquor and those in the solid and liquid fractions respectively the decay process was fitted with the pseudo first order model expressed as lo g 10 c t c 0 k d t d where t d is the time day d k d is the decay constant d 1 and c 0 and c t is the virus concentration at 0 d and t d genome copies per liter gc l 2 6 modeling of the anmbr in this study viruses from the wastewater were reduced in the anmbr by the rejection effect of the membrane and associated foulants retention accompanied decay and loss due to sludge discharge viruses bound to the biomass were assumed to be totally rejected before the membrane and build up in the bio cake layer along with the biomass deposition and free flowing viruses were assumed to be sequentially retained by the bio cake layer the membrane and pore foulants since the concentrations of the viruses were observed to gradually increase in the mixed liquor an unsteady state material balance was established as following 1 v d c d t q c infuent c permeate d w d t c s ss β fq c l β 1 f θ q c l k l c l v k s c s v q w c where c represents the virus concentration in the mixed liquor gc l v is the work volume of the bioreactor l t is the run time of the bioreactor d and q represents the flow rate of the feed influent and the permeate l d w is the dry weight of the cake layer foulants g which was assumed to be steadily developed through the deposition of the sludge biomass with a constant net deposition rate for simplification charfi et al 2017 k is the decay rate constant d 1 and subscripts l and s denote the liquid and solid phases respectively β is introduced to correct the change in the concentration of the free virus in the vicinity of membrane surface due to the potential concentration polarization and expressed as the concentration ratio of the free virus next to the cake layer to that in the bulk liquid rathore et al 2014 f and θ is the proportion of free viruses retained by the cake layer and subsequently the membrane and associated pore foulants respectively referred as to membrane retention factors hereafter and q w is the sludge discharge rate l d which represented the volume of the mixed liquor piped out per day the virus concentrations in the liquid and solid phases were represented as c l c p l and c s c p s respectively gc l with p denoting the proportion of viruses partitioned in the corresponding phase to characterize the rejection process of free viruses at the membrane interface the membrane retention factors were estimated specifically accumulation of the free virus in the bio cake was described as following 2 d c c a k e w d t q β f c l d w d t c s s s k s c c a k e w where c cake is the virus density in the bio cake gc g which was quantified by measuring the concentration in the rinsing solution and based on the definitions of the membrane retention factors the following equation is obtained 3 c p e r m e a t e β 1 f 1 θ c l by regressing with the virus measurements and combining eqs 1 3 the correction and retention factors of β f and θ were estimated 2 7 membrane contribution in series filtration test was conducted ex situ to estimate the lrv contribution of the fouled membrane wu et al 2010 specifically the fouled membrane was recovered from the bioreactor when the trans membrane pressure tmp sharply increased and then sequentially rinsed with pressured water to remove the bio cake layer immersed in 0 1 naclo solution for 24 h to remove organic foulants in the membrane pores and immersed in 10 g l citric acid solution for 4 h to remove inorganic foulants correspondingly sewage influent was sequentially filtered through the intact fouled membrane the physically cleaned membrane the membrane with pore organics removed the membrane with pore inorganics removed and a pristine membrane in each step virus concentrations in the feed and permeate were determined to calculate the corresponding lrv specific lrv contributed by the cake layer organic foulants inorganic foulants and irrecoverable foulants was obtained by subtracting the lrv during the latter step from that during the former one likewise deionized water was also filtered in each step to calculate the corresponding flux resistance m 1 as previously reported lee and kim 2014 li et al 2019 2 8 mechanism contribution to log removal the overall lrv and in series lrvs associated with the filtration experiment was calculated by the following equation 4 lrv lo g 10 c final c initial where c final and c initial gc l were the virus concentrations in the permeate effluent and feed influent samples respectively the lrv contribution due to virus attachment to sludge was calculated by subtracting those due to membrane retention from the overall lrv the lrv contributions due to decay of the virus in the liquid and solid phases and the mixed liquor were estimated by modifying the eq 4 as following 5 l r v decay lo g 10 c decay c n o d e c a y where c decay and c no decay were the hypothetical virus concentrations with or without the decay impact and they were predicted with eq 1 by setting the decay rate constant k to the experimental measurement and zero respectively chaudhry et al 2015b 2 9 data analysis the virus concentration of the permeate samples with no amplification signal during the routine monitoring was left censored to half of the limit of detection lod for reasonable estimation of lrv a parametric sensitivity analysis of the membrane retention factors to possible changes in the permeate concentration was conducted to examine the impact of this data manipulation to estimate the membrane retention factors and lrvs due to decay monte carlo simulation was employed to reduce the uncertainties induced by the virus decay constants k and the phase partitioning factor p by performing 10 000 trials for each test during each trial a random parameter value was drawn from the corresponding distribution table s2 3 results 3 1 virus fate through anmbr during the investigation period viruses were rarely detected in the effluent n 18 except for two samples for hunov gii and five samples for rotavirus whose ct values approached the limits of detection by assigning half of each lod to those negative samples the averaged overall lrvs were estimated to be 4 64 1 23 5 00 1 51 and 2 31 1 34 95 c i for norovirus gi gii and rotavirus a respectively viruses were considerably accumulated in the mixed liquor and predominantly enriched in the biomass fig 1 likewise the majority of the virus in sewage were associated with suspended solids on average 99 48 and 90 for hunov gi gii and rotavirus a respectively table s3 regardless of the virus state free or bound to suspended solids the corresponding concentration of the mixed liquor was higher than that of sewage 3 2 virus partitioning in the suspended solids viruses were universally dispersed in sewage particles of different sizes while in the mixed liquor they were bimodally concentrated in particles with equivalent diameters of 5 25 μm and 100 μm fig 2 although there was a similar distribution pattern of the particle size between the sewage and the mixed liquor figure s2 in particular about 30 of norovirus and 90 of rotavirus in the solid phase of the mixed liquor were associated to particles of 100 μm despite the small proportion of these particles figure s2 regarding the small sized particles viruses in particles of 5 μm only accounted for 3 in the mixed liquor in contrast to the number of 24 40 for the counterpart in the sewage the virus concentration normalized by the particle weight tended to decrease with the particle size for the small scaled suspended solids 100 μm in the sewage and mixed liquor with the highest concentration in the particles of 25 μm in the mixed liquor the weight specific concentrations of the norovirus in particles of 100 μm were comparable to those of 10 μm and the difference was even larger for the rotavirus 1 5 log furthermore the weight specific virus concentrations in 100 μm particles in the mixed liquor were significantly higher 1 1 6 log10 gc g than that in the sewage fig 3 3 3 virus decay and associated lrvs virus decay constants in the mixed liquor ranged from 0 016 to 0 176 d 1 table s4 viruses in the liquid fraction decayed faster than in the solid fraction the difference between the decay rates in the mixed liquor and the solid phase were not statistically significant for all the viruses p 0 05 data not shown probably owing to the high virus partitioning proportion in the suspended solids lrvs due to virus decay was found to increase with time and reached a plateau of 0 50 0 10 and 0 17 after running for 100 days fig 4 which was proportional to the virus decay rate virus decay in the matrix of the solid phase dominantly contributed to the overall lrv while the contribution of decay in the liquid phase was limited 3 4 free virus behavior at the membrane interface viruses were significantly enriched in the cake layer with averaged concentrations 0 83 1 34 log10 gc g 7 22 times higher than those in the sludge table s5 indicating accumulation of free viruses in the bio cake the concentration of the free virus at the membrane interface was not significantly changed from the bulk concentration suggesting that no evident diffusive boundary layer formed less than 8 free viruses were attached to the cake layer when flowing through however 99 free viruses lrv of 2 11 5 45 were retained by the membrane and associated pore foulants table 1 parametric analysis showed that possible virus concentrations of the effluent posed limited influence on the factors associated with the concentration polarization and bio cake layer retention while the pore retention factor θ increased with the lower effluent concentration figure s3 3 5 mechanism contribution to virus removal in series filtration test showed that the fouled membrane directly retained both free and bound viruses of the influent by 2 82 4 71 log10 which was followed by the lrv due to sludge attachment fig 5 a specifically viruses were mainly retained by the cake layer followed by the pristine membrane the cake layer contributed 0 6 lrv for rotavirus and up to 1 6 lrv for norovirus gii pristine membrane was showed to remove 2 01 2 45 and 1 81 log10 norovirus gi gii and rotavirus respectively the lrv for each part is positively correlated with the corresponding resistance figure s4 however the inorganic foulants in membrane pores had the highest specific lrv relative to the filtration resistance while the bio cake layer had the least one fig 5b 4 discussion in this study human pathogenic viruses were removed with a relatively high efficiency in the anmbr with rarely detected effluent samples during the investigation period we systematically investigated the removal mechanism due to membrane retention biomass attachment and decay inactivation to discriminate the contribution between membrane rejection and biomass attachment we used raw sewage as the feed in the in series filtration experiment the virus lrv due to sludge attachment has previously been calculated as the logarithm reduction between the concentration of the influent and that of the bulk liquid of the mixed liquor chaudhry et al 2015b shang et al 2005 ueda and horan 2000 which neglected the contribution of virus laden solid contents in the feed sewage and thus could overestimate the associated lrv indeed hirani et al 2010 documented that the reduction rate of indigenous bacteriophage ms2 was higher compared to seeded ms2 and was not liable to be influenced by the membrane pore size because of a higher degree of particle association of the indigenous coliphage in this study 48 99 of viruses were associated with the solid phase of sewage in sizes far larger than that of the membrane pore and up to 90 viruses were retained by the pristine membrane considering the intrinsic high partitioning rate of viruses in suspended solids of sewage using sewage as the feed influent in the in series membrane rejection test aid in better estimating the real contribution of sludge adsorption attachment of viruses to sludge 90 was elucidated to be one of the primary mechanisms of virus removal once fed in the bioreactor viruses were found to be enriched into larger sized particles in the mixed liquor especially in the particles of 100 μm in this study which is expected to further promote the membrane physical rejection of the bound viruses at the microscopic level virus attachment is determined by both the number of active binding sites and the interforce between virus and the particle surface which depend on the specific surface area ssa or the particle scale and the material surface property respectively here in this study a size level comparison between sewage and mixed liquor allowed differentiating between the two mechanisms of interaction since the weight specific virus concentration increased with the decreased particle size in the sewage and mixed liquor 100 μm ssa is the main contributor in this range however for larger particles 100 μm the attached virus amount in the biomass of the mixed liquor was comparable to the amount of 25 μm biomass and considerably higher than the counterpart in sewage this enhanced and ssa independent interaction is thereby attributed to the surface property of the biomass which is intrinsically different from the sewage counterpart in terms of composition sludge flocs were formed with cohesive microbial aggregates linked together by extracellular polymer substances eps among the components constituting eps polysaccharide may be of particular importance in binding with viruses as the human norovirus and rotavirus use glycans of histo blood group antigens as receptors coreceptors esseili et al 2012 hu et al 2012 since polysaccharide components of eps constitute the scaffold of the floc architecture flemming and wingender 2010 larger aggregates own more adhesive polysaccharides to maintain the mechanical stability of self structure shi and liu 2021 for instance a previous study wang et al 2014 has revealed that eps of active sludge owned a higher polysaccharide protein ratio in the floc level compared to that in the microcolony level therefore higher content of polysaccharide in large scale sludge flocs might lead to the enhanced enrichment of viruses the bimodal distribution of viruses in the biomass particles of 5 25 μm and 100 μm might be due to the superimposing effect of the dominant small particles of the anmbr mixed liquor medium φ41 μm figure s2 and the high virus affinity of 100 μm biomass from the perspective of anmbr operation regulation measures such as expanding the floc size is inferred to enhance the biotic effect of virus adhesion and thus improve the efficiency of virus removal in this study virus decay rates were limited particularly in the solid phase while previous studies in aembr showed much faster decay rate constants chaudhry et al 2015b wu et al 2010 in contrast to the aerobic condition anmbr provides an environment of low oxidation reduction potential orp suppressed predation and enzymatic decay barrios hernandez et al 2021 regarding the decay associated lrv the decay lrv increased with the run time and the corresponding median lrv reached up to 0 5 68 reduction for norovirus gi in the end this is achieved by the long sludge retention time srt due to the membrane retention which decouples the water and sludge flow and the high virus partitioning rate in the solid phase considering the enriched virus concentration of the mixed liquor the total number of decayed viruses inside the bioreactor was enormous thus despite the disadvantage of limited decay rate in anmbr the long srt and less residual production could decrease the ultimate health risk associated with sludge disposal since the virus decay was evaluated by rt qpcr detection targeting the virus capsid encapsulated rna the decay contribution is a conservative estimate of the virus inactivation here in this study it is also worthy of noting that the one stage bioreactor adopted in this study attains a relatively neutral ph a two stage system is anticipated to facilitate decay due to a lower ph and high ammonia concentration associated with the separate anaerobic digestion and methane generation stage respectively as free viruses in the liquid phase are prone to break through the membrane and responsible for the permeate quality their membrane interface behaviors were quantitatively interpreted in this study the higher virus concentration in the bio cake compared to that in the sludge indicated accumulation of free viruses apart from the deposition of virus laden sludge further analysis showed that about 4 8 of free viruses in the bulk liquid were immobilized in the bio cake layer in contrast 99 of free viruses were retained by the membrane and associated pore foulants which eventually guaranteed the permeate quality in series filtration test with feed sewage showed that they were primarily retained by the cake layer followed by the pristine membrane considering the low retention rate of the cake layer for free viruses the physical sieve of the high virus laden biomass was the predominant removal mechanism for the cake layer on the other hand despite this relatively high lrv contribution the cake layer showed the lowest resistance specific lrv while the membrane and pore foulants owned the highest ones implying a much higher virus rejection efficiency in terms of the permeate flux throughput the resistance specific lrv of the membrane was 8 12 times higher than that of the bio cake which probably resulted from the different rejection targets of bound and free viruses for the cake layer and the membrane and associated pore foulants respectively in general membrane fouling is regarded as detrimental to the permeate throughput and operational cost xiao et al 2019 the needs for alleviating the fouling and enhancing virus rejection apparently result in a paradox by analyzing the resistance specific lrv of individual fouling component a delicate balance between the acceptable flux throughput and the high rate of virus removal could be anticipated by regulating the fouling process in fact previous studies have showed that the pore fouling and bio cake layers are developed by initial deposition of soluble microbial products smp and latter microbial adhesion lei et al 2021 meng et al 2017 and dominance of either fouling type can be regulated by the organic loading rate olr chen et al 2017 future works on the dynamic relationships between virus rejection and resistance should be conducted when different kinds of membrane fouling develop limitations of the present study includes the uncertainties associated to the left censored virus concentrations for the effluent samples and variations in the lrv contribution due to the gradually increased membrane fouling the parametric sensitivity analysis showed that a lower effluent concentration suggested enhanced retention of free viruses however substitution with half of the lod for the non detects was probably a reasonable estimation here in this study since the concentrations of the partial positive detects of the effluent samples approached the lod regarding the lrv estimation dynamic contribution of the membrane foulants has been previously documented to increase with the operation time after backwashing membrane chaudhry et al 2015b during the fouling development the concentration polarization and retention factors of the membrane might change over time for example the introduction of smp in the pores of the cake deposits and the membrane can decrease the porosity and lead to a higher rejection rate the model estimates of those values for the free virus thus represented the averaged level throughout the study runtime meanwhile the lrv values measured with the filtration test in this study represented the high efficiency stage attributable to severe fouling as evidenced by the sharply increased tmp prior to demounting the membrane module after all by investigating the virus behaviors inside the anmbr and at the membrane interface this study provided an insight into potential regulation strategies of anmbr to ensure the safety of water reuse 5 conclusions virus removal was improved due to enrichment in the biomass of the mixed liquor which has a scale dependent affinity with viruses biomass particles of 100 μm had an extra virus binding capability probably owing to the high polysaccharide proportion of eps the removal of viruses in the anmbr was mainly achieved by the biomass attachment and the membrane retention of which the bio cake layer and the pristine membrane were the main drivers while the membrane and associated pore foulants worked in a resistance efficient way and the membrane was key to rejecting breakthrough prone free viruses in the bulk liquid to ensure final effluent quality viruses slowly decayed in the one stage anmbr but the prolonged sludge retention by the membrane improved the associated removal effect potential regulation strategies of anmbr should be investigated in future works by modifying the biomass floc size and the membrane fouling development for enhanced virus removal funding this study was funded by the national key research and development program of
