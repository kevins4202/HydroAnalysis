15095,work in wastewater treatment plants wwtps can be associated with exposure to airborne microorganisms and endotoxin from the working environment the aim of this study was to obtain knowledge about whether serum levels of the markers of systemic inflammation c reactive protein crp and serum amyloid a saa are associated with personal exposure to endotoxin measured using the limulus endotoxinlimulus and the rfc endotoxinrfc assays as well as bacteria and fungi in a cohort of wwtp workers exposure and blood samples were collected for 11 workers over one year exposure to endotoxinlimulus day and endotoxinrfc day correlated significantly r 0 80 p 0 0001 n 104 but endotoxinlimulus day was 4 4 geometric mean gm value times higher than endotoxinrfc day p 0 0001 the endotoxinlimulus day endotoxinrfc day bacteria and fungal exposure as well as serum levels of crp day gm 1 4 mg l and saa day gm 12 mg l differed between workers serum levels of saaday correlated significantly with crpday r 0 30 p 0 0068 the serum levels of crpday were associated significantly with exposure to endotoxinlimulus day exposure saa and crp data were also analyzed as av of each season and saaseason was associated positively and significantly with endotoxinlimulus season and endotoxinrfc season and negatively with fungalseason exposure in conclusion crpday was associated with the endotoxinlimulus day and saaseason with endotoxinlimulus season and endotoxinrfc season exposure thus we hereby document that wwtp workers are exposed to airborne endotoxin which seems to have a

treatment plants wwtps has been shown to be associated with respiratory symptoms and impaired pulmonary function cyprowski et al 2015 rylander 1999 a few studies have found both an increased and a decreased risk of death due to arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease among wwtp workers reviewed in thorn and kerekes 2001 airborne endotoxin has repeatedly been found in elevated levels in wwtps lu et al 2020 oppliger et al 2005 uhrbrand et al 2011 and lower respiratory symptoms smit et al 2005 have been linked with occupational exposure to endotoxin a large number of different airborne bacterial species have been found in wwtps lu et al 2020 uhrbrand et al 2017 of which some are pathogenic such as enterococcus faecalis and e faecium uhrbrand et al 2017 clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus fracchia et al 2006 elevated levels of the inflammatory marker c reactive protein crp have been found in serum samples of wwtp workers exposed to bioaerosols heldal et al 2010 mattsby and rylander 1978 thorn and beijer 2004 and have been associated with impaired lung function among wwtp workers heldal et al 2019 increased levels of serum crp and amyloid a saa have been associated with airway inflammation takemura et al 2006 asthma kilic et al 2012 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease bozinovski et al 2008 in patients and increased risk of cardiovascular disease ridker et al 2000 likewise low grade chronic inflammation seems to be a risk factor for atherosclerosis packard and libby 2008 shah and lecis 2019 the chromogen kinetic limulus amoebocyte lysate limulus assay is the most widely used assay for measurement of occupational exposure to endotoxin lawniczek walczyk and górny 2010 liebers et al 2020 it is based on an endotoxin triggered enzyme cascade present in the hemolymph of the atlantic horseshoe crab an alternative to the limulus assay is the recombinant factor c rfc test which is based on a recombinant factor c enzyme it was developed to avoid the use of the horseshoe crab and to reduce the variability that arises from using different preparations of the limulus lysate thorne et al 2010 the rfc assay is expected to be used in the future as the method does not require animal material liebers et al 2020 to be able to use already published data obtained by the limulus method together with new data obtained by the rfc method it is important to obtain knowledge about the association between results obtained by the two methods the aim of the present study was to obtain knowledge about whether serum levels of crp and saa are associated with personal exposure to endotoxin measured using kinetic limulus assay endotoxinlimulus and the rfc assay endotoxinrfc as well as exposure to bacteria and fungi in a cohort of wwtp workers 2 materials and methods the study has obtained ethical approval id h 3 2014 028 2 1 the plant and participating workers sampling was conducted at a wwtp in denmark located in zealand sampling was performed by two occupational hygienists monthly over one year from june 2014 to june 2015 a total of 14 wastewater workers employed at the wwtp were enrolled and followed through one year with 12 sampling days their work tasks included observations of the different wastewater processes industrial cleaning and maintenance of the participants 11 were male and 3 were female employees they were between 24 and 65 years old average av of 45 years during air sampling the ambient outdoor air temperature and relative humidity rh were measured with a tinytag plus data logger tgp 1500 united kingdom outdoor between a building with sludge drainage and a bio phosphor tank the data logger measured every fifth minute the av temperature was 14 c daily av 3 9 c to 22 5 c the av rh measured each workday was 75 7 daily av 51 2 to 94 8 2 2 sampling of airborne endotoxin and microorganisms in a pilot study bioaerosols were sampled in parallel outdoors using stationary gsp samplers gesamtstaubprobenahme cis by bgi inc waltham ma usa for 8 h at a flow rate of 3 5 l min samplers were mounted with polycarbonate pore size 1 µm suez water technologies solutions feasterville trevose pa usa n 9 or teflon ptfe 3 µm millipore sigma darmstadt germany n 9 filters these samples were used to test different extraction methods in the main study airborne inhalable endotoxin and microorganisms were sampled on the 14 workers using personal gsp samplers the samplers were mounted with polycarbonate filters for quantifications of colony forming units cfu of bacteria and fungi or with teflon filters for sampling airborne endotoxin the airflow of the samplers was checked at least every 2 h on every sampling day one teflon and one polycarbonate filter in a gsp sampler were used as negative controls at the end of the workday the pumps were switched off and the samples were immediately transported to the laboratory in total 104 personal gsp samples were taken over one year 2 3 extraction of dust microorganisms and endotoxin in the pilot study the bacteria and fungi collected on the polycarbonate filters were extracted in 6 0 ml sterile solution with 0 85 nacl by orbital

analysis the 14 workers were invited to give blood and of these 11 consented to participate blood samples were drawn post exposure on wednesday afternoons after showering at the end of the workday of exposure assessment three to 10 blood samples were drawn from each of 11 workers 3 women and 8 men and in total 78 blood samples were collected from june 2014 to june 2015 blood sampling was only performed if the worker was present that day blood samples were drawn into plain vacutainer tubes bd vacutainer gold top serum separator inverted 5 times left to clot for a minimum of 60 min and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min to separate serum the serum was frozen at 80 c until analysis serum levels of saa were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa invitrogen ca usa

correlated negatively with both measures of exposure to bacteriaday table 1 when each exposure was studied separately in a model with a random effect of person the serum levels of crpday were associated significantly with exposure to endotoxinlimulus day and tended to be associated with endotoxinrfc day if the exposures endotoxinrfc day or endotoxinlimulus day and bacteriaday and fungiday were analyzed in the same model with random effect of person and backward transformation crpday was associated significantly with exposure to endotoxinlimulus day saaseason was associated positively and significantly with both measures of exposure to and dose of endotoxinseason and negatively with fungiseason crpseason was associated positively with dose of endotoxinrfc season table 2 4 discussion in this cohort study we have shown significant associations between wwtp workers serum levels of the inflammatory markers crp and saa and occupational exposures to or doses of endotoxin and fungi we have used different approaches to study this in the first approach we study the association between the time weighted av exposure or the dose measured during the day of blood sampling vs the concentration of crpday and saaday this is relevant because in some studies crp levels increase across work shifts e g after exposure to wood smoke particles hejl et al 2013 and after shift work morris et al 2017 in the second approach we study the association between av exposures or dose vs serum levels of crp and saa of each season the rationale is an expected variation in exposure between consecutive days combined with the half life of crp and saa of approximately 1½ days coelho et al 2007 takata et al 2011 thus the end of workday crp and saa levels may also be affected by the exposure occurring the previous days in the last approach we have studied the association with a hazard index based on both endotoxin bacterial and fungal exposure 4 1 levels of saa and crp the wwtp workers serum levels of crp av 1 9 gm 1 4 mg l were similar to or at the higher end of levels previously measured for workers in a swedish pulp and paper mill medians between 1 3 and 1 5 mg l westberg et al 2016 swedish iron foundries av 1 8 median 0 89 mg l westberg et al 2019 danish greenhouses av 1 6 median 0 95 mg l madsen et al 2016 in a wood smoke impacted community mean 1 0 0 78 mg l in canada allen et al 2011 and for young healthy danish individuals in two studies gm 1 2 mg l bräuner et al 2008 av 1 0 mg l andersen et al 2018a the crp concentrations were lower than found for most patients with viral and bacterial infections in the airways melbye et al 2004 for norwegian sewage workers with impaired lung function elevated levels of crp have been found thus a negative correlation was found between lung function and serum concentrations of crp heldal et al 2019 the sewage plant workers had crp levels av 1 9 mg l median 1 2 mg l similar to levels found for wwtp workers in this study before the measurements the wwtp workers told us that they considered themselves as having frequent episodes of diarrhea some studies also report a high prevalence of diarrhea among wwtp workers khuder et al 1998 lee et al 2007 the serum levels of crp measured in this study were lower than what is usually measured for people with diarrhea thus patients with inflammatory diarrhea and non inflammatory diarrhea are described as having serum levels of crp of 49 25 vs 18 9 5 mg l kim et al 2013 in this wwtp a single person had during a single day a crp level above 8 mg l the lowest level for non inflammatory diarrhea the wwtp workers were sometimes exposed to airborne e coli yersinia enterocolitica providencia rettgeri and different species of aeromonas e g aeromonas veronii lu et al 2020 which might cause diarrhea if swallowed in the right dose the workers serum level of saa av 17 7 gm 12 1 mg l was at the lower end of what has previously been measured for greenhouse workers av 28 3 median 15 2 mg l madsen et al 2016 but higher than the median levels for healthy young 2 3 mg l middle aged 2 5 mg l and aged 3 7 mg l swedish adults lannergård et al 2005 and higher than for pulp and paper mill workers av from 1 7 to 2 3 mg l westberg et al 2016 as mentioned wwtp workers have in previous studies reported a high prevalence of diarrhea therefore it is relevant to relate the saa levels with levels in people with diarrhea a study with infants without infections infected by rotavirus causing diarrhea and bacteria causing diarrhea has measured serum levels of saa of 3 9 1 0 79 33 and 317 107 mg l respectively lv et al 2021 we have found no similar study for adults in this study four persons had a serum sample with saa concentrations above 46 mg l the lowest level for rotavirus infection causing diarrhea 4 2 exposure levels or doses and associations with crp and saa personal exposure to endotoxinlimulus exceeded the suggested occupational exposure limits oel of 50 eu m3 netherlands 2010 for 17 of the measurements the personal exposure to endotoxinlimulus gm 10 eu m3 was lower than the workers exposure in a wastewater sludge thermal drying room in france gm 53 eu m3 schlosser et al 2011 and in wwtps in iowa city usa gm 91 eu m3 lee et al 2007 in spite of that serum levels of crpday were associated significantly with the level of exposure to endotoxinlimulus day in contrast saaday was not associated with endotoxinday exposure and furthermore it was not associated with endotoxinday dose in congruence with this studies with workers exposed to burning particles found no cross work shift in saa even though some other inflammatory markers increased cross work shift andersen et al 2018b hejl et al 2013 saaseason was associated positively and significantly with exposure to and dose of endotoxinseason as measured using both the limulus and rfc method crpseason was associated positively and significantly with dose of endotoxinrfc for greenhouse workers who in general are exposed to higher levels of endotoxinlimulus median 66 eu m3 serum levels of saaweek av of monday and thursday measurements and crpweek were associated significantly and positively with exposure to endotoxin madsen et al 2016 a study with mice showed the dose of endotoxin causing tissue or cell damage in mice lungs was 5 times lower than the dose causing acute inflammation xue et al 2018 therefore long term sub chronic exposure might cause health problems for the wwtp workers later in life and a follow up study could be relevant saaseason was associated negatively with exposure to and dose of fungi we cannot explain this but it seems as though fungi have a protective effect or that the exposure correlates with another protecting factor in the mentioned study of greenhouse workers who are exposed to much higher concentrations of fungi median 4 3 104 cfu m3 than wwtp workers we also found a negative and significant association between fungal exposure and serum levels of saaweek madsen et al 2016 for a subpopulation of these greenhouse workers who worked with cucumbers the fungal species in their exposure were identified and it was dominated by cladosporium sp penicillium brevicompactum and podosphaera fusca powdery mildew madsen et al 2020 for the wwtp workers exposure we identified 7 to 10 randomly selected fungal isolates from each exposure measurement and the exposure was not dominated by any fungal species but contained several aspergillus cladosporium and penicillium species and also species belonging to other genera some of these fungi belong to risk group 2 aspergillus calidoustus a flavus a fumigatus a niger a terreus and purpureocillium lilacinum unfallversicherung 2017 some of the species are known to be allergenic including e g acremonium strictum alternaria alternate a versicolor cladosporium herbarum and wallemia sebi therefore it is interesting if the fungi may also have a protective effect the oel for bacteria of 500 cfu m3 suggested by the acgih otten 1986 was exceeded in 60 of the measurements the av exposure to bacteriana of 579 cfu m3 is in the lower end of what was found in a wwtp in switzerland oppliger et al 2005 and poland staszowska 2022 and it is low compared to in occupational settings where organic material is handled e g madsen et al 2021 robertson et al 2019 in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that crp binds to some bacteria sproston and ashworth 2018 and facilitates phagocytosis manley et al 2006 furthermore a study with animals shows that it is likely that other components in wastewater than endotoxin contributes to the inflammation caused by exposure liu et al 2021 however in this study the serum levels of crp and saa were not associated significantly with bacterial exposure of the wwtp workers this might be due to the low exposure levels but also that the bacteria should not be considered as a unified group but rather as different species which may affect the exposed workers differently the bacterial exposure was not dominated by any particular species but acinetobacter lwoffi bacillus cereus clostridium novyi dietzia maris micrococcus luteus rhodococcus fascians and different staphylococcus species were often found lu et al 2020 but whether they affected the workers is not known 4 4 endotoxin limulus and rfc to our knowledge this is the first study to relate exposure to endotoxin as measured using both the limulus and the rfc assay to signs of health effects on exposed workers here measured as the inflammatory markers crp and saa exposures were highest when analyzed using the limulus assay though concentrations correlated significantly the limulus assay has been used for decades while the rfc assay was introduced app 15 years ago in a study about endotoxin in seawater the limulus assay measured app twice as high concentrations as the rfc assay gehr et al 2008 in a study with livestock dust analyzed using the rfc and the limulus assay a significant correlation was found between results obtained using the two methods thorne et al 2010 in samples taken in most farm types the rfc measured slightly higher concentrations than the limulus assay and for samples from other farm types the opposite was found thorne et al 2010 in other studies with farm dust endotoxinrfc and endotoxinlimulus also correlated significantly with a tendency to result in higher concentrations for endotoxinrfc kirychuk 2008 sorrentino 2011 in a study with home dust endotoxinrfc and endotoxinlimulus also correlated significantly but here the endotoxinlimulus was twice as high as the endotoxinrfc alwis and milton 2006 exposure to endotoxin in farm environments is up to 1000 times higher than what we measured on the wwtp and farm dust thorne et al 2010 has about 20 times higher endotoxin concentrations eu mg of dust than indoor dust alwis and milton 2006 whether these differences are due to types of endotoxin amounts of dust or other factors is not possible to conclude yet based on the significantly higher exposure to endotoxin as measured using the limulus assay as compared to the rfc assay it will not be possible to directly pool data obtained using the limulus assay with new data obtained using the rfc assay furthermore it will not be possible to directly relate exposures analyzed using the rfc assay with suggested oels obtained using the limulus assay 4 5 perspectives the wwtp workers exposure to endotoxin seems to cause an increase in their serum level of the inflammatory markers crp and saa serum levels of crp and saa have been associated with airway inflammation takemura et al 2006 asthma kilic et al 2012 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease bozinovski et al 2008 and increased risk of cardiovascular disease ridker et al 2000 therefore it would be relevant to obtain knowledge about the effect of long term exposure later in the wwtp workers life the endotoxin in this environment derives from many different gram negative bacterial species and to obtain more knowledge about the impact of these different species a very large study is needed in this study we analyzed the cultivable fraction of bacteria to be able to identify bacteria using the maldi tof ms method this method has the strength of having a large database with bacterial pathogens and a high and correct identification rate of both clinical carbonnelle et al 2011 and environmental isolates pinar méndez et al 2021 pomastowski et al 2019 in a future study it would be relevant also to quantify bacteria using other methods as e g based on bacterial dna chemical components or total count by microscopy to also measure non cultivable isolates the serum levels of saa were associated negatively with fungal exposure the fungal exposure was low and several of the fungal species are known to be allergenic or classified in risk class 2 this potential protective effect of fungal exposure would be relevant to study further in this study with wwtp workers the two endotoxin assays gave exposures that were highly correlated and serum levels of saaseason were related significantly to both endotoxinrfc season and endotoxinlimulus season a relevant step is to investigate if environments with a wider span of exposure to endotoxin or different concentrations of endotoxin eu mg dust e g at wwtp where dry dried sludge is handled also correlate this is important because endotoxin exposure should be part of the risk assessment of wwtp workers working environment also at the method level further studies on the extraction efficiency of endotoxin and microorganisms from the filters may be relevant thus the european standard 14031 2021 mentions that no recommendation can be given for use of detergents in the extraction procedure for endotoxin due to lack of data in this study we used 0 05 tween to extract endotoxin from the filters and this was based on the pilot study and on other studies which have shown that the amounts of endotoxin and microorganisms extracted from filters are significantly and considerably higher if tween is used 0 vs 0 05 douwes et al 1995 liebers et al 2007 noss et al 2010 sorrentino 2011 0 vs 0 02 kim et al 2008 0 vs 1 olenchock et al 1989 for extraction of microorganisms from filters we used tween 80 which was also based on our pilot study the european standard 13098 2019 as well as a literature study kim et al 2008 macher 2001 mcdevitt et al 2004 4 6 conclusions this study shows a significant and positive association for serum levels of the inflammatory markers crpday vs endotoxinlimulus day exposure saaseason vs endotoxinlimulus season and endotoxinrfc season exposure and dose thus wwtp workers seem to be negatively affected by their daily exposure to endotoxin exposure to endotoxin as measured using the rfc method correlated with data obtained using the classical limulus method was overall related to serum levels of saa in the same way as data obtained using the limulus method consistently measured lower endotoxin concentrations than the limulus method thus endotoxin exposure should be measured in future risk assessments of wwtp workers exposure it is not possible to directly analyze data from previous studies obtained by the limulus assay together with data obtained using the rfc method without including a conversion factor data obtained by the rfc method cannot directly be related to oels which are based on limulus data and if the rfc method is used it will be necessary also to analyze some samples from each environment with the limulus assay to get a conversion factor funding the work was supported by the danish research council grant number dff 1335 00183 and the danish working authority

15095,work in wastewater treatment plants wwtps can be associated with exposure to airborne microorganisms and endotoxin from the working environment the aim of this study was to obtain knowledge about whether serum levels of the markers of systemic inflammation c reactive protein crp and serum amyloid a saa are associated with personal exposure to endotoxin measured using the limulus endotoxinlimulus and the rfc endotoxinrfc assays as well as bacteria and fungi in a cohort of wwtp workers exposure and blood samples were collected for 11 workers over one year exposure to endotoxinlimulus day and endotoxinrfc day correlated significantly r 0 80 p 0 0001 n 104 but endotoxinlimulus day was 4 4 geometric mean gm value times higher than endotoxinrfc day p 0 0001 the endotoxinlimulus day endotoxinrfc day bacteria and fungal exposure as well as serum levels of crp day gm 1 4 mg l and saa day gm 12 mg l differed between workers serum levels of saaday correlated significantly with crpday r 0 30 p 0 0068 the serum levels of crpday were associated significantly with exposure to endotoxinlimulus day exposure saa and crp data were also analyzed as av of each season and saaseason was associated positively and significantly with endotoxinlimulus season and endotoxinrfc season and negatively with fungalseason exposure in conclusion crpday was associated with the endotoxinlimulus day and saaseason with endotoxinlimulus season and endotoxinrfc season exposure thus we hereby document that wwtp workers are exposed to airborne endotoxin which seems to have a

treatment plants wwtps has been shown to be associated with respiratory symptoms and impaired pulmonary function cyprowski et al 2015 rylander 1999 a few studies have found both an increased and a decreased risk of death due to arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease among wwtp workers reviewed in thorn and kerekes 2001 airborne endotoxin has repeatedly been found in elevated levels in wwtps lu et al 2020 oppliger et al 2005 uhrbrand et al 2011 and lower respiratory symptoms smit et al 2005 have been linked with occupational exposure to endotoxin a large number of different airborne bacterial species have been found in wwtps lu et al 2020 uhrbrand et al 2017 of which some are pathogenic such as enterococcus faecalis and e faecium uhrbrand et al 2017 clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus fracchia et al 2006 elevated levels of the inflammatory marker c reactive protein crp have been found in serum samples of wwtp workers exposed to bioaerosols heldal et al 2010 mattsby and rylander 1978 thorn and beijer 2004 and have been associated with impaired lung function among wwtp workers heldal et al 2019 increased levels of serum crp and amyloid a saa have been associated with airway inflammation takemura et al 2006 asthma kilic et al 2012 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease bozinovski et al 2008 in patients and increased risk of cardiovascular disease ridker et al 2000 likewise low grade chronic inflammation seems to be a risk factor for atherosclerosis packard and libby 2008 shah and lecis 2019 the chromogen kinetic limulus amoebocyte lysate limulus assay is the most widely used assay for measurement of occupational exposure to endotoxin lawniczek walczyk and górny 2010 liebers et al 2020 it is based on an endotoxin triggered enzyme cascade present in the hemolymph of the atlantic horseshoe crab an alternative to the limulus assay is the recombinant factor c rfc test which is based on a recombinant factor c enzyme it was developed to avoid the use of the horseshoe crab and to reduce the variability that arises from using different preparations of the limulus lysate thorne et al 2010 the rfc assay is expected to be used in the future as the method does not require animal material liebers et al 2020 to be able to use already published data obtained by the limulus method together with new data obtained by the rfc method it is important to obtain knowledge about the association between results obtained by the two methods the aim of the present study was to obtain knowledge about whether serum levels of crp and saa are associated with personal exposure to endotoxin measured using kinetic limulus assay endotoxinlimulus and the rfc assay endotoxinrfc as well as exposure to bacteria and fungi in a cohort of wwtp workers 2 materials and methods the study has obtained ethical approval id h 3 2014 028 2 1 the plant and participating workers sampling was conducted at a wwtp in denmark located in zealand sampling was performed by two occupational hygienists monthly over one year from june 2014 to june 2015 a total of 14 wastewater workers employed at the wwtp were enrolled and followed through one year with 12 sampling days their work tasks included observations of the different wastewater processes industrial cleaning and maintenance of the participants 11 were male and 3 were female employees they were between 24 and 65 years old average av of 45 years during air sampling the ambient outdoor air temperature and relative humidity rh were measured with a tinytag plus data logger tgp 1500

correlated negatively with both measures of exposure to bacteriaday table 1 when each exposure was studied separately in a model with a random effect of person the serum levels of crpday were associated significantly with exposure to endotoxinlimulus day and tended to be associated with endotoxinrfc day if the exposures endotoxinrfc day or endotoxinlimulus day and bacteriaday and fungiday were analyzed in the same model with random effect of person and backward transformation crpday was associated significantly with exposure to endotoxinlimulus day saaseason was associated positively and significantly with both measures of exposure to and dose of endotoxinseason and negatively with fungiseason crpseason was associated positively with dose of endotoxinrfc season table 2 4 discussion in this cohort study we have shown significant associations between wwtp workers serum levels of the inflammatory markers crp and saa and occupational exposures to or doses of endotoxin and fungi we have used different approaches to study this in the first approach we study the association between the time weighted av exposure or the dose measured during the day of blood sampling vs the concentration of crpday and saaday this is relevant because in some studies crp levels increase across work shifts e g after exposure to wood smoke particles hejl et al 2013 and after shift work morris et al 2017 in the second approach we study the association between av exposures or dose vs serum levels of crp and saa of each season the rationale is an expected variation in exposure between consecutive days combined with the half life of crp and saa of approximately 1½ days coelho et al 2007 takata et al 2011 thus the end of workday crp and saa levels may also be affected by the exposure occurring the previous days in the last approach we have studied the association with a hazard index based on both endotoxin bacterial and fungal exposure 4 1 levels of saa and crp the wwtp workers serum levels of crp av 1 9 gm 1 4 mg l were similar to or at the higher end of levels previously measured for workers in a swedish pulp and paper mill medians between 1 3 and 1 5 mg l westberg et al 2016 swedish iron foundries av 1 8 median 0 89 mg l westberg et al 2019 danish greenhouses av 1 6 median 0 95 mg l madsen et al 2016 in a wood smoke impacted community mean 1 0 0 78 mg l in canada allen et al 2011 and for young healthy danish individuals in two studies gm 1 2 mg l bräuner et al 2008 av 1 0 mg l andersen et al 2018a the crp concentrations were lower than found for most patients with viral and bacterial infections in the airways melbye et al 2004 for norwegian sewage workers with impaired lung function elevated levels of crp have been found thus a negative correlation was found between lung function and serum concentrations of crp heldal et al 2019 the sewage plant workers had crp levels av 1 9 mg l median 1 2 mg l similar to levels found for wwtp workers in this study before the measurements the wwtp workers told us that they considered themselves as having frequent episodes of diarrhea some studies also report a high prevalence of diarrhea among wwtp workers khuder et al 1998 lee et al 2007 the serum levels of crp measured in this study were lower than what is usually measured for people with diarrhea thus patients with inflammatory diarrhea and non inflammatory diarrhea are described as having serum levels of crp of 49 25 vs 18 9 5 mg l kim et al 2013 in this wwtp a single person had during a single day a crp level above 8 mg l the lowest level for non inflammatory diarrhea the wwtp workers were sometimes exposed to airborne e coli yersinia enterocolitica providencia rettgeri and different species of aeromonas e g aeromonas veronii lu et al 2020 which might cause diarrhea if swallowed in the right dose the workers serum level of saa av 17 7 gm 12 1 mg l was at the lower end of what has previously been measured for greenhouse workers av 28 3 median 15 2 mg l madsen et al 2016 but higher than the median levels for healthy young 2 3 mg l middle aged 2 5 mg l and aged 3 7 mg l swedish adults lannergård et al 2005 and higher than for pulp and paper mill workers av from 1 7 to 2 3 mg l westberg et al 2016 as mentioned wwtp workers have in previous studies reported a high prevalence of diarrhea therefore it is relevant to relate the saa levels with levels in people with diarrhea a study with infants without infections infected by rotavirus causing diarrhea and bacteria causing diarrhea has measured serum levels of saa of 3 9 1 0 79 33 and 317 107 mg l respectively lv et al 2021 we have found no similar study for adults in this study four persons had a serum sample with saa concentrations above 46 mg l the lowest level for rotavirus infection causing diarrhea 4 2 exposure levels or doses and associations with crp and saa personal exposure to endotoxinlimulus exceeded the suggested occupational exposure limits oel of 50 eu m3 netherlands 2010 for 17 of the measurements the personal exposure to endotoxinlimulus gm 10 eu m3 was lower than the workers exposure in a wastewater sludge thermal drying room in france gm 53 eu m3 schlosser et al 2011 and in wwtps in iowa city usa gm 91 eu m3 lee et al 2007 in spite of that serum levels of crpday were associated significantly with the level of exposure to endotoxinlimulus day in contrast saaday was not associated with endotoxinday exposure and furthermore it was not associated with endotoxinday dose in congruence with this studies with workers exposed to burning particles found no cross work shift in saa even though some other inflammatory markers increased cross work shift andersen et al 2018b hejl et al 2013 saaseason was associated positively and significantly with exposure to and dose of endotoxinseason as measured using both the limulus and rfc method crpseason was associated positively and significantly with dose of endotoxinrfc for greenhouse workers who in general are exposed to higher levels of endotoxinlimulus median 66 eu m3 serum levels of saaweek av of monday and thursday measurements and crpweek were associated significantly and positively with exposure to endotoxin madsen et al 2016 a study with mice showed the dose of endotoxin causing tissue or cell damage in mice lungs was 5 times lower than the dose causing acute inflammation xue et al 2018 therefore long term sub chronic exposure might cause health problems for the wwtp workers later in life and a follow up study could be relevant saaseason was associated negatively with exposure to and dose of fungi we cannot explain this but it seems as though fungi have a protective effect or that the exposure correlates with another protecting factor in the mentioned study of greenhouse workers who are exposed to much higher concentrations of fungi median 4 3 104 cfu m3 than wwtp workers we also found a negative and significant association between fungal exposure and serum levels of saaweek madsen et al 2016 for a subpopulation of these greenhouse workers who worked with cucumbers the fungal species in their exposure were identified and it was dominated by cladosporium sp penicillium brevicompactum and podosphaera fusca powdery mildew madsen et al 2020 for the wwtp workers exposure we identified 7 to 10 randomly selected fungal isolates from each exposure measurement and the exposure was not dominated by any fungal species but contained several aspergillus cladosporium and penicillium species and also species belonging to other genera some of these fungi belong to risk group 2 aspergillus calidoustus a flavus a fumigatus a niger a terreus and purpureocillium lilacinum unfallversicherung 2017 some of the species are known to be allergenic including e g acremonium strictum alternaria alternate a versicolor cladosporium herbarum and wallemia sebi therefore it is interesting if the fungi may also have a protective effect the oel for bacteria of 500 cfu m3 suggested by the acgih otten 1986 was exceeded in 60 of the measurements the av exposure to bacteriana of 579 cfu m3 is in the lower end of what was found in a wwtp in switzerland oppliger et al 2005 and poland staszowska 2022 and it is low compared to in occupational settings where organic material is handled e g madsen et al 2021 robertson et al 2019 in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that crp binds to some bacteria sproston and ashworth 2018 and facilitates phagocytosis manley et al 2006 furthermore a study with animals shows that it is likely that other components in wastewater than endotoxin contributes to the inflammation caused by exposure liu et al 2021 however in this study the serum levels of crp and saa were not associated significantly with bacterial exposure of the wwtp workers this might be due to the low exposure levels but also that the bacteria should not be considered as a unified group but rather as different species which may affect the exposed workers differently the bacterial exposure was not dominated by any particular species but acinetobacter lwoffi bacillus cereus clostridium novyi dietzia maris micrococcus luteus rhodococcus fascians and different staphylococcus species were often found lu et al 2020 but whether they affected the workers is not known 4 4 endotoxin limulus and rfc to our knowledge this is the first study to relate exposure to endotoxin as measured using both the limulus and the rfc assay to signs of health effects on exposed workers here measured as the inflammatory markers crp and saa exposures were highest when analyzed using the limulus assay though concentrations correlated significantly the limulus assay has been used for decades while the rfc assay was introduced app 15 years ago in a study about endotoxin in seawater the limulus assay measured app twice as high concentrations as the rfc assay gehr et al 2008 in a study with livestock dust analyzed using the rfc and the limulus assay a significant correlation was found between results obtained using the two methods thorne et al 2010 in samples taken in most farm types the rfc measured slightly higher concentrations than the limulus assay and for samples from other farm types the opposite was found thorne et al 2010 in other studies with farm dust endotoxinrfc and endotoxinlimulus also correlated significantly with a tendency to result in higher concentrations for endotoxinrfc kirychuk 2008 sorrentino 2011 in a study with home dust endotoxinrfc and endotoxinlimulus also correlated significantly but here the endotoxinlimulus was twice as high as the endotoxinrfc alwis and milton 2006 exposure to endotoxin in farm environments is up to 1000 times higher than what we measured on the wwtp and farm dust thorne et al 2010 has about 20 times higher endotoxin concentrations eu mg of dust than indoor dust alwis and milton 2006 whether these differences are due to types of endotoxin amounts of dust or other factors is not possible to conclude yet based on the significantly higher exposure to endotoxin as measured using the limulus assay as compared to the rfc assay it will not be possible to directly pool data obtained using the limulus assay with new data obtained using the rfc assay furthermore it will not be possible to directly relate exposures analyzed using the rfc assay with suggested oels obtained using the limulus assay 4 5 perspectives the wwtp workers exposure to endotoxin seems to cause an increase in their serum level of the inflammatory markers crp and saa serum levels of crp and saa have been associated with airway inflammation takemura et al 2006 asthma kilic et al 2012 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease bozinovski et al 2008 and increased risk of cardiovascular disease ridker et al 2000 therefore it would be relevant to obtain knowledge about the effect of long term exposure later in the wwtp workers life the endotoxin in this environment derives from many different gram negative bacterial species and to obtain more knowledge about the impact of these different species a very large study is needed in this study we analyzed the cultivable fraction of bacteria to be able to identify bacteria using the maldi tof ms method this method has the strength of having a large database with bacterial pathogens and a high and correct identification rate of both clinical carbonnelle et al 2011 and environmental isolates pinar méndez et al 2021 pomastowski et al 2019 in a future study it would be relevant also to quantify bacteria using other methods as e g based on bacterial dna chemical components or total count by microscopy to also measure non cultivable isolates the serum levels of saa were associated negatively with fungal exposure the fungal exposure was low and several of the fungal species are known to be allergenic or classified in risk class 2 this potential protective effect of fungal exposure would be relevant to study further in this study with wwtp workers the two endotoxin assays gave exposures that were highly correlated and serum levels of saaseason were related significantly to both endotoxinrfc season and endotoxinlimulus season a relevant step is to investigate if environments with a wider span of exposure to endotoxin or different concentrations of endotoxin eu mg dust e g at wwtp where dry dried sludge is handled also correlate this is important because endotoxin exposure should be part of the risk assessment of wwtp workers working environment also at the method level further studies on the extraction efficiency of endotoxin and microorganisms from the filters may be relevant thus the european standard 14031 2021 mentions that no recommendation can be given for use of detergents in the extraction procedure for endotoxin due to lack of data in this study we used 0 05 tween to extract endotoxin from the filters and this was based on the pilot study and on other studies which have shown that the amounts of endotoxin and microorganisms extracted from filters are significantly and considerably higher if tween is used 0 vs 0 05 douwes et al 1995 liebers et al 2007 noss et al 2010 sorrentino 2011 0 vs 0 02 kim et al 2008 0 vs 1 olenchock et al 1989 for extraction of microorganisms from filters we used tween 80 which was also based on our pilot study the european standard 13098 2019 as well as a literature study kim et al 2008 macher 2001 mcdevitt et al 2004 4 6 conclusions this study shows a significant and positive association for serum levels of the inflammatory markers crpday vs endotoxinlimulus day exposure saaseason vs endotoxinlimulus season and endotoxinrfc season exposure and dose thus wwtp workers seem to be negatively affected by their daily exposure to endotoxin exposure to endotoxin as measured using the rfc method correlated with data obtained using the classical limulus method was overall related to serum levels of saa in the same way as data obtained using the limulus method consistently measured lower endotoxin concentrations than the limulus method thus endotoxin exposure should be measured in future risk assessments of wwtp workers exposure it is not possible to directly analyze data from previous studies obtained by the limulus assay together with data obtained using the rfc method without including a conversion factor data obtained by the rfc method cannot directly be related to oels which are based on limulus data and if the rfc method is used it will be necessary also to analyze some samples from each environment with the limulus assay to get a conversion factor funding the work was supported by the danish research council grant number dff 1335 00183 and the danish working authority

15096,bioaerosols produced by municipal wastewater treatment plants mwtp can spread in air thereby polluting the atmosphere and causing safety hazards to workers and surrounding residents in this study the biological reaction tanks brts of six mwtps undergoing typical processes in north china yangtze river delta and the greater bay area were selected to set up sampling points and investigate the production characteristics of bioaerosols the atmospheric dispersion modelling system method was used to simulate the diffusion of bioaerosols in the mwtps the concentrations of bacteria and specifically intestinal bacteria in the bioaerosols ranged from 389 cfu m3 to 1 536 cfu m3 and 30 cfu m3 to 152 cfu m3 respectively and the proportion of the intestinal bacteria was 8 85 the concentration of soluble chemicals scs in the bioaerosols was 18 36 μg m3 82 19 μg m3 and the main scs found were mg2 ca2 and so4 2 the proportion of intestinal bacteria 75 79 produced via surface aeration by a brt attached to large sized bioaerosol particles was higher than that of a brt undergoing the bottom aeration process 37 28 the main microorganisms found in the bioaerosols included moraxellaceae escherichia shigella psychrobacter and cyanobacteria the generation of bioaerosols exhibited regional characteristics the wastewater treatment scale wastewater quality and aeration mode were the main factors influencing bioaerosol production model simulation showed that after 1 h the diffusion distance of bioaerosol was 292 m 515 m and the affected area was 42 895 m2 91 708 m2 the diffusion distance and range of the bioaerosols were significantly correlated with the concentration at the bioaerosol source and the aeration mode adopted by the brts wind speed and direction were two environmental factors that affected the diffusion of bioaerosols with an increase in the diffusion distance the concentration of microorganisms intestinal bacteria ions and fine particles in the bioaerosols decreased significantly resulting in a corresponding reduction in the exposure risk this study provides new insights to help predict bioaerosol risks at mwtps and identify safe areas around mwtps the study also provides a basis for selecting safe mwtp sites and reducing bioaerosol pollution risks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment bioaerosol generation characteristics trajectory prediction diffusion factors 1 introduction wastewater treatment is considered a major source of bioaerosols most urban wastewater treatments use activated sludge processes that use microorganisms to degrade organic matter in wastewater into harmless substances however oxygen is required to maintain the growth of the microorganisms and the reaction therefore biochemical treatment processes usually adopt aeration and microorganisms may enter the air during the process of bioaerosol generation when bioaerosols contain intestinal bacteria viruses or fungi and their spores that cause allergic reactions they can cause diseases in the human respiratory tract brenner et al 1988 the exposure risk and pathogenesis of bioaerosol requires further investigation bioaerosols containing bacteria and fungi have been detected in the air around biological reaction tanks brts during oxidation ditch sequencing batch reactor activated sludge process sbr and anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o processes li et al 2011 xu et al 2018 in a previous study the concentration of particles in bioaerosol produced as a result of wastewater treatment reached 1233 m3 6533 m3 and the microbial concentration reached more than 1690 cfu m3 li et al 2016 the particle size of bioaerosols in municipal wastewater treatment plants mwtps is generally 2 1μm 3 3 μm laitinen et al 1994 bioaerosols produced by mwtps may contain various pathogenic microorganisms such as viruses rotavirus norovirus adenovirus hepatitis virus and coliphages and intestinal bacteria micrococcus bacteroides chryseobacterium pseudomonas and acinetobacter they can cause infections following inhalation swallowing and skin contact gotkowska plachta et al 2013 wang et al 2018b wang et al 2018c previous studies on wastewater treatment of bioaerosols have mainly focused on their emission levels particle size characteristics and population structure li et al 2011 wang et al 2018c infective pathogens can be transported over long distances via airflow van doremalen et al 2020 it was found that the concentration of microorganisms decreased significantly at 500 m downwind of the bioaerosol source and each mwtp presented its own bioaerosol diffusion characteristics brts are sewage treatment facilities built outdoors the bioaerosol generated by them will spread around the mwtp with the wind bringing potential risks to the downwind area bioaerosol transport and dispersion models that describe the spatial and temporal distributions of aerosol concentrations are commonly generated using computational fluid dynamics cfd which usually represent the turbulent transport of momentum and energy using eddy diffusivities in the corresponding governing equations hayashi et al 2002 yang et al 2014 the viruses in public places bioaerosols in hospital diagnosis and treatment sites and particulate matter emissions from aquaculture farms were calculated and simulated by this method to predict the infection caused by the spread of particulate pollutants and prevent the exposure risk brought about by them archer et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 analytical solutions obtained using the gaussian like atmospheric dispersion modelling system adms based on the cfd principle can provide a quick prediction of the probability of taking in bioaerosol in this study the adms was used to study bioaerosol diffusion at the mwtp scale because it is helpful to reduce bioaerosols and their exposure risk studies on bioaerosol diffusion characteristics have attracted increasing attention in this study six mwtps undergoing oxidation ditch sbr and a2 o processes were investigated in three regions of china the chemical composition of bioaerosol was analyzed by ion chromatography high throughput sequencing was used to analyze microbial population in bioaerosols the adms was used to simulate the diffusion of bioaerosols from the mwtps to explore the diffusion law of bioaerosols analyzing the influencing factors of bioaerosol diffusion and evaluating the bioaerosol transport risk may contribute to risk predictions of bioaerosols from mwtps which in turn can provide a basis for safely selecting mwtp sites and reducing bioaerosol pollution risks 2 materials and methods 2 1 municipal mwtp descriptions sampling sites for bioaerosol capture were set up 1 5 m above the aeration tanks of

operational taxonomic units otus were clustered with a 97 similarity cut off and chimeric sequences were identified and removed the taxonomy of each 16s rrna gene sequence was analysed using a confidence threshold of 70 amato et al 2013 jiang et al 2015 each sample was normalized at the same sequence depth 34 536 reads the alpha and beta diversity and similarity of the bacterial community s structure were analysed table s2 2 3 3 simulation on bioaerosol atmospheric dispersion modelling system adms was an advanced dispersion model used to obtain the air quality impact of existing and proposed industrial installations which was originally developed for regulatory authorities in the uk it has been widely applied to simulate the diffusion of gasses or particles in various situations hood et al 2020 jaffe et al 2020 adms was utilized in the simulation of bioaerosol diffusion in this study considering the change of microbial activity in bioaerosols this study adjusted and improved the model parameters such as the type selection of particles representing aerosols dry and wet sedimentation boundary layer processes chemical reactions and topography the adjusted model is compared with the observed results and fitted with the actual measured values in order to simulate the diffusion characteristics of bioaerosols accurately we measured and obtained ground structures and terrain

brt section of the six mwtps the concentrations of bioaerosols presented upwind were also measured with 275 cfu m3 for nco 177 cfu m3 for nc a 75 cfu m3 for yzd o 42 cfu m3 for yzd a 99 cfu m3 for gba o and 51 cfu m3 for gba a respectively the emission level of bioaerosols found at all brts were higher than those presented in the air upwind table s1 the concentration of airborne bacteria at the mwtps ranged from 389 cfu m3 to 1536 cfu m3 with the concentrations in the nco nc a yzd o yzd a gba o and gba a being 1536 cfu m3 1009 cfu m3 1184 cfu m3 554 cfu m3 1056 cfu m3 and 389 cfu m3 respectively mwtps using the surface aeration method had a higher concentration of bacteria 1258 cfu m3 intestinal bacteria were found at each mwtp with concentrations ranging from 30 cfu m3 to 1 52 cfu m3 accounting for 8 04 of the total bacterial population mwtps in the nc area generated more bacteria and specifically intestinal bacteria with averages of 1273 cfu m3 and 140 cfu m3 respectively than did those in the other areas which had averages of 796 cfu m3 and 47 cfu m3 respectively fig 2 shows the soluble chemicals scs detected in bioaerosols at the six mwtps scs were detected at each mwtp and the amount of ten kinds of scs ranged from 18 36 μg m3 82 19 μg m3 bioaerosols at the mwtps of the nc and gba areas had higher sc contents with an average of 73 74 μg m3 than did those in the yzd area with an average of 37 89 μg m3 mg2 ca2 and so4 2 were the major scs in the bioaerosols at each mwtp accounting for 29 84 of the total sc content 3 1 2 aerosol particle size distribution the size distributions of the bioaerosol particles to which the airborne and intestinal bacteria attached at each mwtps are shown in fig 3 the aerodynamic cut size diameters of the six stage viable andersen cascade impactor are over 7 0 µm in stage 1 4 7 7 0 µm in stage 2 3 3 4 7 µm in stage 3 2 1 3 3 µm in stage 4 1 1 2 1 µm in stage 5 0 65 1 1 µm in stage 6 the microbial aerosol particles collected in this study were classified as fine particles which picked from the stage 5 and the stage 6 and coarse particles that sampled from the stage 1 to the stage 4 the inhalation of particles smaller than 10 μm has detrimental health effects such as causing asthma and cardiovascular disease urbán et al 2015 vestlund et al 2014 at the sampling sites nco yzd o and gba o 69 73 to 80 56 of the intestinal bacteria were attached to coarse particles with an average concentration of 64 cfu m3 while the average concentration of the fine particles was 23 cfu m3 at the sampling sites nc a yzd a and gba a 62 72 of the intestinal bacteria on average were attached to fine particles the concentrations of fine and coarse particles were 4 cfu m3 24 cfu m3 and 10 cfu m3 68 cfu m3 respectively 3 1 3 microbial population in bioaerosols this study analyzed the microbial populations at each mwtp fig 4 and table s3 show the composition and proportion of the microorganisms at each mwtp the main microorganism species in the bioaerosols varied among mwtps moraxellaceae 11 17 pseudomonas 7 11 and chroococcidiopsis 6 64 dominated the bacterial population in nc a pseudomonas escherichia shigella and psychrobacter accounted for 84 63 of the bacterial population in nco cyanobacteria was the dominant microorganism in yzd a accounting for 80 46 of the overall bacterial population while in yzd o cyanobacteria 28 65 candidatus 8 76 and saccharibacteria 4 55 were the most abundant the dominant species in gba a were sphingomona 9 74 sphingomonadales 6 97 and mitochondria 6 29 while peptostreptococcaceae 13 79 mycobacterium 4 75 and sphingobacteriaceae 4 47 were the dominant bacteria in gba o intestinal bacteria including moraxellaceae pseudomonas acinetobacter arcobacter neisseriaceae escherichia shigella mycobacterium saccharibacteria romboutsia serratia and flexibacter were detected in bioaerosols at the mwtps pseudomonas is a common pathogenic bacterium that can cause endocarditis osteomyelitis pneumonia urinary tract infections gastrointestinal infections meningitis and sepsis rice et al 2012 diseases caused by pseudomonas are becoming more common gomez gamboa et al 2021 acinetobacter mainly causes respiratory and urinary tract infections sepsis and secondary meningitis gao et al 2014 gou et al 2016 serratia can cause urinary tract respiratory tract and wound infections kowalski et al 2017 escherichia shigella is a common pathogenic bacterium that can cause extra intestinal infections acute diarrhea bacillary dysentery and other diseases kotloff et al 2018 rodriguez angeles 2002 therefore in addition to strengthening the personal protection of workers such as by wearing masks and goggles brts especially the oxidation ditch need to be equipped with protective covers and other facilities to prevent the escape of bioaerosols 3 1 4 bioaerosol generation there were differences in the number particle size distribution and composition of total bacteria and enterobacteriaceae in aerosols released from each sewage treatment plant and the concentrations of scs in the aerosols differed similar results were reported in previous studies wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018d reasons for this difference might be differences in regional characteristics and aeration modes the water quality and environmental conditions of sewage treatment plants differ regionally aerosol generation is related to water quality and environmental conditions therefore the concentration of microorganisms generated in nc which has a high concentration of microorganisms in its sewage was high the diffusion of bioaerosols produced by wastewater treatment plants undergoing surface oxygenation and bottom oxygenation differed within the same area this may be related to the different mechanisms of bioaerosol generation as a result of bottom aeration and surface aeration the bottom aeration process filled the bottom of the water body with gas and the gas formed bubbles at the bottom of the liquid and gradually rose to the liquid surface during this process sludge flocs from the bottom and middle of the liquid were carried to the surface during the process of surface rupture the bubbles reaching the surface transported substances in the sewage to the air resulting in a loss of water and aerosolizing in the air thereby forming aerosols surface aeration oxygenation facilities are located at liquid surfaces and often disturb water surfaces owing to the motion of rotating brushes after flapping and raising water surface liquid is wrapped with substances in sewage and is transported into the air and the splashing of large droplets water loss and atomization of small droplets leads to bioaerosols generation near the specific brush data on aerosol production characteristics in this study also confirmed that both surface and bottom aeration produces bioaerosols the higher the amount of bioaerosols produced the higher the concentration in the air at 200 m dw compared with surface aeration bottom aeration produces less bioaerosol the concentration in the air emitted by bottom aeration was also lower at 200 m dw 3 2 bioaerosol diffusion the adms was used to calculate the diffusion of bioaerosols microorganisms particles and water soluble ions the flowstar model was used to calculate flow and turbulence fields over the terrain by introducing meteorological parameters wind direction and wind speed are the dominant factor influencing bioaerosol diffusion direction and range wei et al 2020 the rose chart of the wind direction in north china the greater bay area and the yangtze river delta are shown in fig 5 the dominant wind directions in north china were south 44 66 and north 22 74 east 20 55 northeast 16 71 and north 15 07 winds were dominant in yangtze river delta north 25 21 southeast 21 10 and northeast 20 01 winds were dominant in the greater bay area 3 2 1 aerosol diffusion direction the concentrations of bioaerosols produced at the mwtps were used to simulate the diffusion of bacteria in air using the adms model fig 6 and table s3 the simulation results showed that bioaerosols from the mwtps diffused evenly after 1 h of diffusion high aerosol concentrations were found close to the generation source and their diffusion was distributed in clumps mwtps in the same region had similar diffusion directions that closely correlated to the wind direction the diffusion trends in nc a and nco had a southwest northwest 139 elliptic distribution the diffusion trends in gba a and gba o exhibited southeast to northwest 164 elliptic distributions diffusion in yzd a exhibited an elliptic distribution with a southwest northeast 243 trend while that in yzd o exhibited a west east trend 285 elliptic distribution 3 2 2 aerosol diffusion scope the concentrations of bacteria in the aerosol diffusion direction at 100 m 100 m dw the boundary of the mwtps and 200 m 200 m dw residential areas varied among the mwtps the bioaerosol concentrations at 100 m dw and 200 m dw in nc a and nco ranged from 63 cfu m3 75 cfu m3 and 25 cfu m3 35 cfu m3 respectively the spread of bioaerosol from yzd a and yzd o at 100 m dw and 200 m dw ranged from 41 cfu m3 66 cfu m3 and 18 cfu m3 50 cfu m3 respectively the spread of bioaerosol in gba a and gba o also ranged from 20 cfu m3 72 cfu m3 and 50 cfu m3 55 cfu m3 at 100 m dw and 200 m dw respectively the concentration of intestinal bacteria at 100 m dw and 200 m dw at each mwtp ranged from 1 cfu m3 8 cfu m3 and 1 cfu m3 3 cfu m3 respectively bacteria attached to fine particles also decreased with increasing distance with concentrations ranging from 4 cfu m3 22 cfu m3 and 3 cfu m3 11 cfu m3 at 100 m dw and 200 m dw respectively the total concentration of scs decreased to 3 62 μg m3 and 2 02 μg m3 on average at 100 m dw and 200 m dw respectively the bioaerosol diffusion distance 292 515 m and affected area 42 895 91 708 m2 differed among the mwtps aerosols in nco spread 423 m in the northwest direction and affected an area of 61 385 m2 the microorganisms in nc a spread 301 m northwest with an affected diffusion area of approximately 42 895 m2 microorganisms in yzd o spread 307 m northwest affecting an area of 47 333 m2 the diffusion distance of microorganisms in yzd a was 554 m and the diffusion area was 80 614 m2 microorganisms in gba o spread 292 m northwest with an affected diffusion area of approximately 48 073 m2 microorganisms in gba a spread 515 m northwest with an affected diffusion area of approximately 91 708 m2 the concentration at the diffusion edge was as low as in the range of 2 cfu m3 20 cfu m3 3 2 3 factors influencing diffusion 3 2 3 1 influence of source strength on the diffusion range diffusion analysis of aerosols generated at the mwtps indicated that there were differences in the aerosol diffusion results during the brt stage mechanical disturbances were major causes of aerosol generation the high microbial content and intense sewage aeration led to a large amount of aerosol being generated in the brt section as supported by previous studies wang et al 2019 yang et al 2019 therefore the bioaerosol concentrations in nco were higher at 200 m dw than at the mwtps in the other areas the level of bioaerosol generated at the source influenced bioaerosol diffusion the higher the level at the source the more microorganisms dispersed in the downward direction the species and concentrations of bacteria varied with place depending on the process selected and meteorological parameters e g temperature rh and ws canonical correlation analysis cca was conducted to describe the influence of these factors on bacterial populations in bioaerosols fig s1 li et al 2017 the results demonstrated that environmental factors influence bacterial emissions among them rh temperature sr and ws were the major factors influencing the level of airborne bacteria in the air which is consistent with results obtained in previous reports yan et al 2019a the rh temperature and sr were positively correlated with airborne intestinal bacteria release and dispersal whereas ws was negatively correlated with airborne intestinal bacteria release and dispersal table 3 high temperatures and rh favor microbiological growth whereas strong winds help disperse bioaerosol particles owing to the suitable temperature appropriate rh and low ws higher bioaerosol concentrations were maintained in the air similar results were obtained from cca of strain influencing factors some microbes were sensitive to meteorological conditions cca results also showed that environmental factors have different effects on different types of microorganisms the rh had a strong positive effect on pseudomonas psychrobacter and serratia that were positively affected by temperature and most of the bacteria were negatively correlated with ws and sr changes in microbial concentrations in bioaerosols are related to ws the results showed that a high ws is conducive to aerosol diffusion whereas light intensity has the opposite effect a high rh is favorable for bacterial activity and diversity during diffusion ws and rh are major factors influencing aerosol diffusion and are important parameters in estimating aerosol diffusion the range of influence of bioaerosol diffusion is related to ws the higher the ws the greater the range of influence of aerosols pseudomonas escherichia shigella psychrobacter and serratia were strongly affected by environmental factors intestinal bacteria accounted for approximately 8 85 of the total bacterial population and may pose risks to human health following breathing or skin contact 3 2 3 2 influence of meteorological parameters on diffusion temperature rh sr ws and other environmental conditions influenced aerosol diffusion sampling of the six mwtps occurred during summer at an air temperature of 31 9 37 2 the optimal growth temperature for most bacteria in bioaerosols is 10 30 rai et al 2021 the rh ranged from 31 5 57 5 at the mwtps the concentration of bioaerosols in the air at the mwtp was high when the rh was high the cca results also showed that a high rh is favorable for bacterial survival in air most microorganisms require water for survival therefore the rh is positively correlated with the abundance of microorganisms a higher rh in air is conducive to the survival of microorganisms yan et al 2019b the sr was in the range of 216 16 w m2 585 6 w m2 and the cca result revealed a negative correlation with microorganism abundance most bacteria are sensitive to light and uv light may inactivate and kill microorganisms thereby negatively affecting the diffusion of bioaerosols fahimipour et al 2018 ws had an important relationship with the diffusion speed and distance of the bioaerosols the wind direction affected the diffusion direction therefore temperature rh sr and ws were affecting bioaerosol diffusion when simulating diffusion it was suggested to consider the influence of pathogenic bacteria particle size and ions to make the evaluation results more accurate and conducive to risk prevention 3 3 1 risk assessment as bioaerosols contain intestinal bacteria they can be used to estimate the exposure risk of people downwind of aerosols produced by sewage plants the results of an exposure dose calculation and a risk assessment are shown in fig 7 the ranges of hqinhalation inside the mwtps were 3 59 10 2 1 42 10 1 the concentration of bacteria was higher in the air undergoing surface aeration 1 16 10 1 than in that undergoing submerged aeration 6 01 10 2 the hazard quotient hq and hi decreased with increasing distance downwind the hqinhalation of the bacteria at 100 m dw and 200 m dw at each mwtp ranged from 1 85 10 3 6 93 10 3 and 9 24 10 4 4 62 10 3 respectively which were 5 88 and 3 28 on average in the brt section respectively the hqinhalation of the bacteria in air undergoing surface aeration at 100 m dw and 200 m dw were 6 56 10 3 and 4 16 10 3 respectively which were higher than those in air undergoing submerged aeration 3 82 103 and 1 63 10 3 respectively bioaerosol diffusion probably exerted higher risks at 100 m dw and 200 m dw in gba a than at the other mwtps due to its higher hqinhalation 1 66 10 3 and 3 79 10 3 respectively the hqinhalation of intestinal bacteria at 100 m dw and 200 m dw at each mwtp ranged from 9 24 10 5 7 39 10 4 and 9 24 10 4 4 62 10 3 respectively the individual risks were low at the sites investigated and they remained below the acceptable levels stipulated by the usepa 1 for noncarcinogenic pollutants as the risk to the skin was several orders of magnitude lower than that following inhalation and was negligible respiratory inhalation was regarded as the main pathway for microbial bioaerosol entry into the human body the hi reached its highest level in nco the order of exposure hq following inhalation was children adult males adult females it is worth noting that the exposure hazard for children is generally higher than that for adults owing to their lower weight fig 2s demonstrated the prediction results of faprotax microbial community function at brt of all mwtps a total of 7 dominant predicted functional groups were detected including chemoheterotrophy aerobic chemoheterotrophy nitrate reduction fermentation human associated functional group and pathogenic functional groups animal parasites or symbionts human pathogens among them human associated functional group human pathogens and animal parasites or symbionts were higher at nc a indicating that the microorganism at nc a has potential risk to human health 3 3 2 factors influencing exposure risk the results of the evaluation obtained using the aerosol generation source and total bacterial value diffused to the outside indicated that the exposure risk of bioaerosols was negligible the mwtps in the nc area had higher internal and downwind risks meanwhile because of the high ws the nc area had a wider bioaerosol exposure risk range it is worth noting that compared with bottom aeration the risk of bioaerosols produced by surface aeration was greater with an increase in the distance from the aerosol generation source the concentration of bioaerosols in the air gradually decreased and the exposure risk decreased accordingly 3 3 2 1 impact of microorganism abundance on bioaerosol risk the microorganism concentrations were used to calculate the bioaerosol risk in this study however this risk of bioaerosol in reality might be higher than evaluated microorganisms present in the air may multiply during transportation fahimipour et al 2018 in addition air contains mg2 ca2 so4 2 and other chemicals which may create a microenvironment suitable for the survival of airborne microorganisms with the progression of diffusion microorganisms in air generally lose their activity or die however aerosols produced in water may behave differently from those in other environments such as soil and vegetation aeration generates a droplet membrane that breaks the water surface to generate aerosols therefore most aerosols produced in water contain microorganisms in the droplet membrane the droplets help the microorganisms to attach to the aerosol particles reduce the direct irradiation of some ultraviolet rays protect the viability of some microorganisms and protect microorganisms from external damage e g wind induced damage or death droplet membranes also increase the humidity in the environment of microorganisms and allow bacteria to survive meanwhile water and soluble chemicals in the droplet membrane can provide nutrients for microorganisms the current risk assessment calculation method does not consider intestinal bacteria small particles scs or other factors table s3 presents the species and genera of intestinal bacteria after diffusion intestinal bacteria scs and fine particles were still present the detected concentrations of intestinal bacteria were 2 cfu m3 8 cfu m3 and 1 cfu m3 3 cfu m3 when intestinal bacteria spread to 100 dw and 200 dw respectively therefore intestinal bacteria pose a potential risk intestinal bacteria including pseudomonas acinetobacter and serratia were detected in the aerosols they may proliferate and maintain their activity during diffusion thereby increasing the risk associated with aerosols second although the number of intestinal bacteria was low the current calculation method does not consider pathogenicity if bacteria are pathogenic although the risk of exposure is low the risk of long term exposure for on site workers cannot be ignored fine particles of 4 cfu m3 24 cfu m3 and 3 cfu m3 11 cfu m3 were also detected at 100 dw and 200 dw respectively the exposure risk was mainly related to the concentration of bacteria the number of bacteria decreased gradually from the proximal end to the distal end of diffusion and the amount of coarse and fine particles also decreased at the proximal end of diffusion the aeration mode had a greater impact surface aeration produces coarser particles that mainly affect the upper respiratory tract because of the sedimentation of coarse particles the distal end 100 m dw and 200 m dw of diffusion is dominated by fine particles which may enter deeper parts of the human body soluble ions at concentration of 1 36 μg m3 5 60 μg m3 and 0 60 μg m3 3 89 μg m3 were detected at 100 m dw and 200 m dw respectively soluble chemicals diffused far into the air to provide nutrients for microorganisms and help them maintain vitality therefore the bioaerosols produced by sewage treatment plants may contain more active intestinal bacteria in the current risk assessment calculation method intestinal bacteria fine particles scs and other factors are not considered therefore on site protection should be strengthened suggestions for protecting workers include wearing masks and protective clothing 4 conclusions concentrations particle size distribution population and soluble ion number of the total bacteria and intestinal bacteria of bioaerosol in the six mwtps present variation because of regional differences and aeration modes mwtps in north china generated more bioaerosol compared with other areas while mwtps with surface aeration process produced higher amounts of bioaerosol than submerge aeration process wind direction affected the diffusion direction the diffusion distance and range were related to the ws and source strength of the bioaerosol the dispersion of bioaerosols with different particle sizes varied surface aeration resulted in more aerosol diffusion with an increase in the distance from the mwtps the exposure risk gradually decreased the number of microorganisms pathogenic bacteria ions and fine particles affect the risk of diffusion since there may be more than one source of bioaerosol production this part of the study can be used to distinguish whether bioaerosols in residential exposure areas come from mwtps thus speculate the impact of bioaerosol generated by mwtps on surrounding area this study simulated the bioaerosol

study the biological reaction tanks brts of six mwtps undergoing typical processes in north china yangtze river delta and the greater bay area were selected to set up sampling points and investigate the production characteristics of bioaerosols the atmospheric dispersion modelling system method was used to simulate the diffusion of bioaerosols in the mwtps the concentrations of bacteria and specifically intestinal bacteria in the bioaerosols ranged from 389 cfu m3 to 1 536 cfu m3 and 30 cfu m3 to 152 cfu m3 respectively and the proportion of the intestinal bacteria was 8 85 the concentration of soluble chemicals scs in the bioaerosols was 18 36 μg m3 82 19 μg m3 and the main scs found were mg2 ca2 and so4 2 the proportion of intestinal bacteria 75 79 produced via surface aeration by a brt attached to large sized bioaerosol particles was higher than that of a brt undergoing the bottom aeration process 37 28 the main microorganisms found in the bioaerosols included moraxellaceae escherichia shigella psychrobacter and cyanobacteria the generation of bioaerosols exhibited regional characteristics the wastewater treatment scale wastewater quality and aeration mode were the main factors influencing bioaerosol production model simulation showed that after 1 h the diffusion distance of bioaerosol was 292 m 515 m and the affected area was 42 895 m2 91 708 m2 the diffusion distance and range of the bioaerosols were significantly correlated with the concentration at the bioaerosol source and the aeration mode adopted by the brts wind speed and direction were two environmental factors that affected the diffusion of bioaerosols with an increase in the diffusion distance the concentration of microorganisms intestinal bacteria ions and fine particles in the bioaerosols decreased significantly resulting in a corresponding reduction in the exposure risk this study provides new insights to help predict bioaerosol risks at mwtps and identify safe areas around mwtps the study also provides a basis for selecting safe mwtp sites and reducing bioaerosol pollution risks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment bioaerosol generation characteristics trajectory prediction diffusion factors 1 introduction wastewater treatment is considered a major source of bioaerosols most urban wastewater treatments use activated sludge processes that use microorganisms to degrade organic matter in wastewater into harmless substances however oxygen is required to maintain the growth of the microorganisms and the reaction therefore biochemical treatment processes usually adopt aeration and microorganisms may enter the air during the process of bioaerosol generation when bioaerosols contain intestinal bacteria viruses or fungi and their spores that cause allergic reactions they can cause diseases in the human respiratory tract brenner et al 1988 the exposure risk and pathogenesis of bioaerosol requires further investigation bioaerosols containing bacteria and fungi have been detected in the air around biological reaction tanks brts during oxidation ditch sequencing batch reactor activated sludge process sbr and anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o processes li et al 2011 xu et al 2018 in a previous study the concentration of particles in bioaerosol produced as a result of wastewater treatment reached 1233 m3 6533 m3 and the microbial concentration reached more than 1690 cfu m3 li et al 2016 the particle size of bioaerosols in municipal wastewater treatment plants mwtps is generally 2 1μm 3 3 μm laitinen et al 1994 bioaerosols produced by mwtps may contain various pathogenic microorganisms such as viruses rotavirus norovirus adenovirus hepatitis virus and coliphages and intestinal bacteria micrococcus bacteroides chryseobacterium pseudomonas and acinetobacter they can cause infections following inhalation swallowing and skin contact gotkowska plachta et al 2013 wang et al 2018b wang et al 2018c previous studies on wastewater treatment of bioaerosols have mainly focused on their emission levels particle size characteristics and population structure li et al 2011 wang et al 2018c infective pathogens can be transported over long distances via airflow van doremalen et al 2020 it was found that the concentration of microorganisms decreased significantly at 500 m downwind of the bioaerosol source and each mwtp presented its own bioaerosol diffusion characteristics brts are sewage treatment facilities built outdoors the bioaerosol generated by them will spread around the mwtp with the wind bringing potential risks to the downwind area bioaerosol transport and dispersion models that describe the spatial and temporal distributions of aerosol concentrations are commonly generated using computational fluid dynamics cfd which usually represent the turbulent transport of momentum and energy using eddy diffusivities in the corresponding governing equations hayashi et al 2002 yang et al 2014 the viruses in public places bioaerosols in hospital diagnosis and treatment sites and particulate matter emissions from aquaculture farms were calculated and simulated by this method to predict the infection caused by the spread of particulate pollutants and prevent the exposure risk brought about by them archer et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 analytical solutions obtained using the gaussian like atmospheric dispersion modelling system adms based on the cfd principle can provide a quick prediction of the probability of taking in bioaerosol in this study the adms was used to study bioaerosol diffusion at the mwtp scale because it is helpful to reduce bioaerosols and their exposure risk studies on bioaerosol diffusion characteristics have attracted increasing attention in this study six mwtps undergoing oxidation ditch sbr and a2 o processes were investigated in three regions of china the chemical composition of bioaerosol was analyzed by ion chromatography high throughput sequencing was used to analyze microbial population in bioaerosols the adms was used to simulate the diffusion of bioaerosols from the mwtps to explore the diffusion law of bioaerosols analyzing the influencing factors of bioaerosol diffusion and evaluating the bioaerosol transport risk may contribute to risk predictions of bioaerosols from mwtps which in turn can provide a basis for safely selecting mwtp sites and reducing bioaerosol pollution risks 2 materials and methods 2 1 municipal mwtp descriptions sampling sites for bioaerosol capture were set up 1 5 m above the aeration tanks of

proposed industrial installations which was originally developed for regulatory authorities in the uk it has been widely applied to simulate the diffusion of gasses or particles in various situations hood et al 2020 jaffe et al 2020 adms was utilized in the simulation of bioaerosol diffusion in this study considering the change of microbial activity in bioaerosols this study adjusted and improved the model parameters such as the type selection of particles representing aerosols dry and wet sedimentation boundary layer processes chemical reactions and topography the adjusted model is compared

utilized to forecast bioaerosols hazard in this study 3 results 3 1 aerosol emission 3 1 1 aerosol emission level fig 1 demonstrates the bacteria and intestinal bacteria in bioaerosol escaped in the brt section of the six mwtps the concentrations of bioaerosols presented upwind were also measured with 275 cfu m3 for nco 177 cfu m3 for nc a 75 cfu m3 for yzd o 42 cfu m3 for yzd a 99 cfu m3 for gba o and 51 cfu m3 for gba a respectively the emission level of bioaerosols found at all brts were higher than those presented in the air upwind table s1 the concentration of airborne bacteria at the mwtps ranged from 389 cfu m3 to 1536 cfu m3 with the concentrations in the nco nc a yzd o yzd a gba o and gba a being 1536 cfu m3 1009 cfu m3 1184 cfu m3 554 cfu m3 1056 cfu m3 and 389 cfu m3 respectively mwtps using the surface aeration method had a higher concentration of bacteria 1258 cfu m3 intestinal bacteria were found at each mwtp with concentrations ranging from 30 cfu m3 to 1 52 cfu m3 accounting for 8 04 of the total bacterial population mwtps in the nc area generated more bacteria and specifically intestinal bacteria with averages of 1273 cfu m3 and 140 cfu m3 respectively than did those in the other areas which had averages of 796 cfu m3 and 47 cfu m3 respectively fig 2 shows the soluble chemicals scs detected in bioaerosols at the six mwtps scs were detected at each mwtp and the amount of ten kinds of scs ranged from 18 36 μg m3 82 19 μg m3 bioaerosols at the mwtps of the nc and gba areas had higher sc contents with an average of 73 74 μg m3 than did those in the yzd area with an average of 37 89 μg m3 mg2 ca2 and so4 2 were the major scs in the bioaerosols at each mwtp accounting for 29 84 of the total sc content 3 1 2 aerosol particle size distribution the size distributions of the bioaerosol particles to which the airborne and intestinal bacteria attached at each mwtps are shown in fig 3 the aerodynamic cut size diameters of the six stage viable andersen cascade impactor are over 7 0 µm in stage 1 4 7 7 0 µm in stage 2 3 3 4 7 µm in stage 3 2 1 3 3 µm in stage 4 1 1 2 1 µm in stage 5 0 65 1 1 µm in stage 6 the microbial aerosol particles collected in this study were classified as fine particles which picked from the stage 5 and the stage 6 and coarse particles that sampled from the stage 1 to the stage 4 the inhalation of particles smaller than 10 μm has detrimental health effects such as causing asthma and cardiovascular disease urbán et al 2015 vestlund et al 2014 at the sampling sites nco yzd o and gba o 69 73 to 80 56 of the intestinal bacteria were attached to coarse particles with an average concentration of 64 cfu m3 while the average concentration of the fine particles was 23 cfu m3 at the sampling sites nc a yzd a and gba a 62 72 of the intestinal bacteria on average were attached to fine particles the concentrations of fine and coarse particles were 4 cfu m3 24 cfu m3 and 10 cfu m3 68 cfu m3 respectively 3 1 3 microbial population in bioaerosols this study analyzed the microbial populations at each mwtp fig 4 and table s3 show the composition and proportion of the microorganisms at each mwtp the main microorganism species in the bioaerosols varied among mwtps moraxellaceae 11 17 pseudomonas 7 11 and chroococcidiopsis 6 64 dominated the bacterial population in nc a pseudomonas escherichia shigella and psychrobacter accounted for 84 63 of the bacterial population in nco cyanobacteria was the dominant microorganism in yzd a accounting for 80 46 of the overall bacterial population while in yzd o cyanobacteria 28 65 candidatus 8 76 and saccharibacteria 4 55 were the most abundant the dominant species in gba a were sphingomona 9 74 sphingomonadales 6 97 and mitochondria 6 29 while peptostreptococcaceae 13 79 mycobacterium 4 75 and sphingobacteriaceae 4 47 were the dominant bacteria in gba o intestinal bacteria including moraxellaceae pseudomonas acinetobacter arcobacter neisseriaceae escherichia shigella mycobacterium saccharibacteria romboutsia serratia and flexibacter were detected in bioaerosols at the mwtps pseudomonas is a common pathogenic bacterium that can cause endocarditis osteomyelitis pneumonia urinary tract infections gastrointestinal infections meningitis and sepsis rice et al 2012 diseases caused by pseudomonas are becoming more common gomez gamboa et al 2021 acinetobacter mainly causes respiratory and urinary tract infections sepsis and secondary meningitis gao et al 2014 gou et al 2016 serratia can cause urinary tract respiratory tract and wound infections kowalski et al 2017 escherichia shigella is a common pathogenic bacterium that can cause extra intestinal infections acute diarrhea bacillary dysentery and other diseases kotloff et al 2018 rodriguez angeles 2002 therefore in addition to strengthening the personal protection of workers such as by wearing masks and goggles brts especially the oxidation ditch need to be equipped with protective covers and other facilities to prevent the escape of bioaerosols 3 1 4 bioaerosol generation there were differences in the number particle size distribution and composition of total bacteria and enterobacteriaceae in aerosols released from each sewage treatment plant and the concentrations of scs in the aerosols differed similar results were reported in previous studies wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018d reasons for this difference might be differences in regional characteristics and aeration modes the water quality and environmental conditions of sewage treatment plants differ regionally aerosol generation is related to water quality and environmental conditions therefore the concentration of microorganisms generated in nc which has a high concentration of microorganisms in its sewage was high the diffusion of bioaerosols produced by wastewater treatment plants undergoing surface oxygenation and bottom oxygenation differed within the same area this may be related to the different mechanisms of bioaerosol generation as a result of bottom aeration and surface aeration the bottom aeration process filled the bottom of the water body with gas and the gas formed bubbles at the bottom of the liquid and gradually rose to the liquid surface during this process sludge flocs from the bottom and middle of the liquid were carried to the surface during the process of surface rupture the bubbles reaching the surface transported substances in the sewage to the air resulting in a loss of water and aerosolizing in the air thereby forming aerosols surface aeration oxygenation facilities are located at liquid surfaces and often disturb water surfaces owing to the motion of rotating brushes after flapping and raising water surface liquid is wrapped with substances in sewage and is transported into the air and the splashing of large droplets water loss and atomization of small droplets leads to bioaerosols generation near the specific brush data on aerosol production characteristics in this study also confirmed that both surface and bottom aeration produces bioaerosols the higher the amount of bioaerosols produced the higher the concentration in the air at 200 m dw compared with surface aeration bottom aeration produces less bioaerosol the concentration in the air emitted by bottom aeration was also lower at 200 m dw 3 2 bioaerosol diffusion the adms was used to calculate the diffusion of bioaerosols microorganisms particles and water soluble ions the flowstar model was used to calculate flow and turbulence fields over the terrain by introducing meteorological parameters wind direction and wind speed are the dominant factor influencing bioaerosol diffusion direction and range wei et al 2020 the rose chart of the wind direction in north china the greater bay area and the yangtze river delta are shown in fig 5 the dominant wind directions in north china were south 44 66 and north 22 74 east 20 55 northeast 16 71 and north 15 07 winds were dominant in yangtze river delta north 25 21 southeast 21 10 and northeast 20 01 winds were dominant in the greater bay area 3 2 1 aerosol diffusion direction the concentrations of bioaerosols produced at the mwtps were used to simulate the diffusion of bacteria in air using the adms model fig 6 and table s3 the simulation results showed that bioaerosols from the mwtps diffused evenly after 1 h of diffusion high aerosol concentrations were found close to the generation source and their diffusion was distributed in clumps mwtps in the same region had similar diffusion directions that closely correlated to the wind direction the diffusion trends in nc a and nco had a southwest northwest 139 elliptic distribution the diffusion trends in gba a and gba o exhibited southeast to northwest 164 elliptic distributions diffusion in yzd a exhibited an elliptic distribution with a southwest northeast 243 trend while that in yzd o exhibited a west east trend 285 elliptic distribution 3 2 2 aerosol diffusion scope the concentrations of bacteria in the aerosol diffusion direction at 100 m 100 m dw the boundary of the mwtps and 200 m 200 m dw residential areas varied among the mwtps the bioaerosol concentrations at 100 m dw and 200 m dw in nc a and nco ranged from 63 cfu m3 75 cfu m3 and 25 cfu m3 35 cfu m3 respectively the spread of bioaerosol from yzd a and yzd o at 100 m dw and 200 m dw ranged from 41 cfu m3 66 cfu m3 and 18 cfu m3 50 cfu m3 respectively the spread of bioaerosol in gba a and gba o also ranged from 20 cfu m3 72 cfu m3 and 50 cfu m3 55 cfu m3 at 100 m dw and 200 m dw respectively the concentration of intestinal bacteria at 100 m dw and 200 m dw at each mwtp ranged from 1 cfu m3 8 cfu m3 and 1 cfu m3 3 cfu m3 respectively bacteria attached to fine particles also decreased with increasing distance with concentrations ranging from 4 cfu m3 22 cfu m3 and 3 cfu m3 11 cfu m3 at 100 m dw and 200 m dw respectively the total concentration of scs decreased to 3 62 μg m3 and 2 02 μg m3 on average at 100 m dw and 200 m dw respectively the bioaerosol diffusion distance 292 515 m and affected area 42 895 91 708 m2 differed among the mwtps aerosols in nco spread 423 m in the northwest direction and affected an area of 61 385 m2 the microorganisms in nc a spread 301 m northwest with an affected diffusion area of approximately 42 895 m2 microorganisms in yzd o spread 307 m northwest affecting an area of 47 333 m2 the diffusion distance of microorganisms in yzd a was 554 m and the diffusion area was 80 614 m2 microorganisms in gba o spread 292 m northwest with an affected diffusion area of approximately 48 073 m2 microorganisms in gba a spread 515 m northwest with an affected diffusion area of approximately 91 708 m2 the concentration at the diffusion edge was as low as in the range of 2 cfu m3 20 cfu m3 3 2 3 factors influencing diffusion 3 2 3 1 influence of source strength on the diffusion range diffusion analysis of aerosols generated at the mwtps indicated that there were differences in the aerosol diffusion results during the brt stage mechanical disturbances were major causes of aerosol generation the high microbial content and intense sewage aeration led to a large amount of aerosol being generated in the brt section as supported by previous studies wang et al 2019 yang et al 2019 therefore the bioaerosol concentrations in nco were higher at 200 m dw than at the mwtps in the other areas the level of bioaerosol generated at the source influenced bioaerosol diffusion the higher the level at the source the more microorganisms dispersed in the downward direction the species and concentrations of bacteria varied with place depending on the process selected and meteorological parameters e g temperature rh and ws canonical correlation analysis cca was conducted to describe the influence of these factors on bacterial populations in bioaerosols fig s1 li et al 2017 the results demonstrated that environmental factors influence bacterial emissions among them rh temperature sr and ws were the major factors influencing the level of airborne bacteria in the air which is consistent with results obtained in previous reports yan et al 2019a the rh temperature and sr were positively correlated with airborne intestinal bacteria release and dispersal whereas ws was negatively correlated with airborne intestinal bacteria release and dispersal table 3 high temperatures and rh favor microbiological growth whereas strong winds help disperse bioaerosol particles owing to the suitable temperature appropriate rh and low ws higher bioaerosol concentrations were maintained in the air similar results were obtained from cca of strain influencing factors some microbes were sensitive to meteorological conditions cca results also showed that environmental factors have different effects on different types of microorganisms the rh had a strong positive effect on pseudomonas psychrobacter and serratia that were positively affected by temperature and most of the bacteria were negatively correlated with ws and sr changes in microbial concentrations in bioaerosols are related to ws the results showed that a high ws is conducive to aerosol diffusion whereas light intensity has the opposite effect a high rh is favorable for bacterial activity and diversity during diffusion ws and rh are major factors influencing aerosol diffusion and are important parameters in estimating aerosol diffusion the range of influence of bioaerosol diffusion is related to ws the higher the ws the greater the range of influence of aerosols pseudomonas escherichia shigella psychrobacter and serratia were strongly affected by environmental factors intestinal bacteria accounted for approximately 8 85 of the total bacterial population and may pose risks to human health following breathing or skin contact 3 2 3 2 influence of meteorological parameters on diffusion temperature rh sr ws and other environmental conditions influenced aerosol diffusion sampling of the six mwtps occurred during summer at an air temperature of 31 9 37 2 the optimal growth temperature for most bacteria in bioaerosols is 10 30 rai et al 2021 the rh ranged from 31 5 57 5 at the mwtps the concentration of bioaerosols in the air at the mwtp was high when the rh was high the cca results also showed that a high rh is favorable for bacterial survival in air most microorganisms require water for survival therefore the rh is positively correlated with the abundance of microorganisms a higher rh in air is conducive to the survival of microorganisms yan et al 2019b the sr was in the range of 216 16 w m2 585 6 w m2 and the cca result revealed a negative correlation with microorganism abundance most bacteria are sensitive to light and uv light may inactivate and kill microorganisms thereby negatively affecting the diffusion of bioaerosols fahimipour et al 2018 ws had an important relationship with the diffusion speed and distance of the bioaerosols the wind direction affected the diffusion direction therefore temperature rh sr and ws were affecting bioaerosol diffusion when simulating diffusion it was suggested to consider the influence of pathogenic bacteria particle size and ions to make the evaluation results more accurate and conducive to risk prevention 3 3 1 risk assessment as bioaerosols contain intestinal bacteria they can be used to estimate the exposure risk of people downwind of aerosols produced by sewage plants the results of an exposure dose calculation and a risk assessment are shown in fig 7 the ranges of hqinhalation inside the mwtps were 3 59 10 2 1 42 10 1 the concentration of bacteria was higher in the air undergoing surface aeration 1 16 10 1 than in that undergoing submerged aeration 6 01 10 2 the hazard quotient hq and hi decreased with increasing distance downwind the hqinhalation of the bacteria at 100 m dw and 200 m dw at each mwtp ranged from 1 85 10 3 6 93 10 3 and 9 24 10 4 4 62 10 3 respectively which were 5 88 and 3 28 on average in the brt section respectively the hqinhalation of the bacteria in air undergoing surface aeration at 100 m dw and 200 m dw were 6 56 10 3 and 4 16 10 3 respectively which were higher than those in air undergoing submerged aeration 3 82 103 and 1 63 10 3 respectively bioaerosol diffusion probably exerted higher risks at 100 m dw and 200 m dw in gba a than at the other mwtps due to its higher hqinhalation 1 66 10 3 and 3 79 10 3 respectively the hqinhalation of intestinal bacteria at 100 m dw and 200 m dw at each mwtp ranged from 9 24 10 5 7 39 10 4 and 9 24 10 4 4 62 10 3 respectively the individual risks were low at the sites investigated and they remained below the acceptable levels stipulated by the usepa 1 for noncarcinogenic pollutants as the risk to the skin was several orders of magnitude lower than that following inhalation and was negligible respiratory inhalation was regarded as the main pathway for microbial bioaerosol entry into the human body the hi reached its highest level in nco the order of exposure hq following inhalation was children adult males adult females it is worth noting that the exposure hazard for children is generally higher than that for adults owing to their lower weight fig 2s demonstrated the prediction results of faprotax microbial community function at brt of all mwtps a total of 7 dominant predicted functional groups were detected including chemoheterotrophy aerobic chemoheterotrophy nitrate reduction fermentation human associated functional group and pathogenic functional groups animal parasites or symbionts human pathogens among them human associated functional group human pathogens and animal parasites or symbionts were higher at nc a indicating that the microorganism at nc a has potential risk to human health 3 3 2 factors influencing exposure risk the results of the evaluation obtained using the aerosol generation source and total bacterial value diffused to the outside indicated that the exposure risk of bioaerosols was negligible the mwtps in the nc area had higher internal and downwind risks meanwhile because of the high ws the nc area had a wider bioaerosol exposure risk range it is worth noting that compared with bottom aeration the risk of bioaerosols produced by surface aeration was greater with an increase in the distance from the aerosol generation source the concentration of bioaerosols in the air gradually decreased and the exposure risk decreased accordingly 3 3 2 1 impact of microorganism abundance on bioaerosol risk the microorganism concentrations were used to calculate the bioaerosol risk in this study however this risk of bioaerosol in reality might be higher than evaluated microorganisms present in the air may multiply during transportation fahimipour et al 2018 in addition air contains mg2 ca2 so4 2 and other chemicals which may create a microenvironment suitable for the survival of airborne microorganisms with the progression of diffusion microorganisms in air generally lose their activity or die however aerosols produced in water may behave differently from those in other environments such as soil and vegetation aeration generates a droplet membrane that breaks the water surface to generate aerosols therefore most aerosols produced in water contain microorganisms in the droplet membrane the droplets help the microorganisms to attach to the aerosol particles reduce the direct irradiation of some ultraviolet rays protect the viability of some microorganisms and protect microorganisms from external damage e g wind induced damage or death droplet membranes also increase the humidity in the environment of microorganisms and allow bacteria to survive meanwhile water and soluble chemicals in the droplet membrane can provide nutrients for microorganisms the current risk assessment calculation method does not consider intestinal bacteria small particles scs or other factors table s3 presents the species and genera of intestinal bacteria after diffusion intestinal bacteria scs and fine particles were still present the detected concentrations of intestinal bacteria were 2 cfu m3 8 cfu m3 and 1 cfu m3 3 cfu m3 when intestinal bacteria spread to 100 dw and 200 dw respectively therefore intestinal bacteria pose a potential risk intestinal bacteria including pseudomonas acinetobacter and serratia were detected in the aerosols they may proliferate and maintain their activity during diffusion thereby increasing the risk associated with aerosols second although the number of intestinal bacteria was low the current calculation method does not consider pathogenicity if bacteria are pathogenic although the risk of exposure is low the risk of long term exposure for on site workers cannot be ignored fine particles of 4 cfu m3 24 cfu m3 and 3 cfu m3 11 cfu m3 were also detected at 100 dw and 200 dw respectively the exposure risk was mainly related to the concentration of bacteria the number of bacteria decreased gradually from the proximal end to the distal end of diffusion and the amount of coarse and fine particles also decreased at the proximal end of diffusion the aeration mode had a greater impact surface aeration produces coarser particles that mainly affect the upper respiratory tract because of the sedimentation of coarse particles the distal end 100 m dw and 200 m dw of diffusion is dominated by fine particles which may enter deeper parts of the human body soluble ions at concentration of 1 36 μg m3 5 60 μg m3 and 0 60 μg m3 3 89 μg m3 were detected at 100 m dw and 200 m dw respectively soluble chemicals diffused far into the air to provide nutrients for microorganisms and help them maintain vitality therefore the bioaerosols produced by sewage treatment plants may contain more active intestinal bacteria in the current risk assessment calculation method intestinal bacteria fine particles scs and other factors are not considered therefore on site protection should be strengthened suggestions for protecting workers include wearing masks and protective clothing 4 conclusions concentrations particle size distribution population and soluble ion number of the total bacteria and intestinal bacteria of bioaerosol in the six mwtps present variation because of regional differences and aeration modes mwtps in north china generated more bioaerosol compared with other areas while mwtps with surface aeration process produced higher amounts of bioaerosol than submerge aeration process wind direction affected the diffusion direction the diffusion distance and range were related to the ws and source strength of the bioaerosol the dispersion of bioaerosols with different particle sizes varied surface aeration resulted in more aerosol diffusion with an increase in the distance from the mwtps the exposure risk gradually decreased the number of microorganisms pathogenic bacteria ions and fine particles affect the risk of diffusion since there may be more than one source of bioaerosol production this part of the study can be used to distinguish whether bioaerosols in residential exposure areas come from mwtps thus speculate the impact of bioaerosol generated by mwtps on surrounding area this study simulated the bioaerosol diffusion generated from mwtp helping mwtps sites selection and reducing bioaerosols possible risks funding sources this project is supported by the special fund of state key joint laboratory of

15097,dissolved ozone concentration measurement is crucial for ozone treatment in the most used conventional indigo method the ozone concentration is measured by the decrease in absorbance due to the loss of the c c double bond of indigotrisulfonic acid however measurement of ozone concentration is difficult when water contains substances that react with c c double bonds other than ozone to address this concern we developed a novel breakthrough method to measure ozone concentration by measuring the p formylbenzoic acid p fba produced after the reaction of p vinylbenzoic acid and ozone the formation of p fba was almost not caused by other substances hypochlorous acid hypobromous acid permanganate ion and hydrogen peroxide and its yield to ozone was maintained at 1 in river water treated wastewater and seawater in addition the experimental error is smaller with the new method than with indigo furthermore the new method does not require cumbersome calibration unlike indigo method because highly pure forms of p fba are commercially available p fba can be separated by liquid chromatography and detected with highly sensitive ultraviolet and mass spectrometric detectors and hence easily analyzed simultaneously with other substances our new method contributes to extensive ozone treatment and ozonation management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

introduction ozone treatment is applied in various fields such as water and wastewater seawater food medical care sewage sludge and pulp bleaching holah et al 2016 loeb et al 2012 paul and liu 2012 tripathi et al 2020 in practice and research in these fields the measurement of dissolved ozone concentration is crucial in the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 which is currently used for measuring dissolved ozone concentration water containing ozone is mixed with an indigotrisulfonic acid indigo solution adjusted to ph 2 using phosphate buffer ozone reacts with the c c double bond in indigo in a 1 1 molar ratio the concentration of indigo before and after the reaction is measured using absorption spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 600 nm and the ozone concentration is calculated the indigo method has long supported ozone treatment but has five limitations firstly the reaction of substances other than ozone such as hypochlorous acid yoshizawa 2019 hypobromous acid penru et al 2013 and permanganate ion gregory and carlson 2001 hydrogen peroxide bader and hoigné 1981 with the c c double bond can result in an overestimation of ozone concentration considering that a large amount of hypobromous acid is produced during the ozonation of seawater there is currently no method to selectively detect ozone concentration buchan et al 2005 in seawater secondly the purity of commercially available indigo is less than 80 and contains many impurities it is reported that even with the same manufacturer the measured molar absorption coefficients of indigo are different on different dates of manufacture gordon and bubnis 2002 thus calibration of molar absorption coefficients is needed but it is cumbersome and beset with uncertainties because of the high volatility of dissolved ozone in addition some ozone treatment facilities do not have the capacity to perform this calibration thirdly the stoichiometry of ozone and indigo is dependent on ph if the ph of the solution is above 4 in any fraction during mixing the amino group in indigo reacts with ozone and a fixed stoichiometry is not maintained bader and hoigné 1981 fourth the concentration of the indigo reagent and mixing ratio of the indigo solution to ozone water should be optimized according to the ozone concentration bader and hoigné 1981 fifth is the effect of the absorbance of the sample measured at a wavelength of 600 nm as ozone is effective in removing color it is often applied to highly colored water therefore the dissolved ozone concentration is often measured with a high background absorbance at a wavelength of 600 nm it may be possible to remove ozone separately with a reducing agent that does not interfere with absorbance at a wavelength of 600 nm and subtract it as background noize however this operation is cumbersome and introduces additional measurement errors to summarize it is desirable to develop a novel measurement that overcomes these drawbacks to selectively accurately and conveniently measure dissolved ozone concentrations in various fields therefore we propose a new method to measure ozone concentration using the reaction of p vinylbenzoic acid p vba with ozone to produce p formylbenzoic acid p fba in equal amounts to the reacted ozone it is expected that oxidants other than ozone react with p vba to produce little or no p fba p vba fujifilm wako pure chemical corporation 2021 and p fba apollo scientific ltd 2021 are commercially available with guaranteed purities of 97 or higher and are suitable for quantification p vba has no sites that react quickly with ozone other than vinyl groups regardless of the ph p fba can be separated by liquid ion or gas santander et al 2013 chromatography and detected with high sensitivity by ultraviolet uv and mass spectrometry ms detectors p fba measurement carried out using column separation is not affected by coexisting substances and simultaneous analysis with other substances is possible it is common to measure the concentration not only of dissolved ozone but also of pollutants at any moment in ozone treatment experiments the p vba method differs significantly from the indigo method as stated above and its measurement error can also be significantly lower according to the globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals p vba and p fba are relatively safe reagents on the aspect that indigo method can be performed with a spectrophotometer it is superior to the p vba method however based on the price at the purchase for this paper fujifilm wako pure chemical corporation tokyo chemical industry co ltd p vba is 7 392 jpy per 5 g and indigo is 28 215 jpy per 5 g taking molar mass and reagent purity into account the price of p vba is 1 22nd that of indigo in the aspect of reagent cost p vba method is less expensive than indigo method even considering the purchase of p fba the structure of p vba was chosen as the c c double bond reacts quickly and stoichiometrically with ozone and a benzene ring is required for sensitive uv detection it may seem possible to use a reaction in which vinylbenzene reacts with ozone to form benzaldehyde however benzaldehyde is a known byproduct of ozone richardson et al 1999 and its structure needs to be specialized carboxy groups are easily ionized enabling analysis with ion chromatography ic and contributing to higher sensitivity in liquid chromatography lc ms analysis furthermore carboxy groups improve hydrophilicity reduce adsorption on experimental instruments and improve analytical precision therefore the carboxyl group is considered a strong candidate for the specificity of vinylbenzene to make this study more comprehensive vinylbenzenes other than p vba m vinylbenzoic acid m vba o vinylbenzoic acid o vba p chlorocinnamic acid and p bromocinnamic acid were examined for their suitability as reagents for ozone determination the effect of persulfuric acid on the indigo and p vba methods was also examined zhou et al 2019 although it is widely known that carbonyl is formed by the reaction of ozone with a c c double bond it has not been established as a quantitative method for ozone this study demonstrates the robustness and advantages of the p vba method by various experiments and analyses 2 methodology 2 1 environmental water samples as a representative of river water a sample from the katsura river in kyoto prefecture japan was used as a representative example of wastewater the secondary effluent from a sewage treatment plant in kyoto prefecture japan was used as a representative example of seawater osaka bay coastal water in osaka prefecture japan was used the samples were filtered through 1 µm pore size glass microfiber filters gf b from cytiva japan the basic water qualities of the samples are listed in table s1 2 2 reagents the purity of all reagents in this study was determined by the supplier the following were acquired

purity 95 regarded as 97 5 and o vba purity 99 7 from thermo fisher scientific inc usa p chlorocinnamic acid purity 99 8 from merck kgaa germany the rest of the reagents were of analytical grade the hypobromous acid solution was adjusted by mixing the sodium bromide and hypochlorous acid solutions tokunaga et al 2007 ozone solution was prepared by blowing ozone gas into ice cold or room temperature 20 25 c ultrapure water or a 1 mm phosphate buffer solution ph 3 ozone gas from an ozone generator sga 01 pas2 sumitomo precision products co ltd japan was blown into water to remove nox and dehumidified the p vba solution was prepared by dissolving p vba in pure water or environmental water samples reacted with 50 µm ozone initial concentration for more than 1 h post which the ozone was removed by nitrogen aeration at this pre ozone treatment the environmental water samples were diluted 1 07 times the concentrations of all p vba solutions were 0 10 g l 1 2 3 chemical analysis absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer uv 1900i shimadzu corporation japan dissolved oxygen was measured using a dissolved oxygen meter multi 3510 ids xylem analytics germany sales gmbh co kg germany the dissolved ozone concentration was measured by direct absorption spectrophotometry von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 and the p vba method for direct absorption spectrophotometry a quartz cell with an optical path length of 1 cm was sealed immediately after syringe injection of ozone water three times the cell volume and measured at a wavelength of 260 nm molar absorptivity coefficient 3200 m 1 cm 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 by performing the direct absorption spectrophotometry and the indigo method or a reaction with vinylbenzenes almost simultaneously the molar absorption coefficient of indigo or the yield of benzaldehydes were determined based on the direct absorption spectrophotometry the ozone water at this time was adjusted to a ph of 3 using phosphoric acid at room temperature and the ozone in the syringe decreased at a rate of 0 07 per minute which can be regarded as no decrease in the syringe over the timescale of the experiment the volume of ozone water before and after addition to volume was determined by converting the difference in mass the density used in the conversion was 1 02 kg l 1 for seawater and 1 00 kg l 1 for others the hypochlorite ion hypobromite ion and hydrogen peroxide concentrations were measured by absorption spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 292 nm molar absorptivity 350 m 1 cm 1 soulard et al 1981 329 nm molar absorptivity 345 m 1 cm 1 soulard et al 1981 and 240 nm molar absorptivity 39 4 m 1 cm 1 nelson and kiesow 1972 the concentrations of benzaldehydes and vinylbenzenes were measured using lc uv or lc ms acquity uplc system with pda eλ detector optical path length 1 cm or xevo tq ms detector from waters corporation united states the ms detector was used only for m z measurements of precursor ions and all quantitation was performed using a uv detector detection wavelengths and examples of detailed analysis conditions are shown in tables s2 s4 s5 and s7 2 4 experimental method 2 4 1 reaction rate measurements the rate constants of the reactions of p vba and m vba with ozone were determined by competition kinetics von sonntag and von gunten 2012 with ca and the ph was adjusted to 7 1 with phosphate buffer or 1 0 with hydrochloric acid on the time scale phosphoric acid and hydrochloric acid did not react with p vba m vba and ca the reaction rate of ozone with p vba or m vba k o 3 vba m 1 s 1 was calculated using the reaction rate of ozone with ca k o 3 ca m 1 s 1 as shown in eq 1 1 k o 3 vba ln vba vba 0 ln ca ca 0 k o 3 c a where the subscript 0 and represent the concentration before and after the reaction and vba represents the concentration of p vba or m vba m the reaction rate constants of ozone with ca are 1 2 106 or 3 8 105 m 1 s 1 in the completely dissociated state and 1 105 or 5 104 m 1 s 1 in the completely non dissociated state leitzke et al 2001 lung 1996 in addition the pk a values of p vba and ca were measured by potentiometric titration reaction rate constants of p fba with ozone hypochlorous acid hypobromous acid and permanganate ion were measured details of the experimental method are described in supplementary materials 2 4 2 false positive ozone measurements in p vba and indigo methods hypochlorite hypobromite potassium permanganate hydrogen peroxide and persulfuric acid solutions were added to the stirred p vba solution and the amount of p fba formed after the reaction was measured these oxidants were also added to the indigo solution and the amount of absorbance loss at a wavelength of 600 nm was measured the molar ratio of each oxidant to p vba or indigo was 1 10 indigo solutions containing malonic acid have also been used as reports reveal that the use of malonic acid can mask false positives of ozone due to hypochlorous acid and hypobromous acid bader and hoigné 1981 2 4 3 absorbance measurements of benzaldehydes and vinylbenzenes molar absorption coefficients of p fba m fba and terephthalic acid ta were measured the terephthalic acid is thought to be produced when p fba is oxidized absorbance was measured in a cell with 1 mm optical path length in addition the p fba solution containing 8 mg l 1 dissolved oxygen was divided into glass tubes and stored in a dark room at 4 c and their absorbances were measured at several days interval 2 4 4 comparison of ozone concentrations in environmental water samples measured by the p vba and indigo methods changes in the dissolved ozone concentration in the environmental water were measured using the p vba and indigo methods ozone water was injected into the environmental water maintained at 20 c and initial ozone concentration of the mixture was 50 µm ozone water was made from pure water and cooled on ice and the environmental water samples were diluted 1 07 times by injection of ozone water the stability of the p fba generated during the application of the p vba method to environmental water was evaluated 2 4 5 measurement error comparison method the formulae for calculating the ozone concentration q ind or q p vba μ m using the indigo method eq 2 and the p vba method eq 3 is as follows for simplicity it does not consider errors due to the background noise at 600 nm wavelength for the indigo method 2 q ind a ind v ind a mix v mix ε v mix v ind 10 6 3 q p vba c p fba p v mix y v mix v p vba where a ind and a mix are the absorbance measured in a cell with a 1 cm optical path length for the indigo solution and a mixture of indigo solution and water containing ozone no unit v ind v p vba and v mix are the volumes of the indigo solution p vba solution and a mixture of ozone water and indigo solution or p vba solution ml respectively ε is the molar absorption coefficient m 1 cm 1 for this error comparison a common ε of 20000 m 1 cm 1 was set bridgewater et al 2012 the absorbance of the indigo solution was set bridgewater et al 2012 to 2 and 0 2 c p fba is the concentration of p fba μ m in the mixture of ozone water and p vba solution when the purity of the p fba reagent is 1 p is the purity of the p fba reagent and y is the yield of p fba to ozone in the reaction between ozone and p vba when each measurement error δ q ind or δ q p vba µm is assumed to be random and independent of each other the errors of the indigo and p vba methods are as shown in eqs 4 and 5 taylor 1996 δ

y 2 δ v mix was determined to be 1 µl using actual balance measurements hr 100a from a d company limited japan δ a ind and δ a mix were set because the transmittance had an error of 0 02 due to stray light sooväli et al 2006 and the actual errors appeared larger than this because of other factors δ ε was set gordon and bubnis 2002 to 5 δ p was set malz and jancke 2005 at 1 5 δ c p fba and δ y values were determined from the experimental results of this study the measurement error was determined for three mixing ratios used for both the indigo and p vba methods five analyses were performed for each mixing ratio the volume of the indigo and p vba solutions was set to 3 ml indigo solution with an absorbance of 2 05 and about 1 4 maximum 1 66 minimum 1 04 mg l 1 ozone water was used ozone concentration within each mixing ratio is the same experiments using ozone water at lower concentrations were not performed because ozone is unstable the errors of the indigo and p vba methods were determined using eqs 6 and 7 6 δ q ind q ind e ind δ e ind 2 q ind ε δ ε 2 where e ind a ind v ind a mix v mix v mix v ind 7 δ q p vba q p vba e p vba δ e p vba 2 q p vba p δ p 2 q p vba y δ y 2 where

above in the evaluation by calculation the errors of the indigo and p vba methods were compared using three representative examples of ozone concentrations of 1 4 0 5 and 0 005 mg l 1 with 1 4 mg l 1 as the experimental setting 3 results and discussion 3 1 reaction rate of ozone with p vba and m vba the pk a values of p vba and ca were determined to be 4 2 and 4 9 at 19 21 c thus p vba and ca are regarded as completely dissociated at ph 7 1 and as completely non dissociated at ph 1 0 the reaction rate constant of ozone with p vba was 1 42 95 ci 1 41 1 44 times greater than that of ozone with ca at ph 7 1 the reaction rate constant of ozone with p vba was 8 2 95 ci 7 8 8 7 times greater at ph 1 0 therefore the reaction rate constant for ozone and p vba were 1 7 106 or 5 4 105 m 1 s 1 in completely dissociated state and 8 105 or 4 105 m 1 s 1 in completely non dissociated state leitzke et al 2001 lung 1996 in the subsequent discussion the reaction rate constant was set to an average value of 1 1 106 m 1 s 1 in the completely dissociated state in addition the following assumptions were made the mixing ratio volume ratio of p vba or indigo solution to ozone containing water and p vba or indigo solution of the p vba method is 0 3 refer to discussion below and the mixing is instantaneous the ozone concentration drops to 1 10 000th within 40 ms to the best of our knowledge the earliest concentration measurement after mixing ozone and sample water is after 115 ms in buffle et al buffle et al 2006 in this study the sample water was the secondary treatment wastewater and had a relatively high doc in the study the ozone concentration was approximately halved from 0 to 115 ms so the average first order reaction rate constant for ozone was 6 s 1 if the decrease of ozone in this period is expressed as a first order reaction since the rate of ozone disappearance decreases after the reaction the reaction rate was less than 6 s 1 at 115 ms sampling point if the mixing ratio is 0 3 the ozone disappearance rate in the p vba method is 740 s 1 thus the consumption of ozone by the sample derived material is less than 0 8 which is an acceptable value for most experiments therefore even though the reaction rate of p vba with ozone is slower than that of indigo 9 4 107 m 1 s 1 muñoz and von sonntag 2000 it is sufficiently fast the reaction rate constant of ozone with m vba was 1 3 95 ci 1 2 1 4 times greater than ozone with ca at ph 7 1 and was sufficiently fast the second order reaction rate constants of p fba with ozone hypochlorite ion hypobromite ion and permanganate were less than 7 0 2 0 2 and 0 7 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 therefore p fba is stable against these oxidants 3 2 yields of benzaldehydes to ozone the ratio of benzaldehyde produced to consumed ozone is shown in fig 1 the yield of p fba is 1 whether p vba is fully dissociated ph 7 or fully non dissociated ph 1 7 the yield of p fba was maintained at 1 even in the presence of coexisting substances in environmental water samples within experiments using p vba solution at ph 7 with phosphate buffer it has been confirmed that 1 mol of ozone reacts with 1 01 95 ci 0 99 1 03 mol of p vba in the stoichiometry the data presented in fig s1 show that the photodiode array detected peak which increased after the reaction was the only p fba peak observed therefore δy in eq 5 was set to 0 different researchers have reported different values 2900 3600 m 1 cm 1 at 258 260 nm for the molar absorption coefficient of ozone in direct spectroscopy bader 1982 hart et al 1983 kilpatrick et al 1956 taube 1957 conversely based on the assumption that 1 mol of ozone reacts with p vba to produce 1 mol of p fba this study supports the molar absorption coefficient of 3200 m 1 cm 1 used here unlike phosphoric acid ammonium carbonate is a volatile buffer solution suitable for lc ms analysis however ammonia reacted with ozone at a moderate rate garland et al 1980 hoigné and bader 1983 reaction rate constant 20 or 44 m 1 s 1 if the reaction rate between ammonia and ozone is 44 m 1 s 1 and with the use of 0 1 g l 1 p vba solution the maximum concentration of ammonium carbonate is 9 mm when the amount of ammonia that reacts with ozone is less than 1 1000th of the amount of p vba unlike the indigo method the p vba method is independent of ph the recommended ammonium carbonate concentration is 9 mm or less in the p vba method the data presented in fig s1 show no new peaks except benzaldehyde from solutions in which vinylbenzenes other than o vba reacted with ozone the yield of benzaldehydes from vinylbenzenes other than o vba is considered 1 in addition fig s1 depicts a new peak different from o fba in the solution in which o vba and ozone reacted thus o fba formation competes with at least one other substance and is likely to be sensitive to reaction conditions temperature ph etc therefore in terms of benzaldehydes yield vinylbenzenes other than o vba are suitable reagents for ozone determination 3 3 false positive ozone in p vba and indigo methods the false positive ozone mol to hypochlorous acid hypobromous acid and hydrogen peroxide mol in the indigo method and hypochlorous acid and persulfuric acid mol in the p vba method are shown in fig 2 false positive ozone mol to hydrogen peroxide in the p vba method was below the lower limit of quantification and less than 10 4 mol in 4 h formation of p fba by hypobromous acid and potassium permanganate in p vba method were completed within minutes after the reaction when the p vba solution at ph 7 contained 50 mm phosphoric acid and 7 mm ammonium carbonate false positive ozone mol to hypobromous acid and potassium permanganate mol was 0 013 95 ci 0 006 0 014 and 0 017 95 ci 0 016 0 018 mol when the p vba solution at ph 7 only contained 50 mm phosphoric acid false positive ozone mol to hypobromous acid and potassium permanganate mol was 0 0007 95 ci 0 0005 0 0008 and 0 012 95 ci 0 011 0 013 mol the false positive ozone was higher in the presence of ammonium carbonate therefore the use of ammonium carbonate is undesirable when hypobromous acid or permanganate ions are present the false positive ozone mol to permanganate ion in the indigo method was 1 5 mol and decolorization of indigo was completed within minutes after the reaction in a previous study 1 mol of permanganate ion decolorized 1 8 mol indigo rakness et al 2010 which is different from the findings of our study this difference may be attributed to the quality and quantity of the impurities in the indigo reagent the stoichiometry of permanganate ions as well as other oxidants and indigo may vary depending on the source and date of acquisition of the indigo reagent however the fact that the p vba method is less likely to falsely detect ozone than the indigo for all oxidants is considered irrefutable the false positive ozone mol to persulfuric acid in the indigo method was below the lower limit of quantitation for persulfuric acid the indigo method had the fewer false positive than the p vba method however the amount of false positives in the p vba method is not large if analyzed immediately the method for measuring ozone concentration when persulfuric acid is coexisting should be determined by comprehensively considering the other advantages of the p vba method the mass scan range 30 300 m z of a solution of p vba reacting with the permanganate ion presented a main peak of 179 m z which is two oh added to the c c double bond of p vba the mass scan range 30 300 m z of a solution of p vba reacted with hypobromous acid and exhibited a main peak of 163 243 and 245 m z which is oh and br added to the c c double bond of p vba the chromatogram data are shown in fig s2 the product of reaction between p vba and hypochlorous acid was also not identified 3 4 molar absorption coefficients the molar absorption coefficients of p fba p vba m fba m vba and ta are shown in fig s3 and listed in table s6 ozone dissolved in ultrapure water reacted with the p vba solution at ph 7 and the absorbance of the solution after the reaction at wavelengths of 233 and 279 nm was measured by direct absorption spectrophotometry further the concentration of p fba m was calculated according to eqs 8 and 9 and the concentration of ozone was determined the ratio of the value measured by this method to that measured by direct absorption spectrophotometry was 99 95 ci 95 104 8 ε p fba 233 p fba ε p vba 233 p vba ab s 233 c 9 ε p fba 279 p fba ε p vba 279 p vba ab s 279 c where ε is the molar absorption coefficient m 1 cm 1 at wavelength of p vba or p fba abs is the absorbance measured in a 1 cm cell at a wavelength no unit and c is the optical path length cm the wavelength of 233 nm is the wavelength at which the ratio of the molar absorption coefficients of p fba to those of p vba are large and wavelength of 279 nm is the opposite cooled highly concentration ozone water adjusted with pure water or a phosphoric acid solution is often used in ozone treatment research the ozone concentration in such water can be measured easily with a spectrophotometer using this method the largest difference 1 39 104 m 1 cm 1 between the molar absorption coefficients of p fba and ta was observed at a wavelength of 262 nm in the non dissociated state the change in absorbance at 262 nm of the p fba solution stored in a dark room at 4 c was within a narrow range of 0 5767 0 5788 over 29 d fig s3 the absorbance measurements were conducted at a temperature of 25 c and ph of 1 if 1 p fba was changed to ta the absorbance decreased by 0 0048 in addition no change in the absorbance was observed at other wavelengths 205 315 nm suggesting that p fba did not change to terephthalic acid or other compounds within a month even when the p fba solution contained 8 mg l 1 of dissolved oxygen therefore p fba is an excellent quantitative reagent that is stable over a long period of time on the contrary p fba of about 5 µg l 1 was detected in the p vba solution about a week after adjustment therefore it is needed to measure the p fba concentration in the p vba solution each time and correct the amount of p fba produced particularly when measuring low ozone concentrations the maximum absorption wavelengths of p vba and m vba are very different when uv detectors are used for analyses it will be possible to improve the measurement sensitivity by proper use of p vba and m vba 3 5 comparison of ozone concentrations in environmental water samples measured by the p vba and indigo methods the molar absorption coefficient of indigo at 600 nm was determined to be 2 4 104 95 ci 2 24 2 55 104 m 1 cm 1 fig 3 shows the dissolved ozone concentration measured by the indigo and p vba methods in environmental water in the river water the measurements of the p vba method tended to fall below those of the indigo method over time in treated wastewater the measurements of the p vba and indigo methods were almost the same in seawater there was a significant difference between the measurements obtained using the p vba and indigo methods the reaction rate constant between bromide ions and ozone at 20 c has been reported haag and hoigne 1983 to be 160 m 1 s 1 thus even considering ozone consumption by only bromide ions the ozone concentration dropped to 1 4 μm after 30 seconds the first measurement point this condition was satisfied by the measurement obtained by the p vba method but not by the indigo method p fba above 1 µg l 1 was not detected in solutions of river water treated wastewater or seawater after ozonation if the ozonated water sample contains p fba the ozone concentration measurements should be corrected measurements of the p fba concentration produced when the p vba solution was mixed with environmental water containing ozone over an 18 h period showed no change in p fba concentration fig s4 thus p fba concentrations were shown to be stable in environmental water after ozone treatment therefore the p vba method is also appropriate for situations in which the analysis cannot be performed immediately the calibration curve for p fba had good linearity r2 0 998 1 x weighting in the range of 1 µg l 1 to 5 mg l 1 with each concentration analyzed eight times the details of the analytical conditions are shown table s7 half of the 95 ci divided by the mean was 5 9 for 1 020 µg l 1 2 9 for 5 262 µg l 1 0 75 for 51 71 µg l 1 0 43 for 509 6 µg l 1 and 0 61 for 4 974 mg l 1 these results were plotted on a graph with the p fba concentration on the horizontal axis and the errors on the vertical axis with a straight line connecting each plot δ c p vba is defined using these straight lines the linearity of the calibration curve was lost at about 5 µg l 1 when methanol was not added to the sample for determination of chlorobenzaldehyde and bromobenzaldehyde however the use of methanol is undesirable because it is cumbersome and costly as there is linearity in the calibration curve of p vba up to 1 020 µg l 1 in an aqueous solution the enhancement of water solubility by the carboxyl group plays an important role in improving the accuracy and convenience of the analysis p vba is a better reagent for ozone concentration determination than p chlorocinnamic acid or p bromocinnamic acid 3 6 comparison of measurement error between p vba and indigo methods the molar absorption coefficient of indigo determined in this study was 20 larger than what was considered common 20000 m 1 cm 1 confirming that the indigo method needed calibration in addition the relative error of the measurement was 7 which was larger than the setting value of 5 for comparison of measurement error this result demonstrates that the error by the indigo method is underestimated for the following comparison the comparison of the relative errors between the indigo and p vba methods is shown in fig 4 a the p vba method presented a smaller relative error than the indigo method for any mixing ratio for both the calculated and measured values when the measurement error of indigo s molar absorption coefficient is larger than 5 or when there is background noise at 600 nm wavelength the error of the indigo method is bigger in the indigo method when the absorbance and mixing ratio were not properly adjusted according to the ozone concentration the error was large hence reduction of error in the indigo method involves determination of the mixing ratio and absorbance of the indigo solution in the pre measurement which is complicated on the contrary p vba method is convenient because a small measurement error was achieved with one p vba solution for example 0 1 g l 1 and one mixing ratio for example 0 3 regardless of the ozone concentration to be measured in addition when measuring substances e g pollutants in a mixture of indigo or p vba solution and ozone containing environmental water by lc or ic the p vba method which can fix the reagent concentration and mixing ratio provides a more consistent baseline among different samples the error in volume measurement δ v ind δ v p vba and δ v mix in this study was very small and such a small error may not be achievable in more complex experiments or outdoor surveys the results of the relative error for the error in the volume 10 times larger δ v ind and δ v p vba 0 8 and δ v mix 1 µl are shown in fig 4 b the p vba method is always more accurate than the indigo method regarding the p vba method the tendency of the error to increase with increasing mixing ratio becomes more pronounced the relative error is almost the minimum below a mixing ratio of about 0 3 at any ozone concentration however a mixing ratio that is too low may result in p vba not being distributed throughout the mixture especially with insufficient agitation therefore it is recommended that the p vba method be performed with a mixing ratio of about 0 3 when the mixing ratio is fixed at 0 3 the change in relative error with respect to changes in dissolved ozone concentration is shown in fig s5 in the p vba method the measurements impacting the error in the measured ozone concentration at a mixing ratio below 0 75 consisted of purity of the p fba reagent or the concentration of p fba uncertainty of the purity is dominant when ozone concentration is high and uncertainty of the p fba concentration becomes dominant as ozone concentration decreases and under the study conditions the magnitude of q p vba p δ p and q p vba c p vba δ c p fba in eq 5 matched at 0 02 mg l 1 therefore when ozone concentrations are low multiple repetitions of the p fba concentration analysis are effective in reducing measurement errors in the indigo method the measurements mainly impacting the error are not volumetric measurements of mixtures of indigo solution and ozone water detailed figure of the error factors and their magnitude comparisons are shown in fig s6 assuming a relative error of 10 as the lower limit the lower limit of quantitation for ozone in this calculation was 4 µg l 1 for the indigo method using indigo solution with absorbance of 0 2 and 0 4 µg l 1 for the p vba method with the p vba method being smaller 4 conclusion the yield of p fba from the reaction of p vba and ozone was maintained at 1 even in the presence of coexisting substances in environmental water and the p vba method can be used for the determination of dissolved ozone concentration the p vba method is more selective than the indigo method and is more resistant to hypochlorous acid hypobromous acid permanganate and hydrogen peroxide to reduce the error the indigo method requires adjustment of the concentration of the indigo solution and the mixing ratio according to the ozone concentration on the contrary the p vba method can measure a wide range of ozone concentrations with one concentration of the p vba solution and mixing ratio with less error than the indigo method as a reagent for ozone concentration determination although fewer evaluations have been performed on m vba than on p vba in this study m vba is considered a possible substitute for p vba the most significant difference between p vba and m vba is the uv spectrum it will be possible to improve the measurement sensitivity by proper use of p vba and m vba when uv detectors are used for analyses o vba is inferior to p vba because the yield of o fba to ozone is not 1 p chlorocinnamic acid and p bromocinnamic acid are inferior to p vba because the calibration curves for p chlorobenzaldehyde and p bromobenzaldehyde produced in the reaction with ozone show poor linearity compared to the indigo method the p vba method is more selective more accurate and can be performed simultaneously with measurement of other analytes and does not require cumbersome calibration p vba can contribute widely to ozone treatment research and management author contributions kohei kawaguchi conceived the study analyzed the data and wrote the

15097,dissolved ozone concentration measurement is crucial for ozone treatment in the most used conventional indigo method the ozone concentration is measured by the decrease in absorbance due to the loss of the c c double bond of indigotrisulfonic acid however measurement of ozone concentration is difficult when water contains substances that react with c c double bonds other than ozone to address this concern we developed a novel breakthrough method to measure ozone concentration by measuring the p formylbenzoic acid p fba produced after the reaction of p vinylbenzoic acid and ozone the formation of p fba was almost not caused by other substances hypochlorous acid hypobromous acid permanganate ion and hydrogen peroxide and its yield to ozone was maintained at 1 in river water treated wastewater and seawater in addition the experimental error is smaller with the new method than with indigo furthermore the new method does not require cumbersome calibration unlike indigo method because highly pure forms of p fba are commercially available p fba can be separated by liquid chromatography and detected with highly sensitive ultraviolet and mass spectrometric detectors and hence easily analyzed simultaneously with other substances our new method contributes to extensive ozone treatment and ozonation management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

introduction ozone treatment is applied in various fields such as water and wastewater seawater food medical care sewage sludge and pulp bleaching holah et al 2016 loeb et al 2012 paul and liu 2012 tripathi et al 2020 in practice and research in these fields the measurement of dissolved ozone concentration is crucial in the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 which is currently used for measuring dissolved ozone concentration water containing ozone is mixed with an indigotrisulfonic acid indigo solution adjusted to ph 2 using phosphate buffer ozone reacts with the c c double bond in indigo in a 1 1 molar ratio the concentration of indigo before and after the reaction is measured using absorption spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 600 nm and the ozone concentration is calculated the indigo method has long supported ozone treatment but has five limitations firstly the reaction of substances other than ozone such as hypochlorous acid yoshizawa 2019 hypobromous acid penru et al 2013 and permanganate ion gregory and carlson 2001 hydrogen peroxide bader and hoigné 1981 with the c c double bond can result in an overestimation of ozone concentration considering that a large amount of hypobromous acid is produced during the ozonation of seawater there is currently no method to selectively detect ozone concentration buchan et al 2005 in seawater secondly the purity of commercially available indigo is less than 80 and contains many impurities it is reported that even with the same manufacturer the measured molar absorption coefficients of indigo are different on different dates of manufacture gordon and bubnis 2002 thus calibration of molar absorption coefficients is needed but it is cumbersome and beset with uncertainties because of the high volatility of dissolved ozone in addition some ozone treatment facilities do not have the capacity to perform this calibration thirdly the stoichiometry of ozone and indigo is dependent on ph if the ph of the solution is above 4 in any fraction during mixing the amino group in indigo reacts with ozone and a fixed stoichiometry is not maintained bader and hoigné 1981 fourth the concentration of the indigo reagent and mixing ratio of the indigo solution to ozone water should be optimized according to the ozone concentration bader and hoigné 1981 fifth is the effect of the absorbance of the sample measured at a wavelength of 600 nm as ozone is effective in removing color it is often applied to highly colored water therefore the dissolved ozone concentration is often measured with a high background absorbance at a wavelength of 600 nm it may be possible to remove ozone separately with a reducing agent that does not interfere with absorbance at a wavelength of 600 nm and subtract it as background noize however this operation is cumbersome and introduces additional measurement errors to summarize it is desirable to develop a novel measurement that overcomes these drawbacks to selectively accurately and conveniently measure dissolved ozone concentrations in various fields therefore we propose a new method to measure ozone concentration using the reaction of p vinylbenzoic acid p vba with ozone to produce p formylbenzoic acid p fba in equal amounts to the reacted ozone it is expected that oxidants other than ozone react with p vba to produce little or no p fba p vba fujifilm wako pure chemical corporation 2021 and p fba apollo scientific ltd 2021 are commercially available with guaranteed purities of 97 or higher and are suitable for quantification p vba has no sites that react quickly with ozone other than vinyl groups regardless of the ph p fba can be separated by liquid ion or gas santander et al 2013 chromatography and detected with high sensitivity by ultraviolet uv and mass spectrometry ms detectors p fba measurement carried out using column separation is not affected by coexisting substances and simultaneous analysis with other substances is possible it is common to measure the concentration not only of dissolved ozone but also of pollutants at any moment in ozone treatment experiments the p vba method differs significantly from the indigo method as stated above and its measurement error can also be significantly lower according to the globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals p vba and p fba are relatively safe reagents on the aspect that indigo method can be performed with a spectrophotometer it is superior to the p vba method however based on the price at the purchase for this paper fujifilm wako pure chemical corporation tokyo chemical industry co ltd p vba is 7 392 jpy per 5 g and indigo is 28 215 jpy per 5 g taking molar mass and reagent purity into account the price of p vba is 1 22nd that of indigo in the aspect of reagent cost p vba method is less expensive than indigo method even considering the purchase of p fba the structure of p vba was chosen as the c c double bond reacts quickly and stoichiometrically with ozone and a benzene ring is required for sensitive uv detection it may seem possible to use a reaction in which vinylbenzene reacts with ozone to form benzaldehyde however benzaldehyde is a known byproduct of ozone richardson et al 1999 and its structure needs to be specialized carboxy groups are easily ionized enabling analysis with ion chromatography ic and contributing to higher sensitivity in liquid chromatography lc ms analysis furthermore carboxy groups improve hydrophilicity reduce adsorption on experimental instruments and improve analytical precision therefore the carboxyl group is considered a strong candidate for the specificity of vinylbenzene to make this study more comprehensive vinylbenzenes other than p vba m vinylbenzoic acid m vba o vinylbenzoic acid o vba p chlorocinnamic acid and p bromocinnamic acid were examined for their suitability as reagents for ozone determination the effect of persulfuric acid on the indigo and p vba methods was also examined zhou et al 2019 although it is widely known that carbonyl is formed by the reaction of ozone with a c c double bond it has not been established as a quantitative method for ozone this study demonstrates the robustness and advantages of the p vba method by various experiments and analyses 2 methodology 2 1 environmental water samples as a representative of river water a sample from the katsura river in kyoto prefecture japan was used as a representative example of wastewater the secondary effluent from a sewage treatment plant in kyoto

hypobromous acid solution was adjusted by mixing the sodium bromide and hypochlorous acid solutions tokunaga et al 2007 ozone solution was prepared by blowing ozone gas into ice cold or room temperature 20 25 c ultrapure water or a 1 mm phosphate buffer solution ph 3 ozone gas from an ozone generator sga 01 pas2 sumitomo precision products co ltd japan was blown into water to remove nox and dehumidified the p vba solution was prepared by dissolving p vba in pure water or environmental water samples reacted with 50 µm ozone initial concentration for more than 1 h post which the ozone was removed by nitrogen aeration at this pre ozone treatment the environmental water samples were diluted 1 07 times the concentrations of all p vba solutions were 0 10 g l 1 2 3 chemical analysis absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer uv 1900i shimadzu corporation japan dissolved oxygen was measured using a dissolved oxygen meter multi 3510 ids xylem analytics germany sales gmbh co kg germany the dissolved ozone concentration was measured by direct absorption spectrophotometry von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 and the p vba method for direct absorption spectrophotometry a quartz cell with an optical path length of 1 cm was sealed immediately after syringe injection of ozone water three times the cell volume and measured at a wavelength of 260 nm molar absorptivity coefficient 3200 m 1 cm 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 by performing the direct absorption spectrophotometry and the indigo method or a reaction with vinylbenzenes almost simultaneously the molar absorption coefficient of indigo or the yield of benzaldehydes were determined based on the direct absorption spectrophotometry the ozone water at this time was adjusted to a ph of 3 using phosphoric acid at room temperature and the ozone in the syringe decreased at a rate of 0 07 per minute which can be regarded as no decrease in the syringe over the timescale of the experiment the volume of ozone water before and after addition to volume was determined by converting the difference in mass the density used in the conversion was 1 02 kg l 1 for seawater and 1 00 kg

measurements of precursor ions and all quantitation was performed using a uv detector detection wavelengths and examples of detailed analysis conditions are shown in tables s2 s4 s5 and s7 2 4 experimental method 2 4 1 reaction rate measurements the rate constants of the reactions of p vba and m vba with ozone were determined by competition kinetics von sonntag and von gunten 2012 with ca and the ph was adjusted to 7 1 with phosphate buffer or 1 0 with hydrochloric acid on the time scale phosphoric acid and hydrochloric acid did not react with p vba m vba and ca the reaction rate of ozone with p vba or m vba k o 3 vba m 1 s 1 was calculated using the reaction rate of ozone with ca k o 3 ca m 1 s 1 as shown in eq 1 1 k o 3 vba ln vba vba 0 ln ca ca 0 k o 3 c a where the subscript 0 and represent the concentration before and after the reaction and vba represents the concentration of p vba or m vba m the reaction rate constants of ozone with ca are 1 2 106 or 3 8 105 m 1 s 1 in the completely dissociated state and 1 105 or 5 104 m 1 s 1 in the completely non dissociated state leitzke et al 2001 lung 1996 in addition the pk a values of p vba and ca were measured by potentiometric titration reaction rate constants of p fba with ozone hypochlorous acid hypobromous acid and permanganate ion were measured details of the experimental method are described in supplementary materials 2 4 2 false positive ozone measurements in p vba and indigo methods hypochlorite hypobromite potassium permanganate hydrogen peroxide and persulfuric acid solutions were added to the stirred p vba solution and the amount of p fba formed after the reaction was measured these oxidants were also added to the indigo solution and the amount of absorbance loss at a wavelength of 600 nm was measured the molar ratio of each oxidant to p vba or indigo was 1 10 indigo solutions containing malonic acid have also been used as reports reveal that the use of malonic acid can mask false positives of ozone due to hypochlorous acid and hypobromous acid bader and hoigné 1981 2 4 3 absorbance measurements of benzaldehydes and vinylbenzenes molar absorption coefficients of p fba m fba and terephthalic acid ta were measured the terephthalic acid is thought to be produced when p fba is oxidized absorbance was measured in a cell with 1 mm optical path length in addition the p fba solution containing 8 mg l 1 dissolved oxygen was divided into glass tubes and stored in a dark room at 4 c and their absorbances were measured at several days interval 2 4 4 comparison of ozone concentrations in environmental water samples measured by the p vba and indigo methods changes in the dissolved ozone concentration in the environmental water were measured using the p vba and indigo methods ozone water was injected into the environmental water maintained at 20 c and initial ozone concentration of the mixture was 50 µm ozone water was made from pure water and cooled on ice and the environmental water samples were diluted 1 07 times by injection of ozone water the stability of the p fba generated during the application of the p vba method to environmental water was evaluated 2 4 5 measurement error comparison method the formulae for calculating the ozone concentration q ind or q p vba μ m using the indigo method eq 2 and the p vba method eq 3 is as follows for simplicity it does not consider errors due to the background noise at 600 nm wavelength for the indigo method 2 q ind a ind v ind a mix v mix ε v mix v ind 10 6 3 q p vba c p fba p v mix y v mix v p vba where a ind

the volumes of the indigo solution p vba solution and a mixture of ozone water and indigo solution or p vba solution ml respectively ε is the molar absorption coefficient m 1 cm 1 for this error comparison a common ε of 20000 m 1 cm 1 was set bridgewater et al 2012 the absorbance of the indigo solution was set bridgewater et al 2012 to 2 and 0 2 c p fba is the concentration of p fba μ m in the mixture of ozone water and p vba solution when the purity of the p fba reagent is 1 p is the purity of the p fba reagent and y is the yield of p fba to ozone in the reaction between ozone and p vba when each measurement error δ q ind or δ q p vba µm is assumed to be random and independent of each other the errors of the indigo and p vba methods are as shown in eqs 4 and 5 taylor 1996 δ

values were determined from the experimental results of this study the measurement error was determined for three mixing ratios used for both the indigo and p vba methods five analyses were performed for each mixing ratio the volume of the indigo and p vba solutions was set to 3 ml indigo solution with an absorbance of 2 05 and about 1 4 maximum 1 66 minimum 1 04 mg l 1 ozone water was used ozone concentration within each mixing ratio is the same experiments using ozone water at lower concentrations were not performed because ozone is unstable the errors of the indigo and p vba methods were

above in the evaluation by calculation the errors of the indigo and p vba methods were compared using three representative examples of ozone concentrations of 1 4 0 5 and 0 005 mg l 1 with 1 4 mg l 1 as the experimental setting 3 results and discussion 3 1 reaction rate of ozone with p vba and m vba the pk a values of p vba and ca were determined to be 4 2 and 4 9 at 19 21 c thus p vba and ca are regarded as completely dissociated at ph 7 1 and as completely non dissociated at ph 1 0 the reaction rate constant of ozone with p vba was 1 42 95 ci 1 41 1 44 times greater than that of ozone with ca at ph 7 1 the reaction rate constant of ozone with p vba was 8 2 95 ci 7 8 8 7 times greater at ph 1 0 therefore the reaction rate constant for ozone and p vba were 1 7 106 or 5 4 105 m 1 s 1 in completely dissociated state and 8 105 or 4 105 m 1 s 1 in completely non dissociated state leitzke et al 2001 lung 1996 in the subsequent discussion the reaction rate constant was set to an average value of 1 1 106 m 1 s 1 in the completely dissociated state in addition the following assumptions were made the mixing ratio volume ratio of p vba or indigo solution to ozone containing water and p vba or indigo solution of the p vba method is 0 3 refer to discussion below and the mixing is instantaneous the ozone concentration drops to 1 10 000th within 40 ms to the best of our knowledge the earliest concentration measurement after mixing ozone and sample water is after 115 ms in buffle et al buffle et al 2006 in this study the sample water was the secondary treatment wastewater and had a relatively high doc in the study the ozone concentration was approximately halved from 0 to 115 ms so the average first order reaction rate constant for ozone was 6 s 1 if the decrease of ozone in this period is expressed as a first order reaction since the rate of ozone disappearance decreases after the reaction the reaction rate was less than 6 s 1 at 115 ms sampling point if the mixing ratio is 0 3 the ozone disappearance rate in the p vba method is 740 s 1 thus the consumption of ozone by the sample derived material is less than 0 8 which is an acceptable value for most experiments therefore even though the reaction rate of p vba with ozone is slower than that of indigo 9 4 107 m 1 s 1 muñoz and von sonntag 2000 it is sufficiently fast the reaction rate constant of ozone with m vba was 1 3 95 ci 1 2 1 4 times greater than ozone with ca at ph 7 1 and was sufficiently fast the second order reaction rate constants of p fba with ozone hypochlorite ion hypobromite ion and permanganate were less than 7 0 2 0 2 and 0 7 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 therefore p fba is stable against these oxidants 3 2 yields of benzaldehydes to ozone the ratio of benzaldehyde produced to consumed ozone is shown in fig 1 the yield of p fba is 1 whether p vba is fully dissociated ph 7 or fully non dissociated ph 1 7 the yield of p fba was maintained at 1 even in the presence of coexisting substances in environmental water samples within experiments using p vba solution at ph 7 with phosphate buffer it has been confirmed that 1 mol of ozone reacts with 1 01 95 ci 0 99 1 03 mol of p vba in the stoichiometry the data presented in fig s1 show that the photodiode array detected peak which increased after the reaction was the only p fba peak observed therefore δy in eq 5 was set to 0 different researchers have reported different values 2900 3600 m 1 cm 1 at 258 260 nm for the molar absorption coefficient of ozone in direct spectroscopy bader 1982 hart et al 1983 kilpatrick et al 1956 taube 1957 conversely based on the assumption that 1 mol of ozone reacts with p vba to produce 1 mol of p fba this study supports the molar absorption coefficient of 3200 m 1 cm 1 used here unlike phosphoric acid ammonium carbonate is a volatile buffer solution suitable for lc ms analysis however ammonia reacted with ozone at a moderate rate garland et al 1980 hoigné and bader 1983 reaction rate constant 20 or 44 m 1 s 1 if the reaction rate between ammonia and ozone is 44 m 1 s 1 and with the use of 0 1 g l 1 p vba solution the maximum concentration of ammonium carbonate is 9 mm when the amount of ammonia that reacts with ozone is less than 1 1000th of the amount of p vba unlike the indigo method the p vba method is independent of ph the recommended ammonium carbonate concentration is 9 mm or less in the p vba method the data presented in fig s1 show no new peaks except benzaldehyde from solutions in which vinylbenzenes other than o vba reacted with ozone the yield of benzaldehydes from vinylbenzenes other than o vba is considered 1 in addition fig s1 depicts a new peak different from o fba in the solution in which o vba and ozone reacted thus o fba formation competes with at least one other substance and is likely to be sensitive to reaction conditions temperature ph etc therefore in terms of benzaldehydes yield vinylbenzenes other than o vba are suitable reagents for ozone determination 3 3 false positive ozone in p vba and indigo methods the false positive ozone mol to hypochlorous acid hypobromous acid and hydrogen peroxide mol in the indigo method and hypochlorous acid and persulfuric acid mol in the p vba method are shown in fig 2 false positive ozone mol to hydrogen peroxide in the p vba method was below the lower limit of quantification and less than 10 4 mol in 4 h formation of p fba by hypobromous acid and potassium permanganate in p vba method were completed within minutes after the reaction when the p vba solution at ph 7 contained 50 mm phosphoric acid and 7 mm ammonium carbonate false positive ozone mol to hypobromous acid and potassium permanganate mol was 0 013 95 ci 0 006 0 014 and 0 017 95 ci 0 016 0 018 mol when the p vba solution at ph 7 only contained 50 mm phosphoric acid false positive ozone mol to hypobromous acid and potassium permanganate mol was 0 0007 95 ci 0 0005 0 0008 and 0 012 95 ci 0 011 0 013 mol the false positive ozone was higher in the presence of ammonium carbonate therefore the use of ammonium carbonate is undesirable when hypobromous acid or permanganate ions are present the false positive ozone mol to permanganate ion in the indigo method was 1 5 mol and decolorization of indigo was completed within minutes after the reaction in a previous study 1 mol of permanganate ion decolorized 1 8 mol indigo rakness et al 2010 which is different from the findings of our study this difference may be attributed to the quality and quantity of the impurities in the indigo reagent the stoichiometry of permanganate ions as well as other oxidants and indigo may vary depending on the source and date of acquisition of the indigo reagent however the fact that the p vba method is less likely to falsely detect ozone than the indigo for all oxidants is considered irrefutable the false positive ozone mol to persulfuric acid in the indigo method was below the lower limit of quantitation for persulfuric acid the indigo method had the fewer false positive than the p vba method however the amount of false positives in the p vba method is not large if analyzed immediately the method for measuring ozone concentration when persulfuric acid is coexisting should be determined by comprehensively considering the other advantages of the p vba method the mass scan range 30 300 m z of a solution of p vba reacting with the permanganate ion presented a main peak of 179 m z which is two oh added to the c c double bond of p vba the mass scan range 30 300 m z of a solution of p vba reacted with hypobromous acid and exhibited a main peak of 163 243 and 245 m z which is oh and br added to the c c double bond of p vba the chromatogram data are shown in fig s2 the product of reaction between p vba and hypochlorous acid was also not identified 3 4 molar absorption coefficients the molar absorption coefficients of p fba p vba m fba m vba and ta are shown in fig s3 and listed in table s6 ozone dissolved in ultrapure water reacted with the p vba solution at ph 7 and the absorbance of the solution after the reaction at wavelengths of 233 and 279 nm was measured by direct absorption spectrophotometry further the concentration of p fba m was calculated according to eqs 8 and 9 and the concentration of ozone was determined the ratio of the value measured by this method to that measured by direct absorption spectrophotometry was 99 95 ci 95 104 8 ε p fba 233 p fba ε p vba 233 p vba ab s 233 c 9 ε p fba 279 p fba ε p vba 279 p vba ab s 279 c where ε is the molar absorption coefficient m 1 cm 1 at wavelength of p vba or p fba abs is the absorbance measured in a 1 cm cell at a wavelength no unit and c is the optical path length cm the wavelength of 233 nm is the wavelength at which the ratio of the molar absorption coefficients of p fba to those of p vba are large and wavelength of 279 nm is the opposite cooled highly concentration ozone water adjusted with pure water or a phosphoric acid solution is often used in ozone treatment research the ozone concentration in such water can be measured easily with a spectrophotometer using this method the largest difference 1 39 104 m 1 cm 1 between the molar absorption coefficients of p fba and ta was observed at a wavelength of 262 nm in the non dissociated state the change in absorbance at 262 nm of the p fba solution stored in a dark room at 4 c was within a narrow range of 0 5767 0 5788 over 29 d fig s3 the absorbance measurements were conducted at a temperature of 25 c and ph of 1 if 1 p fba was changed to ta the absorbance decreased by 0 0048 in addition no change in the absorbance was observed at other wavelengths 205 315 nm suggesting that p fba did not change to terephthalic acid or other compounds within a month even when the p fba solution contained 8 mg l 1 of dissolved oxygen therefore p fba is an excellent quantitative reagent that is stable over a long period of time on the contrary p fba of about 5 µg l 1 was detected in the p vba solution about a week after adjustment therefore it is needed to measure the p fba concentration in the p vba solution each time and correct the amount of p fba produced particularly when measuring low ozone concentrations the maximum absorption wavelengths of p vba and m vba are very different when uv detectors are used for analyses it will be possible to improve the measurement sensitivity by proper use of p vba and m vba 3 5 comparison of ozone concentrations in environmental water samples measured by the p vba and indigo methods the molar absorption coefficient of indigo at 600 nm was determined to be 2 4 104 95 ci 2 24 2 55 104 m 1 cm 1 fig 3 shows the dissolved ozone concentration measured by the indigo and p vba methods in environmental water in the river water the measurements of the p vba method tended to fall below those of the indigo method over time in treated wastewater the measurements of the p vba and indigo methods were almost the same in seawater there was a significant difference between the measurements obtained using the p vba and indigo methods the reaction rate constant between bromide ions and ozone at 20 c has been reported haag and hoigne 1983 to be 160 m 1 s 1 thus even considering ozone consumption by only bromide ions the ozone concentration dropped to 1 4 μm after 30 seconds the first measurement point this condition was satisfied by the measurement obtained by the p vba method but not by the indigo method p fba above 1 µg l 1 was not detected in solutions of river water treated wastewater or seawater after ozonation if the ozonated water sample contains p fba the ozone concentration measurements should be corrected measurements of the p fba concentration produced when the p vba solution was mixed with environmental water containing ozone over an 18 h period showed no change in p fba concentration fig s4 thus p fba concentrations were shown to be stable in environmental water after ozone treatment therefore the p vba method is also appropriate for situations in which the analysis cannot be performed immediately the calibration curve for p fba had good linearity r2 0 998 1 x weighting in the range of 1 µg l 1 to 5 mg l 1 with each concentration analyzed eight times the details of the analytical conditions are shown table s7 half of the 95 ci divided by the mean was 5 9 for 1 020 µg l 1 2 9 for 5 262 µg l 1 0 75 for 51 71 µg l 1 0 43 for 509 6 µg l 1 and 0 61 for 4 974 mg l 1 these results were plotted on a graph with the p fba concentration on the horizontal axis and the errors on the vertical axis with a straight line connecting each plot δ c p vba is defined using these straight lines the linearity of the calibration curve was lost at about 5 µg l 1 when methanol was not added to the sample for determination of chlorobenzaldehyde and bromobenzaldehyde however the use of methanol is undesirable because it is cumbersome and costly as there is linearity in the calibration curve of p vba up to 1 020 µg l 1 in an aqueous solution the enhancement of water solubility by the carboxyl group plays an important role in improving the accuracy and convenience of the analysis p vba is a better reagent for ozone concentration determination than p chlorocinnamic acid or p bromocinnamic acid 3 6 comparison of measurement error between p vba and indigo methods the molar absorption coefficient of indigo determined in this study was 20 larger than what was considered common 20000 m 1 cm 1 confirming that the indigo method needed calibration in addition the relative error of the measurement was 7 which was larger than the setting value of 5 for comparison of measurement error this result demonstrates that the error by the indigo method is underestimated for the following comparison the comparison of the relative errors between the indigo and p vba methods is shown in fig 4 a the p vba method presented a smaller relative error than the indigo method for any mixing ratio for both the calculated and measured values when the measurement error of indigo s molar absorption coefficient is larger than 5 or when there is background noise at 600 nm wavelength the error of the indigo method is bigger in the indigo method when the absorbance and mixing ratio were not properly adjusted according to the ozone concentration the error was large hence reduction of error in the indigo method involves determination of the mixing ratio and absorbance of the indigo solution in the pre measurement which is complicated on the contrary p vba method is convenient because a small measurement error was achieved with one p vba solution for example 0 1 g l 1 and one mixing ratio for example 0 3 regardless of the ozone concentration to be measured in addition when measuring substances e g pollutants in a mixture of indigo or p vba solution and ozone containing environmental water by lc or ic the p vba method which can fix the reagent concentration and mixing ratio provides a more consistent baseline among different samples the error in volume measurement δ v ind δ v p vba and δ v mix in this study was very small and such a small error may not be achievable in more complex experiments or outdoor surveys the results of the relative error for the error in the volume 10 times larger δ v ind and δ v p vba 0 8 and δ v mix 1 µl are shown in fig 4 b the p vba method is always more accurate than the indigo method regarding the p vba method the tendency of the error to increase with increasing mixing ratio becomes more pronounced the relative error is almost the minimum below a mixing ratio of about 0 3 at any ozone concentration however a mixing ratio that is too low may result in p vba not being distributed throughout the mixture especially with insufficient agitation therefore it is recommended that the p vba method be performed with a mixing ratio of about 0 3 when the mixing ratio is fixed at 0 3 the change in relative error with respect to changes in dissolved ozone concentration is shown in fig s5 in the p vba method the measurements impacting the error in the measured ozone concentration at a mixing ratio below 0 75 consisted of purity of the p fba reagent or the concentration of p fba uncertainty of the purity is dominant when ozone concentration is high and uncertainty of the p fba concentration becomes dominant as ozone concentration decreases and under the study conditions the magnitude of q p vba p δ p and q p vba c p vba δ c p fba in eq 5 matched at 0 02 mg l 1 therefore when ozone concentrations are low multiple repetitions of the p fba concentration analysis are effective in reducing measurement errors in the indigo method the measurements mainly impacting the error are not volumetric measurements of mixtures of indigo solution and ozone water detailed figure of the error factors and their magnitude comparisons are shown in fig s6 assuming a relative error of 10 as the lower limit the lower limit of quantitation for ozone in this calculation was 4 µg l 1 for the indigo method using indigo solution with absorbance of 0 2 and 0 4 µg l 1 for the p vba method with the p vba method being smaller 4 conclusion the yield of p fba from the reaction of p vba and ozone was maintained at 1 even in the presence of coexisting substances in environmental water and the p vba method can be used for the determination of dissolved ozone concentration the p vba method is more selective than the indigo method and is more resistant to hypochlorous acid hypobromous acid permanganate and hydrogen peroxide to reduce the error the indigo method requires adjustment of the concentration of the indigo solution and the mixing ratio according to the ozone concentration on the contrary the p vba method can measure a wide range of ozone concentrations with one concentration of the p vba solution and mixing ratio with less error than the indigo method as a reagent for ozone concentration determination although fewer evaluations have been performed on m vba than on p vba in this study m vba is considered a possible substitute for p vba the most significant difference between p vba and m vba is the uv spectrum it will be possible to improve the measurement sensitivity by proper use of p vba and m vba when uv detectors are used for analyses o vba is inferior to p vba because the yield of o fba to ozone is not 1 p chlorocinnamic acid and p bromocinnamic acid are inferior to p vba because the calibration curves for p chlorobenzaldehyde and p bromobenzaldehyde produced in the reaction with ozone show poor linearity compared to the indigo method the p vba method is more selective more accurate and can be performed simultaneously with measurement of other analytes and does not require cumbersome calibration p vba can contribute widely to ozone treatment research and management author contributions kohei kawaguchi conceived the study analyzed the data and wrote the

15098,bioleaching facilitated by iron oxidizing bacteria is regarded as a promising sludge dewatering method due to excellent dewaterability and low cost however a two days bioleaching time for sludge conditioning decreased its daily treatment capacity in fact fe2 easily reacts with o2 to produce reactive oxygen species ros with high oxidizing activity can bioleaching performed in fe2 rich system generate ros to decompose sludge extracellular polymeric substances eps here both contribution of ros produced in bioleaching to improve sludge dewaterability and the increase of ros content to shorten sludge bioleaching treatment time were investigated the introduction of h2o2 in sludge bioleaching treatment bs h2o2 to increase ros could simultaneously improve sludge dewaterability and decrease bioleaching time specific resistance to filtration srf and capillary suction time cst reduction ratios 90 3 and 80 9 in bs h2o2 process were much higher than those in other processes after only 30 min reaction mechanisms of improving sludge dewaterability in bs h2o2 mainly included ros oxidation and fe3 flocculation by analysis of the contribution factors these findings not only provide an effectively method to promote sludge dewatering efficiency of bioleaching but also give new sights into the design of cost efficient processes for improving the sludge dewatering graphical abstract

introduction sewage sludge as a byproduct of wastewater treatment plants has a high moisture content 95 99 and complex pollutants e g heavy metals organic pollutants pathogens and typical viruses wei et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 sludge dewatering is essential for decreasing its volume transportation cost and safe disposal however sludge deep dewatering to below 60 of moisture content is difficult due to strong affinity between water and extracellular polymeric substances eps chen et al 2022 many methods e g chemical physical biological have been used to improve sludge dewaterability cao et al 2021 liang and zhou 2022 wu et al 2020 among these methods bioleaching was a microbial technique previously for leaching metals from sludge by redox reaction and acidification by acidophilic sulfur and iron oxidizing bacteria zhou 2012 and then it was unexpectedly found to be a very promising approach for improving sludge dewaterability capable of environmentally friendly and low cost huo et al 2014 li et al 2022 liu et al 2016 in fact since 2010 sludge deep dewatering through bioleaching conditioning followed by diaphragm press filter have been widely applied on a commercial scale in china zhou 2012 fe2 in sludge bioleaching system as energy substance could be bio oxidized by acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans a ferrooxidans to produce fe3 and low ph huo et al 2014 liu et al 2016 which obviously enhanced the dewaterability of sludge by fe3 flocculation acidification and sludge eps reduction liu et al 2016 zhou 2012 the replacement of heterotrophic microorganism in sludge fully by chemoautophic a ferrooxidans during bioleaching to consequently decrease slime eps in bioleached sludge were considered as a main factor to improve dehydration performance huo et al 2014 liu et al 2016 zhou 2012 however a two day s bioleaching time is too long to enhance daily sludge treatment capability fontmorin and sillanpää 2015 huang et al 2020 notably fe2 rich bioleaching system under aerobic condition is easy to produce reactive oxygen species ros such as h2o2 o2 oh and feiv o2 simplified as fe iv by a series of reactions fe2 o2 fe3 o2 fe2 o2 2h fe3 h2o2 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh h2o2 fe2 feiv o2 h2o dong et al 2021 li et al 2021 yang et al 2022 these strongly oxidized ros can efficiently degrade sludge eps for releasing bound water however the contribution of ros produced in sludge bioleaching to improve the dewaterability of sludge has not been clarified it is expected that increasing ros content may be an effective method for shortening reaction time of bioleaching recently fe2 activating oxidants e g h2o2 persulfate and hypochlorite has been widely used to enhance sludge dewaterability owing to production of reactive radicals e g oh so4 and o2 with high oxidation ability ge et al 2021 considering the presence of fe2 added in bioleaching system we speculate that appropriate introduction of oxidants may increase ros content to further improve the sludge dewatering efficiency by bioleaching therefore the main purposes of this work were to 1 explore whether self production ros occurred and its contribution to improve sludge dewaterability by bioleaching 2 select suitable oxidant to increase ros concentration for promoting sludge dewatering efficiency by bioleaching 3 analyze the key factors to enhance dewatering efficiency and 4 clarify the mechanism of increasing ros concentration for promoting dewatering efficiency of bioleaching 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials sewage sludge was obtained from chengdong municipal waste water treatment plant nanjing china the wastewater treatment plant mainly adopted a2 o activated sludge process sewage sludge from concentrated tanks was taken for sludge dewatering experiment

eps extraction and analysis and quantification of ros e g oh o2 fe iv were shown in text s3 and text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 ros generation and main factors to improve sludge dewaterability by bioleaching the involved ros in bs process were studied by epr spectra and quantitative detection the dmpo o2 and dmpo oh signals 1 1 1 1 and 1 2 2 1 characteristic peaks obviously appeared in the bs process fig 1a and b indicating that bs could effectively generate reactive radicals such as o2 and oh compared with rs fe2 system the existence of a ferrooxidans in bs was conducive to maintain an acid environment for radicals generation in fig s4 ph value of bs significantly decreased from 7 4 to 3 6 due to a ferrooxidans induced fe2 oxidation followed by fe3 hydrolysis fe3 h2o fe oh 3 h to further clarify ros production h2o2 o2 oh and fe iv were quantitatively analyzed fig s5 the concentration of h2o2 1 4 mg l o2 6 9 mg l oh 3 1 mg l and fe iv 1 3 mg l in bs process was too low to play a significant role in improving sludge dewaterability as exhibiting that when tert butanol tba was added into bs process to eliminate oh of strongest oxidation capacity no inhibition on sludge srf was observed fig 1c by calculating the srf reduction percentage in different treatments text s5 the contribution of a ferrooxidans lx5 84 1 to reduce sludge srf was much higher than fe2 19 0 and oh 2 6 fig 1d when fe2 was completely oxidized by a ferrooxidans lx5 to fe3 the contribution to sludge srf reduction could be up to 100 thus the generation of fe3 flocculants was to a great extent responsible for a high contribution of a ferrooxidans lx5 to reduce sludge srf which is consistent with previous studies huo et al 2014 liu et al 2016 zhou 2012 however fe2 oxidation reaction was relatively slow because of a slow growth process of a ferrooxidans lx5 resulting in a relative long bioleaching periods 2 d in practical engineering application huang et al 2020 li et al 2022 zhou 2012 therefore we thought that increasing ros concentration in reaction system probably rapidly decomposed eps to promote sludge dewaterability and shorten bioleaching time 3 2 increasing ros of bs system to improve sludge dewatering efficiency according to the effects of different oxidants and dosages on bioleached sludge dewatering performance in preliminary experiment fig s1 and fig s2 low concentration of h2o2 0 554 g l was selected for enhancing bs dewaterability meanwhile the activity of a ferrooxidans lx5 in the bs h2o2 treatment was investigated in the light of toc and a ferrooxidans lx5 density changes fig s6 the introduction of 0 554 g l h2o2 in bs process had no obvious influence on the activity of a ferrooxidans lx5 although h2o2 was regards as an antimicrobial agent on the one hand little effect on the activity of a ferrooxidans lx5 in bs h2o2 process was due to relatively low content of h2o2 on the other hand although h2o2 in bs process could react with fe2 to produce oh sludge eps in bs process competed with a ferrooxidans lx5 for oh which reduced negative impact of added h2o2 on the activity of a ferrooxidans lx5 thus it could be considered and used to enhance the yield of ros during bs fig 2a exhibited sludge dewatering performance after different treatments the treatment of bs h2o2 showed the best sludge dewaterability as exhibiting a remarkable decrease in srf from 1 9 1013 to 1 8 1012 m kg and cst from 115 to 22 s after 30 min reaction srf and cst of sludge after the bs h2o2 conditioning were reduced by 90 3 and 80 9 respectively with compared to those of rs the ph value during bs h2o2 process decreased gradually with the increase of reaction time fig s7 which would cause the breakage of sludge flocs and the release of trapped water moreover the lowest sludge cake moisture content 72 7 and bound water 1 52 g g ds were achieved after the bs h2o2 treatment fig 2b indicating that the bound water release facilitated the improvement of sludge dewaterablity furthermore the comparison of 1 uc versus consolidation time plots were used to analyze the respective primary the elasticity of the filter cake and secondary creep within the filter cake consolidation phases in the sludge dewatering process lu et al 2019 the elasticity and settleability of sludge were obviously improved after bs h2o2 treatment fig 2c and d which was easier to be squeezed and aggregated together although the rs fenton treatment also exhibited relatively low srf cst and bound water because of the destruction of sludge eps by radicals e g oh o2 wu et al 2020 fe2 h2o2 dosages applied in the rs fenton treatment was 1 4 times higher than that in the bs h2o2 treatment the introduction of h2o2 in bs process not only increased ros content to efficiently decompose eps for releasing interstitial water or bound water but also accelerated fe3 production to improve flocculation ability the orp value of sludge in the bs h2o2 treatment was higher than that in bs fig s8 owning to a stronger oxidation reaction further proving that h2o2 in bs enhanced fe2 oxidation and ros generation 3 3 variations of sludge properties the surface morphology of sludge in rs a ferrooxidans lx5 rs bs h2o2 and rs fenton treatments was further analyzed rs exhibited a smooth and complete structure because of high water holding capacity fig 3a the morphology of a ferrooxidans lx5 treated sludge showed a slight change fig 3b indicating that bio substitution which the heterotrophic microorganism with high eps in sludge was replaced by chemoautophic a ferrooxidans lx5 with low eps during bioleaching for reducing sludge eps was difficult in a short time 30 min however the morphology of sludge by prolonged bio substitution reaction 1

protein and polysaccharide as the major hydrophilic polymeric substances in sludge eps li et al 2019 qian et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 therefore eps components after bs h2o2 treatment might be significantly decomposed to cause a strong hydrophobicity and high dewaterability of sludge the effects of distribution and spatial structure of sludge eps on sludge dewaterability were further

consisted of five regions chen et al 2003 aromatic like proteins region i tryptophan region ii fulvic acid like materials region iii soluble microbial products like substances region iv and humic substances region v obviously after bs h2o2 and rs fenton treatments fluorescence intensity of s eps was much lower than other treatments suggesting that most soluble eps fractions were greatly degraded by reactive radicals meanwhile fluorescent intensities of lb eps and tb eps in bs h2o2 greatly decreased which was due to the release of carbonyl hydroxyl amino and carboxyl groups in the

easily destroyed by ros oxidation and a ferrooxidans lx5 induced acidification to increase the transformation of tb eps into the outer layer these results exhibited that bs h2o2 treatment not only could degrade s eps but also effectively destroyed lb eps and tb eps 3 4 dominant factor of improved sludge dewatering efficiency during bs h2o2 process consumption of h2o2 in bs h2o2 process was up to 98 while ros content 291 7 mg l was 20 7 times higher than bs process fig 7a as mentioned above the decrease of high molecular weight biopolymers e g proteins in eps were dependent on oxidation disintegration of ros compared with srf of raw sludge reduced percentage of srf in the bs h2o2 treatment reached 90 3 fig 7b when tba oh scavenger and benzoquinone bq o2 scavenger were added into the bs h2o2 reaction srf reduction percentage decreased from 90 3 to 76 3 and 82 8 respectively indicating that oh and o2 played a role in enhancing the sludge dewaterability a ferrooxidans lx5 itself was capable of reducing srf of sludge as exhibiting that srf could be decreased by 64 5 in the a f rs treatment by calculating the srf reduction percentage in different treatments text s5 the contribution of involved factors to sludge srf reduction followed such an order of a ferrooxidans lx5 64 5 ros 35 5 oh 15 5 fe iv 11 7 o2 8 3 fig 7c a high contribution of a ferrooxidans to promote the sludge dewaterability was mainly due to the production of fe3 flocculants by a ferrooxidans induced fe2 oxidation although the contribution of the bio substitution namely the replacement of heterotrophic microorganism in waste activated sludge fully by chemoautophic a ferrooxidans couldn t be excluded fe3 could effectively flocculate the dissociated sludge particles and eps through compressing double electric layers and charge neutralization which facilitated the increase of flowability and hydrophobicity of sludge liang and zhou 2022 undoubtedly fe3 75 6 mg l could be rapidly produced in bs h2o2 by fe2 oxidation meanwhile a ferrooxidans lx5 51 9 and h2o2 68 2 had significant contribution to fe3 production fig 7d 3 5 mechanism of enhanced sludge dewatering efficiency by bs h2o2 treatment on the basis of the contribution of the related factors the mechanisms of sludge dewatering by the bs h2o2 treatment were mainly divided into two aspects besides h generation and bio substitution reported in previous studies fig 8 ros oxidation and fe3 flocculation in the oxidation reaction ros such as oh fe iv o2 could be generated via a series of oxidation reactions in bs h2o2 process which effectively destroyed the sludge eps and microbial cell structure to enhance sludge dewaterability the hydrophilic substances and the sticky biopolymers e g high molecular weight proteins and polysaccharides in the eps could be remarkably decomposed by ros resulting in the bond water release moreover the a ferrooxidans lx5 in bs h2o2 could maintain an acid environment which was favorable for the generation of ros in the flocculation reaction fe3 as excellent flocculants could effectively flocculate the disrupted sludge particles and decomposed eps by decreasing water affinity surface areas and electronegativity to improve the sludge hydrophobicity ai et al 2021 li et al 2020b wang et al 2019 a ferrooxidans lx5 and h2o2 accelerated fe3 production to enhance the sludge flocculation reaction which could enhance the sludge dewaterability overall ros and fe3 in the bs h2o2 treatment have a significant synergistic effect on the sludge dewaterability by eps decomposition and re flocculation dissociated sludge particles as a result the release of the intracellular water hydrophobicity and settleability of sludge were enhanced while the gel like structure hydrophilia and apparent viscosity of sludge were weakened after bs h2o2 treatment the bs h2o2 process was relatively suitable for engineering application by comparing the cost and effect of sludge treatment dosages of chemical reagents in the bs h2o2 process were 30 less than that of the rs fenton treatment table s1 meanwhile the treated time for bs h2o2 process also was much shorter than bs process therefore bs h2o2 process was a promising modified bioleaching approach for the sludge treatment on the other hand in bs h2o2 process acidity will be produced due to the fe3 hydrolysis which probably leads to the acidification of soil if dewatered sludge is applied to farmland thus the amount of fe2 introduced in the bs h2o2 treatment and the applied dosage of bioleached sludge on farmland should be carefully considered for the subsequent safe disposal and utilization 4 conclusions the introduction of h2o2 during bs process to increase ros content bs h2o2 simultaneously improved sludge dewaterability and reduced the treatment time of bs compared with the bs bs h2o2 contained oxidative degradation and flocculation reaction which can decompose sludge eps to release the bound water and flocculate the disrupted sludge particles to improve the hydrophobicity lots of ros such as oh fe iv and o2 could efficiently destroy the sludge eps in a short period to enhance sludge dewatering rate meanwhile a ferrooxidans lx5 and h2o2 rapidly oxidized fe2 to produce fe3 with strong flocculation ability for improving the sludge hydrophobicity as result a higher sludge dewatering efficiency 90 3 srf and 80 9 cst reduction at reaction 30 min appeared in bs h2o2 process compared with the traditional fenton the bs h2o2 only needed a little of chemical reagents less than 30 therefore these findings provide a novel way for solving bottleneck problem of sludge bioleaching process through increasing ros content for enhancing sludge dewatering efficiency which will inspire more ideas on the design of cost

15098,bioleaching facilitated by iron oxidizing bacteria is regarded as a promising sludge dewatering method due to excellent dewaterability and low cost however a two days bioleaching time for sludge conditioning decreased its daily treatment capacity in fact fe2 easily reacts with o2 to produce reactive oxygen species ros with high oxidizing activity can bioleaching performed in fe2 rich system generate ros to decompose sludge extracellular polymeric substances eps here both contribution of ros produced in bioleaching to improve sludge dewaterability and the increase of ros content to shorten sludge bioleaching treatment time were investigated the introduction of h2o2 in sludge bioleaching treatment bs h2o2 to increase ros could simultaneously improve sludge dewaterability and decrease bioleaching time specific resistance to filtration srf and capillary suction time cst reduction ratios 90 3 and 80 9 in bs h2o2 process were much higher than those in other processes after only 30 min reaction mechanisms of improving sludge dewaterability in bs h2o2 mainly included ros oxidation and fe3 flocculation by analysis of the contribution factors these findings not only provide an effectively method to promote sludge dewatering efficiency of bioleaching but also give new sights into the design of cost efficient processes for improving the sludge dewatering graphical abstract

introduction sewage sludge as a byproduct of wastewater treatment plants has a high moisture content 95 99 and complex pollutants e g heavy metals organic pollutants pathogens and typical viruses wei et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 sludge dewatering is essential for decreasing its volume transportation cost and safe disposal however sludge deep dewatering to below 60 of moisture content is difficult due to strong affinity between water and extracellular polymeric substances eps chen et al 2022 many methods e g chemical physical biological have been used to improve sludge dewaterability cao et al 2021 liang and zhou 2022 wu et al 2020 among these methods bioleaching was a microbial technique previously for leaching metals from sludge by redox reaction and acidification by acidophilic sulfur and iron oxidizing bacteria zhou 2012 and then it was unexpectedly found to be a very promising approach for improving sludge dewaterability capable of environmentally friendly and low cost huo et al 2014 li et al 2022 liu et al 2016 in fact since 2010 sludge deep dewatering through bioleaching conditioning followed by diaphragm press filter have been widely applied on a commercial scale in china zhou 2012 fe2 in sludge bioleaching system as energy substance could be bio oxidized by acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans a ferrooxidans to produce fe3 and low ph huo et al 2014 liu et al 2016 which obviously enhanced the dewaterability of sludge by fe3 flocculation acidification and sludge eps reduction liu et al 2016 zhou 2012 the replacement of heterotrophic microorganism in sludge fully by chemoautophic a ferrooxidans during bioleaching to consequently decrease slime eps in bioleached sludge were considered as a main factor to improve dehydration performance huo et al 2014 liu et al 2016 zhou 2012 however a two day s bioleaching time is too long to enhance daily sludge treatment capability fontmorin and sillanpää 2015 huang et al 2020 notably fe2 rich bioleaching system under

fe2 feiv o2 h2o dong et al 2021 li et al 2021 yang et al 2022 these strongly oxidized ros can efficiently degrade sludge eps for releasing bound water however the contribution of ros produced in sludge bioleaching to improve the dewaterability of sludge has not been clarified it is expected that increasing ros content may be an effective method for shortening reaction time of bioleaching recently fe2 activating oxidants e g h2o2 persulfate and hypochlorite has been widely used to enhance sludge dewaterability owing to production of reactive radicals e g oh so4 and o2 with high oxidation ability ge et al 2021 considering the presence of fe2 added in bioleaching system we speculate that appropriate introduction of oxidants may increase ros content to further improve the sludge dewatering efficiency by bioleaching therefore the main purposes of this work were to 1 explore whether self production ros occurred and its contribution to improve sludge dewaterability by bioleaching 2 select suitable oxidant to increase ros concentration for promoting sludge dewatering efficiency by bioleaching 3 analyze the key factors to enhance dewatering efficiency and 4 clarify the mechanism of increasing ros concentration for promoting dewatering efficiency of bioleaching 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials sewage sludge was obtained from chengdong municipal

eps extraction and analysis and quantification of ros e g oh o2 fe iv were shown in text s3 and text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 ros generation and main factors to improve sludge dewaterability by bioleaching the involved ros in bs process were studied by epr spectra and quantitative detection the dmpo o2 and dmpo oh signals 1 1 1 1 and 1 2 2 1 characteristic peaks obviously appeared in the bs process fig 1a and b indicating that bs could effectively generate reactive radicals such as o2 and oh compared with rs fe2 system the existence of a ferrooxidans in bs was conducive to maintain an acid environment for radicals generation in fig s4 ph value of bs significantly decreased from 7 4 to 3 6 due to a ferrooxidans induced fe2 oxidation followed by fe3 hydrolysis fe3 h2o fe oh 3 h to further clarify ros production h2o2 o2 oh and fe iv were quantitatively analyzed fig s5 the concentration of h2o2 1 4 mg l o2 6 9 mg l oh 3 1 mg l and fe iv 1 3 mg l in bs process was too low to play a significant role in improving sludge dewaterability as exhibiting that when tert butanol tba was added into bs process to eliminate oh of strongest oxidation capacity no inhibition on sludge srf was observed fig 1c by calculating the srf reduction percentage in different treatments text s5 the contribution of a ferrooxidans lx5 84 1 to reduce sludge srf was much higher than fe2 19 0 and oh 2 6 fig 1d when fe2 was completely oxidized by a ferrooxidans lx5 to fe3 the contribution to sludge srf reduction could be up to 100 thus the generation of fe3 flocculants was to a great extent responsible for a high contribution of a ferrooxidans lx5 to reduce sludge srf which is consistent with previous studies huo et al 2014 liu et al 2016 zhou 2012 however fe2 oxidation reaction was relatively slow because of a slow growth process of a ferrooxidans lx5 resulting in a relative long bioleaching periods 2 d in practical engineering application huang et al 2020 li et al 2022 zhou 2012 therefore we thought that increasing ros concentration in reaction system probably rapidly decomposed eps to promote sludge dewaterability and shorten bioleaching time 3 2 increasing ros of bs system to improve sludge dewatering efficiency according to the effects of different oxidants and dosages on bioleached sludge dewatering performance in preliminary experiment fig s1 and fig s2 low concentration of h2o2 0 554 g l was selected for enhancing bs dewaterability meanwhile the activity of a ferrooxidans lx5 in the bs h2o2 treatment was investigated in the light of toc and a ferrooxidans lx5 density changes fig s6 the introduction of 0 554 g l h2o2 in bs process had no obvious influence on the activity of a ferrooxidans lx5 although h2o2 was regards as an antimicrobial agent on the one hand little effect on the activity of a ferrooxidans lx5 in bs h2o2 process was due to relatively low content of h2o2 on the other hand although h2o2 in bs process could react with fe2 to produce oh sludge eps in bs process competed with a ferrooxidans lx5 for oh which reduced negative impact of added h2o2 on the activity of a ferrooxidans lx5 thus it could be considered and used to enhance the yield of ros during bs fig 2a exhibited sludge dewatering performance after different treatments the treatment of bs h2o2 showed the best sludge dewaterability as exhibiting a remarkable decrease in srf from 1 9 1013 to 1 8 1012 m kg and cst from 115 to 22 s after 30 min reaction srf and cst of sludge after the bs h2o2 conditioning were reduced by 90 3 and 80 9 respectively with compared to those of rs the ph value during bs h2o2 process decreased gradually with the increase of reaction time fig s7 which would cause the breakage of sludge flocs and the release of trapped water moreover the lowest sludge cake moisture content 72 7 and bound water 1 52 g g ds were achieved after the bs h2o2 treatment fig 2b indicating that the bound water release facilitated the improvement of sludge dewaterablity furthermore the comparison of 1 uc versus consolidation time plots were used to analyze the respective primary the elasticity of the filter cake and secondary creep within the filter cake consolidation phases in the sludge dewatering process lu et al 2019 the elasticity and settleability of sludge were obviously improved after bs h2o2 treatment fig 2c and d which was easier to be squeezed and aggregated together although the rs fenton treatment also exhibited relatively low srf cst and bound water because of the destruction of sludge eps by radicals e g oh o2 wu et al 2020 fe2 h2o2 dosages applied in the rs fenton treatment was 1 4 times higher than that in the bs h2o2 treatment the introduction of h2o2 in bs process not only increased ros content to efficiently decompose eps for releasing interstitial water or bound water but also accelerated fe3 production to improve flocculation ability the orp value of sludge in the bs h2o2 treatment was higher than that in bs fig s8 owning to a stronger oxidation reaction further proving that h2o2 in bs enhanced fe2 oxidation and ros generation 3 3 variations of sludge properties the surface morphology of sludge in rs a ferrooxidans lx5 rs bs h2o2 and rs fenton treatments was further analyzed rs exhibited a smooth and complete structure because of high water holding capacity fig 3a the morphology of a ferrooxidans lx5 treated sludge showed a slight change fig 3b indicating that bio substitution which the heterotrophic microorganism with high eps in sludge was replaced by chemoautophic a ferrooxidans lx5 with low eps during bioleaching for reducing sludge eps was difficult in a short time 30 min however the morphology of sludge by prolonged bio substitution reaction 1 d in the bs exhibited a remarkable change fig s9 likewise bs h2o2 and rs fenton conditioning for 30 min also posed an obviously destructive surface of sludge and exposed many the uneven grooves fig 3c

of chemical reagents in the bs h2o2 process were 30 less than that of the rs fenton treatment table s1 meanwhile the treated time for bs h2o2 process also was much shorter than bs process therefore bs h2o2 process was a promising modified bioleaching approach for the sludge treatment on the other hand in bs h2o2 process acidity will be produced due to the fe3 hydrolysis which probably leads to the acidification of soil if dewatered sludge is applied to farmland thus the amount of fe2 introduced in the bs h2o2 treatment and the applied dosage of bioleached sludge on farmland should be carefully considered for the subsequent safe disposal and utilization 4 conclusions the introduction of h2o2 during bs process to increase ros content bs h2o2 simultaneously improved sludge dewaterability and reduced the treatment time of bs compared with the bs bs h2o2 contained oxidative degradation and flocculation reaction which can decompose sludge eps to release the bound water and flocculate the disrupted sludge particles to improve the hydrophobicity lots of ros such as oh fe iv and o2 could efficiently destroy the sludge eps in a short period to enhance sludge dewatering rate meanwhile a ferrooxidans lx5 and h2o2 rapidly oxidized fe2 to produce fe3 with strong flocculation ability for improving the sludge hydrophobicity as result a higher sludge dewatering efficiency 90 3 srf and 80 9 cst reduction at reaction 30 min appeared in bs h2o2 process compared with the traditional fenton the bs h2o2 only needed a little of chemical reagents less than 30 therefore these findings provide a novel way for solving bottleneck problem of sludge bioleaching process through increasing ros content for enhancing sludge dewatering efficiency which will inspire more ideas on the design of cost

15099,vegetated buffer strips vbs are an effective measure to retain pesticide inputs during rain events numerous studies have examined the retention effects of vbs on pesticides however no study has addressed on a large scale with event related peak concentrations how wide the vbs should be to avoid ecological impacts on aquatic life here we investigated for 115 lowland stream sections in germany the relevance of environmental and physico chemical parameters to determine the in stream pesticide concentration and their ecological risks based on peak concentrations related to rain events with precipitation amount resulting in vbs relevant surface runoff for 30 of the 115 investigated stream sections 25 to 70 mm d we demonstrated that the average width of vbs was the main parameter r² 0 38 reducing the pesticide input ratio indicating a relevant proportion of surface runoff contributing to the total in stream pesticide concentrations additionally dry ditches within agricultural fields increased pesticide input r² 0 31 generally substances classified as slightly mobile were better retained by vbs than mobile substances other factors including slope land use and vegetation cover of vbs had only a minor influence we assessed the ecological risk of in stream pesticide concentrations by quantifying exceedances of regulatory rac and field validated acceptable concentrations acfield we then translated this ecological risk into protective vbs width by calculating the quotient of in stream concentration and threshold rq we estimate that a vbs width of 18 m is sufficient to meet the rqacfield protection goal for 95 of streams the presence of dry ditches increased the protective vbs width to 32 m in current agricultural practice however 26 of the water stretches investigated do not comply with the prescribed 5 m vbs an extension of the vbs area to 18 m would demand 3 8 of agricultural land within the catchments a 50 reduction in pesticide use as required by the european green deal would still result in 39 rac and 68 acfield of event related samples being exceeded consequently we see the extension of the vbs width as the most efficient mearsure to sustainably reduce pesticide concentrations in small streams graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction small streams are exposed to ecologically relevant pesticide concentrations due to rainfall related runoff from adjacent agricultural fields liess et al 1999 liess and schulz 1999 vegetated buffer strips vbs located between the stream channel and the agricultural field are an important measure to reduce diffuse pesticide input from direct runoff reichenberger et al 2007 the positive effect of vbs in retaining pesticides has been shown in many review studies arora et al 2010 cole et al 2020 lacas et al 2005 prosser et al 2020 reichenberger et al 2007 zhang et al 2010 however there is an ongoing debate about the magnitude of the retention capacity for pesticides bereswill et al 2013 carluer et al 2011 davies et al 2008 donohue et al 2006 fitzpatrick et al 2001 lorenz et al 2022 wang et al 1997 despite the numerous studies available few have quantified the effects of vbs on the in stream pesticide concentration of small agricultural streams bereswill et al 2013 dunn et al 2011 rasmussen et al 2011 for example the minimum vbs width proved to be the best measure to explain the maximum toxicity of 20 pesticides in 14 danish lowland streams rasmussen et al 2011 the authors conclude that a 6 6 m wide vbs would be sufficient to keep in stream pesticide concentrations at a low risk level for invertebrates 3 log toxic unit a meta analysis of 80 studies regarding the most effective vbs width in terms of cost benefit estimation liu et al 2008 established that a 10 m wide vbs would be the optimum width to retain pesticides without however quantifying the degree of reduction currently a vbs width of 5 m is prescribed for second order streams with a catchment area larger than 10 km² according to 38a of the german water resources act bgbl 2009 this objective was also set out in the national action plan for plant protection products nap bmel 2013 however there is no scientific consensus as to whether a width of 5 m is sufficient to protect in stream communities the effectiveness of vbs is dependant not only on their width but also on their vegetation cover the longitudinal continuity of the vbs and the physico chemical properties of the pesticides to be retained cole et al 2020 dosskey et al 2010 liu et al 2008 prosser et al 2020 reed and carpenter 2002 in addition to the characteristics of the vbs itself other catchment factors also determine the exposure to pesticides in a stream such as soil erodibility length and slope of the adjacent field and the presence of erosion rills and dry ditches bereswill et al 2012 dabrowski et al 2002 hilary et al 2021 schönenberger et al 2022 schriever et al 2007 schriever and liess 2007 stehle et al 2016 wohlfahrt et al 2010 on field erosion rills in particular for definition see chapter 2 4 5 can affect the vbs retention efficacy bereswill et al 2012 stehle et al 2016 this has been shown in viniculture dominated catchments where pesticide concentrations in erosion rills positively correlated with in stream pesticide concentration and buffer strips had no reducing effect bereswill et al 2012 ohliger and schulz 2010 however the influence of dry ditches compared to on field erosion rills has also not yet been sufficiently quantified we evaluated the influence of vbs and other catchment characteristics as well as the physico chemical properties of the pesticides applied on in stream pesticide contamination in 115 small streams distributed across germany by means of event related samples during the period of highest pesticide contamination april to july we investigated i the relevance of vbs width and additional environmental factors on the in stream pesticide concentration and ii the influence of physico chemical properties on the in stream occurrence of pesticides we further estimated a protective vbs width to comply with risk assessment thresholds and mitigate ecological risks rq of pesticides to small agricultural streams 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we investigated 115 small streams in mainly agricultural environments 20 agricultural cover average 59 during the main pesticide application period from april to july in 2018 and 2019 see map si fig 1 the streams were distributed across germany the average catchment size was 12 km² varying from 1 8 km² to 70 km² the stream channel width varied between 0 5 m and 5 m details are shown in si table 2 the influence of urban areas average 6 7 of urban land cover was minimised to the best of our knowledge to ensure that the stream did not flow through urban areas thus point source discharges from wastewater treatment plants wwtp were reduced for a further detailed description of the influence of urban point sources on the streams see elsewhere liess et al 2021a thirty stream sections fulfilled the requirements of the occurrence of at least one event driven sample with a minimum of 25 mm d and a maximum of 70 mm d maximum amount of rain for one eds of rainfall prior to the pesticide sampling this site selection n 30 was used for the analysis in the results we excluded two sites from the analysis as they were characterized by a 250 times lower in stream pesticide concentration than other comparable sites organic farming in the catchment area could be one reason for this exceptionally low pesticide exposure statistically sites were identified as outliers by cook s distance 2 2 sampling design chemical analysis and substance selection event driven water samples eds n 318 were obtained from mid april to mid july in 2018 and 2019 during the main pesticide application period liess et al 2021a for this we used an automatic sampling device to collect samples as soon as the water level rose by more than 5 cm maxx rangendingen germany after initiating the sampling a composite sample of 40 subsamples was obtained every 5 min 40 ml for 3 h and 20 min samples were cooled to 4 c on site and analysed within two days additionally we obtained grab samples every three weeks according to the guidelines of the water framework directive wfd european union 2000 grab samples were treated in the same way as the eds and analysed for 11 insecticides 26 fungicides and 38 herbicides with an lchrms ms for further details see halbach et al 2021 substances were only included in the analysis if their use was authorised in germany at the time of sampling see list of substances si table 1 approval statuses were obtained from the federal office of consumer protection and food safety bvl bvl 2022 the average application rates for the selected pesticides were derived from the bvl bvl 2022 see si table 1 we retrieved the pesticide application rate data from 1998 to 2018 for each substance and aggregated them by the median for each pesticide application application rates were not available for desaminometamitron fipronil not approved since 2016 fludioxonil and propyzamide we then normalised the pesticide water concentration with the application rate for each substance to calculate a pesticide input ratio pir for each stream section see eq 1 see si table 3 1 p e s t i c i d e i n p u t r a t i o p i r i 1 n c o n c e n t r a t i o n μ g l i a p p l i c a t i o n r a t e g h a i 2 3 ecological risk assessment we estimated ecological effects on non target organisms by comparing the in stream pesticide concentration with existing regulatory and ecological effect thresholds for this purpose we used the rac and acfield liess et al 2021a umweltbundesamt uba 2019 regulatory acceptable concentrations racs were introduced to prevent unacceptable effects of pesticide exposure on non target organisms within this framework no long term adverse effects on the freshwater populations are anticipated as long as the threshold values are not exceeded umweltbundesamt uba 2019 however a recent extensive nationwide study in germany showed that generally the existing rac thresholds for insecticides and fungicides are not protective liess et al 2021a instead they introduced a field validated acceptable concentration acfield that provides a protective threshold to achieve good ecological quality for 95 of streams limited to effects on the invertebrate community the acfield only covers insecticides and fungicides for which invertebrates represent the most sensitive organism group for a full list see liess et al 2021a the in stream pesticide concentration was converted to a risk quotient rq with these two thresholds for this purpose the concentration is divided by the threshold value we defined three ecological risks based on the different thresholds 1 the maximum concentration to threshold ratio with rac values rqmax see eq 2 2 the rqacfield by replacing rac values with acfield values if available see eq 3 and 3 the rqsum with rac values only to account for the summed risk of all pesticides present in a sample see eq 4 for acetamiprid bromoxynil clothianidin dimoxystrobin foramsulfuron imidacloprid lenacil methiocarb s metolachlor terbuthylazin thiacloprid and thiamethoxam we used the predicted environmental exposure concentration pec values instead of post regulated rac values this is due to the fact that a lower post regulated rac value identified during an update within the risk assessment process is in many cases not associated with an updated pec such a delay in risk assessment of exposure and effect applied to 12 of the 16 most ecologically relevant pesticides at the time of the study as a result the post regulated rac values are often too low and the authorised application rates result in stream concentrations that substantially exceed the post regulated rac by factors of up to 5 and would in our analyses result in biased wide vbs widths to retain pesticides therefore in these cases the authorised application rates and resulting pecs don t match the post regulated racs anymore no authorisation would normally in an optimal non inert risk assessment be issued under these conditions we here aim to derive a theoretically protective vbs width that neglects this inertia problem of the risk assessment to avoid that this imbalance of pec and rac is carried out on the backs of the vbs width we consider the pecs instead we also expect that pecs were close to the initial racs before these racs were post regulated since post regulation already led to racs smaller than the respective pecs we therefore consider the pecs as a suitable approximation of initial racs to derive a protective vbs width see section 3 5 for a derivation of protective vbs width where post regulated racs were not exchanged by pecs 2 r q m a x max i 1 c i r a c i 3 r q a c f i e l d max i 1 c i a c f i e l d i 4 r q s u m i 1 n c i r a c i r q risk quotient i substance c concentration r a c regulatory acceptable

the streams with transects at 100 m intervals up to 3 km upstream of the sampling site see si fig 2 information was obtained with qgis version 3 2 1 from aerial photography with field observation from every site transect lines metres were drawn from the stream channel towards the adjacent agricultural field the maximum transect width for digitalisation was 150 m as no input of pesticides is expected via the path of surface runoff from more distant fields the widths were averaged for each transect of the stream all transects were averaged for each stream section in addition a weighted width was calculated by dividing the maximum distance of the transects by the distance of each individual transect transects close to the sampling sites were thus given a greater weighting as these are considered more relevant to explaining in stream pesticide concentrations the vegetation of the vbs was mapped during the 2018 and 2019 monitoring campaign all data regarding vbs and catchment factors is listed in si table 2 it is important to note that an intended pesticide untreated area in the agricultural field required by the terms of use of specific ppp and acting as an extension to the vbs is not regarded as part of the vbs width in addition the potential misconduct of farmers who have applied pesticides on the vbs could not be traced 2 4 2 land use the agricultural land use in the catchment was mapped 3 km upstream and in a 500 m wide longitudinal runoff corridor lrc to each site several studies have demonstrated that the impact of pesticide input through runoff is greatest within this area bunzel et al 2014 schriever et al 2007 the characteristics of land use within the catchments investigated was highly diverse covering a large gradient of environmental factors details on land use and crop types are listed in si fig 3 the loss of agricultural land due to a possible extension of the vbs area was calculated with qgis the land use data used for this analysis were obtained from the national digital landscape model basis dlm 2018 atkis 2018 a buffer area of 18 m and 5 m was calculated around the watercourses in the catchments see si fig 4 subsequently these areas were subtracted from each other at each stream section the agricultural land within this buffer area was summed and divided against the percentage of total agricultural land in the watershed 2 4 3 precipitation the daily precipitation amounts were obtained from radar information collected by the german weather service in 2018 and 2019 with a spatial resolution of 1 km² deutscher wetterdienst dwd 2020 2 4 4 slope slope data was processed by digital elevation model dgm25 efa 2013 with a resolution of 25 25 m the slope of the field adjacent to the stream was calculated by the extended distance between the end of the transect see si fig 2 and the next highest location on the adjacent field dgm25 2 4 5 erosion rills and dry ditches the number of erosion rills i e concentrated flow paths on the field leading directly to the bank of a tributary bruce et al 1975 cooper et al 2004 was determined by calculating the topographic wetness index twi using the saga flow accumulation tool in arcgis version 10 6 saga 2018 this approach determines the accumulating water from neighbouring cells and calculates the twi value according to the slope of the catchments this allows raster datasets to be created that show lines along streams indicating the potential for surface runoff and its flow direction the number of dry ditches i e canalized channels next to fields or roads that do not carry water during dry periods bereswill et al 2013 were mapped from aerial photography and supplemented by on site field observations bereswill et al 2013 2 4 6 soil information on the soil types occurring in the catchment areas of the stream sections was obtained from soil maps bük1000 bgr 1998 since several soil types occur in most catchments and thus no uniform value could be determined for the statistical evaluations the soil types were classified according to their vulnerability to erosion by rainfall this approach assumes that the input of pesticides from surface runoff is greater from soils that erode faster than from less erodible soils for this purpose the soil erodibility factor k of the general soil erodibility equation was used schwertmann et al 1990 wischmeier and smith 1978 this factor describes how easily soil material is washed from the aggregate structure the k factor was determined for each field and averaged for the lrc of a stream section 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 comparison of pesticides in terms of their physico chemical properties we compared the differences between physico chemical property classes mobility solubility and persistence of the measured in stream pesticide concentrations divided by their average application rate for this comparison we used an adapted classification system for substances obtained from the pesticide property data base ppdb lewis et al 2016 kfoc values were used instead of koc values because they were available for more pesticides persistence is represented by water sediment and water phase dt50soil values according to ppdb for values see si table 1 2 5 2 procedure of linear regression models and multiple linear regressions vbs width and in stream pesticide concentration were correlated using log transformed regression models all regressions were performed using the linear ordinary least squares approach from the stats package v4 0 2 in rstudio r core team 2020 to evaluate the influence of vbs width and the number of dry ditches on the logarithmic risk quotient a model consisting of both variables was constructed multiple linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of catchment factors on the average in stream pesticide concentration divided by the average application rate µg l and the corresponding risk quotients rqmax all predictors were validated for homoscedasticity and normality and were log transformed if necessary these include average vbs width agriculture in the lrc average slope number of erosion rills number of dry ditches dominant soil type in the lrc the average erodibility k factor per lrc catchment size and the average field size per lrc see si table 2 intercorrelation of environmental parameters was tested using the variance inflation factor vif parameters with vif scores greater than two were omitted since the sample number of 30 is too small to test all 6 parameters simultaneously the correlations between the variables were tested iteratively the selection of the total model was carried out by an automated forward model selection analysis and the akaike information criterion stepaic r package mass v7 3 51 6 venables and ripley 2007 the total model is composed of significant parameters only and the explained variance is given by the adjusted r² the contribution of each significant parameter to the total explained variance

strip width in retaining pesticides we investigated the effect of vegetated buffer strips vbs on the pir at 115 stream sections for this we restricted the selection of stream sections to those that received considerable runoff associated with a minimum rainfall of 25 mm d n 30 with this approach we avoid including weak precipitation events in the assessment that did not cause a runoff event subsequently we found a negative correlation between the average width of vbs and the pir of insecticides r² 0 45 p 0 001 fungicides r² 0 27 p 0 003 and herbicides r² 0 43 p 0 001 see fig 1 a the pir also correlates negatively with the pr of all pesticides combined r² 0 25 p 0 001 the explained variance between pir and the average vbs indicates that a relevant proportion of surface runoff contributes to the total in stream pesticide concentrations on average two such events with more than 25 mm d and less than 70 mm d of precipitation occurred in the catchments at the selected stream sections in 2018 and 2019 90th percentile 4 events n 115 representing a relevant input of pesticides to small streams the average width of vbs transects per stream section correlated best with the pir on average r² 0 38 the correlation between vbs width and pir was lower for events below 25 mm d r² 0 08 the correlation between the pir and other vbs aggregations was lower the median vbs width on average r² 0 19 minimum vbs width on average r² 0 18 and vbs width weighted to distance between transects and sampling site on average r² 0 08 correlated less strongly than the average width the pir value of herbicides log 0 5 was 25 times higher than that of insecticides and fungicides log 1 9 at the site with most narrow vbs width this is due to the generally higher in stream herbicide concentrations the average width of vbs covered a large gradient over the 30 selected stream sections see si fig 5 in germany most pesticides must be applied at least 10 m from water bodies 26 of the digitalised vbs transects n 1808 were narrower than the 5 m prescribed by the german water resources act 38a and nap see fig 1b this could potentially lead to inputs of pesticides through runoff at present the review of the vbs width by state authorities is carried out only on a random basis it is therefore possible for large scale violations of these prescribed vbs widths to occur the vegetation cover of the vbs was dominated by grass 66 8 but also includes trees 19 2 shrubs 10 9 tracks 2 7 and flowering strips 0 3 see si fig 6 however the different vegetation covers did not correlate with the pir on average for insecticides fungicides and herbicides r² 0 1 one previous investigation obtained similar results indicating no significant difference in retaining pesticides between grassed vbs and other types of vegetation cover lowrance et al 1997 however numerous studies have investigated the influence of the vegetation cover and found that the plant community and density of the vbs is also important for the quantity of pesticides entering the streams lyons et al 2000 pätzold et al 2007 prosser et al 2020 schmitt et al 1999 this lack of information about vegetation cover e g its density may explain why we did not find differences in pesticide retention amongst the vegetation covers studied here regarding the efficacy of the vbs width our study revealed similar results to a study involving 14 small streams in denmark rasmussen et al 2011 here the authors identified a correlation r² 0 37 p 0 01 between average width and summed measured in stream pesticide toxicity tu which is similar to the correlation found here average r² 0 31 in their investigation the minimum width revealed the best association with tumax r² 0 66 rasmussen et al 2011 in contrast our results showed for over 70 pesticides on a large spatial scale that the average width correlates better to the in stream pesticide concentration than the minimum vbs width by digitalising fewer transects every 500 m rasmussen et al 2011 may have missed actual vbs width minima along the stream sections with the result that the minimum width corresponds better to the average width this indicates the importance of a high spatial resolution when describing vbs width in order to include the influence of vbs width minima our results also suggest that using vbs minima alone is not sufficient to obtain an accurate prediction 3 2 the influence of physico chemical properties on the effectiveness of vegetated buffer strips we investigated the effectiveness of vegetated buffer strips vbs in retaining substances as a function of their physico chemical properties by classifying the substances according to their mobility solubility and persistence the analyses revealed that substances that are moderately to very mobile log kfoc 1500 0 01 l kg can pass the vbs more easily as indicated by their higher pir in eds at sites with narrow vbs r² 0 34 p 0 001 log kfoc 1500 150 l kg and r² 0 31 p 0 001 log kfoc 150 l kg see fig 2 in contrast there was no correlation between the average vbs width and substances that are only slightly mobile log kfoc 1500 l kg these substances contain mainly fungicides and few herbicides see classification si table 1 water solubility mg l and the persistence dt50soil of the substances showed no influence on the pesticide input ratio substances that have lower mobility and higher sediment adsorption capacity can be better retained by vbs these substances are bound to organic particles and are retained by the vegetation cover of the vbs dunn et al 2011 habibiandehkordi et al 2017 prosser et al 2020 schmitt et al 1999 for more details on the effect of vegetation cover on pir see section 3 1 the lack of correlation for slightly mobile substances is possibly due to the complete trapping of slightly mobile hydrophobic pesticides in even narrow vbs while very mobile pesticides can easier pass narrow and even wider vbs widths being dissolved in the surface runoff water our study illustrates the pesticide retaining effect of vbs for slightly mobile pesticides for an additional 16 substances on a large scale see si table 1 for mobile substances we were able to show that these substances needed broader vbs than slightly mobile substances 3 3 effectiveness of vegetated buffer strips in preventing rac exceedances vegetated buffer strips vbs reduce runoff related pesticide exposure however the pesticides entering water bodies are characterised by a strongly contrasting toxicity we assessed the ecotoxicological relevance of substances entering the stream by comparing the in stream concentrations with the regulatory rac and field validated acfield effect thresholds we considered three different protection goals rqmax rqacfield and rqsum see chapter 2 3 logarithmic rq values greater than 0 indicate an unacceptable risk efa 2013 to estimate protective vbs widths we modelled the relationship between average vbs widths and the rq log per stream section and intersected the logarithmically transformed linear models at the zero line on the y axis see fig 3 rqmax revealed required vbs widths of 18 6 m for algae rqsum which takes into account the summed risk caused by pesticides that occur together and affect the same organism group revealed 31 6 m for algae see values in table 1 compared to invertebrates and fish protective widths were widest for algae with respect to rqmax and rqsum to exclude unacceptable effects on the invertebrate community in 95 of streams and avoid a summed rac exceedance by multiple substances a vbs width of 10 m would be needed instead of 5 m invertebrates were best protected by the rqacfield protection goal for 95 of the streams 25 5 m compared to the regulated width of 5 m in germany by implementing a vbs width of 25 5 m we could lower the risk rqacfield by a factor of 8 rqacfield for invertebrates 2 for fish and 4 for algae due to the exponential relationship between risk and vbs width it is noteworthy that these protective vbs widths include all point source inputs dry ditches etc and are therefore wider than a vbs width that would only retain runoff see section 3 4 attempts to derive protective vbs widths that retain pesticides have already been made by several investigations however these usually refer to pesticide load reductions in percent and are difficult to translate into ecologically relevant concentrations dunn et al 2011 in studies the protective vbs width ranges from 6 6 m to 15 m liu et al 2008 prosser et al 2020 through the present investigation we were the first to develop an approach to derive a protective vbs width in compliance with the pesticide risk assessment under field conditions our proposed protective vbs widths are considerably higher than the 5 m prescribed by law and the 6 6 15 m suggested in the literature pesticide entries can still occur but they should not exceed any rac or acfield depending on the protection goal however the current risk assessment seems to underestimate the risk to fish as their maximum rq is 7 6 times lower than that of invertebrates another recent study also found that pesticides in small to medium sized streams pose a risk to fish and that pesticide risk may be underestimated werner et al 2021 3 4 drivers for the effectiveness of vegetated buffer strips and proposed protective widths effective retention of pesticides by vbs requires evaluation of the factors that increase pesticide inputs to the streams the protective vbs widths identified in section 3 3 are likely to be too large because these results include pesticide input promoting factors we therefore investigated the average slope dominant soil type number of erosion rills average field size erodibility of soils k factor and the influence of dry ditches a multiple linear regression revealed that dry ditches were found to correlate positively with the rqmax insecticides r² 0 35 fungicides r² 0 2 and herbicides r² 0 57 while the average vbs width was the only parameter that negatively correlated with the rqmax see si fig 8 other variables such as slope agricultural cover in the catchment vegetation cover average field size erosion rills erodibility soil type and catchment size were not significant and of minor influence r² 0 1 the full model of the multiple linear regression for rqmax was highest for algae r² 0 61 followed by invertebrates r² 0 35 and fish r² 0 3 the r² of the full models for rqsum invertebrates r² 0 33 fish r² 0 34 and algae r² 0 59 and rqacfield invertebrates r² 0 24 fish r² 0 28 and algae r² 0 46 were smaller to a minor extend see si fig 8 however multiple regressions have the disadvantage that as the number of observations decreases the possibility of testing explanatory variables also decreases hence all combinations of explanatory variables were tested consecutively the unexplained proportion of variance in all analyses shown in this study are generally exceeding 50 this is partly due to the complex off site transport processes of pesticides or to missing factors in the multifactorial analyses such as the presence of drainage systems in the catchment areas drainage systems can change the input patterns of pesticides during rain events and in the worst case vbs can be bypassed brown and van beinum 2009 this should be taken into account when considering these results and could be the subject of future research we combined the effects of vbs width and dry ditches in one model to evaluate the protective width of vbs with and without the presence of dry ditches there were only weak correlations r 0 7 between dry ditches or vbs width and any other variables see si fig 9 if dry ditches were optimally managed in the catchments and there would be no input from this source then the most protective vbs width could be reduced by 7 7 m from 25 5 m rqacfield invertebrates 95 to 17 8 m rqacfield invertebrates 95 this reduction potential is even higher for herbicides here the protective vbs width could be reduced by 20 4 m from 23 m rqsum algae 50 to 2 6 m rqsum algae 50 most herbicides are very mobile log kfoc 150 l kg due to their physico chemical properties these substances are therefore transported more quickly to the dry ditches and flow rapidly into the nearest receiving waters compared to algae and invertebrates the reduction potential for fish is small 0 6 m rqsum 50 as in general their risk is low see fig 3 we therefore propose an overall protective vbs width of 18 m to protect all vulnerable aquatic organisms and to avoid acfield and rac exceedance for 95 of the streams a widening of the vbs from 5 m to 18 m would result in an average reduction in agricultural land of 3 8 in the catchments studied here until now no study has shown such an extensive influence of dry ditches on the in stream pesticide concentration previous studies have found a contribution of dry ditches to in stream pesticide contamination bereswill et al 2013 ohliger and schulz 2010 stehle et al 2016 however they observed more pesticide inputs coming from erosion rills bereswill et al 2012 we did not observe a pesticide input enhancing effect from on field erosion rills on lowland streams this could be due to the comparably steep slopes investigated by stehle et al 2016 on average 8 4 the average slope in the catchments investigated here was 2 5 3 5 deficiencies of the regulatory pesticide approval process the regulatory approval of pesticides is designed to avoid long term effects on aquatic life european food safety authority efsa 2013 to ensure this predicted environmental concentrations pecs are modelled for specific pesticide applications to assess whether the estimated in stream concentrations are below the regulatory thresholds rac a protective vbs width as derived in this study is therefore directly dependant on the application rates resulting from the pesticide authorisation process based on new scientific findings pesticides may be classified as more toxic and rac values are downregulated without a new authorisation process being initiated until the original authorisation expires however these new scientific findings are not reflected in the previously established exposure models nor in the application rates which would require corresponding downregulation brühl and zaller 2019 liess et al 2021a pesticides are thus treated with double standards by risk assessment the application is based on old knowledge leading to high in stream concentrations which are then compared to thresholds of new standards resulting in many threshold exceedances if we want to implement a protective vbs width under current authorised pesticide application rates and rac values the calculated protective vbs width for algae would be 47 3 m rqsum application rates adapted to the current scientific findings could therefore avoid many threshold exceedances and would also result in a more moderate protective vbs width the proposed european green deal calls for a 50 reduction in pesticide use by the year 2030 european commission 2022 assuming that a 50 reduction in pesticide use would result in a 50 reduction in pesticide concentrations in the stream 39 rac and 68 acfield of the eds samples would still have exceedances see si table 4 since 95 of the rac and acfield exceedances could be avoided by expanding the vbs width we consider this approach to be more effective than a 50 reduction in use 4 conclusion we conclude that the width of vegetated buffer strips vbs is the most efficient factor for pesticide retention and revealed an average width of 18 m to prevent ecological effects in 95 of stream sections pesticide retention is higher for slightly mobile substances moderately mobile to mobile substances are more likely to bypass the vbs and require a broader vbs a wide vbs does not automatically protect streams as vbs can be bypassed by dry ditches which positively correlate with the pesticide input ratio on average r² 0 31 if the current vbs adjacent to agricultural streams were increased to 18 m an additional 3 8 of agricultural land would have to be transformed to protect in stream communities 5 additional resources additional figures for this publication are listed in supplementary s1 fig while tables are

15099,vegetated buffer strips vbs are an effective measure to retain pesticide inputs during rain events numerous studies have examined the retention effects of vbs on pesticides however no study has addressed on a large scale with event related peak concentrations how wide the vbs should be to avoid ecological impacts on aquatic life here we investigated for 115 lowland stream sections in germany the relevance of environmental and physico chemical parameters to determine the in stream pesticide concentration and their ecological risks based on peak concentrations related to rain events with precipitation amount resulting in vbs relevant surface runoff for 30 of the 115 investigated stream sections 25 to 70 mm d we demonstrated that the average width of vbs was the main parameter r² 0 38 reducing the pesticide input ratio indicating a relevant proportion of surface runoff contributing to the total in stream pesticide concentrations additionally dry ditches within agricultural fields increased pesticide input r² 0 31 generally substances classified as slightly mobile were better retained by vbs than mobile substances other factors including slope land use and vegetation cover of vbs had only a minor influence we assessed the ecological risk of in stream pesticide concentrations by quantifying exceedances of regulatory rac and field validated acceptable concentrations acfield we then translated this ecological risk into protective vbs width by calculating the quotient of in stream concentration and threshold rq we estimate that a vbs width of 18 m is sufficient to meet the rqacfield protection goal for 95 of streams the presence of dry ditches increased the protective vbs width to 32 m in current agricultural practice however 26 of the water stretches investigated do not comply with the prescribed 5 m vbs an extension of the vbs area to 18 m would demand 3 8 of agricultural land within the catchments a 50 reduction in pesticide use as required by the european green deal would still result in 39 rac and 68 acfield of event related samples being exceeded consequently we see the extension of the vbs width as the most efficient mearsure to sustainably reduce pesticide concentrations in small streams graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction small streams are exposed to ecologically relevant pesticide concentrations due to rainfall related runoff from adjacent agricultural fields liess et al 1999 liess and schulz 1999 vegetated buffer strips vbs located between the stream channel and the agricultural field are an important measure to reduce diffuse pesticide input from direct runoff reichenberger et al 2007 the positive effect of vbs in retaining pesticides has been shown in many review studies arora et al 2010 cole et al 2020 lacas et al 2005 prosser et al 2020 reichenberger et al 2007 zhang et al 2010 however there is an ongoing debate about the magnitude of the retention capacity for pesticides bereswill et al 2013 carluer et al 2011 davies et al 2008 donohue et al 2006 fitzpatrick et al 2001 lorenz et al 2022 wang et al 1997 despite the numerous studies available few have quantified the effects of vbs on the in stream pesticide concentration of small agricultural streams bereswill et al 2013 dunn et al 2011 rasmussen et al 2011 for example the minimum vbs width proved to be the best measure to explain the maximum toxicity of 20 pesticides in 14 danish lowland streams rasmussen et al 2011 the authors conclude that a 6 6 m wide vbs would be sufficient to keep in stream pesticide concentrations at a low risk level for invertebrates 3 log toxic unit a meta analysis of 80 studies regarding the most effective vbs width in terms of cost benefit estimation liu et al 2008 established that a 10 m wide vbs would be the optimum width to retain pesticides without however quantifying the degree of reduction currently a vbs width of 5 m is prescribed for second order streams with a catchment area larger than 10 km² according to 38a of the german water resources act bgbl 2009 this objective was also set out in the national action plan for plant protection products nap bmel 2013 however there is no scientific consensus as to whether a width of 5 m is sufficient to protect in stream communities the effectiveness of vbs is dependant not only on their width but also on their vegetation cover the longitudinal continuity of the vbs and the physico chemical properties of the pesticides to be retained cole et al 2020 dosskey et al 2010 liu et al 2008 prosser et al 2020 reed and carpenter 2002 in addition to the characteristics of the vbs itself other catchment factors also determine the exposure to pesticides in a stream such as soil erodibility length and slope of the adjacent field and the presence of erosion rills and dry ditches bereswill et al 2012 dabrowski et al 2002 hilary et al 2021 schönenberger et al 2022 schriever et al 2007 schriever and liess 2007 stehle et al 2016 wohlfahrt et al 2010 on field erosion rills in particular for definition see chapter 2 4 5 can affect the vbs retention efficacy bereswill et al 2012 stehle et al 2016 this has been shown in viniculture dominated catchments where pesticide concentrations in erosion rills positively correlated with in stream pesticide concentration and buffer strips had no reducing effect bereswill et al 2012 ohliger and schulz 2010 however the influence of dry ditches compared to on field erosion rills has also not yet been sufficiently quantified we evaluated the influence of vbs and other catchment characteristics as well as the physico chemical properties of the pesticides applied on in stream pesticide contamination in 115 small streams distributed across germany by means of event related samples during the period of highest pesticide contamination april to july we investigated i the relevance of vbs width and additional environmental factors on the in stream pesticide concentration and ii the influence of physico chemical properties on the in stream occurrence of pesticides we further estimated a protective vbs width to comply with risk assessment thresholds and mitigate ecological risks rq of pesticides to small agricultural streams 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we investigated 115 small streams in mainly agricultural environments 20 agricultural cover average 59 during the main pesticide application period from april to july in 2018 and 2019 see map si fig 1 the streams were distributed across germany the average catchment size was 12 km² varying from 1 8 km² to 70 km² the stream channel width varied between 0 5 m and 5 m details are shown in si table 2 the influence of urban areas average 6 7 of urban land cover was minimised to the best of our knowledge to ensure that the stream did not flow through urban areas thus point source discharges from wastewater treatment plants wwtp were reduced for a further detailed description of the influence of urban point sources on the streams see elsewhere liess et al 2021a thirty stream sections fulfilled the requirements of the occurrence of at least one event driven sample with a minimum of 25 mm d and a maximum of 70 mm d maximum amount of rain for one eds of rainfall prior to the pesticide sampling this site selection n 30 was used for the analysis in the results we excluded two sites from the analysis as they were characterized by a 250 times lower in stream pesticide concentration than other comparable sites organic farming in the catchment area could be one reason for this exceptionally low pesticide exposure statistically sites were identified as outliers by cook s distance 2 2 sampling design chemical analysis and substance selection event driven water samples eds n 318 were obtained from mid april to mid july in 2018 and 2019 during the main pesticide application period liess et al 2021a for this we used an automatic sampling device to collect samples as soon as the water level rose by more than 5 cm maxx rangendingen germany after initiating the sampling a composite sample of 40 subsamples was obtained every 5 min 40 ml for 3 h and 20 min samples were cooled to 4 c on site and analysed within two days additionally we obtained grab samples every three weeks according to the guidelines of the water framework directive wfd european union 2000 grab samples were treated in the same way as the eds and analysed for 11 insecticides 26 fungicides and 38 herbicides with an lchrms ms for further details see halbach et al 2021 substances were only included in the analysis if their use was authorised in germany at the time of sampling see list of substances si table 1 approval statuses were obtained from the federal office of consumer protection and food safety bvl bvl 2022 the average application rates for the selected pesticides were derived from the bvl bvl 2022 see si table 1 we retrieved the pesticide application rate data from 1998 to 2018 for each substance and aggregated them by the median for each pesticide application application rates were not available for desaminometamitron fipronil not approved since 2016 fludioxonil and propyzamide we then normalised the pesticide water concentration with the application rate for each substance to calculate a pesticide input ratio pir for each stream section see eq 1 see si table 3 1 p e s t i c i d e i n p u t r a t i o p i r i 1 n c o n c e n t r a t i o n μ g l i a p p l i c a t i o n r a t e g h a i 2 3 ecological risk assessment we estimated ecological effects on non target organisms by comparing the in stream pesticide concentration with existing regulatory and ecological effect thresholds for this purpose we used the rac and acfield liess et al 2021a umweltbundesamt uba 2019 regulatory acceptable concentrations racs were introduced to prevent unacceptable effects of pesticide exposure on non target organisms within this framework no long term adverse effects on the freshwater populations are anticipated as long as the threshold values are not exceeded umweltbundesamt uba 2019 however a recent extensive nationwide study in germany showed that generally the existing rac thresholds for insecticides and fungicides are not protective liess et al 2021a instead they introduced a field validated acceptable concentration acfield that provides a protective threshold to achieve good ecological quality for 95 of streams limited to effects on the invertebrate community the acfield only covers insecticides and fungicides for which invertebrates represent the most sensitive organism group for a full list see liess et al 2021a the in stream pesticide concentration was converted to a risk quotient rq with these two thresholds for this purpose the concentration is divided by the threshold value we defined three ecological risks based on the different thresholds 1 the maximum concentration to threshold ratio with rac values rqmax see eq 2 2 the rqacfield by replacing rac values with acfield values if available see eq 3 and 3 the rqsum with rac values only to account for the summed risk of all pesticides present in a sample see eq 4 for acetamiprid bromoxynil clothianidin dimoxystrobin foramsulfuron imidacloprid lenacil methiocarb s metolachlor terbuthylazin thiacloprid and thiamethoxam we used the predicted environmental exposure concentration pec values instead of post regulated rac values this is due to the fact that a lower post regulated rac value identified during an update within the risk assessment process is in many cases not associated with an updated pec such a delay in risk assessment of exposure and effect applied to 12 of the 16 most ecologically relevant pesticides at the time of the study as a result the post regulated rac values are often too low and the authorised application rates result in stream concentrations that substantially exceed the post regulated rac by factors of up to 5 and would in our analyses result in biased wide vbs widths to retain pesticides therefore in these cases the authorised application rates and resulting pecs don t match the post regulated racs anymore no authorisation would normally in an optimal non inert risk assessment be issued under these conditions we here aim to derive a theoretically protective vbs width that neglects this inertia problem of the risk assessment to avoid that this imbalance of pec and rac is carried out on the backs of the vbs width we consider the pecs instead we also expect that pecs were close to the initial racs before these racs were post regulated since post regulation already led to racs smaller than the respective pecs we therefore consider the pecs as a suitable approximation of initial racs to derive a protective vbs width see section 3 5 for a derivation of protective vbs width where post regulated racs were not exchanged by pecs 2 r q m a x max i 1 c i r a c i 3 r q a c f i e l d max i 1 c i a c f i e l d i 4 r q s u m i 1 n c i r a c i r q risk quotient i substance c concentration r a c regulatory acceptable

the streams with transects at 100 m intervals up to 3 km upstream of the sampling site see si fig 2 information was obtained with qgis version 3 2 1 from aerial photography with field observation from every site transect lines metres were drawn from the stream channel towards the adjacent agricultural field the maximum transect width for digitalisation was 150 m as no input of pesticides is expected via the path of surface runoff from more distant fields the widths were averaged for each transect of the stream all transects were averaged for each stream section in addition a weighted width was calculated by dividing the maximum distance of the transects by the distance of each individual transect transects close to the sampling sites were thus given a greater weighting as these are considered more relevant to explaining in stream pesticide concentrations the vegetation of the vbs was mapped during the 2018 and 2019 monitoring campaign all data regarding vbs and catchment factors is listed in si table 2 it is important to note that an intended pesticide untreated area in the agricultural field required by the terms of use of specific ppp and acting as an extension to the vbs is not regarded as part of the vbs width in addition the potential misconduct of farmers who have applied pesticides on the vbs could not be traced 2 4 2 land use the agricultural land use in the catchment was mapped 3 km upstream and in a 500 m wide longitudinal runoff corridor lrc to each site several studies have demonstrated that the impact of pesticide input through runoff is greatest within this area bunzel et al 2014 schriever et al 2007 the characteristics of land use within the catchments investigated was highly diverse covering a large gradient of environmental factors details on land use and crop types are listed in si fig 3 the loss of agricultural land due to a possible extension of the vbs area was calculated with qgis the land use data used for this analysis were obtained from the national digital landscape model basis dlm 2018 atkis 2018 a buffer area of 18 m and 5 m was calculated around the watercourses in the catchments see si fig 4 subsequently these areas were subtracted from each other at each stream section the agricultural land within this buffer area was summed and divided against the percentage of total agricultural land in the watershed 2 4 3 precipitation the daily precipitation amounts were obtained from radar information collected by the german weather service in 2018 and 2019 with a spatial resolution of 1 km² deutscher wetterdienst dwd 2020 2 4 4 slope slope data was processed by digital elevation model dgm25 efa 2013 with a resolution of 25 25 m the slope of the field adjacent to the stream was calculated by the extended distance between the end of the transect see si fig 2 and the next highest location on the adjacent field dgm25 2 4 5 erosion rills and dry ditches the number of erosion rills i e concentrated flow paths on the field leading directly to the bank of a tributary bruce et al 1975 cooper et al 2004 was determined by calculating the topographic wetness index twi using the saga flow accumulation tool in arcgis version 10 6 saga 2018 this approach determines the accumulating water from neighbouring cells and calculates the twi value according to the slope of the catchments this allows raster datasets to be created that show lines along streams indicating the potential for surface runoff and its flow direction the number of dry ditches i e canalized channels next to fields or roads that do not carry water during dry periods bereswill et al 2013 were mapped from aerial photography and supplemented by on site field observations bereswill et al 2013 2 4 6 soil information on the soil types occurring in the catchment areas of the stream sections was obtained from soil maps bük1000 bgr 1998 since several soil types occur in most catchments and thus no uniform value could be determined for the statistical evaluations the soil types were classified according to their vulnerability to erosion by rainfall this approach assumes that the input of pesticides from surface runoff is greater from soils that erode faster than from less erodible soils for this purpose the soil erodibility factor k of the general soil erodibility equation was used schwertmann et al 1990 wischmeier and smith 1978 this factor describes how easily soil material is washed from the aggregate structure the k factor was determined for each field and averaged for the lrc of a stream section 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 comparison of pesticides in terms of their physico chemical properties we compared the differences between physico chemical property classes mobility solubility and persistence of the measured in stream pesticide concentrations divided by their average application rate for this comparison we used an adapted classification system for substances obtained from the pesticide property data base ppdb lewis et al 2016 kfoc values were used instead of koc values because they were available for more pesticides persistence is represented by water sediment and water phase dt50soil values according to ppdb for values see si table 1 2 5 2 procedure of linear regression models and multiple linear regressions vbs width and in stream pesticide concentration were correlated using log transformed regression models all regressions were performed using the linear ordinary least squares approach from the stats package v4 0 2 in rstudio r core team 2020 to evaluate the influence of vbs width and the number of dry ditches on the logarithmic risk quotient a model consisting of both variables was constructed multiple linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of catchment factors on the average in stream pesticide concentration divided by the average application rate µg l and the corresponding risk quotients rqmax all predictors were validated for homoscedasticity and normality and were log transformed if necessary these include average vbs width agriculture in the lrc average slope number of erosion rills number of dry ditches dominant soil type in the lrc the average erodibility k factor per lrc catchment size and the average field size per lrc see si table 2 intercorrelation of environmental parameters was tested using the variance inflation factor vif parameters with vif scores greater than two were omitted since the sample number of 30 is too small to test all 6 parameters simultaneously the correlations between the variables were tested iteratively the selection of the total model was carried out by an automated forward model selection analysis and the akaike information criterion stepaic r package mass v7 3 51 6 venables and ripley

strip width in retaining pesticides we investigated the effect of vegetated buffer strips vbs on the pir at 115 stream sections for this we restricted the selection of stream sections to those that received considerable runoff associated with a minimum rainfall of 25 mm d n 30 with this approach we avoid including weak precipitation events in the assessment that did not cause a runoff event subsequently we found a negative correlation between the average width of vbs and the pir of insecticides r² 0 45 p 0 001 fungicides r² 0 27 p 0 003 and herbicides r² 0 43 p 0 001 see fig 1 a the pir also correlates negatively with the pr of all pesticides combined r² 0 25 p 0 001 the explained variance between pir and the average vbs indicates that a relevant proportion of surface runoff contributes to the total in stream pesticide concentrations on average two such events with more than 25 mm d and less than 70 mm d of precipitation occurred in the catchments at the selected stream sections in 2018 and 2019 90th percentile 4 events n 115 representing a relevant input of pesticides to small streams the average width of vbs transects per stream section correlated best with the pir on average r² 0 38 the correlation between vbs width and pir was lower for events below 25 mm d r² 0 08 the correlation between the pir and other vbs aggregations was lower the median vbs width on average r² 0 19 minimum vbs width on average r² 0 18 and vbs width weighted to distance between transects and sampling site on average r² 0 08 correlated less strongly than the average width the pir value of herbicides log 0 5 was 25 times higher than that of insecticides and fungicides log 1 9 at the site with most narrow vbs width this is due to the generally higher in stream herbicide concentrations the average width of vbs covered a large gradient over the 30 selected stream sections see si fig 5 in germany most pesticides must be applied at least 10 m from water bodies 26 of the digitalised vbs transects n 1808 were narrower than the 5 m prescribed by the german water resources act 38a and nap see fig 1b this could potentially lead to inputs of pesticides through runoff at present the review of the vbs width by state authorities is carried out only on a random basis it is therefore possible for large scale violations of these prescribed vbs widths to occur the vegetation cover of the vbs was dominated by grass 66 8 but also includes trees 19 2 shrubs 10 9 tracks 2 7 and flowering strips 0 3 see si fig 6 however the different vegetation covers did not correlate with the pir on average for insecticides fungicides and herbicides r² 0 1 one previous investigation obtained similar results indicating no significant difference in retaining pesticides between grassed vbs and other types of vegetation cover lowrance et al 1997 however numerous studies have investigated the influence of the vegetation cover and found that the plant community and density of the vbs is also important for the quantity of pesticides entering the streams lyons et al 2000 pätzold et al 2007 prosser et al 2020 schmitt et al 1999 this lack of information about vegetation cover e g its density may explain why we did not find differences in pesticide retention amongst the vegetation covers studied here regarding the efficacy of the vbs width our study revealed similar results to a study involving 14 small streams in denmark rasmussen et al 2011 here the authors identified a correlation r² 0 37 p 0 01 between average width and summed measured in stream pesticide toxicity tu which is similar to the correlation found here average r² 0 31 in their investigation the minimum width revealed the best association with tumax r² 0 66 rasmussen et al 2011 in contrast our results showed for over 70 pesticides on a large spatial scale that the average width correlates better to the in stream pesticide concentration than the minimum vbs width by digitalising fewer transects every 500 m rasmussen et al 2011 may have missed actual vbs width minima along the stream sections with the result that the minimum width corresponds better to the average width this indicates the importance of a high spatial resolution when describing vbs width in order to include the influence of vbs width minima our results also suggest that using vbs minima alone is not sufficient to obtain an accurate prediction 3 2 the influence of physico chemical properties on the effectiveness of vegetated buffer strips we investigated the effectiveness of vegetated buffer strips vbs in retaining substances as a function of their physico chemical properties by classifying the substances according to their mobility solubility and persistence the analyses revealed that substances that are moderately to very mobile log kfoc 1500 0 01 l kg can pass the vbs more easily as indicated by their higher pir in eds at sites with narrow vbs r² 0 34 p 0 001 log kfoc 1500 150 l kg and r² 0 31 p 0 001 log kfoc 150 l kg see fig 2 in contrast there was no correlation between the average vbs width and substances that are only slightly mobile log kfoc 1500 l kg these substances contain mainly fungicides and few herbicides see classification si table 1 water solubility mg l and the persistence dt50soil of the substances showed no influence on the pesticide input ratio substances that have lower mobility and higher sediment adsorption capacity can be better retained by vbs these substances are bound to organic particles and are retained by the vegetation cover of the vbs dunn et al 2011 habibiandehkordi et al 2017 prosser et al 2020 schmitt et al 1999 for more details on the effect of vegetation cover on pir see section 3 1 the lack of correlation for slightly mobile substances is possibly due to the complete trapping of slightly mobile hydrophobic pesticides in even narrow vbs while very mobile pesticides can easier pass narrow and even wider vbs widths being dissolved in the surface runoff water our study illustrates the pesticide retaining effect of vbs for slightly mobile pesticides for an additional 16 substances on a large scale see si table 1 for mobile substances we were able to show that these substances needed broader vbs than slightly mobile substances 3 3 effectiveness of vegetated buffer strips in preventing rac exceedances vegetated buffer strips vbs reduce runoff related pesticide exposure however the pesticides entering water bodies are characterised by a strongly contrasting toxicity we assessed the ecotoxicological relevance of substances entering the stream by comparing the in stream concentrations with the regulatory rac and field validated acfield effect thresholds we considered three different protection goals rqmax rqacfield and rqsum see chapter 2 3 logarithmic rq values greater than 0 indicate an unacceptable risk efa 2013 to estimate protective vbs widths we modelled the relationship between average vbs widths and the rq log per stream section and intersected the logarithmically transformed linear models at the zero line on the y axis see fig 3 rqmax revealed required vbs widths of 18 6 m for algae rqsum which takes into account the summed risk caused by pesticides that occur together and affect the same organism group revealed 31 6 m for algae see values in table 1 compared to invertebrates and fish protective widths were widest for algae with respect to rqmax and rqsum to exclude unacceptable effects on the invertebrate community in 95 of streams and avoid a summed rac exceedance by multiple substances a vbs width of 10 m would be needed instead of 5 m invertebrates were best protected by the rqacfield protection goal for 95 of the streams 25 5 m compared to the regulated width of 5 m in germany by implementing a vbs width of 25 5 m we could lower the risk rqacfield by a factor of 8 rqacfield for invertebrates 2 for fish and 4 for algae due to the exponential relationship between risk and vbs width it is noteworthy that these protective vbs widths include all point source inputs dry ditches etc and are therefore wider than a vbs width that would only retain runoff see section 3 4 attempts to derive protective vbs widths that retain pesticides have already been made by several investigations however these usually refer to pesticide load reductions in percent and are difficult to translate into ecologically relevant concentrations dunn et al 2011 in studies the protective vbs width ranges from 6 6 m to 15 m liu et al 2008 prosser et al 2020 through the present investigation we were the first to develop an approach to derive a protective vbs width in compliance with the pesticide risk assessment under field conditions our proposed protective vbs widths are considerably higher than the 5 m prescribed by law and the 6 6 15 m suggested in the literature pesticide entries can still occur but they should not exceed any rac or acfield depending on the protection goal however the current risk assessment seems to underestimate the risk to fish as their maximum rq is 7 6 times lower than that of invertebrates another recent study also found that pesticides in small to medium sized streams pose a risk to fish and that pesticide risk may be underestimated werner et al 2021 3 4 drivers for the effectiveness of vegetated buffer strips and proposed protective widths effective retention of pesticides by vbs requires evaluation of the factors that increase pesticide inputs to the streams the protective vbs widths identified in section 3 3 are likely to be too large because these results include pesticide input promoting factors we therefore investigated the average slope dominant soil type number of erosion rills average field size erodibility of soils k factor and the influence of dry ditches a multiple linear regression revealed that dry ditches were found to correlate positively with the rqmax insecticides r² 0 35 fungicides r² 0 2 and herbicides r² 0 57 while the average vbs width was the only parameter that negatively correlated with the rqmax see si fig 8 other variables such as slope agricultural cover in the catchment vegetation cover average field size erosion rills erodibility soil type and catchment size were not significant and of minor influence r² 0 1 the full model of the multiple linear regression for rqmax was highest for algae r² 0 61 followed by invertebrates r² 0 35 and fish r² 0 3 the r² of the full models for rqsum invertebrates r² 0 33 fish r² 0 34 and algae r² 0 59 and rqacfield invertebrates r² 0 24 fish r² 0 28 and algae r² 0 46 were smaller to a minor extend see si fig 8 however multiple regressions have the disadvantage that as the number of observations decreases the possibility of testing explanatory variables also decreases hence all combinations of explanatory variables were tested consecutively the unexplained proportion of variance in all analyses shown in this study are generally exceeding 50 this is partly due to the complex off site transport processes of pesticides or to missing factors in the multifactorial analyses such as the presence of drainage systems in the catchment areas drainage systems can change the input patterns of pesticides during rain events and in the worst case vbs can be bypassed brown and van beinum 2009 this should be taken into account when considering these results and could be the subject of future research we combined the effects of vbs width and dry ditches in one model to evaluate the protective width of vbs with and without the presence of dry ditches there were only weak correlations r 0 7 between dry ditches or vbs width and any other variables see si fig 9 if dry ditches were optimally managed in the catchments and there would be no input from this source then the most protective vbs width could be reduced by 7 7 m from 25 5 m rqacfield invertebrates 95 to 17 8 m rqacfield invertebrates 95 this reduction potential is even higher for herbicides here the protective vbs width could be reduced by 20 4 m from 23 m rqsum algae 50 to 2 6 m rqsum algae 50 most herbicides are very mobile log kfoc 150 l kg due to their physico chemical properties these substances are therefore transported more quickly to the dry ditches and flow rapidly into the nearest receiving waters compared to algae and invertebrates the reduction potential for fish is small 0 6 m rqsum 50 as in general their risk is low see fig 3 we therefore propose an overall protective vbs width of 18 m to protect all vulnerable aquatic organisms and to avoid acfield and rac exceedance for 95 of the streams a widening of the vbs from 5 m to 18 m would result in an average reduction in agricultural land of 3 8 in the catchments studied here until now no study has shown such an extensive influence of dry ditches on the in stream pesticide concentration previous studies have found a contribution of dry ditches to in stream pesticide contamination bereswill et al 2013 ohliger and schulz 2010 stehle et al 2016 however they observed more pesticide inputs coming from erosion rills bereswill et al 2012 we did not observe a pesticide input enhancing effect from on field erosion rills on lowland streams this could be due to the comparably steep slopes investigated by stehle et al 2016 on average 8 4 the average slope in the catchments investigated here was 2 5 3 5 deficiencies of the regulatory pesticide approval process the regulatory approval of pesticides is designed to avoid long term effects on aquatic life european food safety authority efsa 2013 to ensure this predicted environmental concentrations pecs are modelled for specific pesticide applications to assess whether the estimated in stream concentrations are below the regulatory thresholds rac a protective vbs width as derived in this study is therefore directly dependant on the application rates resulting from the pesticide authorisation process based on new scientific findings pesticides may be classified as more toxic and rac values are downregulated without a new authorisation process being initiated until the original authorisation expires however these new scientific findings are not reflected in the previously established exposure models nor in the application rates which would require corresponding downregulation brühl and zaller 2019 liess et al 2021a pesticides are thus treated with double standards by risk assessment the application is based on old knowledge leading to high in stream concentrations which are then compared to thresholds of new standards resulting in many threshold exceedances if we want to implement a protective vbs width under current authorised pesticide application rates and rac values the calculated protective vbs width for algae would be 47 3 m rqsum application rates adapted to the current scientific findings could therefore avoid many threshold exceedances and would also result in a more moderate protective vbs width the proposed european green deal calls for a 50 reduction in pesticide use by the year 2030 european commission 2022 assuming that a 50 reduction in pesticide use would result in a 50 reduction in pesticide concentrations in the stream 39 rac and 68 acfield of the eds samples would still have exceedances see si table 4 since 95 of the rac and acfield exceedances could be avoided by expanding the vbs width we consider this approach to be more effective than a 50 reduction in use 4 conclusion we conclude that the width of vegetated buffer strips vbs is the most efficient factor for pesticide retention and revealed an average width of 18 m to prevent ecological effects in 95 of stream sections pesticide retention is higher for slightly mobile substances moderately mobile to mobile substances are more likely to bypass the vbs and require a broader vbs a wide vbs does not automatically protect streams as vbs can be bypassed by dry ditches which positively correlate with the pesticide input ratio on average r² 0 31 if the current vbs adjacent to agricultural streams were increased to 18 m an additional 3 8 of agricultural land would have to be transformed to protect in stream communities 5 additional resources additional figures for this publication are listed in supplementary s1 fig while tables are
