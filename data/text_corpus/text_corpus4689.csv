23445,a bucket foundation with bulkheads bfb is a new form of offshore foundation that is divided into seven compartments by an internal skirt and bulkheads suction penetration is an important process during the installation of bfbs however little attention has been paid to the effect of seepage on the penetration resistance of bfbs in sand in this paper a series of experiments and numerical simulations are performed to study the seepage field and the effect of seepage on the penetration resistance of a bfb during suction installation in sand moreover a method of calculating the penetration resistance of bfbs is proposed considering the seepage effect and the penetration resistance distribution of the bfb test model is analyzed the analysis results show that seepage obviously reduces the penetration resistance of bfbs and the ratio of reductions in resistance to the total resistance reaches a maximum value of 0 55 at the final penetration stage in addition the soil

and renewable energy source wind energy is gradually attracting attention worldwide as offshore wind farms present the advantages of saving land resources high wind speed and minimal influence on the surrounding environment offshore wind power has become a tendency in the wind power development china has a rich offshore wind energy resource of over1 billion kw and its total offshore wind power resources is about 750 million kw a large number of foundation types for offshore wind turbines have been studied in recent years the foundation structures mainly include pile foundation gravity foundation jacket foundation and floating foundation byrne and houslby 2003 liu et al 2015b as a new foundation form bucket foundations present the advantages of economic feasibility and environment friendly work principles houlsby and byrne 2000 liu et al 2015a the norwegian geotechnical institute studied the europipe 16 11 e large jacket platform in 1994 at which point the suction type bucket foundation came into being bye et al 1995 since its first installation in 2002 in denmark houlsby et al 2005 which featured a diameter of 16 m and a height of 6 m was successfully the number of bucket foundations has grown considerably during installation large equipment are required to level the bucket foundation which brings some inconvenience to the construction to solve problems related to the installation of bucket foundations tianjin university proposed a new type of bucket foundation with bulkheads bfb in this structure seven rooms are divided inside the bucket by bulkheads and a skirt six peripheral rooms have the same proportions while the seventh room which is located in the middle is slightly larger see fig 1 c with this structure leveling the bucket foundation can be achieved by applying the suction positive pressure to different compartments zhang et al 2015a 2016a 2016b moreover the bfb presents reasonable motion characteristics and towing reliability during the wet tow construction process ding et al 2013 zhang et al 2013a 2013b 2015b in 2010 the first composite bfb for offshore wind turbines was successfully installed at the offshore test facility in qidong city china as shown in fig 1 a in 2016 a second bfb was also installed in xiangshui city china see fig 1 b these developments reveal that the application of bfbs has become an important endeavor in china the suction penetration process is a key consideration during the installation of bucket foundations keeping the suction within a reasonable range is extremely important on one hand excess suction will cause soil plug in the bucket resulting in the suspension of penetration tran et al 2005 on the other hand insufficient suction cannot maintain continuous bucket penetration thus evaluating the penetration resistance of the bucket foundation before installation is necessary because the penetration mechanism of bucket foundations in clay is simple the predicted value of the construction suction is relatively accurate houlsby and byrne 2005 however calculating the penetration resistance in sand is difficult because of the seepage effect caused by suction seepage flow could reduce or enhance the effective stress in the surrounding soil and change both the wall friction and tip resistance bye et al 1995 erbrich and tjelta 1999 tjelta 1994 1995 several related works employing experiments and numerical simulations have been performed lian et al 2014 mehravar et al 2015 tran and randolph 2008 researches showed that seepage can significantly reduce the inner friction of the bucket wall and the tip resistance the methods to calculate the penetration resistance of bucket foundations have also been proposed considering the seepage effect guo et al 2016 harireche et al 2014 houlsby and byrbe 2005 senders and randolph 2009 the approach proposed by houlsby and byrbe 2005 is based on the bearing capacity theory with friction angle senders and randolph 2009 proposed a cpt based approach for penetration resistance in which resistance reduction factors used the ratio of current to critical suction as input value in addition during the process of bucket installation in sand suction should be controlled to avoid the formation of piping channels which would prevent further penetration and may cause the failure of the penetration installation achmus and schröder 2014 feld 2001 ibsen and thilsted 2011 whereas many studies have been published about bucket foundations bfbs have received relatively little attention especially as regards methods to calculate their penetration resistance the effect of seepage on the penetration resistance of bfbs particularly the resistance of the internal skirt and bulkheads remains unclear in this paper a series of experiments and numerical simulations are applied to study the seepage field and penetration resistance of a bfb during the suction installation in sand and try to reveal the effect of seepage on the penetration resistance of the bfb the calculations of penetration resistance in this paper are based on the bearing capacity theory with friction angle the approach that the resistance reduction factors use the ratio of current to critical suction as input value achmus and schröder 2014 feld 2001 senders and randolph 2009 is not used in this paper this is because the critical suction of bfb is complicated the exit gradient adjacent to the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads is most prone to piping but the exact location where the earliest piping occurs is unknown moreover there is no suitable formula for calculating the critical suction of bfb currently in the first part of this study experiments are conducted to study the variation of the penetration resistance of bfb with the penetration depth during the suction installation in sand the test values of penetration resistance are compared with the calculated ones under no seepage flow results show that the two sets of data are obviously different seepage clearly causes difficulties when predicting the penetration resistance of bfbs in the second part of this study the seepage field during suction installation is revealed the effect of pore water seepage on the soil resistance to bfb penetration is studied and a method to calculate the penetration resistance considering the seepage effect is also proposed finally the proposed method is verified and the distribution of the penetration resistance of bfb model is analyzed 2 effect of seepage on the bfb penetration resistance during suction installation 2 1 test model the bfb model consisted of a bucket lid a bucket wall an internal skirt and six bulkheads in this way the bucket was divided into seven rooms as shown in fig 2 a the middle compartment featured two holes on its lid one was connected to a vacuum pump through a pipeline and the other was linked to a piezometer to measure the suction pressure within the bucket each side compartment also included two holes on their lids one was connected to a vacuum pump and the other was a spare hole that was kept closed during the penetration process the material of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads was steel and the lid was made of polymethyl methacrylate the test model measured 0 3 m in outside diameter and 0 12 m in height the middle compartment had an outer diameter of 0 15 m d mo and the side compartment had an outer diameter of 0 075 m d so the wall internal skirt and bulkheads had the same thickness t as shown in fig 2 b the dimensions of the bfb model are listed in table 1 2 2 soil preparation the soil used in the test was sand obtained from an excavation site near the bohai sea in tianjin china the particle size distribution curve of the soil is shown in fig 3 which reveals that the sand is mainly composed of medium and coarse sand the grain size of the medium sand was in the range of 0 25 0 5 mm and that of coarse sand was larger than 0 5 mm the installation tests on the model bucket were carried out in a soil container fig 4 the length width and height of the container were 1 2 0 6 and 0 8 m respectively to speed up the drainage process of sand in the container the gravel gauze element and geotextile were arranged layer by layer in an upward direction from the bottom of the container the dry sand was first uniformly placed in the container layer by layer at a thickness of 0 1 m and water supply and drainage system was then used to saturate the sand a vibrating rod was used to vibrate the sand bed sufficiently to release the gas therein after which the sand bed was left for static settlement for 30 days the final height of sand bed was 0 5 m and the water layer on the mudline was 0 12 m the properties of the soil used for the model tests are shown in table 2 2 3 test procedures and apparatus the tests were carried out in the same way as they are normally conducted in the field this process typically consisted of two phases a self weight installation followed by suction installation during phase i the bfb penetrated into the soil using its own weight and any additional surcharge as the driving force once the bfb settles down under its weight the suction installation phase was initiated by pumping water out of the bucket compartment in phase ii suction was applied in several steps and the applied suction increased step by step the pumping valves were opened at the beginning and closed at the end of each step during each step the suction remained at a steady value this installation method is beneficial to suppress the development of soil heave by releasing the suction inside the bucket at intervals during the suction penetration process guo et al 2012 in the tests on suction penetration a suction sensor was fixed to the lid of the middle compartment to record the suction within the bucket see fig 2 a and the displacement of the bucket penetration process was measured by a displacement transducer measurement range of the suction sensor and displacement transducer are 0 50 kpa and 0 600 mm respectively and measuring accuracy of them are 0 05 kpa and 1 2 mm respectively the complete test device is shown in fig 4 the suction pressure regulation system ensured the stability of the suction pressure applied at each phase and the water circulation device ensured that the water level in the container remained constant several tests were carried out under the same test conditions to ensure the reliability of test results two of them were taken as examples as named as test a and test b 2 4 test results fig 5 shows the suction pressure and displacement obtained from test a and test b when the bucket penetrated into sand by suction the curves do not include the self weight installation process test a is used to illustrate the penetration process in test a the bucket penetrated the soil 1 78 cm 3 50 cm 0 93 cm and 0 56 cm according to the corresponding step of suction as shown in fig 5 a at the beginning of each step the pumping valves on the bucket lid were opened and then suction was applied inside the bucket pressure inside the bucket was decreased to a negative value and the bucket penetrated to a certain depth at the corresponding step of suction at the end of each step the pumping valves on the bucket lid were closed and the suction reversed to zero the applied suction increased in a step wise manner at the end of step 4 the suction installation was complete tests a and b were carried out in the same test conditions by the same installation method for comparison with the calculated results of formula in section 4 the penetration force f test can be obtained from the tests by the equilibrium equation as follow 1 f test w 0 25 s π d i 2 note that while suction is generally negative the suction pressure s in eq 1 is positive according to andersen et al 2008 the following method can be used to calculate the bucket penetration resistance r total in sand under no pore water flow the total penetration resistance is the sum of the tip resistance q tip and the side friction q side 2 r total q tip q side q tip a tip f s av a side 3 f s a v 0 5 γ hk tan δ 4 q t i p 0 5 γ t n γ q n q 5 n q e π tan φ tan 2 45 φ 2 6 n γ 1 5 n q 1 tan φ where k tan δ is defined as 0 84 api 2000 an discussion about the value of k tan δ is elaborated in section 5 fig 6 shows the calculated penetration resistance r total by using eq 2 and f test measured from the tests on a dimensionless scale since t is very small relative to d d d i d o 0 3 m as can be seen from the figure the penetration force measured in tests a and b is significantly smaller than the calculated suction pressure mainly because the seepage changes the vertical stress of soil and therefore the soil resistance acting on the bucket wall and bucket tip changes as the penetration depths increase the reduction in resistance due to seepage flow also increases although the effect of seepage on the total resistance can be determined from the experiments how seepage affects the penetration resistance of the bucket wall skirt and bulkheads is still not clear therefore a numerical simulation is used to study the seepage field during the suction installation and reveal the impact of seepage on the penetration resistance of each part of the bfb 3 numerical simulation of the seepage field during suction installation the predictions of penetration resistance are difficult to make because of the influence of seepage caused by suction therefore the seepage field during foundation penetration is first analyzed after which the distribution of excess pore water pressure around the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads is studied extensively 3 1 seepage formula and its numerical implementation pore water flow is assumed to obey darcy s law the penetration speed of the bfb is slow in tests a and b if suction is maintained for a sufficient length of time the resulting seepage tends to achieve a steady state given the boundary conditions the seepage field can be obtained by the laplace equation 2 h w 0 where h w is the total head for a homogeneous soil laplace equation is shown as below 7 2 h w 2 h w x 2 2 h w y 2 2 h w z 2 0 the above process is realized by seepage analysis using the finite element software adina adina 2003 in this analysis a porous media material is used in the soil the basic assumption for the porous media is that the fluid is considered incompressible and the pore medium is in a saturated state moreover porous fluid flow conforms to darcy s law the three dimensional finite element model consists of two parts the homogeneous sandy seabed which presents the same parameters as the test soil and the bfb which features the same size as the test model as shown in fig 7 a soil is modeled as a porous dielectric material because finite element analysis focuses on the characteristic of seepage field soil permeability and density are mainly considered in the model the permeability coefficient k of the soil is 0 021 cm s 1 the unit weight is 20 kn m 3 the internal friction angle is 35 the bfb is made of steel so it is considered to be an impermeable material density of the bucket is 7800 kg m 3 with young s modulus of 2 1 1011 pa the seven rooms inside the bucket are named as rooms 1 7 see fig 7 b the model is established under three dimensional coordinates x y z and the z axis is considered the height direction of the bfb fig 7 c shows the xy plane of the bucket soil system in which planes oadc and fehg refer to the soil in the bfb and plane ablkij refers to the soil outside the bfb in previous studies the continuous penetration of bucket foundation model is divided into a series of discrete steady states to simplify simulations guo et al 2016 harireche et al 2014 houlsby and byrbe 2005 in this study the suction installation process is simulated for different scaled penetration depths i e h 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 the bfb penetration speed is very slow at each penetration depth the penetration resistance is assumed to be equal to the downward driving force thus steady state seepage is assumed at each penetration stage at a certain stage during the bfb installation process a penetration depth h is reached as a constant suction s is applied to the oc and fg boundaries fig 7 c the ambient sea water pressure on boundary ik is equal to zero the bfb is considered to be an impermeable material thus as the bucket penetrates the seabed the radial flow of pore water across the bfb is prevented so the boundaries cd ef gh and ij are set to be impermeable bl and kl are set as permeable boundary conditions which are located far from the suction area by a sensitivity study of mesh density element edge length of 0 02 m is selected the total mesh number of whole model is 936567 the meshing type is free form and each element has four nodes to draw conclusions that will not affected by the size of the prototype we normalize the main problem variables as follows 8 p p s when suction is applied to the mud surface inside the bfb the excess pore pressure in the bfb is negative the coordinates and penetration depth are dimensionless as follows 9 x x d y y d z z d h h d 3 2 characteristics of seepage flow around the bucket foundation with bulkheads the water seepage caused by suction produces a hydraulic gradient that varies with depth and this gradient produces an excess pore water pressure in soil fig 8 shows the distribution of normalized excess pore pressures caused by suction when the scaled penetration depth h is 0 2 the distribution of excess pore pressures on both sides of the bucket wall and internal skirt can be observed clearly by magnifying the oblk plane the equipotential lines at the bucket tip are close to each other which means that great hydraulic gradients or seepage forces occur at this position to study the effect of seepage on the penetration resistance of the bfb the distribution of excess pore water pressures on both sides of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads is analyzed in detail first the distributions of normalized excess pore pressure along the depth of both sides of bucket wall and internal skirt are studied as illustrated in fig 9 the excess pore pressure along both sides of the bucket wall and internal skirt are denoted as p ij p g h p f e and p c d respectively from the mud surface to the embedded bucket tip the normalized excess pore pressure p ij changes from 0 to 0 282 p g h from 1 to 0 359 p f e from 1 to 0 601 and p c d from 1 to 0 611 all of these variations are nearly linear as the bucket continuously penetrate the soil the seepage field around the bfb changes accordingly the distribution of the normalized excess pore pressure along the bucket wall and internal skirt at different normalized penetration depths h 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 are plotted in fig 10 a and b in fig 10 a the values of p ij and p g h are obviously different by comparison p f e and p c d show very close values during penetration in fig 10 b p j p h p e and p d denote the normalized excess pore pressures at points j h e and d respectively see fig 9 as the penetration depth increases p j changes from 0 329 to 0 213 p h from 0 441 to 0 262 p e from 0 707 to 0 427 and p d from 0 764 to 0 436 to prepare for the subsequent calculations of penetration resistance the values of p j p h p e and p d at different penetration depths are given in table 3 second the distribution of excess pore water pressures around the bulkheads is analyzed fig 11 shows the distribution of the normalized excess pore pressure in the soil next to the bulkhead plane mpqn represents the soil next to the bulkhead here the distribution of excess pore water pressures along the radial portion of the bulkhead differs the normalized excess pore pressure at point q near the bucket wall is 0 33 and the normalized excess pore pressure at point p near the internal skirt is 0 59 s the midpoint of points p and q presents a normalized excess pore pressure of 0 53 r is the midpoint of points m and n p q p s and p p are the normalized excess pore pressures of points q s and p respectively and their values at different penetration depths are given in table 4 4 method for estimating the effect of seepage on penetration resistance of the bfb although the reductions in the penetration resistance of bucket foundations are known to be due to the water seepage caused by suction and seepage reduces the effective stresses of soil inside the bucket accurate quantitative treatment is difficult because of the complexity of stress state the existing models are generally based on the estimates of the changes in vertical effective stress adjacent to the bucket skirt thus the estimates of changes in friction and tip resistance senders and randolph 2009 in this study the method based on the estimates of the changes in vertical effective stress is used to calculate the reduction in penetration resistance of the bfb to reveal the proportions of the penetration resistance of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads to the total resistance and obtain the reduction in the penetration resistance of each part during the suction installation process the penetration resistance of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads contributes to the total penetration resistance the effects of seepage on the resistance of each part will be discussed in the following study 4 1 seepage effect on the soil resistance of bucket wall when there is no seepage flow and a bfb penetrates into the seabed without causing significant disturbance to the soil the effective stress of the soil is σ γ z the suction loss l is expressed as 10 l j p j 11 l h 1 p h where l j and l h denote the suction loss at points j and h respectively suction loss can be calculated according to the normalized excess pore pressure as listed in table 3 to simplify the calculation variations in excess pore pressures along the bucket wall are assumed to be nearly linear houlsby and byrbe 2005 the analysis shown in fig 9 is similar to that in previous studies adopting a linear assumption will simplify the expression of suction loss along the bucket wall as follows 12 l i j l j h z 13 l g h l h h z where l i j and l g h denote the respective suction losses along the interior and exterior of the bucket wall the seepage caused by suction will increase the effective stress of the soil outside the bucket wall while reduce the effective stress of soil inside the bucket wall houlsby and byrbe 2005 considering the seepage effect the effective pressure of the soil at depth z outside and inside the bucket wall may be respectively expressed as follows 14 σ i j γ z l j h z s 15 σ g h γ z l h h z s moreover the interface friction of bucket wall q side wall can be expressed as in eq 16 using the effective stress under seepage conditions expressed in eqs 14 and 15 eq 16 can be rewritten as in eq 17 16 q side wall 0 h σ i j d z k tan δ π d o 0 h σ g h d z k tan δ π d i 17 q side wall 0 h γ l j h s z d z k tan δ π d o 0 h γ l h h s z d z k tan δ π d i since t is very small relative to d d i d o d the interface friction of the bucket wall can be expressed as follows 18 q side wall 0 h 2 γ l j l h h s z d z k tan δ π d γ h 2 l h l j s h 2 k tan δ π d the reduction in the frictional resistance of the bucket wall can be calculated as follows 19 δ r side wall l h l j s h 2 k tan δ π d during the suction penetration process it is generally assumed that the internal soil effective stress is reduced sufficiently so that the failure mechanism involves movement of soil entirely inwards houlsby and byrbe 2005 so seepage also results in a decrease in the vertical effective stress at the tip of the bucket resulting in further reductions in the total resistance a further assumption is that the effective stress of soil decreases linearly along the skirt thickness under the suction effect the resistance at the tip of bucket wall can be expressed as 20 q tip wall 0 5 γ j h t n γ q j h n q a tip wall where q tip wall and a tip wall denote the tip resistance and tip area of the bucket wall respectively therefore under seepage effect the effective overburden pressure and weight of the soil beneath the bucket wall tip can be calculated as follows 21 q j h γ h 1 l j l h s 22 γ j h γ 1 l j l h s h hence the resisting force at the bucket wall tip decreases as follows 23 δ r tip wall 0 5 1 l j l h s h t n γ 1 l j l h s n q a tip wall under the influence of seepage the total penetration resistance of the bucket wall r wall can be expressed in eq 24 the total reduction caused by seepage in r wall can be expressed in eq 25 24 r wall q side wall q tip wall 25 δ r wall δ r side wall δ r tip wall 4 2 seepage effect on the soil resistance of the internal skirt the method for calculating the internal skirt friction is similar to that applied to calculate the bucket wall friction seepage caused by suction will reduce the effective stress on both sides of the internal skirt therefore both sides of the skirt friction will also decrease the friction of internal skirt q side skirt is expressed as follow 26 q side skirt 0 h σ f e d z k tan δ π d mo 0 h σ c d d z k tan δ π d mi where d mo and d mi are the outer and inner diameters of the middle compartment respectively and σ f e and σ c d are the effective soil pressures considering seepage effect these pressures are respectively expressed in eqs 27 and 28 27 σ f e γ z l e h z s 28 σ c d γ z l d h z s the suction losses at points e and d are denoted as l e and l d respectively and they are expressed as follows 29 l e 1 p e 30 l d 1 p d since t is very small relative to d mo d mo d mi d m the interface friction of internal skirt can be expressed in the following form 31 q side skirt 0 h σ f e σ c d d z k tan δ π d m γ h 2 l e l d 2 s k tan δ π d m the reduction in the frictional resistance of internal skirt can be calculated as follows 32 δ r side skirt l e l d s h 2 k tan δ π d under seepage conditions the resistance at the tip of internal skirt can be expressed as in eq 33 and the reduced resistance force at the bucket wall tip is expressed in 34 33 q tip skirt 0 5 γ d e t n γ q d e n q a tip skirt 34 δ r tip skirt 0 5 γ γ d e t n γ γ h q d e n q a tip skirt under the influence of seepage the total penetration resistance of internal skirt r skirt is expressed in eq 35 and the total reduction caused by seepage in r skirt is expressed in eq 36 35 r skirt q side skirt q tip skirt 36 δ r skirt δ r side skirt δ r tip skirt 4 3 seepage effect on the soil resistance of bulkheads by analyzing the results in section 3 3 the excess pore water pressures may be observed to vary along the radial direction of the bulkhead especially near the bulkhead tip see fig 11 to simplify the calculation excess pore water pressures at line rs are selected as average values to calculate the penetration resistance of bulkheads the method used to calculate the side friction and tip resistance of bulkheads is identical to that used to calculate the corresponding values for the internal skirt therefore the total penetration resistance of bulkheads r b h s under seepage conditions and the total reduction δ r bhs caused by seepage in r bhs can be calculated finally the total penetration resistance of bfb under seepage conditions can be calculated by 37 r total r wall r skirt r bhs the total reduction in penetration resistance caused by seepage can be calculated as follows 38 δ r total δ r wall δ r skirt δ r bhs 5 evaluation and validation of the proposed method the study in section 4 and the approach proposed by houlsby and byrbe 2005 is used to calculate the penetration resistance of the bfb model under seepage conditions and a comparison between the calculation results and the test data is shown in fig 12 it should be noted that the method proposed by houlsby and byrbe 2005 is suitable for traditional bucket foundations as to the bucket foundation with inner compartments it does not give the calculation method of penetration resistance for internal skirt and bulkheads the calculation formula for bucket wall is used to estimate the penetration resistance of the internal skirt and bulkheads the parameters used in the calculation are identical to those adopted in section 2 4 and the suction pressure s is the value applied in the tests by inverse analysis of the experiment data with the numerical simulation coefficient k tan δ is taken as 0 84 to provide a good correlation between the tests data and the calculated suction for prototype cases k is usually taken as 0 8 but for laboratory model tests in this paper the value of coefficient k is taken as 1 4 to consider the test boundary condition an increased k seems reasonable as the radial wall of the sand bed container would limit the lateral displacements of the sand outside the bucket and cause higher lateral reaction stresses against the bucket wall during bucket penetration than in a free field situation andersen et al 2008 as seen in fig 12 the changing trends of the curves are identical the calculated suction values obtained by using method in section 4 is in good agreement with the test results while calculated values by using houlsby and byrbe 2005 method are slightly lower than the measured ones it is mostly because that the approach proposed by houlsby and byrbe 2005 does not directly consider the contribution of internal skirt and bulkheads the calculation method for bucket wall is used to estimate the penetration resistance of internal skirt and bulkheads so the calculation result has some deviation from the tests data in the suction installation tests the contributions of the resistance of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads to the total resistance differ fig 13 shows the penetration resistance of these parts on a dimensionless scale along the penetration depth the resistance of bucket wall is significantly larger than those of the two other parts the difference in the resistances of the internal skirt and bulkheads is relativity small table 5 lists the ratios of the resistances of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads to the total resistance at different penetration depths as the penetration depth increases the proportion of bucket wall increases while those of the two other parts decrease these results show that the bucket wall resistance contributes the most to the total resistance during the bfb penetration process the total reduction in the penetration resistance for the bfb model is shown in fig 14 the ratio of the total reduction to the total resistance under no seepage flow is in the range of 0 35 0 55 and reaches a maximum value of 0 55 at the final penetration stage reductions in the penetration resistance of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads caused by seepage differ the ratios of the reductions in the resistance of these three parts to the total reduction are shown in fig 15 as the penetration depth increases changes in the trends of the proportions may be observed while the resistance of the bucket wall shows the largest reduction ratio at the beginning of penetration the reduction ratios of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads tend to become identical as the penetration depth increases 6 conclusion based on a series of experiments and numerical simulations the seepage field and penetration resistance of a bfb during suction installation in sand are studied the effect of seepage on the penetration resistance of bfb is revealed and the resistances of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads are calculated the main findings can be summarized as follows 1 during the suction installation of the bfb in sand the excess pore pressure varies nearly linearly along the depth of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads the excess pore pressures on both sides of the internal skirt and bulkheads are nearly identical but they differ obviously on both sides of the bucket wall 2 the seepage caused by suction increases the effective soil stress outside the bucket wall and reduces the effective soil stress inside the bucket wall it also causes the effective soil stress on both sides of the internal skirt and bulkheads to decrease in general seepage reduces the penetration resistance of the bfb significantly 3 a calculation method is proposed to determine the penetration resistance of a bfb under seepage conditions the penetration resistances of bfb calculated by the proposed method are slightly smaller than the test values obtained likely because the premise of the calculation is to assume that seepage reaches a steady state 4 the analysis of the penetration resistance distribution is carried out for the test model the soil resistance of bucket wall is significantly larger than those of the internal skirt and bulkheads with the increasing penetration depth the proportion of the bucket wall s penetration resistance also increases reaching 71 at the final penetration stage the ratio of the reduced resistance to the total resistance reaches a maximum value of 0 55 at the final penetration stage at the beginning of suction installation the ratio of the reduction in resistance of the bucket wall to the total reduction is 59 at the final stage of the penetration process the reductions in the resistances of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads are nearly identical acknowledgment the authors would like to acknowledge the

23445,a bucket foundation with bulkheads bfb is a new form of offshore foundation that is divided into seven compartments by an internal skirt and bulkheads suction penetration is an important process during the installation of bfbs however little attention has been paid to the effect of seepage on the penetration resistance of bfbs in sand in this paper a series of experiments and numerical simulations are performed to study the seepage field and the effect of seepage on the penetration resistance of a bfb during suction installation in sand moreover a method of calculating the penetration resistance of bfbs is proposed considering the seepage effect and the penetration resistance distribution of the bfb test model is analyzed the analysis results show that seepage obviously reduces the penetration resistance of bfbs and the ratio of reductions in resistance to the total resistance reaches a maximum value of 0 55 at the final penetration stage in addition the soil

and renewable energy source wind energy is gradually attracting attention worldwide as offshore wind farms present the advantages of saving land resources high wind speed and minimal influence on the surrounding environment offshore wind power has become a tendency in the wind power development china has a rich offshore wind energy resource of over1 billion kw and its total offshore wind power resources is about 750 million kw a large number of foundation types for offshore wind turbines have been studied in recent years the foundation structures mainly include pile foundation gravity foundation jacket foundation and floating foundation byrne and houslby 2003 liu et al 2015b as a new foundation form bucket foundations present the advantages of economic feasibility and environment friendly work principles houlsby and byrne 2000 liu et al 2015a the norwegian geotechnical institute studied the europipe 16 11 e large jacket platform in 1994 at which point the suction type bucket foundation came into being bye et al 1995 since its first installation in 2002 in denmark houlsby et al 2005 which featured a diameter of 16 m and a height of 6 m was successfully the number of bucket foundations has grown considerably during installation large equipment are required to level the bucket foundation which brings some inconvenience to the construction to solve problems related to the installation of bucket foundations tianjin university proposed a new type of bucket foundation with bulkheads bfb in this structure seven rooms are divided inside the bucket by bulkheads and a skirt six peripheral rooms have the same proportions while the seventh room which is located in the middle is slightly larger see fig 1 c with this structure leveling the bucket foundation can be achieved by applying the suction positive pressure to different compartments zhang et al 2015a 2016a 2016b moreover the bfb presents reasonable motion characteristics and towing reliability during the wet tow construction process ding et al 2013 zhang et al 2013a 2013b 2015b in 2010 the first composite bfb for offshore wind turbines was successfully installed at the offshore test facility in qidong city china as shown in fig 1 a in 2016 a second bfb was also installed in xiangshui city china see fig 1 b these developments reveal that the application of bfbs has become an important endeavor in china the suction penetration process is a key consideration during the installation of bucket foundations keeping the suction within a reasonable range is extremely important on one hand excess suction will cause soil plug in the bucket resulting in the suspension of penetration tran et al 2005 on the other hand insufficient suction cannot maintain continuous bucket penetration thus evaluating the penetration resistance of the bucket foundation before installation is necessary because the penetration mechanism of bucket foundations in clay is simple the predicted value of the construction suction is relatively accurate houlsby and byrne 2005 however calculating the penetration resistance in sand is difficult because of the seepage effect caused by suction seepage flow could reduce or enhance the effective stress in the surrounding soil and change both the wall friction and tip resistance bye et al 1995 erbrich and tjelta 1999 tjelta 1994 1995 several related works employing experiments and numerical simulations have been performed lian et al 2014 mehravar et al 2015 tran and randolph 2008 researches showed that seepage can significantly reduce the inner friction of the bucket wall and the tip resistance the methods to calculate the penetration resistance of bucket foundations have also been proposed considering the seepage effect guo et al 2016 harireche et al 2014 houlsby and byrbe 2005 senders and randolph 2009 the approach proposed by houlsby and byrbe 2005 is based on the bearing capacity theory with friction angle senders and randolph 2009 proposed a cpt based approach for penetration resistance in which resistance reduction factors used the ratio of current to critical suction as input value in addition during the process of bucket installation in sand suction should be controlled to avoid the formation of piping channels which would prevent further penetration and may cause the failure of the penetration installation achmus and schröder 2014 feld 2001 ibsen and thilsted 2011 whereas many studies have been published about bucket foundations bfbs have received relatively little attention especially as regards methods to calculate their penetration resistance the effect of seepage on the penetration resistance of bfbs particularly the resistance of the internal skirt and bulkheads remains unclear in this paper a series of experiments and numerical simulations are applied to study the seepage field and penetration resistance of a bfb during the suction installation in sand and try to reveal the effect of seepage on the penetration resistance of the bfb the calculations of penetration resistance in this paper are based on the bearing capacity theory with friction angle the approach that the resistance reduction factors use the ratio of current to critical suction as input value achmus and schröder 2014 feld 2001 senders and randolph 2009 is not used in this paper this is because the critical suction of bfb is complicated the exit gradient adjacent to the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads is most prone to piping but the exact location where the earliest piping occurs is unknown moreover there is no suitable formula for calculating the critical suction of bfb currently in the first part of this study experiments are conducted to study the variation of the penetration resistance of bfb with the penetration depth during the suction installation in sand the test values of penetration resistance are compared with the calculated ones under no seepage flow results show that the two sets of data are obviously different seepage clearly causes difficulties when predicting the penetration resistance of bfbs in the second part of this study the seepage field during suction installation is revealed the effect of pore water seepage on the soil resistance to bfb penetration is studied and a method to calculate the penetration resistance considering the seepage effect is also proposed finally the proposed method is verified and the distribution of the penetration resistance of bfb model is analyzed 2 effect of seepage on the bfb penetration resistance during suction installation 2 1 test model the bfb model consisted of a bucket lid a bucket wall an internal skirt and six bulkheads in this way the bucket was divided into seven rooms as shown in fig 2 a the middle compartment featured two holes on its lid one was connected to a vacuum pump through a pipeline and the other was linked to a piezometer to measure the suction pressure within the bucket each side compartment also included two holes on their lids one was connected to a vacuum pump and the other was a spare hole that was kept closed during the penetration process the material of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads was steel and the lid was made of polymethyl methacrylate the test model measured 0 3 m in outside diameter and 0 12 m in height the middle compartment had an outer diameter of 0 15 m d mo and the side compartment had an outer diameter of 0 075 m d so the wall internal skirt and bulkheads had the same thickness t as shown in fig 2 b the dimensions of the bfb model are listed in table 1 2 2 soil preparation the soil used in the test was sand obtained from an excavation site near the bohai sea in tianjin china the particle size distribution curve of the soil is shown in fig 3 which reveals that the sand is mainly composed of medium and coarse sand the grain size of the medium sand was in the range of 0 25 0 5 mm and that of coarse sand was larger than 0 5 mm the installation tests on the model bucket were carried out in a soil container fig 4 the length width and height of the container were 1 2 0 6 and 0 8 m respectively to speed up the drainage process of sand in the container the gravel gauze element and geotextile were arranged layer by layer in an upward direction from the bottom of the container the dry sand was first uniformly placed in the container layer by layer at a thickness of 0 1 m and water supply and drainage system was then used to saturate the sand a vibrating rod was used to vibrate the sand bed sufficiently to release the gas therein after which the sand bed was left for static settlement for 30 days the final height of sand bed was 0 5 m and the water layer on the mudline was 0 12 m the properties of the soil used for the model tests are shown in table 2 2 3 test procedures and apparatus the tests were carried out in the same way as they are normally conducted in the field this process typically consisted of two phases a self weight installation followed by suction installation during phase i the bfb penetrated into the soil using its own weight and any additional surcharge as the driving force once the bfb settles down under its weight the suction installation phase was initiated by pumping water out of the bucket compartment in phase ii suction was applied in several steps and the applied suction increased step by step the pumping valves were opened at the beginning and closed at the end of each step during each step the suction remained at a steady value this installation method is beneficial to suppress the development of soil heave by releasing the suction inside the bucket at intervals during the suction penetration process guo et al 2012 in the tests on suction penetration a suction sensor was fixed to the lid of the middle compartment to record the suction within the bucket see fig 2 a and the displacement of the bucket penetration process was measured by a displacement transducer measurement range of the suction sensor and displacement transducer are 0 50 kpa and 0 600 mm respectively and measuring accuracy of them are 0 05 kpa and 1 2 mm respectively the complete test device is shown in fig 4 the suction pressure regulation system ensured the stability of the suction pressure applied at each phase and the water circulation device ensured that the water level in the container remained constant several tests were carried out under the same test conditions to ensure the reliability of test results two of them were taken as examples as named as test a and test b 2 4 test results fig 5 shows the suction pressure and displacement obtained from test a and test b when the bucket penetrated into sand by suction the curves do not include the self weight installation process test a is used to illustrate the penetration process in test a the bucket penetrated the soil 1 78 cm 3 50 cm 0 93 cm and 0 56 cm according to the corresponding step of suction as shown in fig 5 a at the beginning of each step the pumping valves on the bucket lid were opened and then suction was applied inside the bucket pressure inside the bucket was decreased to a negative value and the bucket penetrated to a certain depth at the corresponding step of suction at the end of each step the pumping valves on the bucket lid were closed and the suction reversed to zero the applied suction increased in a step wise manner at the end of step 4 the suction installation was complete tests a and b were carried out in the same test conditions by the same installation method for comparison with the calculated results of formula in section 4 the penetration force f test can be obtained from the tests by the equilibrium equation as follow 1 f test w 0 25 s π d i 2 note that while suction is generally negative the suction pressure s in eq 1 is positive according to andersen et al 2008 the following method can be used to calculate the bucket penetration resistance r total in sand under no pore water flow the total penetration resistance is the sum of the tip resistance q tip and the side friction q side 2 r total q tip q side q tip a tip f s av a side 3 f s a v 0 5 γ hk tan δ 4 q t i p 0 5 γ t n γ q n q 5 n q e π tan φ tan 2 45 φ 2 6 n γ 1 5 n q 1 tan φ where k tan δ is defined as 0 84 api 2000 an discussion about the value of k tan δ is elaborated in section 5 fig 6 shows the calculated penetration resistance r total by using eq 2 and f test measured from the tests on a dimensionless scale since t is very small relative to d d d i d o 0 3 m as can be seen from the figure the penetration force measured in tests a and b is significantly smaller than the calculated suction pressure mainly because the seepage changes the vertical stress of soil and therefore the soil resistance acting on the bucket wall and bucket tip changes as the penetration depths increase the reduction in resistance due to seepage flow also increases although the effect of seepage on the total resistance can be determined from the experiments how seepage affects the penetration resistance of the bucket wall skirt and bulkheads is still not clear therefore a numerical simulation is used to study the seepage field during the suction installation and reveal the impact of seepage on the penetration resistance of each part of the bfb 3 numerical simulation of the seepage field during suction installation the predictions of penetration resistance are difficult to make because of the influence of seepage caused by suction therefore the seepage field during foundation penetration is first analyzed after which the distribution of excess pore water pressure around the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads is studied extensively 3 1 seepage formula and its numerical implementation pore water flow is assumed to obey darcy s law the penetration speed of the bfb is slow in tests a and b if suction is maintained for a sufficient length of time the resulting seepage tends to achieve a steady state given the boundary conditions the seepage field can be obtained by the laplace equation 2 h w 0 where h w is the total head for a homogeneous soil laplace equation is shown as below 7 2 h w 2 h w x 2 2 h w y 2 2 h w z 2 0 the above process is realized by seepage analysis using the finite element software adina adina 2003 in this analysis a porous media material is used in the soil the basic assumption for the porous media is that the fluid is considered incompressible and the pore medium is in a saturated state moreover porous fluid flow conforms to darcy s law the three dimensional finite element model consists of two parts the homogeneous sandy seabed which presents the same parameters as the test soil and the bfb which features the same size as the test model as shown in fig 7 a soil is modeled as a porous dielectric material because finite element analysis focuses on the characteristic of seepage field soil permeability and density are mainly considered in the model the permeability coefficient k of the soil is 0 021 cm s 1 the unit weight is 20 kn m 3 the internal friction angle is 35 the bfb is made of steel so it is considered to be an impermeable material density of the bucket is 7800 kg m 3 with young s modulus of 2 1 1011 pa the seven rooms inside the bucket are named as rooms 1 7 see fig 7 b the model is established under three dimensional coordinates x y z and the z axis is considered the height direction of the bfb fig 7 c shows the xy plane of the bucket soil system in which planes oadc and fehg refer to the soil in the bfb and plane ablkij refers to the soil outside the bfb in previous studies the continuous penetration of bucket foundation model is divided into a series of discrete steady states to simplify simulations guo et al 2016 harireche et al 2014 houlsby and byrbe 2005 in this study the suction installation process is simulated for different scaled penetration depths i e h 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 the bfb penetration speed is very slow at each penetration depth the penetration resistance is assumed to be equal to the downward driving force thus steady state seepage is assumed at each penetration stage at a certain stage during the bfb installation process a penetration depth h is reached as a constant suction s is applied to the oc and fg boundaries fig 7 c the ambient sea water pressure on boundary ik is equal to zero the bfb is considered to be an impermeable material thus as the bucket penetrates the seabed the radial flow of pore water across the bfb is prevented so the boundaries cd ef gh and ij are set to be impermeable bl and kl are set as permeable boundary conditions which are located far from the suction area by a sensitivity study of mesh density element edge length of 0 02 m is selected the total mesh number of whole model is 936567 the meshing type is free form and each element has four nodes to draw conclusions that will not affected by the size of the prototype we normalize the main problem variables as follows 8 p p s when suction is applied to the mud surface inside the bfb the excess pore pressure in the bfb is negative the coordinates and penetration depth are dimensionless as follows 9 x x d y y d z z d h h d 3 2 characteristics of seepage flow around the bucket foundation with bulkheads the water seepage caused by suction produces a hydraulic gradient that varies with depth and this gradient produces an excess pore water pressure in soil fig 8 shows the distribution of normalized excess pore pressures caused by suction when the scaled penetration depth h is 0 2 the distribution of excess pore pressures on both sides of the bucket wall and internal skirt can be observed clearly by magnifying the oblk plane the equipotential lines at the bucket tip are close to each other which means that great hydraulic gradients or seepage forces occur at this position to study the effect of seepage on the penetration resistance of the bfb the distribution of excess pore water pressures on both sides of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads is analyzed in detail first the distributions of normalized excess pore pressure along the depth of both sides of bucket wall and internal skirt are studied as illustrated in fig 9 the excess pore pressure along both sides of the bucket wall and internal skirt are denoted as p ij p g h p f e and p c d respectively from the mud surface to the embedded bucket tip the normalized excess pore pressure p ij changes from 0 to 0 282 p g h from 1 to 0 359 p f e from 1 to 0 601 and p c d from 1 to 0 611 all of these variations are nearly linear as the bucket continuously penetrate the soil the seepage field around the bfb changes accordingly the distribution of the normalized excess pore pressure along the bucket wall and internal skirt at different normalized penetration depths h 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 are plotted in fig 10 a and b in fig 10 a the values of p ij and p g h are obviously different by comparison p f e and p c d show very close values during penetration in fig 10 b p j p h p e and p d denote the normalized excess pore pressures at points j h e and d respectively see fig 9 as the penetration depth increases p j changes from 0 329 to 0 213 p h from 0 441 to 0 262 p e from 0 707 to 0 427 and p d from 0 764 to 0 436 to prepare for the subsequent calculations of penetration resistance the values of p j p h p e and p d at different penetration depths are given in table 3 second the distribution of excess pore water pressures around the bulkheads is analyzed fig 11 shows the distribution of the normalized excess pore pressure in the soil next to the bulkhead plane mpqn represents the soil next to the bulkhead here the distribution of excess pore water pressures along the radial portion of the bulkhead differs the normalized excess pore pressure at point q near the bucket wall is 0 33 and the normalized excess pore pressure at point p near the internal skirt is 0 59 s the midpoint of points p and q presents a normalized excess pore pressure of 0 53 r is the midpoint of points m and n p q p s and p p are the normalized excess pore pressures of points q s and p respectively and their values at different penetration depths are given in table 4 4 method for estimating the effect of seepage on penetration resistance of the bfb although the reductions in the penetration resistance of bucket foundations are known to be due to the water seepage caused by suction and seepage reduces the effective stresses of soil inside the bucket accurate quantitative treatment is difficult because of the complexity of stress state the existing models are generally based on the estimates of the changes in vertical effective stress adjacent to the bucket skirt thus the estimates of changes in friction and tip resistance senders and randolph 2009 in this study the method based on the estimates of the changes in vertical effective stress is used to calculate the reduction in penetration resistance of the bfb to reveal the proportions of the penetration resistance of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads to the total resistance and obtain the reduction in the penetration resistance of each part during the suction installation process the penetration resistance of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads contributes to the total penetration resistance the effects of seepage on the resistance of each part will be discussed in the following study 4 1 seepage effect on the soil resistance of bucket wall when there is no seepage flow and a bfb penetrates into the seabed without causing significant disturbance to the soil the effective stress of the soil is σ γ z the suction loss l is expressed as 10 l j p j 11 l h 1 p h where l j and l h denote the suction loss at points j and h respectively suction loss can be calculated according to the normalized excess pore pressure as listed in table 3 to simplify the calculation variations in excess pore pressures along the bucket wall are assumed to be nearly linear houlsby and byrbe 2005 the analysis shown in fig 9 is similar to that in previous studies adopting a linear assumption will simplify the expression of suction loss along the bucket wall as follows 12 l i j l j h z 13 l g h l h h z where l i j and l g h denote the respective suction losses along the interior and exterior of the bucket wall the seepage caused by suction will increase the effective stress of the soil outside the bucket wall while reduce the effective stress of soil inside the bucket wall houlsby and byrbe 2005 considering the seepage effect the effective pressure of the soil at depth z outside and inside the bucket wall may be respectively expressed as follows 14 σ i j γ z l j h z s 15 σ g h γ z l h h z s moreover the interface friction of bucket wall q side wall can be expressed as in eq 16 using the effective stress under seepage conditions expressed in eqs 14 and 15 eq 16 can be rewritten as in eq 17 16 q side wall 0 h σ i j d z k tan δ π d o 0 h σ g h d z k tan δ π d i 17 q side wall 0 h γ l j h s z d z k tan δ π d o 0 h γ l h h s z d z k tan δ π d i since t is very small relative to d d i d o d the interface friction of the bucket wall can be expressed as follows 18 q side wall 0 h 2 γ l j l h h s z d z k tan δ π d γ h 2 l h l j s h 2 k tan δ π d the reduction in the frictional resistance of the bucket wall can be calculated as follows 19 δ r side wall l h l j s h 2 k tan δ π d during the suction penetration process it is generally assumed that the internal soil effective stress is reduced sufficiently so that the failure mechanism involves movement of soil entirely inwards houlsby and byrbe 2005 so seepage also results in a decrease in the vertical effective stress at the tip of the bucket resulting in further reductions in the total resistance a further assumption is that the effective stress of soil decreases linearly along the skirt thickness under the suction effect the resistance at the tip of bucket wall can be expressed as 20 q tip wall 0 5 γ j h t n γ q j h n q a tip wall where q tip wall and a tip wall denote the tip resistance and tip area of the bucket wall respectively therefore under seepage effect the effective overburden pressure and weight of the soil beneath the bucket wall tip can be calculated as follows 21 q j h γ h 1 l j l h s 22 γ j h γ 1 l j l h s h hence the resisting force at the bucket wall tip decreases as follows 23 δ r tip wall 0 5 1 l j l h s h t n γ 1 l j l h s n q a tip wall under the influence of seepage the total penetration resistance of the bucket wall r wall can be expressed in eq 24 the total reduction caused by seepage in r wall can be expressed in eq 25 24 r wall q side wall q tip wall 25 δ r wall δ r side wall δ r tip wall 4 2 seepage effect on the soil resistance of the internal skirt the method for calculating the internal skirt friction is similar to that applied to calculate the bucket wall friction seepage caused by suction will reduce the effective stress on both sides of the internal skirt therefore both sides of the skirt friction will also decrease the friction of internal skirt q side skirt is expressed as follow 26 q side skirt 0 h σ f e d z k tan δ π d mo 0 h σ c d d z k tan δ π d mi where d mo and d mi are the outer and inner diameters of the middle compartment respectively and σ f e and σ c d are the effective soil pressures considering seepage effect these pressures are respectively expressed in eqs 27 and 28 27 σ f e γ z l e h z s 28 σ c d γ z l d h z s the suction losses at points e and d are denoted as l e and l d respectively and they are expressed as follows 29 l e 1 p e 30 l d 1 p d since t is very small relative to d mo d mo d mi d m the interface friction of internal skirt can be expressed in the following form 31 q side skirt 0 h σ f e σ c d d z k tan δ π d m γ h 2 l e l d 2 s k tan δ π d m the reduction in the frictional resistance of internal skirt can be calculated as follows 32 δ r side skirt l e l d s h 2 k tan δ π d under seepage conditions the resistance at the tip of internal skirt can be expressed as in eq 33 and the reduced resistance force at the bucket wall tip is expressed in 34 33 q tip skirt 0 5 γ d e t n γ q d e n q a tip skirt 34 δ r tip skirt 0 5 γ γ d e t n γ γ h q d e n q a tip skirt under the influence of seepage the total penetration resistance of internal skirt r skirt is expressed in eq 35 and the total reduction caused by seepage in r skirt is expressed in eq 36 35 r skirt q side skirt q tip skirt 36 δ r skirt δ r side skirt δ r tip skirt 4 3 seepage effect on the soil resistance of bulkheads by analyzing the results in section 3 3 the excess pore water pressures may be observed to vary along the radial direction of the bulkhead especially near the bulkhead tip see fig 11 to simplify the calculation excess pore water pressures at line rs are selected as average values to calculate the penetration resistance of bulkheads the method used to calculate the side friction and tip resistance of bulkheads is identical to that used to calculate the corresponding values for the internal skirt therefore the total penetration resistance of bulkheads r b h s under seepage conditions and the total reduction δ r bhs caused by seepage in r bhs can be calculated finally the total penetration resistance of bfb under seepage conditions can be calculated by 37 r total r wall r skirt r bhs the total reduction in penetration resistance caused by seepage can be calculated as follows 38 δ r total δ r wall δ r skirt δ r bhs 5 evaluation and validation of the proposed method the study in section 4 and the approach proposed by houlsby and byrbe 2005 is used to calculate the penetration resistance of the bfb model under seepage conditions and a comparison between the calculation results and the test data is shown in fig 12 it should be noted that the method proposed by houlsby and byrbe 2005 is suitable for traditional bucket foundations as to the bucket foundation with inner compartments it does not give the calculation method of penetration resistance for internal skirt and bulkheads the calculation formula for bucket wall is used to estimate the penetration resistance of the internal skirt and bulkheads the parameters used in the calculation are identical to those adopted in section 2 4 and the suction pressure s is the value applied in the tests by inverse analysis of the experiment data with the numerical simulation coefficient k tan δ is taken as 0 84 to provide a good correlation between the tests data and the calculated suction for prototype cases k is usually taken as 0 8 but for laboratory model tests in this paper the value of coefficient k is taken as 1 4 to consider the test boundary condition an increased k seems reasonable as the radial wall of the sand bed container would limit the lateral displacements of the sand outside the bucket and cause higher lateral reaction stresses against the bucket wall during bucket penetration than in a free field situation andersen et al 2008 as seen in fig 12 the changing trends of the curves are identical the calculated suction values obtained by using method in section 4 is in good agreement with the test results while calculated values by using houlsby and byrbe 2005 method are slightly lower than the measured ones it is mostly because that the approach proposed by houlsby and byrbe 2005 does not directly consider the contribution of internal skirt and bulkheads the calculation method for bucket wall is used to estimate the penetration resistance of internal skirt and bulkheads so the calculation result has some deviation from the tests data in the suction installation tests the contributions of the resistance of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads to the total resistance differ fig 13 shows the penetration resistance of these parts on a dimensionless scale along the penetration depth the resistance of bucket wall is significantly larger than those of the two other parts the difference in the resistances of the internal skirt and bulkheads is relativity small table 5 lists the ratios of the resistances of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads to the total resistance at different penetration depths as the penetration depth increases the proportion of bucket wall increases while those of the two other parts decrease these results show that the bucket wall resistance contributes the most to the total resistance during the bfb penetration process the total reduction in the penetration resistance for the bfb model is shown in fig 14 the ratio of the total reduction to the total resistance under no seepage flow is in the range of 0 35 0 55 and reaches a maximum value of 0 55 at the final penetration stage reductions in the penetration resistance of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads caused by seepage differ the ratios of the reductions in the resistance of these three parts to the total reduction are shown in fig 15 as the penetration depth increases changes in the trends of the proportions may be observed while the resistance of the bucket wall shows the largest reduction ratio at the beginning of penetration the reduction ratios of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads tend to become identical as the penetration depth increases 6 conclusion based on a series of experiments and numerical simulations the seepage field and penetration resistance of a bfb during suction installation in sand are studied the effect of seepage on the penetration resistance of bfb is revealed and the resistances of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads are calculated the main findings can be summarized as follows 1 during the suction installation of the bfb in sand the excess pore pressure varies nearly linearly along the depth of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads the excess pore pressures on both sides of the internal skirt and bulkheads are nearly identical but they differ obviously on both sides of the bucket wall 2 the seepage caused by suction increases the effective soil stress outside the bucket wall and reduces the effective soil stress inside the bucket wall it also causes the effective soil stress on both sides of the internal skirt and bulkheads to decrease in general seepage reduces the penetration resistance of the bfb significantly 3 a calculation method is proposed to determine the penetration resistance of a bfb under seepage conditions the penetration resistances of bfb calculated by the proposed method are slightly smaller than the test values obtained likely because the premise of the calculation is to assume that seepage reaches a steady state 4 the analysis of the penetration resistance distribution is carried out for the test model the soil resistance of bucket wall is significantly larger than those of the internal skirt and bulkheads with the increasing penetration depth the proportion of the bucket wall s penetration resistance also increases reaching 71 at the final penetration stage the ratio of the reduced resistance to the total resistance reaches a maximum value of 0 55 at the final penetration stage at the beginning of suction installation the ratio of the reduction in resistance of the bucket wall to the total reduction is 59 at the final stage of the penetration process the reductions in the resistances of the bucket wall internal skirt and bulkheads are nearly identical acknowledgment the authors would like to acknowledge the

open cruise by r v shiyan 1 the r v was from the south china sea institute of oceanology scsio chinese academy of sciences cas a polyethylene core liner was inserted in the gravity corer barrel to reduce the disturbance to the sediments upon retrieval of the gravity corer we removed the core liner and the sediment core sample it contained and then placed them in a laboratory at a constant temperature and constant pressure 23 c atmospheric pressure among the sediment sample locations station s1 was in the east sub basin of the scs water depth 4000 m near luzon island stations s2 s3 and s4 were in the northwest sub basin water depth 4100 m these three stations were surrounded by seamounts and or abyssal hills stations s4 and s5 were in the southwest sub basin of the scs water depth 4300 m 2 3 sample analysis the sound velocity vp was measured in a standard laboratory 23 c atmospheric pressure using a portable wsd 3 digital sonic instrument and the coaxial differential distance measurement method fig 2 the measurement parameters were as follows the sediment core initial length was l1 average of 50 cm the sediment measurement interval was l2 average of 25 cm and the full waveforms were digitized at frequencies of 100 khz a single channel sampling length of 4096 points and a sampling interval of 0 1 μs the acoustic transducers were in direct contact with the top of the sediment core and were coupled to the liner on the bottom by using vaseline at first all of the cores were cut into 50 cm fragments to measure the acoustic characteristics except for the core from station s1 which was measured directly due to an insufficient length then a 25 cm sample was cut from the top of the core every section of the cut needs to be measured details on the measuring procedure are described in hou et al 2015 the velocity of the sound pulse was detected via wavelet transform methods the calculation of uncertainty was performed using statistical methods and the accuracy calculation method of is as follows 1 δa s x x i x n 1 the uncertainty of the sound velocity measurements is approximately 5 m s the sub samples were collected every 25 cm using the core cutter method for physical measurements and additional samples were taken at depths of special interest the sub samples were dried in a dryer for 24 h the density of the samples can be calculated using the following formula 2 ρ w m v 3 ρ d m m l v in the above formula ρ w is the wet bulk density ρ d is the dry bulk density m is the weight of the sub sample m l is the loss of weight of the sub sample and v is the volume of the sub sample the water content could then be calculated from the loss of weight and the porosity was measured by using a pycnometer the sand silt clay components and mean grain size were measured with a particle size analyzer at the south china sea institute of oceanology chinese academy of sciences the measurement error for the particle size analysis was less than 2 the sorting coefficient was defined by the ratio of the 25 and 75 grain sizes on the cumulative particle diameter curve and was used as a reference for the sorting characteristics of the seafloor sediments the correction of the laboratory values to the seafloor values was performed by using the sound velocity ratio method hamilton 1971 the pore water velocity was reported for the standard laboratory conditions favored by hamilton 23 c 35 ppt and atmospheric pressure these conditions correspond to a water sound velocity of 1529 97 m s and a water density of 1024 kg m3 the velocity of sound in seawater depends on the seawater temperature salinity and hydrostatic pressure for calculation of the velocity of sound wilson s empirical formula offered in 1960 is of common use wilson 1960 the temperature salinity and hydrostatic pressure in the seawater was measured by a conductivity temperature depth system ctd 3 results the deep sea sediments of the central basin are thought to be mud prone however according to our analysis the sediments in the study area are mainly silty clay clayey silt silt and silty sand the sound velocity of the seawater at a depth of 4000 m is approximately 1530 m s therefore we define the high velocity province by sediment velocities greater than 1530 m s otherwise the area is in the low velocity province the vp of the surface sediment in the study area can be divided into three provinces fig 3 the northeast ne province h1 which includes station s1 with a high compressional wave velocity the middle province l which includes stations s2 s3 and s4 with a low compressional wave velocity and the southwest sw province h2 which includes station s5 with a high velocity the highest velocity in the study area is 1668 m s and the lowest velocity is 1477 m s the physical properties of the three provinces are listed in table 1 generally the high velocity provinces h1 and h2 present a low porosity n high wet bulk density wd and coarse grain size mz while the low velocity province l presents a high porosity n low wet bulk density wd and fine grain size mz the high velocity provinces h1 and h2 mainly consist of clayey silt silt and silty sand in the high velocity provinces the clay content varies between 13 2 and 52 wd varies between 1 3 g cm3 and 1 88 g cm3 and mz ranges from 4 53 ϕ to 7 5 ϕ the low velocity province l mainly consists of silty clay and clayey silt in the low velocity province the clay content varies between 3 9 and 44 5 wd varies between 1 28 g cm3 and 1 7 g cm3 and mz ranges from 6 19 ϕ to 8 09 ϕ 4 discussion 4 1 sound velocity ratio method environmental factors temperature salinity and hydrostatic pressure have a notable effect on the sound velocity of seawater and on the acoustic behavior of seafloor sediment zou et al 2015 for the sampling methodology used in this study the sediments are collected from the seafloor and then raised to the deck this method changes the environment of the seafloor sediment especially the temperature and pressure therefore we need to correct the experimental data to reflect the in situ conditions the correction method we used is the sound velocity ratio method hamilton 1971 hamilton instituted the term velocity ratio or v p r which is the ratio of the measured sound velocity of sediment to the sound velocity of water at the same temperature salinity and pressure under the standard laboratory conditions of 23 c atmospheric pressure and a salinity of 35 ppt v p r can be used to calculate the in situ sound velocity v p v p r c w the validity of this approach has been demonstrated in laboratory measurements by many researchers shumway 1958 hamilton 1971 carbó and molero 2002 in this study we used this method to calculate the in situ sound velocity vps 3 v p l c w l v p s c w s v p r in the formula above v pl is the sound velocity of the sediment measured in the laboratory and cwl is the sound velocity of the seawater calculated by wilson s empirical formula under laboratory conditions vps is the in situ sound velocity of the sediment and cws is the in situ sound velocity of the seawater calculated by wilson s empirical formula according to our data analysis vps is slightly greater than v pl and is approximately 3 15 m s on average 3 06 3 46 m s this error is basically negligible which might mean that calibration of the sampling measurements is not needed in the future then the relevant theoretical elaborations were put forward in this method standard laboratory conditions 23 c atmospheric pressure and a salinity of 35 ppt correspond to a water sound velocity of 1529 97 m s cwl at the seafloor in the scs at a depth of approximately 4300 m the pressure is approximately 43 7 mpa the salinity is 34 7 ppt and the temperature is approximately 2 46 c as measured by ctd these data correspond to a water sound velocity of 1532 99 m s cws we can see that the error between cwl and cws is very small and can be neglected therefore the error between vps and v pl is basically negligible which may suggest that the laboratory measurements are consistent with in situ measurements the sound velocity of seawater decreases with increasing depth within 1000 m of the surface munk 2005 wang et al 2008 researched the relation between the acoustic characteristics of the sea bottom sediment and the seawater depth and found that when the water depth is less than 1000 m the influence of depth on the sound velocity can be ignored less than 1 thus the change in the velocity of the seawater within 1000 m is mainly caused by the temperature when the water depth exceeds 1000 m the velocity of the seawater increases with the water depth because of the combined action of the temperature and depth pressure when the temperature decreases the velocity decreases when the water depth increases velocity and pressure increase clearly when the water depth exceeds 1000 m the effect of depth pressure is greater than the effect of temperature from formula 3 we know that when cwl is approximately equal to cws v pl is equal to vps suggesting that the laboratory measurements are nearly consistent with the in situ measurements therefore based on the hamilton sound velocity ratio method we propose a laboratory method to more accurately measure the sound velocity of sediment bringing the laboratory measurements closer to the in situ measurements when we measure the velocity of seafloor sediment in a laboratory we can adjust the sediment temperature to constrain the velocity of the pore water in the sediment to be closer to the sound velocity of the seafloor seawater thus the measured sound velocity of the sediment is closer to the in situ value table 2 lists the sound velocities of the seawater at different depths and the suggested sediment temperatures table 2 shows that when the depth is 4000 m the in situ seawater velocity is 1527 71 m s approximately equal to the standard laboratory seawater velocity 1529 97 m s for example based on the method we proposed in this paper when the water depth is approximately 4000 m in the scs we can measure the sound velocity of the sediment samples under standard laboratory conditions and adjust the sediment temperature between 22 and 23 c the results of the measurements in the laboratory are not required to be calibrated because they are already close to the in situ measurements 4 2 sound velocity in fig 3 we can see that provinces h1 and h2 show a high velocity while province l presents a low velocity this distribution is related to the sediment physical properties and many studies have confirmed that hamilton 1970 kim et al 2011 endler et al 2015 generally vp is inversely proportional to n and mz and is proportional to wd this is consistent with our observations in table 1 the high velocity province has a low n high wd and coarse particles while the low velocity has a high n low wd and fine particles in fig 1 we can see that there are several seamounts and or abyssal hills around province l we initially thought that the seamount might have an effect on the sediment components however according to our analysis the surface sediment in h1 and h2 is mainly clayey silt silt and silty sand while the surface sediment in l is mainly silty clay and clayey silt suggesting that the suspended sediments are not from the seamounts and that the seamounts and or abyssal hills have little effect on the surface sediment composition the data indicate that the distribution of vp may be mainly associated with the sediment source and ocean current based on the clay mineral distribution of the surface sediments in the scs especially the illite chemistry index and illite percentage the sediment transport route of the deep water current dwc and ocean current are outlined in fig 3 wang et al 2011 liu et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 various proxies have revealed that the dwc may exist in the northern scs affecting sediment transport and deposition jian and wang 1997 wan et al 2010 however there is still no information about the full dwc transport route in the scs after it flows into the northern part of the sea through the luzon strait in the western north atlantic the dwc can transport sediments over a long distance in the deep marine environment and then deposit sediment drifts at a high sedimentation rate kissel et al 2009 according to the illite distributions and clay minerals the dwc can reach 112 e in the west and 13 n in the south along the 2000 m isobaths liu et al 2013 xue et al 2004 suggested that the maximum intrusion of the kc reaches the western scs during the fall compensating for summer surface offshore transport associated with coastal upwelling therefore sediments derived from taiwan and luzon are possibly transported and then deposited in the central scs liu et al 2013 according to clay mineral assemblages of the surface sediments from the entire scs the sediment sources in the scs liu et al 2013 and sound velocity provinces in this study area are illustrated in fig 3 according to fig 3 the surface sediment sources in province h1 and l are probably primarily from the luzon strait transported by dwc and the surface sediment sources in province h2 are mainly from the red river transported by surface currents during the summer and winter driven by the ocean current and sedimentation the sediments of coarse particles are deposited in the near shore and the fine particles are transported a farther distance generally a coarser mean grain size range typically has a higher sound velocity therefore for the same sediment source the sound velocity decreases away from the sediment source in this study province l is farther from the luzon strait than province h1 thus the sound velocity of province h1 is higher than that of province l which is consistent with the results of our measurements this observation indicates that the sediment sources and ocean currents can influence the distribution of the sound velocity the map of the vertical variation in vp at stations s2 s4 and s5 is displayed in fig 4 vertical variation is an important part of a geoacoustic model kim and kim 2001 with an increase in the sediment burial depth the loose sediments or unconsolidated sediments gradually become consolidated and the porosity and density decreases under these conditions vp increases linearly with depth indicating the normal consolidation of the sediments ryang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 the vertical variation in vp is complicated in the scs and is affected by many factors such as topography sediment source and ocean current in fig 4 the general variation in vp is closely related to the sediment physical properties vp decreases with an increase in n and water content and increases with the wd and mz station s2 is in province l and the length of the core sample from this station is 190 cm here the surface sediment is mainly clayey silt the highest vp is 1535 m s and the lowest vp is only 1489 m s a difference of 46 m s the physical properties have similar changes with velocity n ranges from 58 5 to 77 9 and reaches its highest value at the bottom of the core water content exhibits the same trend as n and ranges from 59 0 to 146 4 the vp at s2 changes with the physical properties first increasing and then decreasing above 120 cm mz changes only slightly however while n and the water content increase with depth wd decreases with depth the mutation point of n is approximately 100 cm and those of mz and wd are approximately 140 cm and vp generally increases with depth compared with the station s2 station s4 has a more complicated vertical variation in vp station s4 is also in province l and the length of core sample is 375 cm this core has the lowest vp in the study area vp ranges from 1477 to 1511 m s a difference of 34 m s although s4 has a small range of vp it changes rapidly within a small range the physical properties also rapidly change at s4 n has a maximum value of 82 2 on the surface and then exhibits small but rapid changes as the depth increases to a depth of 325 cm from 325 to 375 cm deep n drops from 80 8 to a minimum of 60 7 a variation was also found in the estimation of the water content which ranges from 65 0 to 182 6 the variations in wd and the water content have excellent symmetry wd increases from 1 3 to 1 7 g cm3 and the maximum value of wd is at the bottom of the sample 375 cm in addition mz ranges from 6 67 ϕ to 7 95 ϕ from stations s2 and s4 province l we can see that although the variation in vp is complicated it still changes with the physical properties and the vertical variations in vp are consistent with those in wd and mz and contrary to those of n and water content geographically there are many seamounts and or abyssal hills around province l in terms of sedimentation and transport ocean currents cannot transport coarse particles to distant locations and the coarse sediment sources may be the seamounts and or abyssal hills liu et al 2013 we think that the vertical variation in vp is partly affected by the seamounts and or abyssal hills and affects the physical properties of seafloor sediment unlike stations s2 and s4 province l station s5 is in province h2 and the vertical variations in vp in the s5 core are simple vp increases from 1537 to 1615 m s with burial depth n decreases from 59 2 to 57 9 as the burial depth increases geographically the terrain near station s5 is flat and the sediment likely comes from the red river fig 3 from the distribution of vp we know that the distance from the sediment source could affect the distribution of the surface sediments due to the sediment sources and ocean currents thus affecting the distribution of sound velocity in the surface sediment the seamounts and or abyssal hills have little effect on the surface sediment distribution however we found that the seamounts and or abyssal hills might provide sources of coarse sediment and cause vertically complex variation in sediment in the deep sea of scs the sediment is mainly sourced from the dwc transport and ocean current the dwc can transport sediments over a long distance in the deep marine environment and then deposit sediment drift with a high sedimentation rate liu et al 2013 the volcanic materials from seamounts only account a small part in the coarse grained silt fraction of sediments thus the surface sediments are mainly affected by the sediment transportation however on a long time scale the volcanic materials from seamounts may increase due to climate change hydrodynamic conditions tectonic activity etc and accumulate at the station resulting in vertical changes in the physical properties of sediments we proposed that on a long time scale the topography would have a certain effect on the physical properties of the seafloor sediments thus affecting the acoustic characteristics of the sediments 4 3 acoustic impedance and reflection coefficient acoustic impedance z is the product of sound velocity and density the main parameter used to calculate the reflection coefficient and the transmission coefficient of the seafloor and an important acoustic parameter schock 2004 kan et al 2014 the distribution of z is similar to the distribution of vp the province h1 s1 and the province h2 s5 and s6 present a high z while the middle province l s2 s3 and s4 presents a low z the acoustic impedance of province h2 s5 and s6 is 1 9956 3 1441 106kg m2 s and the average value is 2 4874 106kg m2 s these values are consistent with previously published studies tang 1998 kan et al 2014 the impedance at station s1 is 2 7157 106kg m2 s the impedance of province l s2 s3 and s4 is approximately 1 9127 2 5330 106kg m2 s with an average value of 2 1026 106kg m2 s the distribution of z is related to vp and wd richardson and briggs 1993 suggest that variations in the acoustic impedance are considerably more similar to the variations in the wet bulk density than in the sound velocity in this study the distribution of vp is consistent with wd thus the distribution of z is similar to the distribution of vp the seafloor sediment and water interface is an important interface and the reflection and refraction of acoustic waves at a sediment interface is an important problem for seafloor scattering bottom reverberation and the acoustic detection of objects hamilton 1970 developed a viscous elastic model to summarize investigations that compare bottom loss measurements and sediment properties the viscous elastic model provides inter relationships between the reflection coefficient r measurements and sediment properties 4 r z 2 z 1 z 2 z 1 z 1 and z 2 are the acoustic impedances of the seawater and seafloor sediment respectively in this paper the seawater velocity was calculated by wilson s equation wilson 1960 the seawater density used the unesco equation of state for seawater millero et al 1980 and the temperature salinity and hydrostatic pressure of the seawater was measured by ctd due to the absence of ctd data we calculated the only reflection coefficient at three stations s2 s4 and s5 the r of s2 s4 and s5 are 0 1664 0 1102 and 0 1181 respectively geographically from s2 to s4 to s5 the stations are located closer to the mid ocean ridge and their reflection coefficients first decrease and then increase therefore the effect of topography can be excluded from s2 to s4 to s5 the clay content is 29 22 37 48 and 35 88 and the variation trend of the reflection coefficient is opposite to that of the clay content a preliminary conclusion is that the reflection coefficient is inversely proportional to the clay content since the sample size is small this conclusion still needs to be verified by conducting future work 5 conclusion the sound velocity ratio method is the most commonly used and simple method to calibrate laboratory measurements to in situ measurements in this paper based on the hamilton sound velocity ratio method we proposed a laboratory measurement method by adjusting the temperature of the sediment bringing the laboratory measurements closer to the in situ values this method can be used as a reference for future laboratory measurements especially in the absence of in situ measurement equipment the results show that the study area can be differentiated into 3 provinces province h1 and h2 have a high compressional wave velocity and province l has a low compressional wave velocity the vertical variation in vp presents two trends a simple vertical variation model and complicated vertical variation model the distribution of sound velocity in the deep sea of scs is related to the sediment physical properties sediment source topography ocean current and consolidation effects in this study the local topography seamounts and or abyssal hills provides a small sediment source for the surface sediment regarding the vertical variation on a long time scale the coarse grained silt fraction of the sediments from the seamounts and or abyssal hills could be deposited and seamounts and or abyssal hills will have a certain effect on the physical properties of the seafloor sediments thus affecting the acoustic characteristics of the sediments temperature salinity and pressure data were measured by ctd in scs seawater velocity was calculated by wilson s empirical formula and water depth at 0 m represents laboratory standard conditions it is recommended that the sediment be measured at the suggested temperature range which can make the measured value

using the following formula 2 ρ w m v 3 ρ d m m l v in the above formula ρ w is the wet bulk density ρ d is the dry bulk density m is the weight of the sub sample m l is the loss of weight of the sub sample and v is the volume of the sub sample the water content could then be calculated from the loss of weight and the porosity was measured by using a pycnometer the sand silt clay components and mean grain size were measured with a particle size analyzer at the south china sea institute of oceanology chinese academy of sciences the measurement error for the particle size analysis was less than 2 the sorting coefficient was defined by the ratio of the 25 and 75 grain sizes on the cumulative particle diameter curve and was used as a reference for the sorting characteristics of the seafloor sediments the correction of the laboratory values to the seafloor values was performed by using the sound velocity ratio method hamilton 1971 the pore water velocity was reported for the standard laboratory conditions favored by hamilton 23 c 35 ppt and atmospheric pressure these conditions correspond to a water sound velocity of 1529 97 m s and a water density of 1024 kg m3 the velocity of sound in seawater depends on the seawater temperature salinity and hydrostatic pressure for calculation of the velocity of sound wilson s empirical formula offered in 1960 is of common use wilson 1960 the temperature salinity and hydrostatic pressure in the seawater was measured by a conductivity temperature depth system ctd 3 results the deep sea sediments of the central basin are thought to be mud prone however according to our analysis the sediments in the study area are mainly silty clay clayey silt silt and silty sand the sound velocity of the seawater at a depth of 4000 m is approximately 1530 m s therefore we define the high velocity province by sediment velocities greater than 1530 m s otherwise the area is in the low velocity province the vp of the surface sediment in the study area can be divided into three provinces fig 3 the northeast ne province h1 which includes station s1 with a high compressional wave velocity the middle province l which includes stations s2 s3 and s4 with a low compressional wave velocity and the southwest sw province h2 which includes station s5 with a high velocity the highest velocity in the study area is 1668 m s and the lowest velocity is 1477 m s the physical properties of the three provinces are listed in table 1 generally the high velocity provinces h1 and h2 present a low porosity n high wet bulk density wd and coarse grain size mz while the low velocity province l presents a high porosity n low wet bulk density wd and fine grain size mz the high velocity provinces h1 and h2 mainly consist of clayey silt silt and silty sand in the high velocity provinces the clay content varies between 13 2 and 52 wd varies between 1 3 g cm3 and 1 88 g cm3 and mz ranges from 4 53 ϕ to 7 5 ϕ the low velocity province l mainly consists of silty clay and clayey silt in the low velocity province the clay content varies between 3 9 and 44 5 wd varies between 1 28 g cm3 and 1 7 g cm3 and mz ranges from 6 19 ϕ to 8 09 ϕ 4 discussion 4 1 sound velocity ratio method environmental factors temperature salinity and hydrostatic pressure have a notable effect on the sound velocity of seawater and on the acoustic behavior of seafloor sediment zou et al 2015 for the sampling methodology used in this study the sediments are collected from the seafloor and then raised to the deck this method changes the environment of the seafloor sediment especially the temperature and pressure therefore we need to correct the experimental data to reflect the in situ conditions the correction method we used is the sound velocity ratio method hamilton 1971 hamilton instituted the term velocity ratio or v p r which is the ratio of the measured sound velocity of sediment to the sound velocity of water at the same temperature salinity and pressure under the standard laboratory conditions of 23 c atmospheric pressure and a salinity of 35 ppt v p r can be used to calculate the in situ sound velocity v p v p r c w the validity of this approach has been demonstrated in laboratory measurements by many researchers shumway 1958 hamilton 1971 carbó and molero 2002 in this study we used this method to calculate the in situ sound velocity vps 3 v p l c w l v p s c w s v p r in the formula above v pl is the sound velocity of the sediment measured in the laboratory and cwl is the sound velocity of the seawater calculated by wilson s empirical formula under laboratory conditions vps is the in situ sound velocity of the sediment and cws is the in situ sound velocity of the seawater calculated by wilson s empirical formula according to our data analysis vps is slightly greater than v pl and is approximately 3 15 m s on average 3 06 3 46 m s this error is basically negligible which might mean that calibration of the sampling measurements is not needed in the future then the relevant theoretical elaborations were put forward in this method standard laboratory conditions 23 c atmospheric pressure and a salinity of 35 ppt correspond to a water sound velocity of 1529 97 m s cwl at the seafloor in the scs at a depth of approximately 4300 m the pressure is approximately 43 7 mpa the salinity is 34 7 ppt and the temperature is approximately 2 46 c as measured by ctd these data correspond to a water sound velocity of 1532 99 m s cws we can see that the error between cwl and cws is very small and can be neglected therefore the error between vps and v pl is basically negligible which may suggest that the laboratory measurements are consistent with in situ measurements the sound velocity of seawater decreases with increasing depth within 1000 m of the surface munk 2005 wang et al 2008 researched the relation between the acoustic characteristics of the sea bottom sediment and the seawater depth and found that when the water depth is less than 1000 m the influence of depth on the sound velocity can be ignored less than 1 thus the change in the velocity of the seawater within 1000 m is mainly caused by the temperature when the water depth exceeds 1000 m the velocity of the seawater increases with the water depth because of the combined action of the temperature and depth pressure when the temperature decreases the velocity decreases when the water depth increases velocity and pressure increase clearly when the water depth exceeds 1000 m the effect of depth pressure is greater than the effect of temperature from formula 3 we know that when cwl is approximately equal to cws v pl is equal to vps suggesting that the laboratory measurements are nearly consistent with the in situ measurements therefore based on the hamilton sound velocity ratio method we propose a laboratory method to more accurately measure the sound velocity of sediment bringing the laboratory measurements closer to the in situ measurements when we measure the velocity of seafloor sediment in a laboratory we can adjust the sediment temperature to constrain the velocity of the pore water in the sediment to be closer to the sound velocity of the seafloor seawater thus the measured sound velocity of the sediment is closer to the in situ value table 2 lists the sound velocities of the seawater at different depths and the suggested sediment temperatures table 2 shows that when the depth is 4000 m the in situ seawater velocity is 1527 71 m s approximately equal to the standard laboratory seawater velocity 1529 97 m s for example based on the method we proposed in this paper when the water depth is approximately 4000 m in the scs we can measure the sound velocity of the sediment samples under standard laboratory conditions and adjust the sediment temperature between 22 and 23 c the results of the measurements in the laboratory are not required to be calibrated because they are already close to the in situ measurements 4 2 sound velocity in fig 3 we can see that provinces h1 and h2 show a high velocity while province l presents a low velocity this distribution is related to the sediment physical properties and many studies have confirmed that hamilton 1970 kim et al 2011 endler et al 2015 generally vp is inversely proportional to n and mz and is proportional to wd this is consistent with our observations in table 1 the high velocity province has a low n high wd and coarse particles while the low velocity has a high n low wd and fine particles in fig 1 we can see that there are several seamounts and or abyssal hills around province l we initially thought that the seamount might have an effect on the sediment components however according to our analysis the surface sediment in h1 and h2 is mainly clayey silt silt and silty sand while the surface sediment in l is mainly silty clay and clayey silt suggesting that the suspended sediments are not from the seamounts and that the seamounts and or abyssal hills have little effect on the surface sediment composition the data indicate that the distribution of vp may be mainly associated with the sediment source and ocean current based on the clay mineral distribution of the surface sediments in the scs especially the illite chemistry index and illite percentage the sediment transport route of the deep water current dwc and ocean current are outlined in fig 3 wang et al 2011 liu et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 various proxies have revealed that the dwc may exist in the northern scs affecting sediment transport and deposition jian and wang 1997 wan et al 2010 however there is still no information about the full dwc transport route in the scs after it flows into the northern part of the sea through the luzon strait in the western north atlantic the dwc can transport sediments over a long distance in the deep marine environment and then deposit sediment drifts at a high sedimentation rate kissel et al 2009 according to the illite distributions and clay minerals the dwc can reach 112 e in the west and 13 n in the south along the 2000 m isobaths liu et al 2013 xue et al 2004 suggested that the maximum intrusion of the kc reaches the western scs during the fall compensating for summer surface offshore transport associated with coastal upwelling therefore sediments derived from taiwan and luzon are possibly transported and then deposited in the central scs liu et al 2013 according to clay mineral assemblages of the surface sediments from the entire scs the sediment sources in the scs liu et al 2013 and sound velocity provinces in this study area are illustrated in fig 3 according to fig 3 the surface sediment sources in province h1 and l are probably primarily from the luzon strait transported by dwc and the surface sediment sources in province h2 are mainly from the red river transported by surface currents during the summer and winter driven by the ocean current and sedimentation the sediments of coarse particles are deposited in the near shore and the fine particles are transported a farther distance generally a coarser mean grain size range typically has a higher sound velocity therefore for the same sediment source the sound velocity decreases away from the sediment source in this study province l is farther from the luzon strait than province h1 thus the sound velocity of province h1 is higher than that of province l which is consistent with the results of our measurements this observation indicates that the sediment sources and ocean currents can influence the distribution of the sound velocity the map of the vertical variation in vp at stations s2 s4 and s5 is displayed in fig 4 vertical variation is an important part of a geoacoustic model kim and kim 2001 with an increase in the sediment burial depth the loose sediments or unconsolidated sediments gradually become consolidated and the porosity and density decreases under these conditions vp increases linearly with depth indicating the normal consolidation of the sediments ryang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 the vertical variation in vp is complicated in the scs and is affected by many factors such as topography sediment source and ocean current in fig 4 the general variation in vp is closely related to the sediment physical properties vp decreases with an increase in n and water content and increases with the wd and mz station s2 is in province l and the length of the core sample from this station is 190 cm here the surface sediment is mainly clayey silt the highest vp is 1535 m s and the lowest vp is only 1489 m s a difference of 46 m s the physical properties have similar changes with velocity n ranges from 58 5 to 77 9 and reaches its highest value at the bottom of the core water content exhibits the same trend as n and ranges from 59 0 to 146 4 the vp at s2 changes with the physical properties first increasing and then decreasing above 120 cm mz changes only slightly however while n and the water content increase with depth wd decreases with depth the mutation point of n is approximately 100 cm and those of mz and wd are approximately 140 cm and vp generally increases with depth compared with the station s2 station s4 has a more complicated vertical variation in vp station s4 is also in province l and the length of core sample is 375 cm this core has the lowest vp in the study area vp ranges from 1477 to 1511 m s a difference of 34 m s although s4 has a small range of vp it changes rapidly within a small range the physical properties also rapidly change at s4 n has a maximum value of 82 2 on the surface and then exhibits small but rapid changes as the depth increases to a depth of 325 cm from 325 to 375 cm deep n drops from 80 8 to a minimum of 60 7 a variation was also found in the estimation of the water content which ranges from 65 0 to 182 6 the variations in wd and the water content have excellent symmetry wd increases from 1 3 to 1 7 g cm3 and the maximum value of wd is at the bottom of the sample 375 cm in addition mz ranges from 6 67 ϕ to 7 95 ϕ from stations s2 and s4 province l we can see that although the variation in vp is complicated it still changes with the physical properties and the vertical variations in vp are consistent with those in wd and mz and contrary to those of n and water content geographically there are many seamounts and or abyssal hills around province l in terms of sedimentation and transport ocean currents cannot transport coarse particles to distant locations and the coarse sediment sources may be the seamounts and or abyssal hills liu et al 2013 we think that the vertical variation in vp is partly affected by the seamounts and or abyssal hills and affects the physical properties of seafloor sediment unlike stations s2 and s4 province l station s5 is in province h2 and the vertical variations in vp in the s5 core are simple vp increases from 1537 to 1615 m s with burial depth n decreases from 59 2 to 57 9 as the burial depth increases geographically the terrain near station s5 is flat and the sediment likely comes from the red river fig 3 from the distribution of vp we know that the distance from the sediment source could affect the distribution of the surface sediments due to the sediment sources and ocean currents thus affecting the distribution of sound velocity in the surface sediment the seamounts and or abyssal hills have little effect on the surface sediment distribution however we found that the seamounts and or abyssal hills might provide sources of coarse sediment and cause vertically complex variation in sediment in the deep sea of scs the sediment is mainly sourced from the dwc transport and ocean current the dwc can transport sediments over a long distance in the deep marine environment and then deposit sediment drift with a high sedimentation rate liu et al 2013 the volcanic materials from seamounts only account a small part in the coarse grained silt fraction of sediments thus the surface sediments are mainly affected by the sediment transportation however on a long time scale the volcanic materials from seamounts may increase due to climate change hydrodynamic conditions tectonic activity etc and accumulate at the station resulting in vertical changes in the physical properties of sediments we proposed that on a long time scale the topography would have a certain effect on the physical properties of the seafloor sediments thus affecting the acoustic characteristics of the sediments 4 3 acoustic impedance and reflection coefficient acoustic impedance z is the product of sound velocity and density the main parameter used to calculate the reflection coefficient and the transmission coefficient of the seafloor and an important acoustic parameter schock 2004 kan et al 2014 the distribution of z is similar to the distribution of vp the province h1 s1 and the province h2 s5 and s6 present a high z while the middle province l s2 s3 and s4 presents a low z the acoustic impedance of province h2 s5 and s6 is 1 9956 3 1441 106kg m2 s and the average value is 2 4874 106kg m2 s these values are consistent with previously published studies tang 1998 kan et al 2014 the impedance at station s1 is 2 7157 106kg m2 s the impedance of province l s2 s3 and s4 is approximately 1 9127 2 5330 106kg m2 s with an average value of 2 1026 106kg m2 s the distribution of z is related to vp and wd richardson and briggs 1993 suggest that variations in the acoustic impedance are considerably more similar to the variations in the wet bulk density than in the sound velocity in this study the distribution of vp is consistent with wd thus the distribution of z is similar to the distribution of vp the seafloor sediment and water interface is an important interface and the reflection and refraction of acoustic waves at a sediment interface is an important problem for seafloor scattering bottom reverberation and the acoustic detection of objects hamilton 1970 developed a viscous elastic model to summarize investigations that compare bottom loss measurements and sediment properties the viscous elastic model provides inter relationships between the reflection coefficient r measurements and sediment properties 4 r z 2 z 1 z 2 z 1 z 1 and z 2 are the acoustic impedances of the seawater and seafloor sediment respectively in this paper the seawater velocity was calculated by wilson s equation wilson 1960 the seawater density used the unesco equation of state for seawater millero et al 1980 and the temperature salinity and hydrostatic pressure of the seawater was measured by ctd due to the absence of ctd data we calculated the only reflection coefficient at three stations s2 s4 and s5 the r of s2 s4 and s5 are 0 1664 0 1102 and 0 1181 respectively geographically from s2 to s4 to s5 the stations are located closer to the mid ocean ridge and their reflection coefficients first decrease and then increase therefore the effect of topography can be excluded from s2 to s4 to s5 the clay content is 29 22 37 48 and 35 88 and the variation trend of the reflection coefficient is opposite to that of the clay content a preliminary conclusion is that the reflection coefficient is inversely proportional to the clay content since the sample size is small this conclusion still needs to be verified by conducting future work 5 conclusion the sound velocity ratio method is the most commonly used and simple method to calibrate laboratory measurements to in situ measurements in this paper based on the hamilton sound velocity ratio method we proposed a laboratory measurement method by adjusting the temperature of the sediment bringing the laboratory measurements closer to the in situ values this method can be used as a reference for future laboratory measurements especially in the absence of in situ measurement equipment the results show that the study area can be differentiated into 3 provinces province h1 and h2 have a high compressional wave velocity and province l has a low compressional wave velocity the vertical variation in vp presents two trends a simple vertical variation model and complicated vertical variation model the distribution of sound velocity in the deep sea of scs is related to the sediment physical properties sediment source topography ocean current and consolidation effects in this study the local topography seamounts and or abyssal hills provides a small sediment source for the surface sediment regarding the vertical variation on a long time scale the coarse grained silt fraction of the sediments from the seamounts and or abyssal hills could be deposited and seamounts and or abyssal hills will have a certain effect on the physical properties of the seafloor sediments thus affecting the acoustic characteristics of the sediments temperature salinity and pressure data were measured by ctd in scs seawater velocity was calculated by wilson s empirical formula and water depth at 0 m represents laboratory standard conditions it is recommended that the sediment be measured at the suggested temperature range which can make the measured value

23447,at model scale propellers conventional turbulence models assume turbulent regimes all over the blade surface and consequently do not obtain accurate predictions that can be compared to experimental results two aspects could be improved in order to produce a better description of the flow complexity generated in these turbulent rotating systems the inclusion of transition phenomena assumptions that normally take place in these flows and a particular modeling of those transition mechanisms such as cross flow that appear at model scale propellers in this paper a new modified γ r e θ correlation based model for transition prediction that takes into account crossflow effects is applied to model scale ship propellers for a wide range of advanced ratios and its results are compared to their corresponding experimental results the average values of the skin friction coefficients on different parts of the blade and the streamlines distribution are studied and compared between different propellers the results obtained with these improvements show an agreement of about 1 in terms of efficiency and below 5 in terms of thrust and torque coefficients when compared to the experimental results at the design point the dependance of the cross flow mechanism on the reynolds number is studied by changing the rotating velocity of the different propellers results show that the relevance of this mechanism grows when the rotating velocity the centrifugal forces and reynolds number increase consequently when the reynolds numbers grows the cross flow transition mechanism is

known that numerical simulation and in particular computational fluid dynamics cfd is one of the most powerful tools that the propeller designer can use nowadays the possibilities of recomputing after introducing geometrical changes extracting detailed flow quantities and analyzing the flow behavior near the propeller blades are attractive options that all engineers wish for when a propeller is designed as kawamura 2011 comments different restrictions such as model size flow velocity and adequate instruments for measurements are avoided when numerical simulation is used as a design tool in order to give a scientific perspective on the possibilities shown by numerical methods it should be acknowledged that the evaluation of the accuracy of cfd methods is not a simple task the performance of the mathematical models is not always accurate enough to capture the essence of such complex phenomena such as laminar turbulent transition or turbulent shear stress the inherent non linearity of fluid dynamics equations and the necessity of discretization methods based on complex mesh designs also add error sources to the computations because cfd are not yet completely accurate it is a good practice to compare them with experimental results it is assumed that in well validated codes the residual errors due to the uncoupling linearisation of the transport equations and solution of linear systems are several orders of magnitude lower than mesh discretization errors in rijpkema 2015 a numerical uncertainty analysis commonly referred to as verification based on a least squares fit of numerical solutions was performed following the procedure of eça and hoekstra 2014 this procedure has been criticized by xing and stern 2014 indicating several drawbacks these grid convergence studies based on systematically refined grid spacing are very useful when simple geometries are used but unfortunately this is not the case when marine propellers are analyzed and it is impractical to refine the whole the grid systematically in these cases the most sensitive part of the grid refinement is found on the blade boundary layers where not only the grid spacing but also the grid distribution and the boundary layer height must be iterated until a grid independent solution is obtained a grid convergence study based on the boundary layer parameters has been performed in this work looking for the idea of obtaining mesh independent results when certain mesh criteria are followed the flow over the propeller at model scale reynolds numbers is clearly in the critical reynolds range where transition from laminar to turbulent flow takes place marine propellers are one of those cfd applications where transitional effects at model scale are specially important if an accurate prediction of the propeller efficiency is searched for visualization of the flow at these reynolds numbers for example with the help of paint tests typically shows regions of laminar and turbulent flows on the blade as for example discussed in kuiper 1981 2000 sánchez caja et al 2014 bhattacharyya et al 2016 the paint streak s direction depends much on the shear stress which increases drastically when the flows transitions from laminar to turbulent regime consequently paint streaks are radially directed on laminar regions while they are more azimuthal where the flow is turbulent it is well known that even at model scale the reynolds numbers are too large to resolve all the eddy scales involved in the physical phenomenon and consequently turbulence models such as k ω or the k ε are necessary to add the turbulent effects when the averaged flow is computed additionally transition models should be also implemented when model scale propellers are simulated due to the laminar turbulent transition phenomenon correlation based transition models using local variables have been in continuous development in menter et al 2004 first proposed these models as a practical solution to transition prediction in cfd codes based on complex unstructured meshes abu ghannam and shaw 1980 menter et al 2006 malan et al 2009 in langtry and menter 2009 presented the full formulation of the γ r e θ and malan et al 2009 presented its implementation in a commercial cfd solver nowadays correlation based methods for transition prediction are being used in different sectors such as aeronautical or marine industries and they are becoming an important tool for designers recently the γ r e θ transition model was extended to capture crossflow effects by langtry et al 2015 without any violation of the lctm local correlation based transition model approach this overcame one of the weakness of these model the correlation method that they used previously was for bypass and natural ts transitions only at model scale conventional turbulence models assume turbulent regimes all over the blade surface and consequently do not obtain an accurate prediction that can be compared to local experimental results due to the absence of transition phenomena assumptions in the boundary layer for this reason one needs improved cfd computation incorporating γ r e θ transition model which should be applied in order to reproduce the complex phenomena that take place in model scale computation one of the first model scale cfd open water tests was presented by bhattacharyya et al 2015 in the last smp15 as many authors confirm e g langtry 2006 traditional methods for transition prediction based on integral computations are impractical from a computational point of view the γ r e θ transition model menter et al 2006 is a correlation based approach for transition modeling that was specifically designed for cfd codes the dependance of the model on the correlation is the main drawback of this method which implies some expertise if the method has to be applied to particular problems in this work the γ r e θ implementation of the starccm software will be used this implementation has demonstrated the capacity to deal with flat plates 2d airfoils 3d multi element airfoils and even in ship propellers by bhattacharyya et al 2015 research has identified several types of instabilities such as attachment line streamwise centrifugal and crossflow see saric et al 2003 since 1989 flow around rotating disks is presented by reed and saric as one of the canonical examples where crossflow instability is present in 3d boundary layers the combined influences of sweep and pressure gradients produce curved streamlines at the boundary layer edge pressure gradient is unchanged inside the boundary layer while the streamwise velocity is reduced consequently the centripetal acceleration does not balance the pressure gradient and a secondary flow called crossflow appears perpendicular to the direction of the inviscid streamline due to the no slip boundary condition crossflow velocity must be zero at the wall and an inflection point appears as a source of an inviscid instability the authors consider important to include the crossflow effects as one of the typical causes of laminar turbulent transition at model scale propellers in the calculation of model scale ship propellers the twist in the propeller boundary layer can be clearly appreciated see figure 1 this case presents an evident similarity when compared to the scheme of a normal 3d boundary layer in a swept wing presented by saric et al 2003 this paper is organized as follows first a description of the numerical method applied is presented in section 2 in section 3 the characteristics of the fluid dynamics problem is well described in section 4 the philosophy of the mesh study carried out and the mesh convergence results are presented for all the cases finally results are presented and discussed in section 5 followed by the final conclusions 2 numerical method the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations are discretized in space by the finite volume method using starccm a semi implicit method known as simple algorithm is used to handle the coupling of the navier stokes equations and calculate the primitive variables such as pressure and velocity at each time step the temporal discretization solver used is a first order implicit scheme for these simulations five inner iterations per time step are used to ensure low residuals in the conservation laws involved in the simulation this software has been used in numerous works in different parts of hydrodynamics and particularly in propellers computations see bhattacharyya et al 2015 and malan et al 2009 as examples the rans equations for incompressible flow for a moving reference frame that rotates with constant angular velocity ω r can be written as 1 v r 0 2 v r t v r v r 2 ω r u r ω r ω r r 1 ρ p μ 2 v r f where v r is the relative velocity and p the fluid pressure r is the radial vector from the rotation axis ρ and μ are the water density and dynamic viscosity respectively and f is an external body force in our case inertial force equations 1 and 2 have been complemented with the k ω s s t turbulence model that computes the turbulent kinetic energy k the specific rate of dissipation ω and the eddy kinematic viscosity ν t k ω see wilcox 2006 in order to detect the different laminar and turbulent regions a γ r e θ transition model has been also added to the set of equations details of this transition model are presented in section 2 1 for further reading see menter et al 2004 menter et al 2006 langtry and menter 2009 malan et al 2009 the boundary conditions for these cases are the same ones usually found in the literature the propeller blades are modeled as rotating non slip surfaces with the velocity field matching the propeller s rotational speed a uniform flow condition is applied to the inlet and peripheral surfaces at the outlet the streamwise gradients of the flow variables as well as the pressure differences are set to zero for the uniform flow computations only one blade has been used due to the periodicity of the propeller geometry 2 1 transition laminar to turbulent transition is a very complex phenomenon where huge amounts of scientific work have been accomplished different approaches to study laminar turbulent transition have been developed and the most efficient methods to model this phenomenon are stability theory approach low reynolds number approach the intermittency transport method with empirical correlation the laminar fluctuation energy methods les and dns method the v 2 f model the intermittency and vorticity reynolds number approach a detailed explanation of each method can be found in the work of di pasquale et al 2009 in particular the γ r e θ t correlation based transition model which is totally compatible with modern cfd codes based on unstructured meshes has been chosen recently this model has been extended in order to be able to capture stationary cross flow effects by muller and herbst 2014 and langtry et al 2015 one of the purposes of this study is to compare this modification with the original model and see how the propeller results are affected at model scale 2 1 1 brief description of the γ r e θ transition model the γ r e θ transition model only computes local variables and gradients this model solves two additional transport equations one for the intermittency γ and another for the transition onset momentum thickness reynolds number r e θ t the transport equation for the intermittency is coupled with the turbulent model turning on the turbulent production or keeping the laminar regime depending on the intermittency value in our case the k ω s s t was selected as the turbulence model but any other alternative turbulence models could be also used the transport equation for r e θ t is an essential part of the model being the interface between the experimental correlation and the intermittency equation the general equations for γ r e θ transition model are 3 d ρ γ d t p γ e γ μ μ t σ f γ 4 d ρ r e θ t d t p θ t σ θ t μ μ t r e θ t where p γ and e γ are the intermittency production and destruction terms μ t is the turbulent viscosity σ f σ θ t are model constants and p θ t is the r e θ t production term a complete description of the model and its formulation including a detailed explanation of the production and destruction terms and constants of the model can be found in malan et al 2009 an additional term has been included in a new empirical correlation see langtry et al 2015 in order to capture cross flow effects this term considers the streamwise vorticity ω s t r e a m w i s e as an indicator of the local crossflow strength in the boundary layer 5 h c r o s s f l o w y ω s t r e a m w i s e u consequently the new empirical correlation including the cross flow effects r e θ t s c f is a function of the h c r o s s f l o w and the surface roughness h the full description of the new correlation including production destruction terms and constants can be found at langtry et al 2015 3 cases of study and set up 3 1 transition study of the m2355 profile firstly a comparison between the original γ r e θ model and the new version that includes cross flow effects is going to be presented in order to observe the differences between these models the m2355 is a deeply studied profile used as a test case by the aircraft company airbus we are going to study this profile for a constant sweep angle and different angles of attack a o a in table 1 the main parameters of the simulation are exposed a mesh convergence process has been carried out using the transition onset point as an indicator of the mesh convergence the mesh convergence has been carried out at a o a 0 and zero swept angle the improvements when the new correlation to capture cross flow was compared to the conventional γ r e θ model for different angles of attack were quantified the level of ambient turbulent intensity has been varied to test the influence of this parameter on the transition onset cross flow instabilities are the most important transition mechanism at low angles of attack when the flow is not parallel to the chord line of the profile see saric et al 2003 as the original γ r e θ transition model was designed only for bypass and natural ts transitions only we expect a relevant improvement in transition onset prediction when the cross flow term is included in the model 3 2 open water propellers study at model scale in the current study three ship propeller geometries are considered the two international towing tank conference ittc benchmark propellers vp1304 conventional and p1727 non conventional geometries and the new generation of contracted and loaded tip clt propeller gonzalez adalid et al 2016 gaggero et al 2016 although two of them are variable pitch propellers this study has been carried out at fixed pitch angle all cases have been computed at model scale for different advanced ratios j the conventional vp1304 propeller is a five blade conventional propeller while the p1727 and clt propellers have only four blades see figure 2 all of the propellers have been experimentally tested at model scale and will be compared to the numerical results obtained the main geometric characteristics of the propellers are in table 2 in all simulations an axisymmetric boundary condition has been used simulating only one propeller blade to avoid mesh rotation or remeshing at each time step the rotational term is added to the navier stokes equations being the propeller fixed to the computational domain and the equations were transformed for a moving reference frame the range of the advance coefficients j studied in this paper depends on the design point of each propeller and the range studied at each experimental campaign consequently different ranges are used for each propeller the conditions studied are summarized in table 3 4 mesh convergence study the computational domain has been designed taking into account the geometrical periodicity of the propeller in the azimuthal direction the diameter of the propeller d will be used as the characteristic length for the definition of the computational domain the cylindrical sector has a length of 9 d and radius of 10 d inside of which the propeller plane will be placed at 3 d behind the inflow boundary and at 6 d ahead of the outflow boundary for the meshing strategy several subdomains are used to control the mesh size the mesh size of these domains is relative to the base size h s which is one of the parameters changed during our mesh convergence process consequently all subdomains are remeshed proportionally that is what is called global mesh refinement the second parameter changed during the mesh convergence process is the number of prism layers in the boundary layer region n l a y e r s this number is varied between five and thirty see fig 3 the thickness of each layer follows a geometric progression and the total thickness of the prism layer δ t 200 δ 0 has been fixed for each propeller during the mesh convergence process the mesh thickness near the wall δ 0 is set to the value that gives a y 1 all the way around the blade this condition must be satisfied when the transition model is used a complete mesh convergence process was done for a different number of layers n l a y e r s in the prism layer in figure 4 it is possible to appreciate the different subdomains and a detailed view of the prism layer around the blade the mesh convergence process was monitored for a different number of prism layers and optimizes the most efficient value of prism layers to use inside the boundary layer 5 results all the parameters used during the cfd study were presented in section 3 and the mesh designs were described in section 4 in particular the m2355 profile was described in table 1 the geometric characteristics of the propellers are quantified in table 2 and the main parameters of the simulation for the propellers are in table 3 5 1 validation case the m2355 profile in this section we are going to present the laminar turbulent transition predictions for the m2355 profile although not many experimental results in the presence of crossflow and different angles of attack are found in the literature results from the airbus group experimental database are used for comparison the experimental transition locations were based on two different experimental techniques temperature sensitive painting tsp and hotfilm probes the 3d computational geometry was built by the extrusion of a 2d profile using periodic boundary conditions for the lateral planes the main objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of the new additional cross flow correlation r e θ s c f in the original γ r e θ transition model that takes into account cross flow effects details about the model can be found in section 2 1 the conditions for this simulation can be found in section 3 1 the transition location criterium used to locate the transition onset is the minimum of the skin friction curve this criterium is applied independently on both the suction and pressure sides at the middle cross section first a mesh convergence test is performed for five different meshes see fig 5 we observed that when the mesh refinement is increased the transition point moves toward the trailing edge in both suction and pressure sides the differences in the transition location was less than 1 when the two most refined meshes are compared in fig 6 the transition onset location is represented against the angle of attack with and without the crossflow correlation when the turbulence intensity parameter is t u 0 07 at the leading edge it can be observed that on the suction side the inclusion of the cross flow term improves the transition location prediction and moves the results closer to the experimental values on pressure side the experimental evidence in the absence of crossflow is that the transition onset moves toward the trailing edge when the angle of attack is increased see menter et al 2006 this tendency changes completely when experiments are performed in the presence of cross flow where the onset position moves toward the leading edge as the angle of attack is increased this behavior could be explained by the fact that when the angle of attack grows crossflow effects on the pressure side are increased see dagenhart 0000 saric et al 2003 this important change on the pressure side is not captured at all when the model does not include the cross flow modeling although the computational results on the pressure side are not close enough to the experimental values they improve when compared to the experiments when the crossflow term is added these differences could be justified due to the high dependance of the transition onset results on the environmental turbulence intensity and the surface roughness of the experimental model as the turbulence intensity value measured in the wind tunnel was not confirmed figure 7 presents a transition prediction study where computational and experimental values have been compared this comparison was made using typical values of the turbulent intensity found in wind tunnels for all the turbulent intensities values in figure 7 the crossflow correlation was used two different methods to control the turbulence intensity were used in the first one the turbulence intensity value decays from t u 1 at the inflow to t u 0 07 at the leading edge of the profile in the other cases a source of turbulent intensity all over the domain in the range t u 0 1 0 5 was used for all range of angles of attack on the suction side results indicate that larger turbulence intensity values move the transition onset towards the leading edge differences between experimental and computational values are reasonably small for the case when turbulence intensity is around t u 0 1 which is a typical value in wind tunnels for the pressure side similar changes in the turbulent intensity did not improve the overall results the slopes of the curves do not behave correctly even if the value of turbulent intensity is varied consequently the cross flow modeling should be improved on the pressure side in order to become closer to the experimental values 5 2 mesh convergence one of the most important things in order to trust the numerical computations is the mesh convergence process in this section the mesh convergence process is presented for each propeller using the dimensionless thrust k t and torque k q coefficients as convergence parameters results of the ittc benchmark test case for the well known vp1304 propeller in terms of dimensionless thrust and torque coefficients are presented in figure 8 as it was explained in section 4 the double mesh convergence process is based on two independent refinements a global refinement and a local refinement on the boundary layer region around the blades figure 8 shows both convergence processes a first one decreasing the global base size for a constant number of layers in the boundary layer region and a second pseudo convergence process increasing the number of prisms layers the result of this bi parametric process makes the converged value more trustworthy than other simpler mesh convergence processes there is an additional advantage when this kind of studies is performed in order to save computational resources observing how the mesh parameters affect the final converged result in figure 8 the dotted grey lines represent the convergence process when the global mesh size is fixed and the number of prisms layers is increased it should be remarked that the number of layers in the boundary layer area seems to be a more relevant choice in the mesh design than the global mesh size consequently meshes with more than 20 prism layers will always have an accurate approximation to the converged final values of k t and 10 k q even when the total number of cells is less than just a third of the finest mesh analogously in figure 9 the mesh convergence study for a p1727 tip rake propeller based on the global mesh size and the number of prisms layers in the boundary layer region is presented it can be observed in figure 9 that with in this kind of propeller when the number of cells is over a critical number around 10 million in this case the converged values are accurately computed even if the number of prism layers is not excessive finally figure 10 shows the mesh convergence study of the new generation of clt propellers in terms of dimensionless thrust and torque coefficients after this mesh convergence process performed for these three types of propellers we can assume that the errors in the future calculations due to the mesh design or mesh sizes will be reasonably controlled and the significant differences when compared to the reference values will be more related to the modelization of the complex physics that appears in these problems 5 3 open water simulations 5 3 1 p1727 tip rake propeller in this section the non conventional p1727 tip rake propeller results are presented the p1727 tip rake propeller was selected by the ittc as a benchmark case of for the scaling study of non convectional propellers in 2017 the experimental measurements performed in the sva towing tank are available for comparison see ittc 2017 the range of advance coefficients studied is from j 0 1 to j 0 9 for this case a mesh of 8193266 cells and 20 prism layers in the boundary layer were used three different models were used a fully turbulent k ω s s t model a γ r e θ transition model that controls the regions where the k ω s s t model is used and finally a third variant where the transition model includes crossflow terms in figure 11 we can observe the efficiency values η 0 in the open water curve given by equation 6 6 η 0 k t 2 k q π j although for j 0 5 the presence of transition models is not relevant important differences can be observed for j 0 5 where the γ r e θ with and without transition model approximate the experimental values quite accurately the only exception is j 0 9 which is out of the propeller s operative range in table 4 the difference between each method and the experimental values δ η 0 is presented we can observe that when transition models are used the differences with the experimental values are always below 2 for the whole range of advance coefficients the highest difference is found for the highest advance coefficient j 0 9 where the propeller efficiency curve decreases the j 0 9 value corresponds to a working point far from the design point which implies larger amounts of detached flow around the profiles and consequently a more complex hydrodynamics to simulate fig 12 presents the differences in k t and k q values with respect to the experimental results for a range of advance coefficients close to the design point of the propeller it can be observed that transition models improve the results in terms of thrust and torque and not only in terms of the global efficiency of the propeller in order to perform a local study of the transition phenomena the propeller blade was divided into 7 sections according to the ittc prescription see figure 13 on each section the skin friction coefficient c f has been averaged and represented along the non dimensional radius r r see figure 14 results show a clear improvement when the transition models are added to the simulation decreasing the averaged skin friction coefficients for all sections negligable differences are seen in this case when the crossflow transition model is included when the intermittency plots with and without the crossflow term are compared at j 0 5 close to the design advance coefficient j 0 56 minute differences are observed see figure 15 figure 16 shows the streamlines and the skin friction coefficients over suction and pressure sides for the three methods studied as before when fully turbulent flow is assumed the centrifugal component of the streamlines is not very intense and the streamlines follow a radial direction when the transition models are included the slope of the streamlines changes noticeably due to the centrifugal component this could be explained in terms of the tendency to rotate that the streamlines have in the laminar region where the skin friction coefficients are lower when compared to the turbulent areas with higher friction near the trailing edge an accumulation of streamlines following the radial direction is appreciated in both transition models when the crossflow term is added to the simulation higher skin friction coefficients are observed close to the trailing edge as can be seen local plots such as figure 16 show complementary information compared to sectional plots recommended by the ittc such as figure 14 where the average process hides local information 5 3 2 new generation of clt propeller in this section results of the new generation of clt propeller are presented this propeller was experimentally tested in 2016 in the cehipar towing tank facilities the advance coefficients studied are from 25 to 15 of the design point j 0 8 for this case a mesh of 6920765 cells and 20 prism layers in the boundary layer was used in figure 17 we can see the open water curve for different transition scenarios the transition models clearly improve the agreement with the experimental values compared to the fully turbulent case as in the previous propeller the largest differences are found again for the highest advance coefficients in order to quantify these differences table 5 shows a relative comparison between each method and the experimental results obtained from the cehipar model basin according to table 5 the transition models clearly improve the result in terms of the efficiency of the propeller being almost below two percent fig 18 presents the differences in k t and k q values with respect to the experimental results for different advance coefficients in this case all models underpredict overall results for thrust although the fully turbulent model performs better than the transition models for the torque coefficient these differences change when the thrust coefficient is computed where the transition models are more accurate as efficiency is a ratio between those coefficients where the k t is pondered with one order of magnitude more than that of k q see equation 6 the final efficiency tends to the experimental results when transition models are used as figure 17 shows figure 19 clearly shows the differences between these models in terms of the averaged skin friction coefficient on different sections along the radius depending on the transition model the transition onset moves appreciably from r r 0 85 without crossflow to r r 0 75 when the cross flow modelization is applied when the simulations with and without the crossflow term are compared in terms of intermittency for the clt propeller at r r 0 81 relevant differences are found in the suction side see figure 20 in order to present a more complete description of the transition that takes place on the clt propeller figure 21 shows the streamlines on both sides and a contour plot of the skin friction coefficient as with the other two propellers when a fully turbulent flow is assumed over the propeller s blade the centrifugal component barely affects the slope of the streamlines as can be observed when compared to the rest of the images where the transition model is included although the images for the γ r e θ with and without crossflow term seem to be very similar an appreciable difference in the averaged skin friction coefficient can be found near the tip region for r r 0 75 see figure 19 5 3 3 vp1304 conventional propeller in this section results for the vp1304 propeller are presented analogously to the first case this propeller was selected by the ittc as a benchmark case and experimental measurements provided by the sva towing tank are available for comparison with computational results see sva 2011 the range of advance coefficients studied are between j 0 6 and j 1 4 both included for this case a mesh of 9555805 cells and 20 prism layers in the boundary layer were used in figure 22 we can see the open water curves the quantitative differences between each method compared to the experimental results obtained from the ittc benchmark are quantified in table 6 the errors compared to the experimental values are below five and four percent for the fully turbulent case and for the γ r e θ transition model respectively it bears mentioning that when the cross flow correlation is included in the γ r e θ transition model it predicts the experimental efficiency values very accurately for all advance ratios being the difference below two percent in the worst case we can conclude that the improvement obtained when the crossflow term is added to the computational model is remarkable obtaining a good agreement with experimental values in figure 23 the prediction of the thrust and torque coefficient is quantified we can observe that the γ r e θ shows smaller differences in both the k t and k q coefficients than in the fully turbulent model although these results are slightly improved when the crossflow term is added the biggest differences with respect to the experimental values are found at j 1 4 a point which is far from the operative range of the propeller advance ratios that are situated on the decreasing part of the efficiency curve imply regions of the propeller working with negative angles of attack figure 24 shows the difference between these models in terms of the average of the skin friction coefficient for the different sections considered along the radius in this kind of representation we identify where the transition occurs by an increment in the skin friction coefficient the increasing part of the curve observed at the tip region r r 0 95 is not due to transition and can be interpreted as a consequence of the tip vortex phenomenon according to figure 24 we could only observe the transition onset when the crossflow term is applied to the model and a relevant increment in the skin friction coefficient is observed at r r 0 75 in order to have a more complete description of the transition phenomena on the tip region the intermittency contours have been plotted at r r 0 9375 in figure 25 where turbulent flow can be identified by intermittency values of γ 1 and laminar flow of γ 1 in this figure we can see that when the simulations with and without the crossflow correlation in the transition model are compared the transition onset moves towards the leading edge on both the suction side and the pressure sides being more intense and easier to appreciate on the pressure side this behavior can be explained due to the fact that crossflow is the most relevant transition cause on the pressure side see dagenhart 0000 figure 26 shows the streamlines over suction and pressure sides for the three different models studied the assumption of fully turbulent flow does not show the typical centrifugal component on the streamlines observed when a transition model is included when the γ r e θ model is added to the simulation a larger centrifugal component appears in the laminar area on both the suction and pressure sides while growing transition instabilities affect the streamlines at large radius near the trailing edge if a cross flow term completes the model higher skin friction coefficients are appreciated in the transition area and consequently the direction of the streamlines changes more abruptly when the transition phenomenon starts 5 4 comparison of the three propellers studied in this section a comparison between the three propellers studied is presented a study of the local and averaged skin friction coefficients for each blade section has been carried out and results are detailed in section 5 3 on each section s i represented by an averaged radius r i a reynolds based on the rotational and axial velocities and the middle chord length of the section number r e i can be defined as 7 r e i c r i j n d 2 r i n π 2 ν where c r i is the chord length on the middle of the section s i and ν μ ρ the kinematic viscosity in figure 27 the skin friction for each dimensionless section is compared among all propellers when the γ r e θ and crossflow terms are used and also when the flow is assumed as fully turbulent everywhere as can be observed the skin friction coefficient obtained is always lower when the transition effects are modeled for all the propellers tested the explanation of this reduction is that the laminar area characterized by lower skin friction values only appears when the transition model is included in figure 28 the same skin friction coefficient is represented as a function of the reynolds number of each section r e i laminar and turbulent curves for the flat plate cases are included as reference values it is important to note that the reynolds numbers range is larger for the vp1304 propeller than for the others due to its size we can appreciate that some curves have two different c f values for the same r e i due to differences in geometrical characteristics such as thickness and the angle of attack of each section the curve corresponding to the propeller p1727 when transition modeling is included remains almost parallel to the flat plate laminar curve indicating that no transition occurs in this propeller for large reynolds values r e 3 5 10 5 the clt and the p1727 cases both curves remain parallel to the flat plate turbulent reference when the k ω model is used different behavior can be observed for the clt and the vp1304 propellers when the transition model is added where a local growth at the large reynolds values in the skin friction coefficient indicates that transition occurs helicity values measure the crossflow strength of each case see langtry et al 2015 helicity values can be computed using equation 8 8 h d ω v r d n 2 figure 29 shows the distribution of the dimensionless helicity all over the suction side of the blade surface for each propeller it is possible to observe for r r 0 5 that the most affected propellers by the cross flow terms present larger helicity values between leading edge and middle chord regions in the case of the clt propeller the helicity increases very fast near the leading edge while in the vp1304 grows slower but monotonically and transition occurs closer to the trailing edge in the case of the p1727 propeller the helicity starts growing after the middle chord and transition is more related to a local laminar separation phenomenon at the trailing edge than a crossflow effect this fact is confirmed in figure 27 where the transition model does not increase the skin friction coefficient of the p1727 propeller between 0 93 r r 0 7 in order to test the influence of the reynolds number one the transition phenomena associated with crossflow the two propellers with smallest reynolds number range clt and p1727 are studied again by increasing its reynolds numbers in order to do this two different rotating velocities and consequently different reynolds numbers have been studied first a rotating velocity n 1 15 rps equal to the one tested in the towing tank and a higher one necessary to reach the reynolds number range of the vp1304 propeller the values of these second rotating velocities are n 2 30 rps and n 2 35 rps for the clt and p1727 propellers respectively in both cases the influence of the cross flow model splits the skin friction curves at smaller radii when higher rotating velocities are used see figures 30 and 31 figures 32 and 33 show the streamlines over the suction side for the largest reynolds number studied for the clt propeller case an important change on the streamline curvature can be seen on the middle region of the trailing edge when the cross flow is modeled for the p1727 propeller a similar change on the streamline curvature is also noted for the cross flow case while a completely different flow separation phenomena is observed in the absence of cross flow modeling the reader should be reminded the results obtained in section 5 3 where the cross flow term influence for these two propellers was not relevant and the reynolds numbers ranges where based on the lowest rotating velocity n 1 when larger reynolds numbers are used for these two propellers strong differences that underline the importance of accurate transition modeling in the cfd simulations unfortunately in these cases where high rotating velocities are used no experimental results are available for comparison 6 conclusions three different model scale propellers have been studied from a computational point of view and the upcoming results have been compared with open water experiments performed in well reputed towing tanks the computational approach starts with a mesh convergence process in order to avoid numerical errors due to the mesh discretization a double convergence process based on the refinement of the general mesh size but also the number of prism layers on the boundary layer region was performed and practical recommendations have been obtained during this process as the transition phenomena has been experimentally observed in painting tests on model scale propellers a model that includes the turbulent and transition phenomena that takes place around the ship propellers has been used and compared to other models where a fully turbulent regime is assumed in particular two variants of the transition model have been used in order to test the influence of the cross flow phenomena that are presumably relevant in rotating flows consequently the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations complemented with the k ω equations and the γ r e θ transition model equations including the cross flow correlation were used to model all the highly complex hydrodynamics involved in ship propellers the γ r e θ transition model has been able to perform accurately and efficiently showing an agreement around 1 in terms of efficiency and below 5 in terms of k q and k t when compared to the experimental results at the design point it is also worth mentioning that the matching with the experimental values obtained when the transition models are implemented is more accurate than when the fully turbulent assumption is used having in the first case larger laminar regions on the blade as rotating elements are canonical examples where crossflow instability is present in 3d boundary layers the importance of the crossflow transition has been studied a first benchmark case based on the local transition measurements on an m2355 profile with 25 of sweep angle was done the new correlation for model transition onset that includes cross flow effect improves the results on both sides of the profile but only a good experimental matching for certain levels of the ambient turbulence intensity is found on the suction side it is observed that the addition of cross flow terms boosts the transition onset and consequently larger turbulent areas are present on the blade when compared to transition models that do not include this particular mechanism when the performance of the crossflow term is compared in the three propellers the case vp1304 is the most affected propeller due to the highest reynolds number used in the simulation in order to match the experimental setup while no such important changes are appreciated in the other two propellers these results suggest that the relevance of the crossflow term in the global result increases when the rotating velocity the centrifugal forces and reynolds number grow to confirm this conclusion the clt and p1727 propellers were tested again increasing the reynolds through the rotating velocity obtaining relevant differences with and without the cross flow inclusion in the model we can also conclude that when the reynolds numbers grow the cross flow transition mechanism is stimulated by the action of the centrifugal forces and consequently it is important to include the cross flow modeling in rotating systems such as model scale ship propellers acknowledgments the research leading to these results has received funding from the spanish ministery of defence under the project

23447,at model scale propellers conventional turbulence models assume turbulent regimes all over the blade surface and consequently do not obtain accurate predictions that can be compared to experimental results two aspects could be improved in order to produce a better description of the flow complexity generated in these turbulent rotating systems the inclusion of transition phenomena assumptions that normally take place in these flows and a particular modeling of those transition mechanisms such as cross flow that appear at model scale propellers in this paper a new modified γ r e θ correlation based model for transition prediction that takes into account crossflow effects is applied to model scale ship propellers for a wide range of advanced ratios and its results are compared to their corresponding experimental results the average values of the skin friction coefficients on different parts of the blade and the streamlines distribution are studied and compared between different propellers the results obtained with these improvements show an agreement of about 1 in terms of efficiency and below 5 in terms of thrust and torque coefficients when compared to the experimental results at the design point the dependance of the cross flow mechanism on the reynolds number is studied by changing the rotating velocity of the different propellers results show that the relevance of this mechanism grows when the rotating velocity the centrifugal forces and reynolds number increase consequently when the reynolds numbers grows the cross flow transition mechanism is

known that numerical simulation and in particular computational fluid dynamics cfd is one of the most powerful tools that the propeller designer can use nowadays the possibilities of recomputing after introducing geometrical changes extracting detailed flow quantities and analyzing the flow behavior near the propeller blades are attractive options that all engineers wish for when a propeller is designed as kawamura 2011 comments different restrictions such as model size flow velocity and adequate instruments for measurements are avoided when numerical simulation is used as a design tool in order to give a scientific perspective on the possibilities shown by numerical methods it should be acknowledged that the evaluation of the accuracy of cfd methods is not a simple task the performance of the mathematical models is not always accurate enough to capture the essence of such complex phenomena such as laminar turbulent transition or turbulent shear stress the inherent non linearity of fluid dynamics equations and the necessity of discretization methods based on complex mesh designs also add error sources to the computations because cfd are not yet completely accurate it is a good practice to compare them with experimental results it is assumed that in well validated codes the residual errors due to the uncoupling linearisation of the transport equations and solution of linear systems are several orders of magnitude lower than mesh discretization errors in rijpkema 2015 a numerical uncertainty analysis commonly referred to as verification based on a least squares fit of numerical solutions was performed following the procedure of eça and hoekstra 2014 this procedure has been criticized by xing and stern 2014 indicating several drawbacks these grid convergence studies based on systematically refined grid spacing are very useful when simple geometries are used but unfortunately this is not the case when marine propellers are analyzed and it is impractical to refine the whole the grid systematically in these cases the most sensitive part of the grid refinement is found on the blade boundary layers where not only the grid spacing but also the grid distribution and the boundary layer height must be iterated until a grid independent solution is obtained a grid convergence study based on the boundary layer parameters has been performed in this work looking for the idea of obtaining mesh independent results when certain mesh criteria are followed the flow over the propeller at model scale reynolds numbers is clearly in the critical reynolds range where transition from laminar to turbulent flow takes place marine propellers are one of those cfd applications where transitional effects at model scale are specially important if an accurate prediction of the propeller efficiency is searched for visualization of the flow at these reynolds numbers for example with the help of paint tests typically shows regions of laminar and turbulent flows on the blade as for example discussed in kuiper 1981 2000 sánchez caja et al 2014 bhattacharyya et al 2016 the paint streak s direction depends much on the shear stress which increases drastically when the flows transitions from laminar to turbulent regime consequently paint streaks are radially directed on laminar regions while they are more azimuthal where the flow is turbulent it is well known that even at model scale the reynolds numbers are too large to resolve all the eddy scales involved in the physical phenomenon and consequently turbulence models such as k ω or the k ε are necessary to add the turbulent effects when the averaged flow is computed additionally transition models should be also implemented when model scale propellers are simulated due to the laminar turbulent transition phenomenon correlation based transition models using local variables have been in continuous development in menter et al 2004 first proposed these models as a practical solution to transition prediction in cfd codes based on complex unstructured meshes abu ghannam and shaw 1980 menter et al 2006 malan et al 2009 in langtry and menter 2009 presented the full formulation of the γ r e θ and malan et al 2009 presented its implementation in a commercial cfd solver nowadays correlation based methods for transition prediction are being used in different sectors such as aeronautical or marine industries and they are becoming an important tool for designers recently the γ r e θ transition model was extended to capture crossflow effects by langtry et al 2015 without any violation of the lctm local correlation based transition model approach this overcame one of the weakness of these model the correlation method that they used previously was for bypass and natural ts transitions only at model scale conventional turbulence models assume turbulent regimes all over the blade surface and consequently do not obtain an accurate prediction that can be compared to local experimental results due to the absence of transition phenomena assumptions in the boundary layer for this reason one needs improved cfd computation incorporating γ r e θ transition model which should be applied in order to reproduce the complex phenomena that take place in model scale computation one of the first model scale cfd open water tests was presented by bhattacharyya et al 2015 in the last smp15 as many authors confirm e g langtry 2006 traditional methods for transition prediction based on integral computations are impractical from a computational point of view the γ r e θ transition model menter et al 2006 is a correlation based approach for transition modeling that was specifically designed for cfd codes the dependance of the model on the correlation is the main drawback of this method which implies some expertise if the method has to be applied to particular problems in this work the γ r e θ implementation of the starccm software will be used this implementation has demonstrated the capacity to deal with flat plates 2d airfoils 3d multi element airfoils and even in ship propellers by bhattacharyya et al 2015 research has identified several types of instabilities such as attachment line streamwise centrifugal and crossflow see saric et al 2003 since 1989 flow around rotating disks is presented by reed and saric as one of the canonical examples where crossflow instability is present in 3d boundary layers the combined influences of sweep and pressure gradients produce curved streamlines at the boundary layer edge pressure gradient is unchanged inside the boundary layer while the streamwise velocity is reduced consequently the centripetal acceleration does not balance the pressure gradient and a secondary flow called crossflow appears perpendicular to the direction of the inviscid streamline due to the no slip boundary condition crossflow velocity must be zero at the wall and an inflection point appears as a source of an inviscid instability the authors consider important to include the crossflow effects as one of the typical causes of laminar turbulent transition at model scale propellers in the calculation of model scale ship propellers the twist in the propeller boundary layer can be clearly appreciated see figure 1 this case presents an evident similarity when compared to the scheme of a normal 3d boundary layer in a swept wing presented by saric et al 2003 this paper is organized as follows first a description of the numerical method applied is presented in section 2 in section 3 the characteristics of the fluid dynamics problem is well described in section 4 the philosophy of the mesh study carried out and the mesh convergence results are presented for all the cases finally results are presented and discussed in section 5 followed by the final conclusions 2 numerical method the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations are discretized in space by the finite volume method using starccm a semi implicit method known as simple algorithm is used to handle the coupling of the navier stokes equations and calculate the primitive variables such as pressure and velocity at each time step the temporal discretization solver used is a first order implicit scheme for these simulations five inner iterations per time step are used to ensure low residuals in the conservation laws involved in the simulation this software has been used in numerous works in different parts of hydrodynamics and particularly in propellers computations see bhattacharyya et al 2015 and malan et al 2009 as examples the rans equations for incompressible flow for a moving reference frame that rotates with constant angular velocity ω r can be written as 1 v r 0 2 v r t v r v r 2 ω r u r ω r ω r r 1 ρ p μ 2 v r f where v r is the relative velocity and p the fluid pressure r is the radial vector from the rotation axis ρ and μ are the water density and dynamic viscosity respectively and f is an external body force in our case inertial force equations 1 and 2 have been complemented with the k ω s s t turbulence model that computes the turbulent kinetic energy k the specific rate of dissipation ω and the eddy kinematic viscosity ν t k ω see wilcox 2006 in order to detect the different laminar and turbulent regions a γ r e θ transition model has been also added to the set of equations details of this transition model are presented in section 2 1 for further reading see menter et al 2004 menter et al 2006 langtry and menter 2009 malan et al 2009 the boundary conditions for these cases are the same ones usually found in the literature the propeller blades are modeled as rotating non slip surfaces with the velocity field matching the propeller s rotational speed a uniform flow condition is applied to the inlet and peripheral surfaces at the outlet the streamwise gradients of the flow variables as well as the pressure differences are set to zero for the uniform flow computations only one blade has been used due to the periodicity of the propeller geometry 2 1 transition laminar to turbulent transition is a very complex phenomenon where huge amounts of scientific work have been accomplished different approaches to study laminar turbulent transition have been developed and the most efficient methods to model this phenomenon are stability theory approach low reynolds number approach the intermittency transport method with empirical correlation the laminar fluctuation energy methods les and dns method the v 2 f model the intermittency and vorticity reynolds number approach a detailed explanation of each method can be found in the work of di pasquale et al 2009 in particular the γ r e θ t correlation based transition model which is totally compatible with modern cfd codes based on unstructured meshes has been chosen recently this model has been extended in order to be able to capture stationary cross flow effects by muller and herbst 2014 and langtry et al 2015 one of the purposes of this study is to compare this modification with the original model and see how the propeller results are affected at model scale 2 1 1 brief description of the γ r e θ transition model the γ r e θ transition model only computes local variables and gradients this model solves two additional transport equations one for the intermittency γ and another for the transition onset momentum thickness reynolds number r e θ t the transport equation for the intermittency is coupled with the turbulent model turning on the turbulent production or keeping the laminar regime depending on the intermittency value in our case the k ω s s t was selected as the turbulence model but any other alternative turbulence models could be also used the transport equation for r e θ t is an essential part of the model being the interface between the experimental correlation and the intermittency equation the general equations for γ r e θ transition model are 3 d ρ γ d t p γ e γ μ μ t σ f γ 4 d ρ r e θ t d t p θ t σ θ t μ μ t r e θ t where p γ and e γ are the intermittency production and destruction terms μ t is the turbulent viscosity σ f σ θ t are model constants and p θ t is the r e θ t production term a complete description of the model and its formulation including a detailed explanation of the production and destruction terms and constants of the model can be found in malan et al 2009 an additional term has been included in a new empirical correlation see langtry et al 2015 in order to capture cross flow effects this term considers the streamwise vorticity ω s t r e a m w i s e as an indicator of the local crossflow strength in the boundary layer 5 h c r o s s f l o w y ω s t r e a m w i s e u consequently the new empirical correlation including the cross flow effects r e θ t s c f is a function of the h c r o s s f l o w and the surface roughness h the full description of the new correlation including production destruction terms and constants can be found at langtry et al 2015 3 cases of study and set up 3 1 transition study of the m2355 profile firstly a comparison between the original γ r e θ model and the new version that includes cross flow effects is going to be presented in order to observe the differences between these models the m2355 is a deeply studied profile used as a test case by the aircraft company airbus we are going to study this profile for a constant sweep angle and different angles of attack a o a in table 1 the main parameters of the simulation are exposed a mesh convergence process has been carried out using the transition onset point as an indicator of the mesh convergence the mesh convergence has been carried out at a o a 0 and zero swept angle the improvements when the new correlation to capture cross flow was compared to the conventional γ r e θ model for different angles of attack were quantified the level of ambient turbulent intensity has been varied to test the influence of this parameter on the transition onset cross flow instabilities are the most important transition mechanism at low angles of attack when the flow is not parallel to the chord line of the profile see saric et al 2003 as the original γ r e θ transition model was designed only for bypass and natural ts transitions only we expect a relevant improvement in transition onset prediction when the cross flow term is included in the model 3 2 open water propellers study at model scale in the current study three ship propeller geometries are considered the two international towing tank conference ittc benchmark propellers vp1304 conventional and p1727 non conventional geometries and the new generation of contracted and loaded tip clt propeller gonzalez adalid et al 2016 gaggero et al 2016 although two of them are variable pitch propellers this study has been carried out at fixed pitch angle all cases have been computed at model scale for different advanced ratios j the conventional vp1304 propeller is a five blade conventional propeller while the p1727 and clt propellers have only four blades see figure 2 all of the propellers have been experimentally tested at model scale and will be compared to the numerical results obtained the main geometric characteristics of the propellers are in table 2 in all simulations an axisymmetric boundary condition has been used simulating only one propeller blade to avoid mesh rotation or remeshing at each time step the rotational term is added to the navier stokes equations being the propeller fixed to the computational domain and the equations were transformed for a moving reference frame the range of the advance coefficients j studied in this paper depends on the design point of each propeller and the range studied at each experimental campaign consequently different ranges are used for each propeller the conditions studied are summarized in table 3 4 mesh convergence study the computational domain has been designed taking into account the geometrical periodicity of the propeller in the azimuthal direction the diameter of the propeller d will be used as the characteristic length for the definition of the computational domain the cylindrical sector has a length of 9 d and radius of 10 d inside of which the propeller plane will be placed at 3 d behind the inflow boundary and at 6 d ahead of the outflow boundary for the meshing strategy several subdomains are used to control the mesh size the mesh size of these domains is relative to the base size h s which is one of the parameters changed during our mesh convergence process consequently all subdomains are remeshed proportionally that is what is called global mesh refinement the second parameter changed during the mesh convergence process is the number of prism layers in the boundary layer region n l a y e r s this number is varied between five and thirty see fig 3 the thickness of each layer follows a geometric progression and the total thickness of the prism layer δ t 200 δ 0 has been fixed for each propeller during the mesh convergence process the mesh thickness near the wall δ 0 is set to the value that gives a y 1 all the way around the blade this condition must be satisfied when the transition model is used a complete mesh convergence process was done for a different number of layers n l a y e r s in the prism layer in figure 4 it is possible to appreciate the different subdomains and a detailed view of the prism layer around the blade the mesh convergence process was monitored for a different number of prism layers and optimizes the most efficient value of prism layers to use inside the boundary layer 5 results all the parameters used during the cfd study were presented in section 3 and the mesh designs were described in section 4 in particular the m2355 profile was described in table 1 the geometric characteristics of the propellers are quantified in table 2 and the main parameters of the simulation for the propellers are in table 3 5 1 validation case the m2355 profile in this section we are going to present the laminar turbulent transition predictions for the m2355 profile although not many experimental results in the presence of crossflow and different angles of attack are found in the literature results from the airbus group experimental database are used for comparison the experimental transition locations were based on two different experimental techniques temperature sensitive painting tsp and hotfilm probes the 3d computational geometry was built by the extrusion of a 2d profile using periodic boundary conditions for the lateral planes the main objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of the new additional cross flow correlation r e θ s c f in the original γ r e θ transition model that takes into account cross flow effects details about the model can be found in section 2 1 the conditions for this simulation can be found in section 3 1 the transition location criterium used to locate the transition onset is the minimum of the skin friction curve this criterium is applied independently on both the suction and pressure sides at the middle cross section first a mesh convergence test is performed for five different meshes see fig 5 we observed that when the mesh refinement is increased the transition point moves toward the trailing edge in both suction and pressure sides the differences in the transition location was less than 1 when the two most refined meshes are compared in fig 6 the transition onset location is represented against the angle of attack with and without the crossflow correlation when the turbulence intensity parameter is t u 0 07 at the leading edge it can be observed that on the suction side the inclusion of the cross flow term improves the transition location prediction and moves the results closer to the experimental values on pressure side the experimental evidence in the absence of crossflow is that the transition onset moves toward the trailing edge when the angle of attack is increased see menter et al 2006 this tendency changes completely when experiments are performed in the presence of cross flow where the onset position moves toward the leading edge as the angle of attack is increased this behavior could be explained by the fact that when the angle of attack grows crossflow effects on the pressure side are increased see dagenhart 0000 saric et al 2003 this important change on the pressure side is not captured at all when the model does not include the cross flow modeling although the computational results on the pressure side are not close enough to the experimental values they improve when compared to the experiments when the crossflow term is added these differences could be justified due to the high dependance of the transition onset results on the environmental turbulence intensity and the surface roughness of the experimental model as the turbulence intensity value measured in the wind tunnel was not confirmed figure 7 presents a transition prediction study where computational and experimental values have been compared this comparison was made using typical values of the turbulent intensity found in wind tunnels for all the turbulent intensities values in figure 7 the crossflow correlation was used two different methods to control the turbulence intensity were used in the first one the turbulence intensity value decays from t u 1 at the inflow to t u 0 07 at the leading edge of the profile in the other cases a source of turbulent intensity all over the domain in the range t u 0 1 0 5 was used for all range of angles of attack on the suction side results indicate that larger turbulence intensity values move the transition onset towards the leading edge differences between experimental and computational values are reasonably small for the case when turbulence intensity is around t u 0 1 which is a typical value in wind tunnels for the pressure side similar changes in the turbulent intensity did not improve the overall results the slopes of the curves do not behave correctly even if the value of turbulent intensity is varied consequently the cross flow modeling should be improved on the pressure side in order to become closer to the experimental values 5 2 mesh convergence one of the most important things in order to trust the numerical computations is the mesh convergence process in this section the mesh convergence process is presented for each propeller using the dimensionless thrust k t and torque k q coefficients as convergence parameters results of the ittc benchmark test case for the well known vp1304 propeller in terms of dimensionless thrust and torque coefficients are presented in figure 8 as it was explained in section 4 the double mesh convergence process is based on two independent refinements a global refinement and a local refinement on the boundary layer region around the blades figure 8 shows both convergence processes a first one decreasing the global base size for a constant number of layers in the boundary layer region and a second pseudo convergence process increasing the number of prisms layers the result of this bi parametric process makes the converged value more trustworthy than other simpler mesh convergence processes there is an additional advantage when this kind of studies is performed in order to save computational resources observing how the mesh parameters affect the final converged result in figure 8 the dotted grey lines represent the convergence process when the global mesh size is fixed and the number of prisms layers is increased it should be remarked that the number of layers in the boundary layer area seems to be a more relevant choice in the mesh design than the global mesh size consequently meshes with more than 20 prism layers will always have an accurate approximation to the converged final values of k t and 10 k q even when the total number of cells is less than just a third of the finest mesh analogously in figure 9 the mesh convergence study for a p1727 tip rake propeller based on the global mesh size and the number of prisms layers in the boundary layer region is presented it can be observed in figure 9 that with in this kind of propeller when the number of cells is over a critical number around 10 million in this case the converged values are accurately computed even if the number of prism layers is not excessive finally figure 10 shows the mesh convergence study of the new generation of clt propellers in terms of dimensionless thrust and torque coefficients after this mesh convergence process performed for these three types of propellers we can assume that the errors in the future calculations due to the mesh design or mesh sizes will be reasonably controlled and the significant differences when compared to the reference values will be more related to the modelization of the complex physics that appears in these problems 5 3 open water simulations 5 3 1 p1727 tip rake propeller in this section the non conventional p1727 tip rake propeller results are presented the p1727 tip rake propeller was selected by the ittc as a benchmark case of for the scaling study of non convectional propellers in 2017 the experimental measurements performed in the sva towing tank are available for comparison see ittc 2017 the range of advance coefficients studied is from j 0 1 to j 0 9 for this case a mesh of 8193266 cells and 20 prism layers in the boundary layer were used three different models were used a fully turbulent k ω s s t model a γ r e θ transition model that controls the regions where the k ω s s t model is used and finally a third variant where the transition model includes crossflow terms in figure 11 we can observe the efficiency values η 0 in the open water curve given by equation 6 6 η 0 k t 2 k q π j although for j 0 5 the presence of transition models is not relevant important differences can be observed for j 0 5 where the γ r e θ with and without transition model approximate the experimental values quite accurately the only exception is j 0 9 which is out of the propeller s operative range in table 4 the difference between each method and the experimental values δ η 0 is presented we can observe that when transition models are used the differences with the experimental values are always below 2 for the whole range of advance coefficients the highest difference is found for the highest advance coefficient j 0 9 where the propeller efficiency curve decreases the j 0 9 value corresponds to a working point far from the design point which implies larger amounts of detached flow around the profiles and consequently a more complex hydrodynamics to simulate fig 12 presents the differences in k t and k q values with respect to the experimental results for a range of advance coefficients close to the design point of the propeller it can be observed that transition models improve the results in terms of thrust and torque and not only in terms of the global efficiency of the propeller in order to perform a local study of the transition phenomena the propeller blade was divided into 7 sections according to the ittc prescription see figure 13 on each section the skin friction coefficient c f has been averaged and represented along the non dimensional radius r r see figure 14 results show a clear improvement when the transition models are added to the simulation decreasing the averaged skin friction coefficients for all sections negligable differences are seen in this case when the crossflow transition model is included when the intermittency plots with and without the crossflow term are compared at j 0 5 close to the design advance coefficient j 0 56 minute differences are observed see figure 15 figure 16 shows the streamlines and the skin friction coefficients over suction and pressure sides for the three methods studied as before when fully turbulent flow is assumed the centrifugal component of the streamlines is not very intense and the streamlines follow a radial direction when the transition models are included the slope of the streamlines changes noticeably due to the centrifugal component this could be explained in terms of the tendency to rotate that the streamlines have in the laminar region where the skin friction coefficients are lower when compared to the turbulent areas with higher friction near the trailing edge an accumulation of streamlines following the radial direction is appreciated in both transition models when the crossflow term is added to the simulation higher skin friction coefficients are observed close to the trailing edge as can be seen local plots such as figure 16 show complementary information compared to sectional plots recommended by the ittc such as figure 14 where the average process hides local information 5 3 2 new generation of clt propeller in this section results of the new generation of clt propeller are presented this propeller was experimentally tested in 2016 in the cehipar towing tank facilities the advance coefficients studied are from 25 to 15 of the design point j 0 8 for this case a mesh of 6920765 cells and 20 prism layers in the boundary layer was used in figure 17 we can see the open water curve for different transition scenarios the transition models clearly improve the agreement with the experimental values compared to the fully turbulent case as in the previous propeller the largest differences are found again for the highest advance coefficients in order to quantify these differences table 5 shows a relative comparison between each method and the experimental results obtained from the cehipar model basin according to table 5 the transition models clearly improve the result in terms of the efficiency of the propeller being almost below two percent fig 18 presents the differences in k t and k q values with respect to the experimental results for different advance coefficients in this case all models underpredict overall results for thrust although the fully turbulent model performs better than the transition models for the torque coefficient these differences change when the thrust coefficient is computed where the transition models are more accurate as efficiency is a ratio between those coefficients where the k t is pondered with one order of magnitude more than that of k q see equation 6 the final efficiency tends to the experimental results when transition models are used as figure 17 shows figure 19 clearly shows the differences between these models in terms of the averaged skin friction coefficient on different sections along the radius depending on the transition model the transition onset moves appreciably from r r 0 85 without crossflow to r r 0 75 when the cross flow modelization is applied when the simulations with and without the crossflow term are compared in terms of intermittency for the clt propeller at r r 0 81 relevant differences are found in the suction side see figure 20 in order to present a more complete description of the transition that takes place on the clt propeller figure 21 shows the streamlines on both sides and a contour plot of the skin friction coefficient as with the other two propellers when a fully turbulent flow is assumed over the propeller s blade the centrifugal component barely affects the slope of the streamlines as can be observed when compared to the rest of the images where the transition model is included although the images for the γ r e θ with and without crossflow term seem to be very similar an appreciable difference in the averaged skin friction coefficient can be found near the tip region for r r 0 75 see figure 19 5 3 3 vp1304 conventional propeller in this section results for the vp1304 propeller are presented analogously to the first case this propeller was selected by the ittc as a benchmark case and experimental measurements provided by the sva towing tank are available for comparison with computational results see sva 2011 the range of advance coefficients studied are between j 0 6 and j 1 4 both included for this case a mesh of 9555805 cells and 20 prism layers in the boundary layer were used in figure 22 we can see the open water curves the quantitative differences between each method compared to the experimental results obtained from the ittc benchmark are quantified in table 6 the errors compared to the experimental values are below five and four percent for the fully turbulent case and for the γ r e θ transition model respectively it bears mentioning that when the cross flow correlation is included in the γ r e θ transition model it predicts the experimental efficiency values very accurately for all advance ratios being the difference below two percent in the worst case we can conclude that the improvement obtained when the crossflow term is added to the computational model is remarkable obtaining a good agreement with experimental values in figure 23 the prediction of the thrust and torque coefficient is quantified we can observe that the γ r e θ shows smaller differences in both the k t and k q coefficients than in the fully turbulent model although these results are slightly improved when the crossflow term is added the biggest differences with respect to the experimental values are found at j 1 4 a point which is far from the operative range of the propeller advance ratios that are situated on the decreasing part of the efficiency curve imply regions of the propeller working with negative angles of attack figure 24 shows the difference between these models in terms of the average of the skin friction coefficient for the different sections considered along the radius in this kind of representation we identify where the transition occurs by an increment in the skin friction coefficient the increasing part of the curve observed at the tip region r r 0 95 is not due to transition and can be interpreted as a consequence of the tip vortex phenomenon according to figure 24 we could only observe the transition onset when the crossflow term is applied to the model and a relevant increment in the skin friction coefficient is observed at r r 0 75 in order to have a more complete description of the transition phenomena on the tip region the intermittency contours have been plotted at r r 0 9375 in figure 25 where turbulent flow can be identified by intermittency values of γ 1 and laminar flow of γ 1 in this figure we can see that when the simulations with and without the crossflow correlation in the transition model are compared the transition onset moves towards the leading edge on both the suction side and the pressure sides being more intense and easier to appreciate on the pressure side this behavior can be explained due to the fact that crossflow is the most relevant transition cause on the pressure side see dagenhart 0000 figure 26 shows the streamlines over suction and pressure sides for the three different models studied the assumption of fully turbulent flow does not show the typical centrifugal component on the streamlines observed when a transition model is included when the γ r e θ model is added to the simulation a larger centrifugal component appears in the laminar area on both the suction and pressure sides while growing transition instabilities affect the streamlines at large radius near the trailing edge if a cross flow term completes the model higher skin friction coefficients are appreciated in the transition area and consequently the direction of the streamlines changes more abruptly when the transition phenomenon starts 5 4 comparison of the three propellers studied in this section a comparison between the three propellers studied is presented a study of the local and averaged skin friction coefficients for each blade section has been carried out and results are detailed in section 5 3 on each section s i represented by an averaged radius r i a reynolds based on the rotational and axial velocities and the middle chord length of the section number r e i can be defined as 7 r e i c r i j n d 2 r i n π 2 ν where c r i is the chord length on the middle of the section s i and ν μ ρ the kinematic viscosity in figure 27 the skin friction for each dimensionless section is compared among all propellers when the γ r e θ and crossflow terms are used and also when the flow is assumed as fully turbulent everywhere as can be observed the skin friction coefficient obtained is always lower when the transition effects are modeled for all the propellers tested the explanation of this reduction is that the laminar area characterized by lower skin friction values only appears when the transition model is included in figure 28 the same skin friction coefficient is represented as a function of the reynolds number of each section r e i laminar and turbulent curves for the flat plate cases are included as reference values it is important to note that the reynolds numbers range is larger for the vp1304 propeller than for the others due to its size we can appreciate that some curves have two different c f values for the same r e i due to differences in geometrical characteristics such as thickness and the angle of attack of each section the curve corresponding to the propeller p1727 when transition modeling is included remains almost parallel to the flat plate laminar curve indicating that no transition occurs in this propeller for large reynolds values r e 3 5 10 5 the clt and the p1727 cases both curves remain parallel to the flat plate turbulent reference when the k ω model is used different behavior can be observed for the clt and the vp1304 propellers when the transition model is added where a local growth at the large reynolds values in the skin friction coefficient indicates that transition occurs helicity values measure the crossflow strength of each case see langtry et al 2015 helicity values can be computed using equation 8 8 h d ω v r d n 2 figure 29 shows the distribution of the dimensionless helicity all over the suction side of the blade surface for each propeller it is possible to observe for r r 0 5 that the most affected propellers by the cross flow terms present larger helicity values between leading edge and middle chord regions in the case of the clt propeller the helicity increases very fast near the leading edge while in the vp1304 grows slower but monotonically and transition occurs closer to the trailing edge in the case of the p1727 propeller the helicity starts growing after the middle chord and transition is more related to a local laminar separation phenomenon at the trailing edge than a crossflow effect this fact is confirmed in figure 27 where the transition model does not increase the skin friction coefficient of the p1727 propeller between 0 93 r r 0 7 in order to test the influence of the reynolds number one the transition phenomena associated with crossflow the two propellers with smallest reynolds number range clt and p1727 are studied again by increasing its reynolds numbers in order to do this two different rotating velocities and consequently different reynolds numbers have been studied first a rotating velocity n 1 15 rps equal to the one tested in the towing tank and a higher one necessary to reach the reynolds number range of the vp1304 propeller the values of these second rotating velocities are n 2 30 rps and n 2 35 rps for the clt and p1727 propellers respectively in both cases the influence of the cross flow model splits the skin friction curves at smaller radii when higher rotating velocities are used see figures 30 and 31 figures 32 and 33 show the streamlines over the suction side for the largest reynolds number studied for the clt propeller case an important change on the streamline curvature can be seen on the middle region of the trailing edge when the cross flow is modeled for the p1727 propeller a similar change on the streamline curvature is also noted for the cross flow case while a completely different flow separation phenomena is observed in the absence of cross flow modeling the reader should be reminded the results obtained in section 5 3 where the cross flow term influence for these two propellers was not relevant and the reynolds numbers ranges where based on the lowest rotating velocity n 1 when larger reynolds numbers are used for these two propellers strong differences that underline the importance of accurate transition modeling in the cfd simulations unfortunately in these cases where high rotating velocities are used no experimental results are available for comparison 6 conclusions three different model scale propellers have been studied from a computational point of view and the upcoming results have been compared with open water experiments performed in well reputed towing tanks the computational approach starts with a mesh convergence process in order to avoid numerical errors due to the mesh discretization a double convergence process based on the refinement of the general mesh size but also the number of prism layers on the boundary layer region was performed and practical recommendations have been obtained during this process as the transition phenomena has been experimentally observed in painting tests on model scale propellers a model that includes the turbulent and transition phenomena that takes place around the ship propellers has been used and compared to other models where a fully turbulent regime is assumed in particular two variants of the transition model have been used in order to test the influence of the cross flow phenomena that are presumably relevant in rotating flows consequently the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations complemented with the k ω equations and the γ r e θ transition model equations including the cross flow correlation were used to model all the highly complex hydrodynamics involved in ship propellers the γ r e θ transition model has been able to perform accurately and efficiently showing an agreement around 1 in terms of efficiency and below 5 in terms of k q and k t when compared to the experimental results at the design point it is also worth mentioning that the matching with the experimental values obtained when the transition models are implemented is more accurate than when the fully turbulent assumption is used having in the first case larger laminar regions on the blade as rotating elements are canonical examples where crossflow instability is present in 3d boundary layers the importance of the crossflow transition has been studied a first benchmark case based on the local transition measurements on an m2355 profile with 25 of sweep angle was done the new correlation for model transition onset that includes cross flow effect improves the results on both sides of the profile but only a good experimental matching for certain levels of the ambient turbulence intensity is found on the suction side it is observed that the addition of cross flow terms boosts the transition onset and consequently larger turbulent areas are present on the blade when compared to transition models that do not include this particular mechanism when the performance of the crossflow term is compared in the three propellers the case vp1304 is the most affected propeller due to the highest reynolds number used in the simulation in order to match the experimental setup while no such important changes are appreciated in the other two propellers these results suggest that the relevance of the crossflow term in the global result increases when the rotating velocity the centrifugal forces and reynolds number grow to confirm this conclusion the clt and p1727 propellers were tested again increasing the reynolds through the rotating velocity obtaining relevant differences with and without the cross flow inclusion in the model we can also conclude that when the reynolds numbers grow the cross flow transition mechanism is stimulated by the action of the centrifugal forces and consequently it is important to include the cross flow modeling in rotating systems such as model scale ship propellers acknowledgments the research leading to these results has received funding from the spanish ministery of defence under the project

23448,when tidal turbines are utilized in the most energetic waters where there are significant waves the assessment of the surface wave effects are of great concerns the objective of this paper is to contribute to a fundamental understanding of surface wave effects on tidal turbines a numerical model was developed based on the modified blade element momentum theory with an inclusion of added mass effects wave excitation forces and a one degree of freedom dof simulation for turbine rotational motion the experiments on a 1 25 scaled tidal turbine were performed in a towing tank it is shown that the surface waves did not affect the average loads and power output but caused severe periodical oscillations the amplitudes of the cyclic thrust and torque could reach up to 50 of the mean value induced by the incident waves with period of 1 6 s and height of 14 cm non dimensional response amplitude operators raos of thrust and torque were proved to be sensitive to submergence of the turbine the wave induced torque and thrust tend to a fixed value when the incident wave length is much longer than the water depth which provides an approximate assessment of the surface wave effects on tidal turbines keywords tidal turbine wave loads blade element momentum towing experiments regular waves 1 introduction the concept of extracting power from ocean tides has a long history elghali et al 2007

limited environmental impacts khan et al 2009 rourke et al 2010 adcock et al 2015 in many parts of the world tidal power presents an advantageous resource about 61 3 twh year of tidal current energy technically available in china some excellent channels in the east china sea are most promising sites with the maximum flow speed over 4 0 m s 1 and energy density over 20 kwm 2 liu et al 2011 in the u k the extractable resource is estimated to be up to 18 twhyear galloway et al 2014 some potential sites where maximum current speeds could exceed 2 5 m s 1 are also identified in korea kim et al 2012 currently several prototype tidal turbines are tested at specific sites some blade failures of the test tidal turbines have been reported white 2011 cbcnews 2010 shulman 2008 which are believed to be caused by uncertain loads on the blades the unsteady hydrodynamic conditions such as turbulent inflow or free surface waves would induce complex unsteady loads on the submerged turbines the majority of previous studies have concentrated on the loads and power production of tidal turbines under steady conditions batten et al 2006 2008 bahaj et al 2007 the knowledge of the unsteady hydrodynamic loads are still very limited as a result large safety factors in extreme loads prediction are used to account for the uncertainties in the loads which would potentially increase the cost of tidal turbines surface waves which can penetrate the water column to a depth of half of the wave length is one important part of unsteady hydrodynamic loads in order to produce more power tidal turbines are designed with increasing size and are expected to be moved into more energetic waters where it would being exposed to significant waves the cyclic surface wave loads which would undoubtedly not only lead to increase of the extreme loads but also accelerate fatigue of the rotor and blades need to be paid more attention in the design the assessment of unsteady loads become essential for avoiding unexpected failures of tidal turbines investigations into the effects of turbulent inflow conditions on tidal turbines were carried out by maganga et al 2009 and mycek et al 2014 considering the turbulence intensities from 3 to 25 of the inflow milne et al 2015 presented experiments to measure unsteady bending moment at the blade root for a scaled tidal turbine subjected to an unsteady planar forcing in a towing tank current number μ u u and reduced frequency k π f c v at the span wise location of 0 75 r are used to describe the degree of unsteadiness of the inflow where u is the amplitude of the velocity perturbation u is the mean inflow velocity f is the physical frequency of the flow c is the local blade chord and v is the resultant local inflow velocity they found that the unsteady blade loads increased with frequency and exceed the steady loads by up to 15 when μ 0 10 and k 0 05 only a few efforts have been made to study the surface wave effects on tidal turbines barltrop et al 2007 carried out the experiments using a 400 mm diameter rotor in a towing tank with the presence of regular waves the average thrust and torque was independent with wave frequencies or wave heights however significant cyclic variation of the loads were observed the relatively small rotor in barltrop s study limited the reynolds number to only about 0 8 10 5 at 75 blade radius when the device was towed at 1 0 m s 1 the model turbines with small reynolds number would reduce the unsteady hydrodynamic loads compared to that expected at full scale with reynolds number of 1 0 10 6 shyy et al 2007 similar model tests in a towing tank were reported by lust et al 2013 and luznik et al 2013 they both confirmed that the average power and thrust were not affected by the passing waves in luznik s experiments the model turbine was towed at 0 6 m s 1 whilst being exposed to the regular waves with period of 1 78 s and height of 7 6 cm the corresponding reduced frequency k and current number μ is about 0 04 and 0 1 respectively their results showed a strong correlation between measured torque and vertical wave particle velocity galloway et al 2014 investigated the wave effects on an 800 mm 3 bladed horizontal axis tst device in regular waves which was being towed at 0 9 m s 1 they also found that the presence of waves did not affect the time averaged torque and thrust but it caused the cyclic loading with a variation of 37 and 35 of the mean for thrust and torque with corresponding reduced frequency k 0 03 and current number μ 0 08 the mentioned studies have concluded some characteristics of the wave loads on tidal turbines however only one or some separate regular waves were involved more experimental data with a wide range of incident waves are needed both for a more general understanding of the surface wave effect on tidal turbines and for calibration of the parameters in the numerical models several tools have been developed to predict the loads and power output of tidal turbines with different numerical approaches the tidal turbine problems share some feature of wind turbine calculation the classical blade element momentum bem theory glauert 1935 is widely used for estimation of the loads on tidal turbines the steady thrust and torque can be predicted well by the bem theory compared to experiments batten et al 2008 in order to simulate the time behavior of the loads on tidal turbines the bem theory was enhanced with dynamic inflow model and dynamic stall model such as cactus with the free vortex model murray and barone 2011 aerodyn with the generalized dynamic wake gdw model moriarty and hansen 2005 and the code with prescribed wake model coton and wang 1999 to provide more accurate relations between induced velocity and radial circulation distribution especially for the heavy load blades epps and kimball 2013 proposed the unified lifting line theory for performance calculation of tidal turbines jo et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 and more recently tatum et al 2016 used the computational fluid dynamics cfd method to predict both steady and unsteady state behavior of tidal turbines bring more realistic and detailed flow features around the submerged rotor most of the numerical approaches mentioned above cannot account for dynamic inflow conditions or incident waves faudot and dahlhaug 2012 used a quasi static bem model to predict wave loads on the blades in which the surface wave effect as a first order approximation simply act as an addition to a uniform stream velocity from linear wave theory galloway et al 2014 developed a modified bem code using boeing vertol dynamic stall model and pitt peters dynamic inflow model which had good agreement with the towing experiment results it has to be pointed out that due to the presence of free surface under some wave conditions the blade tip would have an opportunity to partly go out of water it would induce impact loads on the blade and also affect the power production of the tidal turbine the partly going out of and re entry water process can not be considered and described by available numerical models it should be paid attention as another aspect of surface wave effects in light of above we developed a new numerical model and carried out a set of experiments to contribute to a more fundamental understanding of the surface wave effect on tidal turbines the numerical model has been developed and verified for wave load prediction based on the modified bem theory with an inclusion of added mass effects wave excitation forces and a one degree of freedom dof simulation for turbine rotational motion experiments for validation on a 1 25 scaled tidal turbine were also performed in a towing tank involving regular waves with periods from 1 0 s to 3 0 s and heights from 5 0 cm to 15 0 cm 2 development of the numerical model the blade element momentum bem theory is widely used for the prediction of steady hydrodynamic performance of tidal turbines the fundamental scheme and modification of the classical bem model particular for tidal turbines can be found in molland et al 2004 and batten et al 2008 some efforts were made by faudot and dahlhaug 2012 and galloway et al 2014 to include wave induced load prediction in an unsteady bem model as mentioned above in the present paper the numerical model was also in the framework of the bem theory with consideration of body motion simulation added mass effects and wave excitation forces 2 1 coordinate systems when accounting for the surface wave effects the absolute position in global coordinate of each blade element needs to be known the undisturbed current velocity and additional wave particle velocity need to be transformed to each blade element as an input to the bem model at every time step the two rectangular coordinate systems as shown in fig 1 are used in this paper an inertial global coordinate system o x 0 y 0 z 0 is centered at the sea bed z 0 is the horizontal coordinate and x 0 is the vertical one the local coordinate system for each blade o x y z is centered at the hub x is aligned with the rotating blade and the axis o z is located in the plane o x 0 z 0 then the position vector x 0 in the global coordinate can be transferred into the local blade coordinate as x by 1 x a 01 x 0 2 a 01 cos θ w i n g sin θ w i n g 0 sin θ w i n g cos θ w i n g 0 0 0 1 where a 01 is the transformation matrix between the two coordinate systems and θ w i n g is the azimuthal position of the blade as defined in fig 2 the position vector r i n of the i th element on the n th blade in the global coordinate is determined by equation 3 and the resultant velocity seen by each blade element is found by transforming the velocity v to the local coordinate by equation 1 3 r i n x p i n y p i n z p i n r t r s r b i n where r t r s is the position vector of the rotor center and r b i n a 01 1 x 0 0 t is the vector between the blade element and the rotor center in the global coordinate 2 2 description of free surface waves based on the linear wave theory incident wave velocity potential ϕ 0 free surface elevation η and wave particle velocity v x w a v e and v z w a v e are given in global coordinate system as follows faltinsen 1993 4 η ζ a sin ω e t k z 5 ϕ 0 g ζ a ω cosh k x cosh k h cos ω e t k z 6 v x w a v e ω ζ a sinh k x sinh k h cos ω e t k z 7 v z w a v e ω ζ a cosh k x sinh k h sin ω e t k z where ζ a is the wave amplitude ω is the natural wave frequency k is the wave number h is the water depth and ω e is the encounter frequency due to the doppler shift which is defined in equation 8 in reality the waves travel on the moving reference frame at the velocity of mean current due to the fact that the tidal turbine is fixed the doppler shift is caused by the moving reference frame however in the towing experiments the waves travel on still water but the tidal turbine was towed at the velocity of mean current the doppler shift in this situation is caused by the moving observer 8 ω e ω k v where v is the undisturbed mean current velocity in reality or is the towing speed in experiments the wave particle velocity is regarded as a perturbation of the mean current velocity in the present numerical model the total inflow velocity will be transferred into the local element coordinate as follows 9 v i a 01 v v w a v e 2 3 velocity triangle and dynamic wake model the relative velocity v r e l in the local reference system is defined in equation 10 and shown in fig 3 then the angle of attack α can be computed by equation 12 if the induced velocity w is known 10 v r e l v i v r o t w 11 v r e l y v r e l z v y v z ω x 0 w y w z 12 α arctan v r e l y v r e l z β where β is the blade pitch angle as shown in fig 3 v 0 is the inflow velocity due to current and waves seen by the blade section v r o t is the blade rotating speed and w is the induced velocity the essence of the bem numerical procedure is to obtain the induced velocity w in view of the classical bem model the induced velocity is determined by the change of fluid momentum passing the rotor which is considered as an ideal disc prandtl s tip and hub loss correction is used accounting for the rotor with finite number of blades and glauert correction is for high induction factor glauert 1935 in view of the changes of the inflow caused by the incident waves the induced velocities on the blade section cannot instantly establish the new steady state conditions to describe the development of the induced wake field in time domain the dynamic wake model is introduced the incident wave periods in the present experiments is from 1 0 s to 1 6 s in model scale for this condition the dynamic effects of the wake were limited a simple model proposed by øye 1991 is utilized in this paper in which two first order differential equations govern the induced velocities see equations 13 and 14 it is noted that equations 13 and 14 must be solved iteratively since the angle of attack depending on the induced velocity itself for the unsteady bem model here time is used as relaxation after the blades moved an azimuthal angle in one time step values from the previous time step are used on the right hand side of equations 13 and 14 for updating the new induced velocity hansen 2013 the present dynamic wake model was originally developed for wind turbines it cannot account for the situation that the blade partly going out of and re entry of water for tidal turbines and the existence of free surface from the results and discussions we know that it caused under prediction of the dynamic loads more accurate wake model accounting for the presence of free surface is the authors future work 13 w i n t τ 1 d w i n t d t w q s k τ 1 d w q s d t 14 w τ 2 d w d t w i n t where w q s is the quasi static value w i n t is an intermediate value τ 1 and τ 2 are two time constants given by hansen 2013 15 τ 1 1 1 1 1 3 a r v 0 16 τ 2 0 39 0 26 r r 2 τ 1 where a is the axial induction factor r is the blade radius and v 0 is the velocity seen by the blade element 2 4 dynamic stall model the angle of attack at each blade element is oscillating with the waves passing and blade rotating dynamic stall may occur as results of the fluctuations of velocity over the rotor plane depending on the angle of attack for dynamic inflow condition induced by surface waves in the present experiments the reduced frequency is no more than 0 05 and the tsr of the rotor is about 5 6 it is noted that the stall effects may be insufficient galloway et al 2014 therefore only the correction for lift coefficient is considered in this paper hansen et al 2004 17 c l f s c l i n v α 1 f s c l f s α 18 d f s d t f s s t f s τ where c l i n v is the attached lift coefficient c l f s is fully separated value and f s describe the degree of separation f s s t is the static value of f s which is determined by the 2d hydrofoil data the f s is assumed to always try to get back to the static value as the same with the dynamic wake model the correction for lifting coefficient is also not valid when the blade element goes out of water 2 5 hydrodynamic forces on the blade section the hydrodynamic forces on the blade element considered in this paper are shown in fig 3 based on the slender body assumption the 3d forces on the blade can be calculated from the integral of the 2d forces acting on the span wise blade elements faltinsen 1993 in view of the fact that effective reduced frequency is under 0 04 see table 3 in this paper the unsteady effects of lift force associated with the varying local angle of attack or inflow velocity are ignored leishman 2002 the hydrodynamic forces acting on the blade are considered separately and combined through superposition of lift and drag forces excitation forces and added mass forces the lift and drag forces on each blade element are decided by the 2 d lift and drag coefficients and are proportional to the square of the relative velocity 19 l 1 2 ρ v r e l 2 c c l 2 d 20 d 1 2 ρ v r e l 2 c c d 2 d where ρ is the water density c is the local chord v r e l is the relative velocity determined by equation 13 and c l 2 d and c d 2 d are the local lift and drag coefficients respectively which were calculated by the panel code xfoil and compared with the experimental data from molland et al 2004 generally the excitation force can be given by 21 f e x t 2 d ρ a m 2 d d v r e l d t where a is the area of the blade section m 2 d is the 2d added mass for the blade section and v r e l is the relative velocity seen by the blade element the time derivative term can be decomposed based on equation 10 as follows 22 d v r e l d t d v d t d w d t d v w a v e d t where v is the mean current velocity regarded as a constant d v d t 0 w is the induced velocity obtained by the dynamic wake model and v w a v e is the wave particle velocity at the rotor plane the wave excitation force f w a v e on a single blade element consisting of froude kriloff force f w a v e z fk and diffraction force f w a v e z d is given both in the z and y directions the drag term in wave excitation force is ignored 23 f w a v e z f w a v e z fk f w a v e z d ρ a m z 2 d t ϕ 0 z 24 f w a v e y ρ a m y 2 d t ϕ 0 y where ϕ 0 is the incident wave velocity potential the force f i n d u c e associated with acceleration of the wake is determined by the time derivative of the induced velocity given by the dynamic wake model to avoid numerical instability and in view of the fact that the f i n d u c e z is much smaller than the lift force f i n d u c e is not coupled to affect the wake in return in other words the wake acceleration is only dependent on the lift 25 f i n d u c e i ρ a m i 2 d d w i d t where i donates the y or z direction the added mass forces caused by the moving body can be given by 26 f a 2 d m 2 d d 2 x d t 2 where x represents the blade element position the turbine in z direction is motionless and the blade rotation in y direction is considered hence the acceleration term in y and z directions are given separately by 27 d 2 x d t 2 z 0 28 d 2 x d t 2 y x dω d t the added mass moment can be given in y direction as follows 29 m ω y m y 2 d x dω d t several previous studies have also modelled and investigated the added mass effects maniaci and li 2012 investigated the added mass effects for the rapid pitching cases and the results indicated that the added mass had a noticeable influence on blade loads whelan 2010 concluded that the unsteady hydrodynamic loading was in phase with inflow velocity and the added mass effects were small for low reduced frequency cases it is hard to measure the added mass force in experiments directly from previous studies and the results presented in the following we also believed that the added mass effects are limited for the present small incident waves although the implementation of added mass has not shown important effects on the load for present conditions we believed that for elastic blades combined with a hydroelastic model of the blades or cases with rapid pitch motions the added mass implementation would be relevant here as the first step of our work the added mass model was considered the hydrodynamic torque and thrust on the rotor is obtained by the sums of force components on every blade element 30 t n b i n l i n cos ϕ i n d i n sin ϕ i n f w a v e z i n f z i n d u c e i n δ x i n 31 m n b i n l i n sin ϕ i n d i n cos ϕ i n f w a v e y i n f i n d u c e y i n x i n m ω y δ x i n where i and n donate the i th blade element on n th blade b is the total number of the blades n is the total number of elements on each blade x i n is the element radial position and δ x i n is the span wise length of each element among the hydrodynamic forces acting on the blade section the lift and drag forces are proportional to the square of the relative velocity and the excitation forces are proportional to acceleration of the relative velocity which is caused by passing waves in this study the period of acceleration of the relative velocity is equal to the wave period and the amplitude of that is proportional to the wave height based on linear wave assumption the waves are small perturbations on the free surface therefore the amplitudes of the excitation forces are small compared with the lift force from the energy point of view the excitation and added mass forces are conservative without consideration of the second order effects the power production of the turbine is only related to the lift and drag forces due to the azimuthal symmetry of the blades arrangement the effects of buoyancy and gravity forces on shaft torque are canceled out the buoyancy and gravity forces are not included in the present numerical model but it is significant for evaluating the force on a single blade which is beyond the scope of the present paper 2 6 added mass of the blade section the above excitation and added mass forces are both related to the added mass of the blade section which is not considered for the wind turbine due to small air density however water density is approximate 700 times of air density the added mass should not be ignored for tidal turbines the blade element is assumed to be a 2d flat plate for the estimation of the 2d added mass only the m 11 2 d in the direction perpendicular to the airfoil chord line as shown in fig 4 is considered and given by 32 m 11 2 d 1 4 ρ π c 2 33 m 22 2 d 0 where ρ is the water density and c is the local chord of the blade element the m 11 2 d is then decomposed into both y and z directions as follows 34 m y 2 d m 11 2 d sin β 35 m z 2 d m 11 2 d cos β where β is the blade twist angle 2 7 rotor motion simulation and speed control strategy most of previous studies assumed that the turbine rotational speed is fixed in practice although a controller or regulation system is utilized to restrict the rotational speed the rpm is still fluctuating due to the cyclic shaft torque the rpm was directly affected by the passing surface wave which was observed and recorded in several experiments by luznik et al 2013 galloway et al 2014 the cyclic rpm would also affected the loads on the blades in turn in the present paper a single degree of freedom dof model of the rotor was used to simulate the varying rotational speed of the tidal turbine the one dof motion is governed by 36 i ω m m g ω m c o n t r o l t where ω is the rotational speed i is the rotor inertia m is the hydrodynamic torque given by equation 31 m g is the generator torque proportional to the square of the rotational speed and m c o n t r o l is the feedback control torque determined by a proportional integral derivative controller pid controller defined as follows 37 m c o n t r o l t k m k p e t k i 0 t e τ d τ k d d e t d t where e t ω sp ω t is the error ω sp is the set point k m is the generator stiffness assumed to be a fixed value k p k i and k d are the proportional integral and derivative gains respectively the k p k i and k d are tuned based on the goal of a little overshoot a proper artificial damping and small steady state error by practice the integral flow chart of dynamic stall model dynamic inflow model added mass effects linear waves and body motion simulation in time domain is illustrated in fig 5 the rotational speed ω k and azimuthal position θ w i n g k are obtained by solving the motion equation see equation 36 by runge kutta fourth order method at k th time step then the ω k is considered unchanged in one time step and transferred into the unsteady bem model to calculate the induced velocity w k and the hydrodynamic loads m k and t k on the rotor meanwhile the obtained rotational speed is compared with the set point in the pid controller to output the control torque see equation 37 for next time step next all these loads formed the right hand terms in the motion equation to determine a new rotational speed ω k 1 and azimuthal position θ w i n g k 1 for the next time step 3 experimental set up and method 3 1 towing tank experiments were carried out in the towing tank at zhejiang ocean university china the towing tank as shown in fig 6 is 130 m long 6 m wide and 3 m deep a flap type wave generator is at the upstream end of the tank and a passive wave absorbing beach is located at the other end with the damping grids for passive wave dissipation the carriage velocity was controlled by the computer for each run the carriage speed up with constant acceleration at the begin and then maintained the velocity during the test before finally slowing down in the present towing experiments 3 2 model tidal turbine a horizontal axis 3 bladed tidal turbine as shown in fig 7 was used in this study choosing a larger size rotor is helpful for maximizing the reynolds number however due to the constraints such as the blockage of the tunnel the ability of speed control of the motor range of dynamometer and processing difficulty of the aluminum alloy blade the diameter of the rotor was chosen to be 800 mm as a compromise there have been few experiments on tidal turbine with larger rotor than the present in the present paper froude scaling was the dominant scaling parameter the 1 25 scaled model represented a 20 m diameter 1 mw prototype tidal turbine developed by shanghai jiao tong university for deep water tidal current energy exploitation the blockage of the tunnel was less than 3 0 no blockage correction to the experimental data was applied galloway et al 2014 milne et al 2015 although increasing towing speed is also effective for increasing the reynolds number the inflow velocity at full scale should be reasonable for tidal turbine sites under froude scaling the unsteady behavior of the hydrodynamic loads related to reynolds number may have some differences between model and prototype in this paper all the results from experiments are shown and discussed at model scale meanwhile the numerical analysis as comparison was also done at model scale all the structures were treated to be rigid both in experiments and numerical predictions the hydro elastic problem is beyond the scope of this paper the hub diameter was 100 mm the blade sections were developed from naca 63 8xx profile with varying thickness and pre twist the span wise distribution of the chord pre twist and thickness is shown in table 1 at model scale 3 3 test rig the test rig as illustrated in fig 9 mainly consisted of an airfoil section tank a generator motor a dynamometer and a 3 bladed rotor the generator motor was equipped with close loop controller to ensure precise speed control the dynamometer was utilized to record the torque and thrust on the end of the shaft the whole test rig was connected to the main carriage which could move forward and back in the tank with a given velocity meanwhile the rig could be moved up and down to adjust the submergence of the turbine hub from 0 32 m to 0 96 m to satisfy different test conditions a wave probe as shown in fig 8 was located in front of the main carriage to record incident wave heights the wave heights at the rotor plane were obtained by changing the phase of the measured waves all these mentioned instruments were carefully calibrated before the experiments all the quantities were recorded with a sampling rate of 100 hz 3 4 regular wave generation a flap type wave generator was used to generate regular waves at the upstream end of the towing tank in this study the typical tidal turbine sites are often located at the channels between the islands near coast the waves tend to have long periods and relatively small significant wave heights in these sheltered location the real wave data from observation at these sites are limited therefore the selected regular waves cover a wide period range from 1 0 s to 3 0 s in model scale corresponding to prototype periods from 5 0 s to 15 0 s in order to get the load raos from regular wave experiments the wave length was from 1 56 m to 12 68 m table 2 shows that the ratio λ h is from 0 52 to 4 22 these regular waves can be split into deep waves and intermediate waves by a criteria of λ h 2 the wave height was determined by a steepness that did not exceed 3 5 the reduced frequency and current number of some typical cases are listed in table 3 due to the non uniformity of the inflow distribution caused by the passing waves and rotating blade at rotor plane the reduced frequency k at 0 75 radius and current number μ at the hub height were used to describe the degree of unsteadiness of the inflow in the present study the reduced frequency k is between 0 02 and 0 04 and the current number is under 0 2 relatively small reduced frequency o 0 01 ensured that changes in the angle of attack was small the maximum wave induced horizontal velocity at hub height was under 20 of the mean current velocity which kept the assumption reasonable that the wave particle velocities are treated as perturbations on the main current velocity all the selected waves have been calibrated before the experiments the parameters of the calibrated waves are shown in table 2 a fixed wave probe was placed at the center of the towing tank about 50 m away from the upstream wave maker for the wave calibration the selected time histories of the incident wave elevation with different wave periods are shown in fig 10 although all the waves have been calibrated the encounter waves in each run had a little differences compared with the calibrated waves all the analysis were based on the measured loads and corresponding encounter waves recorded in each run 4 results and discussion 4 1 average power and thrust coefficients the time averaged c p and c t for both still water cases and wave cases were presented as the first step of validation the experimental c p and c t points versus tip speed ratio tsr are shown and compared with the numerical prediction in figs 11 and 12 the c p c t and tsr are defined as follows 38 c p m ω 0 5 ρ u 3 π r 2 39 c t t 0 5 ρ u 2 π r 2 40 tsr ω r u where m is shaft torque t is thrust ω is rotational speed u is carriage velocity ρ is water density and r is the rotor radius the still water cases no wave cases were performed at the carriage velocity of 0 56 m s 1 and 0 68 m s 1 and the rotor speed from 65 rpm to 138 rpm the submergence of the turbine hub is 0 64 m 0 8 d the c p and c t curves have been well discussed by previous studies bahaj et al 2007 milne et al 2015 at the low speed region tsr 4 due to the fixed pitch angle the rotor is dominated by the stall effects when the tsr is larger than 7 the turbulent wake state leads to a reduction of the power coefficient the optimal power coefficient is obtained at tsr approximately 5 6 as a result most of the wave cases in this paper were performed in this optimal tsr region in view of froude scaling the carriage velocities of 0 56 m s 1 and 0 68 m s 1 are equivalent to 2 8 m s 1 and 3 4 m s 1 in prototype respectively which are the typical rated current speed for tidal turbines the reynolds number based on the cord length and the maximum relative velocity at 75 radius in model scale was between 0 87 1 52 10 5 in the present cases which was lower than that of the prototype tidal turbines o 10 6 the model turbine with lower reynolds number would reduce the dynamic effects acting on the blade compared with that expected in full scale shyy et al 2007 the previous studies also confronted the situation with this dilemma of reynolds number barltrop et al 2006 luznik et al 2013 galloway et al 2014 milne et al 2015 therefore all the experimental data and numerical predictions were discussed in model scale in this paper the wave cases were performed under the same towing conditions but being exposed to different incident waves several previous experiments indicate that the passing waves did not affect the time averaged loads and power output faudot and dahlhaug 2012 luznik et al 2013 galloway et al 2014 the results from the wave cases have some differences in the present c p and c t curves this may be caused by the following reasons the first one could be the mean drift effects of the waves which may cause shift of the mean value for some cases the thrust force and the torque on the tidal turbine are the resulting force and moment from the lift and the drag forces acting on each blade cross section which are quadratic terms of the local velocity considering both the current velocity which is dominating and the wave particle velocity at each blade cross section we will get the thrust and the torque with linear and second order terms with respect to the wave induced velocity the lift and drag forces acting on a blade section in waves can be simply written as f u 0 v w 2 it can be further split into three parts f 0 u 0 2 which is the mean force f w 1 2 u 0 v w which is the linear wave induced loads and f w 2 v w 2 which is the second order effects mean drift effects in present the authors cannot given second order transfer functions to quantitative explanation of this effects which will be the future work of the authors another reason may be related to the generator speed in experiments although the generator speed is close loop controlled for very slow or fast speed the speed control is not perfectly effective the varying rotational speed may cause errors for waves cases 4 2 comparisons of the experimental data and numerical simulation the typical wave test procedure is presented as follows firstly the motor driven the turbine to rotate at the given speed without forward velocity and waited for the incident waves coming from the upstream end of the tank as the waves arrive the carriage started to speed up and then maintained the constant velocity finally it stopped before the tank end after more than 25 wave periods the experimental time histories of the shaft torque and thrust from a case u 0 68 m s 1 rpm 94 2 t w a v e 1 6 s h w a v e 7 cm and submergence of the hub is 0 64 m is presented as an example in fig 13 the numerical results have very good agreement with experimental data it is shown that the passing waves directly affect the rpm torque and thrust of the rotor by inducing cyclic oscillations the relation between the encounter wave elevation at the rotor plane and the rpm torque and thrust shows that the waves and its effects on these quantities have the same frequency and very small phase differences when the wave elevation at the rotor plane reached the highest level the wave particle had maximum forward speed and hence it caused the maximum loads on the rotor and vice versa however only wave frequency oscillation could be observed from the time histories of the shaft torque and thrust this was due to the three blades are at symmetrical azimuthal positions and it would cancel the 1p effects the wave induced oscillation of the shaft torque in turn influenced the quality of the electrical power production from above discussion we know that the waves mainly cause the periodical oscillations with wave frequency on the loads the average range of the dynamic torque m wave and thrust t wave see equations 41 and 42 are used to describe the degree of the effects caused by the passing waves in this paper 41 m wave 1 n m i range n 42 t wave 1 n t i range n where m i range and t i range are the range of the dynamic torque and thrust in a single period and n is the selected number of the periods which is normally no less than 10 4 3 wave effects on torque and thrust it is shown that m wave and t wave have linear dependence on the incident wave height see fig 14 a b and c in this set of the cases the same towing condition was held at u 0 68 m s 1 rpm 87 6 tsr 5 4 and submergence of the hub is 0 64 m 0 8 d the numerical results are lines in the figures as expected with the linear incident waves experimental results agree well with the numerical prediction fig 14 d e and f show the m wave and t wave normalized by its mean value versus instantaneous current number it is noted that a small perturbation of the inflow about 15 of the mean could induce large amplitude of the cyclic variation of the loads about 50 of the mean loads due to the linear relationship between the incident waves and load responses the load raos can be introduced to investigate the feature of responses in frequency domain the torque and thrust raos are defined and nondimensionalized as follows 43 k m m wave 0 25 ρ g d 3 ζ a 44 k t t wave 0 25 ρ g d 2 ζ a where ρ is water density g is the acceleration of gravity d is the diameter of the rotor and ζ a is the amplitude of the incident waves it should be pointed out that the raos are only valid for linear incident waves or for the conditions that current number μ 0 2 and reduced frequency k 0 04 figs 15 and 16 show the numerical and experimental results of the nondimensional responses in frequency domain with different submergence h d the response curve of torque agrees very well with the numerical predictions but there are discrepancies in the thrust curve for h d 0 6 this discrepancy was due to the possible dynamic effects of the model turbine in the experimental set up in some cases in figs 15 and 16 the time averaged power or thrust coefficients are also shown for the same towing velocity and rotation speed the mean value for cases with different wave conditions is unchanged similar results for the mean power and thrust coefficients were also presented in previous studies faudot and dahlhaug 2012 luznik et al 2013 galloway et al 2014 for λ h 0 2 h is the water depth v z w a v e decreases exponentially with increasing depth see fig 17 a the short wave effects are strictly restricted in very limited depth and we can just put the tidal turbine under the wave influence region h λ 2 0 5 d to avoid effect of waves if submergence of the hub h d 0 8 it means that the waves with λ h 0 16 cannot have significant influence on the tidal turbine therefore increasing submergence is an effective way to avoid effects from deep water waves on the other end when wave length goes to zero the dynamic response of the torque and thrust also vanish converting to corresponding still water cases for 0 2 λ h 4 with the increasing wave length submergence and incident wave frequency become important factors in the response curves the wave influence region is so large that there are no more space to avoid the effects completely see fig 17 b when λ h 1 the load responses torque and thrust go up sharply with increasing wave length when the submergence h d is less than 0 8 a response peak can be identified around λ h 1 in both torque and thrust curves after that the responses tend to a fixed value slowly and smoothly for the intermediate waves the submergence of the turbine becomes important the appearance of the response peak is also related to submergence and will be discussed later for λ h 4 the water particle has almost the same horizontal velocity v z w a v e throughout the whole water column see fig 17 c the submergence is not the key factor any more the torque and thrust slowly tend towards a fixed value with continually increasing wave length it is interesting to note that the response of very long waves provides a convenient and effective method to evaluate the wave effects on the tidal turbine the period of the incident waves also become very long when the reduced frequency k o 0 01 the flow can be assumed steady or quasi steady leishman 2002 although we can estimate the response by performing incident waves with period long enough or just by interpolation of the response curves the quasi static method will be introduced later as an alternative way to calculate the quasi static response of dynamic thrust and torque 4 4 free surface and tsr effects as shown previously we know that the response peak occurs around λ h 1 and submergence is the key factor of the load response caused by intermediate waves therefore two incident waves with λ h 0 75 and 1 33 were selected to investigate the submergence effects the non dimensional response of dynamic torque as a function of submergence of the hub is shown in fig 18 when h d 0 7 the numerical and experimental results agreed very well from fig 17 it shows that the maximum current number μ is less than 0 2 in this situation the numerical model with linear wave assumption worked pretty well with the increasing submergence of the hub the dynamic response also decreased which means that larger submergence would be helpful for limiting wave induced loads on the rotor the lower limit as shown in figs 16 and 15 could be obtained by the physical limitation of the presence of sea bed that putting the rotor hub only 0 5d up on the sea bed under this condition the effects caused by intermediate waves and deep water waves can be effectively reduced the waves are no longer the issue but the turbine would suffer from the boundary layer of the inflow caused by the sea bed which is beyond the scope of this paper when the rotor getting close to free surface h d 0 6 the present numerical model obviously underestimated the wave induced loads from the comparison in fig 18 the horizontal wave particle velocity v z w a v e could be larger than 50 of the inflow current velocity which means that regarding the water particle velocity as a disturbance is no longer suitable the dynamic wake behind the rotor was strongly affected by the free surface which was not considered in the present dynamic wake model under extreme condition the tidal turbine blades would have an opportunity to go out of water bringing more complex physical phenomenon that can not be described by the present numerical model therefore we did not give the upper limit in figs 16 and 15 in order to take the free surface effects into account more details about the free surface should be considered in the numerical model and it will be the future work for the authors the rotational speed of the turbine is another parameter of this problem normally it is determined by the operating point on the power coefficient curve in this paper optimal tsr is about 5 6 see fig 11 when inflow velocity u 0 68 m s 1 the optimal rotor speed is from range1 351 62 hz which is obviously higher than the effective incident wave frequency around 0 65 hz λ h 1 therefore the coupling effects between the rotation of the rotor and incident waves can be ignored the non dimensional thrust and torque raos as a function of λ h with different tsrs from numerical prediction are shown in figs 19 and 20 it is shown that the varying tsr dose not affect much for intermediate waves however it dose affect the quasi static value for long waves significantly the quasi static torque goes down but the thrust goes up with increasing rotating speed in this situation for deciding the operating tsr the effects of tsr on the wave loads should be taken into account 4 5 estimation for the quasi static k m st and k t st from figs 15 16 19 and 20 we know that when λ h the load responses tend towards the quasi static values which can be called k m st and k t st the quasi static values were proved to be independent with wave conditions or submergence of the rotor which would be convenient for the prediction of wave loads in early design stage here we provide a method to calculate the quasi static responses by shallow water assumption the relation between the tidal current velocity and shaft torque and thrust at rpm 87 6 is shown in fig 21 the shaft torque m and thrust t can be written as a function of the tidal current velocity v and rotational speed ω 45 m f v ω 46 t g v ω if the rotational speed ω is regarded as a constant a small change of the torque can be given by 47 δ m f v ω δ v where δ v is a small change of the inflow velocity induced by the waves as the wave length is assumed to be infinite the shallow water condition λ 20 h is automatically satisfied since the reduced frequency k is smaller than 0 01 the inflow can be regarded as quasi steady state leishman 2002 the range of the horizontal wave particle velocity is obtained by shallow water condition which is independent with the wave frequency and submergence as follows mei et al 2005 48 δ v 2 ζ a g h where ζ a is the wave amplitude g is the acceleration of gravity and h is the water depth therefore the k m st and similarly k t st can be given by 49 k m st 8 f v ω ρ d 3 g h 50 k t st 8 g v ω ρ d 2 g h the k m st and k t st are related to water depth of the site it indicates that the deeper site would be helpful for reducing the wave load effects and tidal turbines should not be located at the extreme shallow waters the k m st and k t st can be obtained by the long wave approximation from figs 19 and 20 or by the quasi static method from equations 49 and 50 the results by the two established approaches with different tsrs at mean inflow velocity u 0 68 m s 1 are listed in table 4 which shows very good agreements 5 conclusions by performing both numerical and experimental approaches the objective of this paper is to obtain a fundamental understanding of the surface wave effects on the loads on tidal turbines a new numerical model based on the modified bem theory with the inclusion of added mass effects wave excitation forces and a one degree of freedom dof simulation for the turbine rotational motion have been developed to simulate the first order loads on the turbine based on the presented experimental results the contributions to the wave induced loads by added mass dynamic stall and dynamic wake model are limited however this may not be the case for non stiff blades or extreme loads which will be the authors future studies the experiments on a 1 25 scaled tidal turbine have been carried out in the towing tank at zhejiang ocean university china the towing speed was 0 56 m s 1 and 0 68 m s 1 the regular waves with periods from 1 0 s to 3 0 s and heights under 15 0 cm at model scale were generated some conclusions are summarized as follows the numerical prediction agrees well with the experimental data validating the reliability of the present numerical model the regular waves did not affect the average loads and power output from experimental and numerical results the amplitudes of periodical oscillations of thrust and torque could reach up to 50 of the mean value induced by the passing waves with period of 1 6 s and height of 14 cm a small perturbation of the inflow 15 of the mean velocity could induce large amplitude of the cyclic variation of the thrust and torque on the rotor 50 of the mean load for linear incident waves the amplitude of the cyclic loads have linear dependence on the wave height the non dimensional load raos k m and k t were introduced for estimating the wave loads which were proved to be sensitive to the submergence and the incident wave frequency to avoid severe wave load effects the submergence should be at least 0 8 of the rotor diameter the quasi static k m st and k t st independent with the submergence and wave conditions provide an approximate method for evaluating the surface wave effects on tidal turbines which could be obtained by the long waves approximation see figs 19 and 20 or by the quasi static method see eqns 49 and 50 the surface wave loads should be carefully considered in the design

23448,when tidal turbines are utilized in the most energetic waters where there are significant waves the assessment of the surface wave effects are of great concerns the objective of this paper is to contribute to a fundamental understanding of surface wave effects on tidal turbines a numerical model was developed based on the modified blade element momentum theory with an inclusion of added mass effects wave excitation forces and a one degree of freedom dof simulation for turbine rotational motion the experiments on a 1 25 scaled tidal turbine were performed in a towing tank it is shown that the surface waves did not affect the average loads and power output but caused severe periodical oscillations the amplitudes of the cyclic thrust and torque could reach up to 50 of the mean value induced by the incident waves with period of 1 6 s and height of 14 cm non dimensional response amplitude operators raos of thrust and torque were proved to be sensitive to submergence of the turbine the wave induced torque and thrust tend to a fixed value when the incident wave length is much longer than the water depth which provides an approximate assessment of the surface wave effects on tidal turbines keywords tidal turbine wave loads blade element momentum towing experiments regular waves 1 introduction the concept of extracting power from ocean tides has a long history elghali et al 2007 with the growing worldwide energy demand utilizing tidal turbines to generate power has gained increased attention tidal current power has advantages of a high predictability a high energy density and limited environmental impacts khan et al 2009 rourke et al 2010 adcock et al 2015 in many parts of the world tidal power presents an advantageous resource about 61 3 twh year of tidal current energy technically available in china some excellent channels in the east china sea are most promising sites with the maximum flow speed over 4 0 m s 1 and energy density over 20 kwm 2 liu et al 2011 in the u k the extractable resource is estimated to be up to 18 twhyear galloway et al 2014 some potential sites where maximum current speeds could exceed 2 5 m s 1 are also identified in korea kim et al 2012 currently several prototype tidal turbines are tested at specific sites some blade failures of the test tidal turbines have been reported white 2011 cbcnews 2010 shulman 2008 which are believed to be caused by uncertain loads on the blades the unsteady hydrodynamic conditions such as turbulent inflow or free surface waves would induce complex unsteady loads on the submerged turbines the majority of previous studies have concentrated on the loads and power production of tidal turbines under steady conditions batten et al 2006 2008 bahaj et al 2007 the knowledge of the unsteady hydrodynamic loads are still very limited as a result large safety factors in extreme loads prediction are used to account for the uncertainties in the loads which would potentially increase the cost of tidal turbines surface waves which can penetrate the water column to a depth of half of the wave length is one important part of unsteady hydrodynamic loads in order to produce more power tidal turbines are designed with increasing size and are expected to be moved into more energetic waters where it would being exposed to significant waves the cyclic surface wave loads which would undoubtedly not only lead to increase of the extreme loads but also accelerate fatigue of the rotor and blades need to be paid more attention in the design the assessment of unsteady loads become essential for avoiding unexpected failures of tidal turbines investigations into the effects of turbulent inflow conditions on tidal turbines were carried out by maganga et al 2009 and mycek et al 2014 considering the turbulence intensities from 3 to 25 of the inflow milne et al 2015 presented experiments to measure unsteady bending moment at the blade root for a scaled tidal turbine subjected to an unsteady planar forcing in a towing tank current number μ u u and reduced frequency k π f c v at the span wise location of 0 75 r are used to describe the degree of unsteadiness of the inflow where u is the amplitude of the velocity perturbation u is the mean inflow velocity f is the physical frequency of the flow c is the local blade chord and v is the resultant local inflow velocity they found that the unsteady blade loads increased with frequency and exceed the steady loads by up to 15 when μ 0 10 and k 0 05 only a few efforts have been made to study the surface wave effects on tidal turbines barltrop et al 2007 carried out the experiments using a 400 mm diameter rotor in a towing tank with the presence of regular waves the average thrust and torque was independent with wave frequencies or wave heights however significant cyclic variation of the loads were observed the relatively small rotor in barltrop s study limited the reynolds number to only about 0 8 10 5 at 75 blade radius when the device was towed at 1 0 m s 1 the model turbines with small reynolds number would reduce the unsteady hydrodynamic loads compared to that expected at full scale with reynolds number of 1 0 10 6 shyy et al 2007 similar model tests in a towing tank were reported by lust et al 2013 and luznik et al 2013 they both confirmed that the average power and thrust were not affected by the passing waves in luznik s experiments the model turbine was towed at 0 6 m s 1 whilst being exposed to the regular waves with period of 1 78 s and height of 7 6 cm the corresponding reduced frequency k and current number μ is about 0 04 and 0 1 respectively their results showed a strong correlation between measured torque and vertical wave particle velocity galloway et al 2014 investigated the wave effects on an 800 mm 3 bladed horizontal axis tst device in regular waves which was being towed at 0 9 m s 1 they also found that the presence of waves did not affect the time averaged torque and thrust but it caused the cyclic loading with a variation of 37 and 35 of the mean for thrust and torque with corresponding reduced frequency k 0 03 and current number μ 0 08 the mentioned studies have concluded some characteristics of the wave loads on tidal turbines however only one or some separate regular waves were involved more experimental data with a wide range of incident waves are needed both for a more general understanding of the surface wave effect on tidal turbines and for calibration of the parameters in the numerical models several tools have been developed to predict the loads and power output of tidal turbines with different numerical approaches the tidal turbine problems share some feature of wind turbine calculation the classical blade element momentum bem theory glauert 1935 is widely used for estimation of the loads on tidal turbines the steady thrust and torque can be predicted well by the bem theory compared to experiments batten et al 2008 in order to simulate the time behavior of the loads on tidal turbines the bem theory was enhanced with dynamic inflow model and dynamic stall model such as cactus with the free vortex model murray and barone 2011 aerodyn with the generalized dynamic wake gdw model moriarty and hansen 2005 and the code with prescribed wake model coton and wang 1999 to provide more accurate relations between induced velocity and radial circulation distribution especially for the heavy load blades epps and kimball 2013 proposed the unified lifting line theory for performance calculation of tidal turbines jo et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 and more recently tatum et al 2016 used the computational fluid dynamics cfd method to predict both steady and unsteady state behavior of tidal turbines bring more realistic and detailed flow features around the submerged rotor most of the numerical approaches mentioned above cannot account for dynamic inflow conditions or incident waves faudot and dahlhaug 2012 used a quasi static bem model to predict wave loads on the blades in which the surface wave effect as a first order approximation simply act as an addition to a uniform stream velocity from linear wave theory galloway et al 2014 developed a modified bem code using boeing vertol dynamic stall model and pitt peters dynamic inflow model which had good agreement with the towing experiment results it has to be pointed out that due to the presence of free surface under some wave conditions the blade tip would have an opportunity to partly go out of water it would induce impact loads on the blade and also affect the power production of the tidal turbine the partly going out of and re entry water process can not be considered and described by available numerical models it should be paid attention as another aspect of surface wave effects in light of above we developed a new numerical model and carried out a set of experiments to contribute to a more fundamental understanding of the surface wave effect on tidal turbines the numerical model has been developed and verified for wave load prediction based on the modified bem theory with an inclusion of added mass effects wave excitation forces and a one degree of freedom dof simulation for turbine rotational motion experiments for validation on a 1 25 scaled tidal turbine were also performed in a towing tank involving regular waves with periods from 1 0 s to 3 0 s and heights from 5 0 cm to 15 0 cm 2 development of the numerical model the blade element momentum bem theory is widely used for the prediction of steady hydrodynamic performance of tidal turbines the fundamental scheme and modification of the classical bem model particular for tidal turbines can be found in molland et al 2004 and batten et al 2008 some efforts were made by faudot and dahlhaug 2012 and galloway et al 2014 to include wave induced load prediction in an unsteady bem model as mentioned above in the present paper the numerical model was also in the framework of the bem theory with consideration of body motion simulation added mass effects and wave excitation forces 2 1 coordinate systems when accounting for the surface wave effects the absolute position in global coordinate of each blade element needs to be known the undisturbed current velocity and additional wave particle velocity need to be transformed to each blade element as an input to the bem model at every time step the two rectangular coordinate systems as shown in fig 1 are used in this paper an inertial global coordinate system o x 0 y 0 z 0 is centered at the sea bed z 0 is the horizontal coordinate and x 0 is the vertical one the local coordinate system for each blade o x y z is centered at the hub x is aligned with the rotating blade and the axis o z is located in the plane o x 0 z 0 then the position vector x 0 in the global coordinate can be transferred into the local blade coordinate as x by 1 x a 01 x 0 2 a 01 cos θ w i n g sin θ w i n g 0 sin θ w i n g cos θ w i n g 0 0 0 1 where a 01 is the transformation matrix between the two coordinate systems and θ w i n g is the azimuthal position of the blade as defined in fig 2 the position vector r i n of the i th element on the n th blade in the global coordinate is determined by equation 3 and the resultant velocity seen by each blade element is found by transforming the velocity v to the local coordinate by equation 1 3 r i n x p i n y p i n z p i n r t r s r b i n where r t r s is the position vector of the rotor center and r b i n a 01 1 x 0 0 t is the vector between the blade element and the rotor center in the global coordinate 2 2 description of free surface waves based on the linear wave theory incident wave velocity potential ϕ 0 free surface elevation η and wave particle velocity v x w a v e and v z w a v e are given in global coordinate system as follows faltinsen 1993 4 η ζ a sin ω e t k z 5 ϕ 0 g ζ a ω cosh k x cosh k h cos ω e t k z 6 v x w a v e ω ζ a sinh k x sinh k h cos ω e t k z 7 v z w a v e ω ζ a cosh k x sinh k h sin ω e t k z where ζ a is the wave amplitude ω is the natural wave frequency k is the wave number h is the water depth and ω e is the encounter frequency due to the doppler shift which is defined in equation 8 in reality the waves travel on the moving reference frame at the velocity of mean current due to the fact that the tidal turbine is fixed the doppler shift is caused by the moving reference frame however in the towing experiments the waves travel on still water but the tidal turbine was towed at the velocity of mean current the doppler shift in this situation is caused by the moving observer 8 ω e ω k v where v is the undisturbed mean current velocity in reality or is the towing speed in experiments the wave particle velocity is regarded as a perturbation of the mean current velocity in the present numerical model the total inflow velocity will be transferred into the local element coordinate as follows 9 v i a 01 v v w a v e 2 3 velocity triangle and dynamic wake model the relative velocity v r e l in the local reference system is defined in equation 10 and shown in fig 3 then the angle of attack α can be computed by equation 12 if the induced velocity w is known 10 v r e l v i v r o t w 11 v r e l y v r e l z v y v z ω x 0 w y w z 12 α arctan v r e l y v r e l z β where β is the blade pitch angle as shown in fig 3 v 0 is the inflow velocity due to current and waves seen by the blade section v r o t is the blade rotating speed and w is the induced velocity the essence of the bem numerical procedure is to obtain the induced velocity w in view of the classical bem model the induced velocity is determined by the change of fluid momentum passing the rotor which is considered as an ideal disc prandtl s tip and hub loss correction is used accounting for the rotor with finite number of blades and glauert correction is for high induction factor glauert 1935 in view of the changes of the inflow caused by the incident waves the induced velocities on the blade section cannot instantly establish the new steady state conditions to describe the development of the induced wake field in time domain the dynamic wake model is introduced the incident wave periods in the present experiments is from 1 0 s to 1 6 s in model scale for this condition the dynamic effects of the wake were limited a simple model proposed by øye 1991 is utilized in this paper in which two first order differential equations govern the induced velocities see equations 13 and 14 it is noted that equations 13 and 14 must be solved iteratively since the angle of attack depending on the induced velocity itself for the unsteady bem model here time is used as relaxation after the blades moved an azimuthal angle in one time step values from the previous time step are used on the right hand side of equations 13 and 14 for updating the new induced velocity hansen 2013 the present dynamic wake model was originally developed for wind turbines it cannot account for the situation that the blade partly going out of and re entry of water for tidal turbines and the existence of free surface from the results and discussions we know that it caused under prediction of the dynamic loads more accurate wake model accounting for the presence of free surface is the authors future work 13 w i n t τ 1 d w i n t d t w q s k τ 1 d w q s d t 14 w τ 2 d w d t w i n t where w q s is the quasi static value w i n t is an intermediate value τ 1 and τ 2 are two time constants given by hansen 2013 15 τ 1 1 1 1 1 3 a r v 0 16 τ 2 0 39 0 26 r r 2 τ 1 where a is the axial induction factor r is the blade radius and v 0 is the velocity seen by the blade element 2 4 dynamic stall model the angle of attack at each blade element is oscillating with the waves passing and blade rotating dynamic stall may occur as results of the fluctuations of velocity over the rotor plane depending on the angle of attack for dynamic inflow condition induced by surface waves in the present experiments the reduced frequency is no more than 0 05 and the tsr of the rotor is about 5 6 it is noted that the stall effects may be insufficient galloway et al 2014 therefore only the correction for lift coefficient is considered in this paper hansen et al 2004 17 c l f s c l i n v α 1 f s c l f s α 18 d f s d t f s s t f s τ where c l i n v is the attached lift coefficient c l f s is fully separated value and f s describe the degree of separation f s s t is the static value of f s which is determined by the 2d hydrofoil data the f s is assumed to always try to get back to the static value as the same with the dynamic wake model the correction for lifting coefficient is also not valid when the blade element goes out of water 2 5 hydrodynamic forces on the blade section the hydrodynamic forces on the blade element considered in this paper are shown in fig 3 based on the slender body assumption the 3d forces on the blade can be calculated from the integral of the 2d forces acting on the span wise blade elements faltinsen 1993 in view of the fact that effective reduced frequency is under 0 04 see table 3 in this paper the unsteady effects of lift force associated with the varying local angle of attack or inflow velocity are ignored leishman 2002 the hydrodynamic forces acting on the blade are considered separately and combined through superposition of lift and drag forces excitation forces and added mass forces the lift and drag forces on each blade element are decided by the 2 d lift and drag coefficients and are proportional to the square of the relative velocity 19 l 1 2 ρ v r e l 2 c c l 2 d 20 d 1 2 ρ v r e l 2 c c d 2 d where ρ is the water density c is the local chord v r e l is the relative velocity determined by equation 13 and c l 2 d and c d 2 d are the local lift and drag coefficients respectively which were calculated by the panel code xfoil and compared with the experimental data from molland et al 2004 generally the excitation force can be given by 21 f e x t 2 d ρ a m 2 d d v r e l d t where a is the area of the blade section m 2 d is the 2d added mass for the blade section and v r e l is the relative velocity seen by the blade element the time derivative term can be decomposed based on equation 10 as follows 22 d v r e l d t d v d t d w d t d v w a v e d t where v is the mean current velocity regarded as a constant d v d t 0 w is the induced velocity obtained by the dynamic wake model and v w a v e is the wave particle velocity at the rotor plane the wave excitation force f w a v e on a single blade element consisting of froude kriloff force f w a v e z fk and diffraction force f w a v e z d is given both in the z and y directions the drag term in wave excitation force is ignored 23 f w a v e z f w a v e z fk f w a v e z d ρ a m z 2 d t ϕ 0 z 24 f w a v e y ρ a m y 2 d t ϕ 0 y where ϕ 0 is the incident wave velocity potential the force f i n d u c e associated with acceleration of the wake is determined by the time derivative of the induced velocity given by the dynamic wake model to avoid numerical instability and in view of the fact that the f i n d u c e z is much smaller than the lift force f i n d u c e is not coupled to affect the wake in return in other words the wake acceleration is only dependent on the lift 25 f i n d u c e i ρ a m i 2 d d w i d t where i donates the y or z direction the added mass forces caused by the moving body can be given by 26 f a 2 d m 2 d d 2 x d t 2 where x represents the blade element position the turbine in z direction is motionless and the blade rotation in y direction is considered hence the acceleration term in y and z directions are given separately by 27 d 2 x d t 2 z 0 28 d 2 x d t 2 y x dω d t the added mass moment can be given in y direction as follows 29 m ω y m y 2 d x dω d t several previous studies have also modelled and investigated the added mass effects maniaci and li 2012 investigated the added mass effects for the rapid pitching cases and the results indicated that the added mass had a noticeable influence on blade loads whelan 2010 concluded that the unsteady hydrodynamic loading was in phase with inflow velocity and the added mass effects were small for low reduced frequency cases it is hard to measure the added mass force in experiments directly from previous studies and the results presented in the following we also believed that the added mass effects are limited for the present small incident waves although the implementation of added mass has not shown important effects on the load for present conditions we believed that for elastic blades combined with a hydroelastic model of the blades or cases with rapid pitch motions the added mass implementation would be relevant here as the first step of our work the added mass model was considered the hydrodynamic torque and thrust on the rotor is obtained by the sums of force components on every blade element 30 t n b i n l i n cos ϕ i n d i n sin ϕ i n f w a v e z i n f z i n d u c e i n δ x i n 31 m n b i n l i n sin ϕ i n d i n cos ϕ i n f w a v e y i n f i n d u c e y i n x i n m ω

is the span wise length of each element among the hydrodynamic forces acting on the blade section the lift and drag forces are proportional to the square of the relative velocity and the excitation forces are proportional to acceleration of the relative velocity which is caused by passing waves in this study the period of acceleration of the relative velocity is equal to the wave period and the amplitude of that is proportional to the wave height based on linear wave assumption the waves are small perturbations on the free surface therefore the amplitudes of the excitation forces are small compared with the lift force from the energy point of view the excitation and added mass forces are conservative without consideration of the second order effects the power production of the turbine is only related to the lift and drag forces due to the azimuthal symmetry of the blades arrangement the effects of buoyancy and gravity forces on shaft torque are canceled out the buoyancy and gravity forces are not included in the present numerical model but it is significant for evaluating the force on a single blade which is beyond the scope of the present paper 2 6 added mass of the blade section the above excitation and added mass forces are both related to the added mass of the blade section which is not considered for the wind turbine due to small air density however water density is approximate 700 times of air density the added mass should not be ignored for tidal turbines the blade element is assumed to be a 2d flat plate for the estimation of the 2d added mass only the m 11 2 d in the direction perpendicular to the airfoil chord line as shown in fig 4 is considered and given by 32 m 11 2 d 1 4 ρ π c 2 33 m 22 2 d 0 where ρ is the water density and c is the local chord of the blade element the m 11 2 d is then decomposed into both y and z directions as follows 34 m y 2 d m 11 2 d sin β 35 m z 2 d m 11 2 d cos β where β is the blade twist angle 2 7 rotor motion simulation and speed control strategy most of previous studies assumed that the turbine rotational speed is fixed in practice although a controller or regulation system is utilized to restrict the rotational speed the rpm is still fluctuating due to the cyclic shaft torque the rpm was directly affected by the passing surface wave which was observed and recorded in several experiments by luznik et al 2013 galloway et al 2014 the cyclic rpm would also affected the loads on the blades in turn in the present paper a single degree of freedom dof model of the rotor was used to simulate the varying rotational speed of the tidal turbine the one dof motion is governed by 36 i ω m m g ω m c o n t r o l t where ω is the rotational speed i is the rotor inertia m is the hydrodynamic torque given by equation 31 m g is the generator torque proportional to the square of the rotational speed and m c o n t r o l is the feedback control torque determined by a proportional integral derivative controller pid controller defined as follows 37 m c o n t r o l t k m k p e t k i 0 t e τ d τ k d d e t d t where e t ω sp ω t is the error ω sp is the set point k m is the generator stiffness assumed to be a fixed value k p k i and k d are the proportional integral and derivative gains respectively the k p k i and k d are tuned based on the goal of a little overshoot a proper artificial damping and small steady state error by practice the integral flow chart of dynamic stall model dynamic inflow model added mass effects linear waves and body motion simulation in time domain is illustrated in fig 5 the rotational speed ω k and azimuthal position θ w i n g k are obtained by solving the motion equation see equation 36 by runge kutta fourth order method at k th time step then the ω k is considered unchanged in one time step and transferred into the unsteady bem model to calculate the induced velocity w k and the hydrodynamic loads m k and t k on the rotor meanwhile the obtained rotational speed is compared with the set point in the pid controller to output the control torque see equation 37 for next time step next all these loads formed the right hand terms in the motion equation to determine a new rotational speed ω k 1 and azimuthal position θ w i n g k 1 for the next time step 3 experimental set up and method 3 1 towing tank experiments were carried out in the towing tank at zhejiang ocean university china the towing tank as shown in fig 6 is 130 m long 6 m wide and 3 m deep a flap type wave generator is at the upstream end of the tank and a passive wave absorbing beach is located at the other end with the damping grids for passive wave dissipation the carriage velocity was controlled by the computer for each run the carriage speed up with constant acceleration at the begin and then maintained the velocity during the test before finally slowing down in the present towing experiments 3 2 model tidal turbine a horizontal axis 3 bladed tidal turbine as shown in fig 7 was used in this study choosing a larger size rotor is helpful for maximizing the reynolds number however due to the constraints such as the blockage of the tunnel the ability of speed control of the motor range of dynamometer and processing difficulty of the aluminum alloy blade the diameter of the rotor was chosen to be 800 mm as a compromise there have been few experiments on tidal turbine with larger rotor than the present in the present paper froude scaling was the dominant scaling parameter the 1 25 scaled model represented a 20 m diameter 1 mw prototype tidal turbine developed by shanghai jiao tong university for deep water tidal current energy exploitation the blockage of the tunnel was less than 3 0 no blockage correction to the experimental data was applied galloway et al 2014 milne et al 2015 although increasing towing speed is also effective for increasing the reynolds number the inflow velocity at full scale should be reasonable for tidal turbine sites under froude scaling the unsteady behavior of the hydrodynamic loads related to reynolds number may have some differences between model and prototype in this paper all the results from experiments are shown and discussed at model scale meanwhile the numerical analysis as comparison was also done at model scale all the structures were treated to be rigid both in experiments and numerical predictions the hydro elastic problem is beyond the scope of this paper the hub diameter was 100 mm the blade sections were developed from naca 63 8xx profile with varying thickness and pre twist the span wise distribution of the chord pre twist and thickness is shown in table 1 at model scale 3 3 test rig the test rig as illustrated in fig 9 mainly consisted of an airfoil section tank a generator motor a dynamometer and a 3 bladed rotor the generator motor was equipped with close loop controller to ensure precise speed control the dynamometer was utilized to record the torque and thrust on the end of the shaft the whole test rig was connected to the main carriage which could move forward and back in the tank with a given velocity meanwhile the rig could be moved up and down to adjust the submergence of the turbine hub from 0 32 m to 0 96 m to satisfy different test conditions a wave probe as shown in fig 8 was located in front of the main carriage to record incident wave heights the wave heights at the rotor plane were obtained by changing the phase of the measured waves all these mentioned instruments were carefully calibrated before the experiments all the quantities were recorded with a sampling rate of 100 hz 3 4 regular wave generation a flap type wave generator was used to generate regular waves at the upstream end of the towing tank in this study the typical tidal turbine sites are often located at the channels between the islands near coast the waves tend to have long periods and relatively small significant wave heights in these sheltered location the real wave data from observation at these sites are limited therefore the selected regular waves cover a wide period range from 1 0 s to 3 0 s in model scale corresponding to prototype periods from 5 0 s to 15 0 s in order to get the load raos from regular wave experiments the wave length was from 1 56 m to 12 68 m table 2 shows that the ratio λ h is from 0 52 to 4 22 these regular waves can be split into deep waves and intermediate waves by a criteria of λ h 2 the wave height was determined by a steepness that did not exceed 3 5 the reduced frequency and current number of some typical cases are listed in table 3 due to the non uniformity of the inflow distribution caused by the passing waves and rotating blade at rotor plane the reduced frequency k at 0 75 radius and current number μ at the hub height were used to describe the degree of unsteadiness of the inflow in the present study the reduced frequency k is between 0 02 and 0 04 and the current number is under 0 2 relatively small reduced frequency o 0 01 ensured that changes in the angle of attack was small the maximum wave induced horizontal velocity at hub height was under 20 of the mean current velocity which kept the assumption reasonable that the wave particle velocities are treated as perturbations on the main current velocity all the selected waves have been calibrated before the experiments the parameters of the calibrated waves are shown in table 2 a fixed wave probe was placed at the center of the towing tank about 50 m away from the upstream wave maker for the wave calibration the selected time histories of the incident wave elevation with different wave periods are shown in fig 10 although all the waves have been calibrated the encounter waves in each run had a little differences compared with the calibrated waves all the analysis were based on the measured loads and corresponding encounter waves recorded in each run 4 results and discussion 4 1 average power and thrust coefficients the time averaged c p and c t for both still water cases and wave cases were presented as the first step of validation the experimental c p and c t points versus tip speed ratio tsr are shown and compared with the numerical prediction in figs 11 and 12 the c p c t and tsr are defined as follows 38 c p m ω 0 5 ρ u 3 π r 2 39 c t t 0 5 ρ u 2 π r 2 40 tsr ω r u where m is shaft torque t is thrust ω is rotational speed u is carriage velocity ρ is water density and r is the rotor radius the still water cases no wave cases were performed at the carriage velocity of 0 56 m s 1 and 0 68 m s 1 and the rotor speed from 65 rpm to 138 rpm the submergence of the turbine hub is 0 64 m 0 8 d the c p and c t curves have been well discussed by previous studies bahaj et al 2007 milne et al 2015 at the low speed region tsr 4 due to the fixed pitch angle the rotor is dominated by the stall effects when the tsr is larger than 7 the turbulent wake state leads to a reduction of the power coefficient the optimal power coefficient is obtained at tsr approximately 5 6 as a result most of the wave cases in this paper were performed in this optimal tsr region in view of froude scaling the carriage velocities of 0 56 m s 1 and 0 68 m s 1 are equivalent to 2 8 m s 1 and 3 4 m s 1 in prototype respectively which are the typical rated current speed for tidal turbines the reynolds number based on the cord length and the maximum relative velocity at 75 radius in model scale was between 0 87 1 52 10 5 in the present cases which was lower than that of the prototype tidal turbines o 10 6 the model turbine with lower reynolds number would reduce the dynamic effects acting on the blade compared with that expected in full scale shyy et al 2007 the previous studies also confronted the situation with this dilemma of reynolds number barltrop et al 2006 luznik et al 2013 galloway et al 2014 milne et al 2015 therefore all the experimental data and numerical predictions were discussed in model scale in this paper the wave cases were performed under the same towing conditions but being exposed to different incident waves several previous experiments indicate that the passing waves did not affect the time averaged loads and power output faudot and dahlhaug 2012 luznik et al 2013 galloway et al 2014 the results from the wave cases have some differences in the present c p and c t curves this may be caused by the following reasons the first one could be the mean drift effects of the waves which may cause shift of the mean value for some cases the thrust force and the torque on the tidal turbine are the resulting force and moment from the lift and the drag forces acting on each blade cross section which are quadratic terms of the local velocity considering both the current velocity which is dominating and the wave particle velocity at each blade cross section we will get the thrust and the torque with linear and second order terms with respect to the wave induced velocity the lift and drag forces acting on a blade section in waves can be simply written as f u 0 v w 2 it can be further split into three parts f 0 u 0 2 which is the mean force f w 1 2 u 0 v w which is the linear wave induced loads and f w 2 v w 2 which is the second order effects mean drift effects in present the authors cannot given second order transfer functions to quantitative explanation of this effects which will be the future work of the authors another reason may be related to the generator speed in experiments although the generator speed is close loop controlled for very slow or fast speed the speed control is not perfectly effective the varying rotational speed may cause errors for waves cases 4 2 comparisons of the experimental data and numerical simulation the typical wave test procedure is presented as follows firstly the motor driven the turbine to rotate at the given speed without forward velocity and waited for the incident waves coming from the upstream end of the tank as the waves arrive the carriage started to speed up and then maintained the constant velocity finally it stopped before the tank end after more than 25 wave periods the experimental time histories of the shaft torque and thrust from a case u 0 68 m s 1 rpm 94 2 t w a v e 1 6 s h w a v e 7 cm and submergence of the hub is 0 64 m is presented as an example in fig 13 the numerical results have very good agreement with experimental data it is shown that the passing waves directly affect the rpm torque and thrust of the rotor by inducing cyclic oscillations the relation between the encounter wave elevation at the rotor plane and the rpm torque and thrust shows that the waves and its effects on these quantities have the same frequency and very small phase differences when the wave elevation at the rotor plane reached the highest level the wave particle had maximum forward speed and hence it caused the maximum loads on the rotor and vice versa however only wave frequency oscillation could be observed from the time histories of the shaft torque and thrust this was due to the three blades are at symmetrical azimuthal positions and it would cancel the 1p effects the wave induced oscillation of the shaft torque in turn influenced the quality of the electrical power production from above discussion we know that the waves mainly cause the periodical oscillations with wave frequency on the loads the average range of the dynamic torque m wave and thrust t wave see equations 41 and 42 are used to describe the degree of the effects caused by the passing waves in this paper 41 m wave 1 n m i range n 42 t wave 1 n t i range n where m i range and t i range are the range of the dynamic torque and thrust in a single period and n is the selected number of the periods which is normally no less than 10 4 3 wave effects on torque and thrust it is shown that m wave and t wave have linear dependence on the incident wave height see fig 14 a b and c in this set of the cases the same towing condition was held at u 0 68 m s 1 rpm 87 6 tsr 5 4 and submergence of the hub is 0 64 m 0 8 d the numerical results are lines in the figures as expected with the linear incident waves experimental results agree well with the numerical prediction fig 14 d e and f show the m wave and t wave normalized by its mean value versus instantaneous current number it is noted that a small perturbation of the inflow about 15 of the mean could induce large amplitude of the cyclic variation of the loads about 50 of the mean loads due to the linear relationship between the incident waves and load responses the load raos can be introduced to investigate the feature of responses in frequency domain the torque and thrust raos are defined and nondimensionalized as follows 43 k m m wave 0 25 ρ g d 3 ζ a 44 k t t wave 0 25 ρ g d 2 ζ a where ρ is water density g is the acceleration of gravity d is the diameter of the rotor and ζ a is the amplitude of the incident waves it should be pointed out that the raos are only valid for linear incident waves or for the conditions that current number μ 0 2 and reduced frequency k 0 04 figs 15 and 16 show the numerical and experimental results of the nondimensional responses in frequency domain with different submergence h d the response curve of torque agrees very well with the numerical predictions but there are discrepancies in the thrust curve for h d 0 6 this discrepancy was due to the possible dynamic effects of the model turbine in the experimental set up in some cases in figs 15 and 16 the time averaged power or thrust coefficients are also shown for the same towing velocity and rotation speed the mean value for cases with different wave conditions is unchanged similar results for the mean power and thrust coefficients were also presented in previous studies faudot and dahlhaug 2012 luznik et al 2013 galloway et al 2014 for λ h 0 2 h is the water depth v z w a v e decreases exponentially with increasing depth see fig 17 a the short wave effects are strictly restricted in very limited depth and we can just put the tidal turbine under the wave influence region h λ 2 0 5 d to avoid effect of waves if submergence of the hub h d 0 8 it means that the waves with λ h 0 16 cannot have significant influence on the tidal turbine therefore increasing submergence is an effective way to avoid effects from deep water waves on the other end when wave length goes to zero the dynamic response of the torque and thrust also vanish converting to corresponding still water cases for 0 2 λ h 4 with the increasing wave length submergence and incident wave frequency become important factors in the response curves the wave influence region is so large that there are no more space to avoid the effects completely see fig 17 b when λ h 1 the load responses torque and thrust go up sharply with increasing wave length when the submergence h d is less than 0 8 a response peak can be identified around λ h 1 in both torque and thrust curves after that the responses tend to a fixed value slowly and smoothly for the intermediate waves the submergence of the turbine becomes important the appearance of the response peak is also related to submergence and will be discussed later for λ h 4 the water particle has almost the same horizontal velocity v z w a v e throughout the whole water column see fig 17 c the submergence is not the key factor any more the torque and thrust slowly tend towards a fixed value with continually increasing wave length it is interesting to note that the response of very long waves provides a convenient and effective method to evaluate the wave effects on the tidal turbine the period of the incident waves also become very long when the reduced frequency k o 0 01 the flow can be assumed steady or quasi steady leishman 2002 although we can estimate the response by performing incident waves with period long enough or just by interpolation of the response curves the quasi static method will be introduced later as an alternative way to calculate the quasi static response of dynamic thrust and torque 4 4 free surface and tsr effects as shown previously we know that the response peak occurs around λ h 1 and submergence is the key factor of the load response caused by intermediate waves therefore two incident waves with λ h 0 75 and 1 33 were selected to investigate the submergence effects the non dimensional response of dynamic torque as a function of submergence of the hub is shown in fig 18 when h d 0 7 the numerical and experimental results agreed very well from fig 17 it shows that the maximum current number μ is less than 0 2 in this situation the numerical model with linear wave assumption worked pretty well with the increasing submergence of the hub the dynamic response also decreased which means that larger submergence would be helpful for limiting wave induced loads on the rotor the lower limit as shown in figs 16 and 15 could be obtained by the physical limitation of the presence of sea bed that putting the rotor hub only 0 5d up on the sea bed under this condition the effects caused by intermediate waves and deep water waves can be effectively reduced the waves are no longer the issue but the turbine would suffer from the boundary layer of the inflow caused by the sea bed which is beyond the scope of this paper when the rotor getting close to free surface h d 0 6 the present numerical model obviously underestimated the wave induced loads from the comparison in fig 18 the horizontal wave particle velocity v z w a v e could be larger than 50 of the inflow current velocity which means that regarding the water particle velocity as a disturbance is no longer suitable the dynamic wake behind the rotor was strongly affected by the free surface which was not considered in the present dynamic wake model under extreme condition the tidal turbine blades would have an opportunity to go out of water bringing more complex physical phenomenon that can not be described by the present numerical model therefore we did not give the upper limit in figs 16 and 15 in order to take the free surface effects into account more details about the free surface should be considered in the numerical model and it will be the future work for the authors the rotational speed of the turbine is another parameter of this problem normally it is determined by the operating point on the power coefficient curve in this paper optimal tsr is about 5 6 see fig 11 when inflow velocity u 0 68 m s 1 the optimal rotor speed is from range1 351 62 hz which is obviously higher than the effective incident wave frequency around 0 65 hz λ h 1 therefore the coupling effects between the rotation of the rotor and incident waves can be ignored the non dimensional thrust and torque raos as a function of λ h with different tsrs from numerical prediction are shown in figs 19 and 20 it is shown that the varying tsr dose not affect much for intermediate waves however it dose affect the quasi static value for long waves significantly the quasi static torque goes down but the thrust goes up with increasing rotating speed in this situation for deciding the operating tsr the effects of tsr on the wave loads should be taken into account 4 5 estimation for the quasi static k m st and k t st from figs 15 16 19 and 20 we know that when λ h the load responses tend towards the quasi static values which can be called k m st and k t st the quasi static values were proved to be independent with wave conditions or submergence of the rotor which would be convenient for the prediction of wave loads in early design stage here we provide a method to calculate the quasi static responses by shallow water assumption the relation between the tidal current velocity and shaft torque and thrust at rpm 87 6 is shown in fig 21 the shaft torque m and thrust t can be written as a function of the tidal current velocity v and rotational speed ω 45 m f v ω 46 t g v ω if the rotational speed ω is regarded as a constant a small change of the torque can be given by 47 δ m f v ω δ v where δ v is a small change of the inflow velocity induced by the waves as the wave length is assumed to be infinite the shallow water condition λ 20 h is automatically satisfied since the reduced frequency k is smaller than 0 01 the inflow can be regarded as quasi steady state leishman 2002 the range of the horizontal wave particle velocity is obtained by shallow water condition which is independent with the wave frequency and submergence as follows mei et al 2005 48 δ v 2 ζ a g h where ζ a is the wave amplitude g is the acceleration of gravity and h is the water depth therefore the k m st and similarly k t st can be given by 49 k m st 8 f v ω ρ d 3 g h 50 k t st 8 g v ω ρ d 2 g h the k m st and k t st are related to water depth of the site it indicates that the deeper site would be helpful for reducing the wave load effects and tidal turbines should not be located at the extreme shallow waters the k m st and k t st can be obtained by the long wave approximation from figs 19 and 20 or by the quasi static method from equations 49 and 50 the results by the two established approaches with different tsrs at mean inflow velocity u 0 68 m s 1 are listed in table 4 which shows very good agreements 5 conclusions by performing both numerical and experimental approaches the objective of this paper is to obtain a fundamental understanding of the surface wave effects on the loads on tidal turbines a new numerical model based on the modified bem theory with the inclusion of added mass effects wave excitation forces and a one degree of freedom dof simulation for the turbine rotational motion have been developed to simulate the first order loads on the turbine based on the presented experimental results the contributions to the wave induced loads by added mass dynamic stall and dynamic wake model are limited however this may not be the case for non stiff blades or extreme loads which will be the authors future studies the experiments on a 1 25 scaled tidal turbine have been carried out in the towing tank at zhejiang ocean university china the towing speed was 0 56 m s 1 and 0 68 m s 1 the regular waves with periods from 1 0 s to 3 0 s and heights under 15 0 cm at model scale were generated some conclusions are summarized as follows the numerical prediction agrees well with the experimental data validating the reliability of the present numerical model the regular waves did not affect the average loads and power output from experimental and numerical results the amplitudes of periodical oscillations of thrust and torque could reach up to 50 of the mean value induced by the passing waves with period of 1 6 s and height of 14 cm a small perturbation of the inflow 15 of the mean velocity could induce large amplitude of the cyclic variation of the thrust and torque on the rotor 50 of the mean load for linear incident waves the amplitude of the cyclic loads have linear dependence on the wave height the non dimensional load raos k m and k t were introduced for estimating the wave loads which were proved to be sensitive to the submergence and the incident wave frequency to avoid severe wave load effects the submergence should be at least 0 8 of the rotor diameter the quasi static k m st and k t st independent with the submergence and wave conditions provide an approximate method for evaluating the surface wave effects on tidal turbines which could be obtained by the long waves approximation see figs 19 and 20 or by the quasi static method see eqns 49 and 50 the surface wave loads should be carefully considered in the design

propulsion test performance prediction method full scale ship 1 introduction maritime transport is the most important mode of cargo transport throughout history and nowadays since 90 of the international trade is carried out at sea with more than one hundred thousand commercial ships worldwide registered in over 150 countries maritime transport is the core of the world economy following the increase in liberalisation of economy and growing efficiency of shipping as mode of transport it can be concluded that future of this industry is prosperous however most of the current world fleet is powered by carbon based fuel and thus the release of harmful gases is an inevitable occurrence lately the international maritime organization imo has implemented regulations such as the energy efficiency design index eedi the ship energy efficiency management plan seemp as well as the energy operational indicator eeoi in order to decrease harmful gases emission in the shipping industry demirel et al 2017 reducing the fuel consumption is therefore a crucial parameter for future of shipping industry not only from shipowner s point of view but from environmental point of view as well in order to design a more energy efficient ship an accurate prediction of the propeller operating point in the initial design stage is crucial traditionally this prediction has been made by extrapolating the towing tank results performed at model scale even though the flow around ship model and full scale ship is not the same as complete hydrodynamic similarity cannot be achieved this approach has been proven to be reliable the main drawback of this approach is an extensive amount of time required to carry out the experiments and the substantial costs the rapid advances in computational power and numerical methods has led to development of computational fluid dynamics cfd choi et al 2010 the methods based on cfd are becoming more reliable and nowadays cfd is used for investigating many problems related to the ship hydrodynamics the main advantage of cfd methods apart from savings in time and money is that local flow characteristics can be more readily obtained tezdogan et al 2015 have carried out unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans simulations of kriso container ship kcs for a range of regular head waves at design and slow steaming speed the authors predicted the increase in effective power and resistance and showed the influence of speed reduction on the decrease in effective power numerical investigation of the interference resistance has been carried out in farkas et al 2017 after verification and validation study interference resistance has been investigated through procedure based on the resistance decomposition the authors found that the form factor of catamaran is correlated with the separation and thus the form factor of monohull and catamaran with identical demihulls are not the same peng et al 2014 have developed a modified dawson method in order to improve prediction of wave pattern and wave making resistance for ships of full form utilizing the proposed method the authors obtained flow field and wave resistance coefficients validation of the computed results was performed by comparison with experimental results and satisfactory agreement was obtained also their method improved numerical stability in the assessment of the flow field wave pattern and wave resistance stern flow field has been investigated for several transom configurations of kcs utilizing cfd based on viscous flow duy et al 2017 modification of transom height is proven to be more significant for the flow field than the modification of transom breadth the obtained results indicated that resistance can decrease with proper modifications of the transom height and breadth kornev and kleinsorge 2011 have applied a new hybrid urans and large eddy simulation les method for the investigations of the wake field behind the kriso very large crude carrier 2 kvlcc2 the authors concluded that the unsteadiness in the wake behind ships of full form should be considered during investigation of propulsion and unsteady loadings since it can be very large since the complete hydrodynamic similarity between model and full scale ship cannot be achieved experimentally obtained results are subjected to scale effects one of the main parameters influenced by scale effects is the wake field in order to investigate the wake field around the ship stern numerous experimental studies have been performed and reliable computational methods have been developed and applied seo et al 2016 distributions of time averaged steady wake flow can be used for the design of propeller i e prediction of delivered power and rotational speed pecoraro et al 2015 nowadays the best approximation of the full scale nominal wake can be assessed utilizing high resolution cfd simulations ittc 2011 pereira et al 2017 have quantified the numerical and modelling errors of the solution for the flow around tanker model as well as numerical errors at full scale in order to evaluate the numerical accuracy in the prediction of the scale effects in guo et al 2013 the authors have performed a systematic analysis of the experimental and numerical uncertainty for the ship resistance distribution at the fore and aft segments as well as for ship s sinkage and trim the authors compared the results obtained with two turbulence models k ω sst and explicit algebraic stress k ω model easm and with four grid densities the results showed that anisotropic easm predicts the wake flow and resistance in the aft segment better other parameters which are subjected to the scale effect are force and moment coefficients of propeller bhattacharyya et al 2016 therefore the appropriate scaling method should be applied for scaling of the measured data obtained in open water test owt in model scale the rapid development of cfd has enabled a prediction of hydrodynamic characteristics of the propeller at full scale and has provided a new way to study scale effects of propellers wang et al 2016 helma 2016 has presented an alternative extrapolation method which uses the concept of the equivalent profile the author claimed that this method can be applied for all propeller geometries and that is independent of the load distribution on the blade the only requirement is that no separation occurs at model tests which should be performed at high enough reynolds number rn baek et al 2015 have investigated the effects of advance ratio j on the wake characteristics of a propeller in owt based on the obtained numerical results the authors provided empirical models of the tip vortex which can be used for establishment of reliable wake modelling lin and kouh 2015 have studied the scale effect of the thrust deduction factor on a newly proposed self propulsion procedure the authors showed that scale effects on the trust deduction factor are irrelevant from practical viewpoint hai long et al 2016 have assessed scale effects of two energy saving devices esd utilizing cfd the authors showed that predicted energy gains at model scale are significantly larger than the ones predicted at full scale a detailed analysis of design developments for a lng twin skeg hull has been shown in kim et al 2014 using cfd and by performing towing tank tests the authors highlighted benefits of twin skeg design significant decrease of fuel consumption was predicted for a particular ship with twin skeg design from computational point of view free surface computations of self propulsion at full scale using a discretized propeller and dynamic overset approach provide a complete cfd prediction of self propulsion factors at full scale castro et al 2011 these simulations represent a current state of the art but since they are computationally very expensive many researchers apply simplified methods in numerical self propulsion tests a coupled rans and boundary element method bem has been analysed in order to highlight advantages and disadvantages of the proposed coupling procedure gaggero et al 2017 the procedure was validated with the available experimental results for kcs and after that simulations were repeated for various ship types to investigate robustness of the proposed procedure in this paper hydrodynamic coefficients of typical handymax bulk carrier at full scale in sea trial conditions are determined utilizing cfd simulations the commercial software package star ccm is used for grid generation and for the numerical simulations of the resistance open water and self propulsion tests verification procedure is performed through grid and time step convergence study for four different turbulence

simulations are performed for three different load conditions i e for design scantling and light ballast draughts furthermore simulations are performed for two different speeds the obtained results are validated against the obtained towing tank results since experimental values are obtained for model scale the obtained results are extrapolated using five extrapolation methods this paper is organised as follows section 2 gives governing equations and the explanation of the applied numerical procedure while in section 3 performed towing tank tests and five extrapolation methods are discussed in section 4 numerical setup used in this paper is briefly described along with the verification and validation procedure the numerically obtained results as well as comparison with experimentally obtained results are shown in section 5 finally in section 6 conclusions drawn from this research are discussed and plan for future research is given 2 governing equations numerical simulations of incompressible viscous flow are performed using commercial software package star ccm rans equations and averaged continuity equation are used for the quantitative description of the

applied standard k ε ske realizible k ε rke shear stress transport k ω sstko and reynolds stress model rsm first three turbulence models represent isotropic eddy viscosity models while rsm takes into account anisotropy of the reynolds stresses the eddy viscosity model for the reynolds stress is based on the assumption that turbulence effects can be described as increased viscosity ferziger and

dimensional flows which are often present in problems related to the ship hydrodynamics in rsm differential equations are defined for the individual components of the symmetric rst and thus complex interactions in turbulent flow fields can be solved more reliably along with six rst equations one equation is needed for the isotropic turbulent dissipation ε and this equation is the same as the one in ske turbulence model therefore rsm requires more computational power than ske rke and sstko turbulence models which require two additional equations for closing the equations 1 and 2 in following text basic equations related to the ske rke sstko and rsm turbulence model are given 2 1 1 standard k ε ske and realizible k ε rke turbulence models within k ε turbulence models two equations are

moving reference frame mrf is the reference frame that can rotate and translate with the respect to the stationary reference frame this model is based on the assumption that the angular velocity of the body is constant and that the mesh is rigid the computational domain is divided into the stationary and rotational part for the numerical simulations of owt the absolute velocity u 0 i is related

used for modelling the effects of a marine propeller therefore numerical simulations of self propulsion tests are made without resolving the geometry of the propeller this method is based on a uniform distribution of volume force over the cylindrical virtual disk the volume force varies only in radial direction and its components follow the goldstein optimum star ccm user guide 2017 26 f b x a x r

typical handymax bulk carrier has been subjected to extensive towing tank measurements brodarski institute 2014 a ship model was made of wood in a scale λ 25 2 and hull lines can be seen in fig 1 the main particulars of ship model are shown in table 1 resistance and self propulsion tests were performed in brodarski institute zagreb in the towing tank no 1 for design scantling and light ballast draughts the main dimensions of towing tank no 1 are length 276 3 m width 12 5 m and depth 6 m considering these dimensions in relation to the main particulars of the ship model and since towing tank experiments were made for relatively low froude numbers fn no blockage effects were taken into account the total resistance was measured for different fn values in order to obtain resistance curve in fig 2 ship model towed at fn 0 202 is shown self propulsion tests spt were made using the stock propeller stock propeller is from wageningen series and its main particulars are shown in table 2 during owt propeller model was attached to the horizontal shaft the draught of the centre line of the shaft was one and a half diameter below the water surface the rotational speed of the propeller was kept constant i e n 18 01 s 1 while the advance velocity was varied thus the whole range of the advance coefficient was examined spt were performed by means of british method i e at different propeller loads for constant velocity furthermore tests were made for seven different velocities for each draught the obtained results of towing tank measurements can be scaled to full scale ship using the certain extrapolation method 3 1 extrapolation methods within this section five different extrapolation methods are described extrapolation methods described in subsections 3 1 3 and 3 1 4 are based on the ittc 1978 performance prediction method but slightly modified as described in those subsections 3 1 1 ittc 1957 performance prediction method international towing tank conference ittc has proposed in 1957 an extrapolation method for scaling the obtained towing tank results at model to full scale this method is based on the froude resistance decomposition using this method total resistance of full scale ship can be determined as follows 33 r t s 1 2 c t s ρ v 2 s where v is the ship speed and c t s is the total resistance coefficient of full scale ship which can be obtained as follows 34 c t s c f s c r c a where c f s is the frictional resistance coefficient obtained using the ittc 1957 model ship correlation line c r is the residual resistance coefficient which is the same for model and ship and c a is the incremental resistance coefficient which varies within different institutions thus several institutions use constant value of c a 0 0004 while some institutions consider c a as a function of ship type and ship size brodarski institute considers c a as a function of rn and for this particular ship following values were applied c a 0 00008 for design draught c a 0 0001 for scantling draught and c a 0 00002 for the light ballast draught brodarski institute 2014 as said before spt were made by means of british method the self propulsion point of ship was obtained at the propeller load that corresponds to the skin friction corrections which can be calculated as follows 35 f d 1 2 ρ m v m 2 s m c f m c f s c a where index m represents model values and index s represents ship values once the self propulsion point of ship for certain speed is obtained i e r t m t m f d propeller rate of revolution n s and speed v s for full scale ship can be calculated according to froude similarity law as follows 36 n s n m λ 37 v s v m λ obtained values of n s represent propeller rate of revolution in towing tank conditions those values are then multiplied by ship model correlation factors for propeller rate of revolution k 2 ship model correlation factors for propeller rate of revolution k 2 n t r i a l n tank were k 2 1 03 for design draught t 9 90 m k 2 1 025 for scantling draught t 11 3 m and k 2 1 05 for light ballast draught brodarski institute 2014 it should be noted that thrust and torque for full scale ship are obtained by applying the scaling laws i e by multiplying the model scale values with λ 3 for thrust and with λ 4 for torque and with density scale λ ρ ρ s ρ m thrust deduction factor t can be easily determined once the resistance and thrust values for full scale ship at certain speed are known effective wake coefficient w is calculated for model scale using the procedure described in section 3 1 2 obtained values for model scale are then taken as the full scale values i e no scaling of the effective wake coefficient is applied also there is no need for scaling of owt results 3 1 2 ittc 1978 performance prediction method this method has become widely accepted procedure for the evaluation of towing tank results within this method the total resistance coefficient is decomposed as follows 38 c t s 1 k c f s c w δ c f where k is the form factor c w is the wave resistance coefficient assumed the same for the model and ship and δ c f is the roughness allowance which can be calculated as follows 39 δ c f 0 001 105 k h l w l 1 3 0 64 where k h is the roughness taken as k h 150 10 6 m the extrapolation of owt results is carried out as follows 40 k t s k t m 0 3 c z d p d δ c d 41 k q s k q m 0 25 c z d δ c d where c is the chord length at radius 0 7d and δ c d is the difference between c dm and c ds 42 c d m 2 1 2 t c 0 044 r n c o 1 6 5 r n c o 2 3 43 c d s 2 1 2 t c 1 89 1 62 log c k p 2 5 where r n c o is rn at 0 7d t is the maximum blade thickness at radius 0 7d and k p is the blade roughness taken as k p 30 10 6 m using the thrust identity assumption advance number at model scale j m can be determined and thus w m can be calculated thrust deduction factor is assumed to be the same for the model and full scale ship and can be calculated as follows 44 t 1 f d r t m t m where f d is determined according to 35 and with c a δ c f the relative rotative efficiency η r can be determined as follows 45 η r m η r s k q o w t k q s p t where k q s p t is the torque coefficient obtained in spt while k q o w t is the torque coefficient obtained in owt effective wake fraction coefficient for full scale ship is calculated according to the following equation 46 w s w m c f s c f m t 0 04 1 c f s c f m in order to obtain n s curve with parameter k t j 2 s has to be drawn in owt diagram for full scale propeller and intersection of this curve and k t s curve from owt diagram represents j s afterwards n s as well as η o s can be easily determined 3 1 3 ittc 1978 performance prediction method 1999 in 1999 ittc has suggested modification of ittc 1978 performance prediction method ppm regarding the determination of w s as follows 47 w s t 0 04 w m t 0 04 1 k c f s δ c f 1 k c f m 3 1 4 ittc 1978 performance prediction method 2017 the main modification in this method is that correlation factor c a has been separated from roughness allowance δ c f in this method δ c f is calculated as follows 48 δ c f 0 044 k h l w l 1 3 10 r n 1 3 0 000125 while c a is calculated using following equation 49 c a 0 001 5 68 0 6 log r n however it is recommended that each institution use its own model ship correlation 3 1 5 grigson extrapolation method this method is used only for extrapolating the total resistance to full scale it is based on the grigson friction line defined as follows watson 1998 50 c f m 0 93 0 1377 log r n 6 3 2 0 06334 log r n 6 3 4 0 075 log r n 2 2 for 1 5 10 6 r n 2 10 7 51 c f s 1 032 0 02816 log r n 8 0 006273 log r n 8 2 0 075 log r n 2 2 for 10 8 r n 4 10 9 the form factor value used in this extrapolation method is calculated according to the following equation 52 k 1 4 c b 1 3 s l w l 2 the total resistance of the ship is calculated using the same procedure as described in ittc 1978 ppm but with the coefficients and form factor given with equations 50 52 it should be noted that roughness allowance within this method is taken according to equation 48 4 numerical setup numerical simulations of resistance open water and self propulsion tests are made within commercial software package star ccm for full scale ship governing equations of viscous flow are presented in section 2 finite volume method is used for discretization of governing equations which are solved in a segregated manner a second order upwind scheme is used for the discretization of convection terms in rans equations while the first order temporal scheme is used for temporal discretization the full scale ship within numerical simulations is kept fixed and its hull surface condition is assumed to be the same as proposed in ittc 1978 ppm since there is no prospect of adequately handling non uniform roughness effects with rans equations eca and hoekstra 2011 roughness effects can be handled through uniformly distributed sand grain roughness either using wall function or near wall treatment within this paper roughness effects are modelled using the roughness function proposed in demirel et al 2017 this roughness function δ u modifies the log law and non dimensional velocity is calculated as follows 53 u 1 κ ln y b δ u where κ is the von karman constant y is the non dimensional wall distance and b is the smooth wall log law intercept roughness function is divided into the three flow regimes hydrodynamically smooth transitionally rough and fully rough the value of this function in last two regimes depends on the roughness rn k while for hydrodynamically smooth flow regime δ u value is equal to zero k is defined according to the equivalent sand grain roughness height k s schultz 2007 has proposed a relation between surface condition equivalent to the one proposed by ittc k h 150 10 6 m and k s which is for this surface condition equal to k s 30 10 6 m it should be noted that equation 43 was suggested using the equation for drag coefficient of flat plate in fully rough regime proposed in schlichting 1979 in the equation proposed by schlichting 1979 k s is used and therefore k p in the equation 43 is actually k s thus the same surface roughness condition is assumed for hull and propeller surface 4 1 computational domain discretization boundary conditions the computational domain is discretized using the unstructured hexahedral mesh for numerical simulations of resistance tests only half of computational domain is created while for owt and spt whole computational domain is created in numerical simulations of spt rudder is included as done in towing tank experiments brodarski institute 2014 near wall mesh generation is performed carefully by creating the prism layers around hull and propeller surfaces prism layer thickness is set in order to keep y values above 30 since wall functions are used furthermore y values should be higher than k value as suggested in star ccm user guide 2017 the mesh for resistance tests and spt is refined in the bow and stern region close to the hull and near free surface in addition mesh is also refined in order to capture kelvin wake fig 3 for spt mesh is also refined in region where virtual disk is placed fig 4 the obtained y distribution for the velocity of 16 32 kn within numerical simulation of the resistance test is shown in fig 5 the domain boundaries must be placed far enough from the ship or propeller in order to avoid their influence on the numerical solution the domain boundaries for resistance tests and spt are placed at the same distance from the ship fig 6 since symmetry boundary condition is not applied in numerical simulations of spt right boundary is placed at the same distance as left boundary in the resistance tests i e 2 75 l p p applied boundary conditions for resistance tests and spt are the same except the symmetry condition used in resistance tests in fig 7 applied boundary conditions for numerical simulations of spt are shown volume of fluid vof wave damping is applied at the outlet inlet and left side boundaries in resistance tests while in spt was applied at the outlet inlet and side boundaries using the damping function defined in star ccm farkas et al 2017 within numerical simulations of resistance tests and spt damping length is set to l p p body force method uniformly distributes the volume force over the cylindrical virtual disk which is defined through inner radius outer radius and thickness inner radius is set as propeller hub radius outer radius is set as propeller radius r and thickness is set as propeller thickness an inflow velocity plane where an average velocity and density are calculated as propeller inflow must be specified this plane is defined with inflow plane radius which is set as 1 1r and inflow plane offset inflow velocity plane is offset by distance 1 1d towards the ship bow from the origin of the virtual disk coordinate system star ccm user guide 2017 after the propeller inflow is obtained thrust and torque used in equations 31 and 32 can be obtained using owt results afterwards volume force distribution in radial and tangential direction are calculated and the integration of these forces over the disk gives the thrust and torque of the propeller in spt it should be noted that simulations of resistance tests and spt are stopped when the total resistance force became steady as done in farkas et al 2017 the cylindrical computational domain for owt is created according to the recommendations proposed in star ccm user guide 2017 fig 8 in order to capture the shape of the blades more accurately the mesh refinement is made along the leading and trailing edge of the propeller thus a proper demarcation between the pressure and suction side of the propeller is made owt results are required as an input data for body force method which is used in spt therefore numerical simulations of owt are performed for full scale propeller at eleven values of j in the range from 0 08 to 0 88 the variations of j are obtained by changing the inlet velocity i e advance speed while rotational speed is kept constant it should be noted that simulations for each j are stopped after 2000 iterations applied boundary conditions for owt are as follows velocity inlet for inlet boundary pressure outlet for outlet boundary slip wall for lateral surface of a cylinder and no slip wall for propeller cap and shaft surfaces computational domain for owt is discretized using unstructured hexahedral mesh with five million cells as in resistance tests and spt wall functions are used and therefore y values are kept above 30 4 2 verification study numerical simulations are performed for four turbulence models described in section 2 1 firstly an extensive verification study is made for resistance test at t 9 9 m and v 16 32 kn for two input parameters grid size and time step according to the ittc procedure ittc 2017 this study for grid size is made with three meshes i e coarse 2 5 m cells medium 5 m cells and fine 10 m cells using the medium time step thus a uniform refinement ratio r i is equal to 2 3 verification study for time step is made with three time steps with r i 2 t 100 t 200 and t 400 using the medium mesh t is defined as the ratio between l p p and ship speed convergence ratio is defined as follows 54 r i ε i 21 ε i 32 where ε i 21 is the change between solution obtained using medium s ˆ i 2 and fine s ˆ i 1 input parameter and ε i 32 is the change between solution obtained using coarse s ˆ i 3 and medium input parameter r i is used for estimation of convergence conditions monotonic convergence is achieved when 0 r i 1 oscillatory convergence is achieved when 1 r i 0 and divergence is achieved when r i 1 numerical uncertainties and errors for monotonic convergence condition are estimated using generalized richardson extrapolation re the order of accuracy is defined as follows 55 p i ln ε i 32 ε i 21 ln r i re error is calculated using following equation 56 δ r e ε i 21 r p i 1 the generalized re solution s ˆ r e can then be calculated as the difference between s ˆ i 1 and δ r e factor of safety approach is used for estimating the uncertainty u i this approach defines u i as a product of safety factor f s 1 25 and δ r e the normalized uncertainties are calculated as follows 57 u u i s ˆ r e 100 4 3 validation study numerical simulations are validated with extrapolated towing tank results using extrapolation methods described in section 3 1 relative deviations between obtained numerical solutions φ c f d and extrapolated values φ e x are calculated as follows 58 r d φ c f d φ e x φ e x 100 5 results within this section the results of verification study are shown as well as the obtained results for break power propeller rotational speed and ship hydrodynamic coefficients for design and slow steaming speeds at three different draughts obtained numerical results are validated and relative deviations are calculated 5 1 verification verification study for grid size and time step is performed for resistance tests at design draught and design speed for all turbulence models described in section 2 1 furthermore verification study is performed for numerical simulations of spt at design draught and design speed with rke turbulence model but only for grid size the obtained results for verification study for resistance tests at design draught with time step as input parameter are shown in table 3 it should be noted that according to the ittc recommendations time step should be in range from 0 005 l v to 0 01 l v where l is the ship length and v is the ship speed the limits of this range correspond to the selected coarse 0 01 l v and medium 0 005 l v time step since resistance test which takes into account hull roughness represents a very complex problem demirel et al 2017 have used significantly lower time step than the recommended one i e 0 0005 l v therefore numerical simulation of resistance test with rke turbulence model is performed with time step proposed in demirel et al 2017 and the obtained value of total resistance is equal to 609 564 n this value is very close to s ˆ r e solution which is expected since proposed time step is ten times lower than the one proposed by ittc for each turbulence model the monotonic convergence is achieved the obtained normalized uncertainties are very low i e the highest u is obtained with rke turbulence model and it is equal to 0 167 the obtained values of total resistance with medium time step i e 0 005 l v for all turbulence models are already very close to s ˆ r e solutions the highest discrepancy between solution obtained with medium time step s ˆ i 2 and s ˆ r e solution can be observed for rke however it is low i e 0 326 to shorten the duration of numerical simulations and considering very low discrepancies between s ˆ i 2 and s ˆ r e medium time step is used in the remaining numerical simulations the verification study for resistance tests at design draught for grid size as input parameter is performed with three grid densities as mentioned in section 4 2 the obtained results of this study are shown in table 4 as can be seen from table 4 the monotonic convergence is achieved for all turbulence models except for ske where divergence is achieved normalized uncertainties are calculated for rke sstko and rsm and the highest u is obtained for rsm and it is equal to 0 033 the verification study of numerical spt with rke turbulence model is performed only for grid size with three grid densities coarse grid 1 9 m cells medium grid 4 1 m cells and fine grid 8 9 m cells thus r i is equal to 1 293 this study is performed for propeller rotational speed n and delivered power p d at self propulsion point and results are shown in table 5 as can be seen from table 5 monotonic convergence is achieved for both n and p d the obtained normalized uncertainty for n is low and equals 1 184 while for p d is higher and equals 6 806 considering low u and since discrepancies between s ˆ i 2 and s ˆ r e are relatively low medium grid can be considered as good compromise between computational time and accuracy for both resistance tests and spt therefore remaining numerical simulations are performed using the medium grid 5 2 resistance tests within this subsection the obtained results of resistance tests are presented and validated against the extrapolated values of towing tank tests in order to apply ittc 1978 ppm ittc 1978 ppm 1999 and ittc 1978 ppm 2017 form factor should be determined ittc have recommended the use of prohaska s method for determination of form factor value within this method ship model is towed at low fn where wave resistance is almost negligible and thus measured value of total resistance is actually viscous resistance in table 6 form factor values obtained using the prohaska s method for three different load conditions are shown as well as the form factor values obtained using the equation 52 it can be seen from table 6 that k values are very similar for both methods and that k value depends on the load condition thus the significant difference in k value is obtained for scantling and light ballast draughts this can be explained through a more considerable change of main particulars of a ship for ballast draught than for design or scantling draughts only resistance test for design draught and design speed is performed using four turbulence models described in section 2 1 while other resistance tests are performed using rke turbulence model numerical simulations of resistance tests are made for two ship speeds which are predicted by extrapolating the towing tank results with ittc 1957 ppm design speed v s which corresponds to 75 of maximum continuous rating mcr and slow steaming speed v s s corresponding to 50 of mcr in table 6 the obtained numerical results of resistance test for design draught at design speed are presented numerical results are validated against the extrapolated towing tank results using extrapolation methods described in section 3 1 it should be noted that results shown in table 7 are obtained utilizing medium grid as it can be seen from table 7 numerical results underpredict the extrapolated values of towing tank results the greatest rd are obtained for ittc 1957 ppm which decompose total resistance into frictional and residual resistance since residual resistance is also dependent on rn i e viscous pressure resistance r p v is dependent on the both rn and fn residual resistance should also be scaled as frictional resistance rather than assumed to be constant at model and full scale it should be noted that a part of this shortcoming of scaling procedure is taken into account with the incremental resistance coefficient since ittc has not prescribed how to determine c a this ppm is dependent on the selection of this coefficient and several towing tank institutes have different approaches for its determination ittc ppm 1978 and ittc ppm 1978 1999 use the same procedure for the determination of total resistance both methods scale r p v by introduction of form factor value and the roughness of ship hull is taken into account by introducing δ c f the main difference between ittc 1978 ppm and ittc 1978 ppm 2017 is separation of the correlation factor and roughness allowance in latter within ittc 1978 ppm 2017 both coefficients are given and thus this method is the most comprehensive one however it should be mentioned that results of the total resistance obtained using ittc 1978 ppm and ittc 1978 ppm 2017 are very similar with relative deviation lower than 0 2 for this load condition at design speed the result obtained with rsm turbulence model has the smallest relative deviation from the extrapolated values as said before within rsm rst is obtained from six additional equations rather than being modelled thus this model considers the anisotropy of rst and predicts the vortices better however the computational time of numerical simulation using rsm turbulence model is significantly larger in table 8 the numerical results obtained using rke turbulence model and medium grid are shown as it can be seen from table 8 numerically obtained results underpredict extrapolated values of towing tank measurements considering loading conditions and the ship speed the lowest rd are obtained for the design speed at scantling draught while the highest rd are obtained for the slow steaming speed at light ballast draught considering different ppm it should be noted that the highest rd are obtained with ittc 1957 ppm while the lowest rd are obtained with grigson extrapolation method which can be considered as the most accurate ppm currently watson 1998 extrapolation methods have several deficiencies first major deficiency is that form factor value is dependent on the scale i e rn as shown by pereira et al 2017 thus the scaling of the viscous resistance coefficient is not reliable the authors have used the results of numerical simulations and ittc 1957 model ship correlation line for the determination of form factor value however raven et al 2008 have shown that when grigson friction line is used the form factor value does not depend on the scale in the case of a containership and only slightly depends on scale for tanker thus an assumption of constant form factor for model scale and full scale is acceptable but only if grigson friction line is used therefore it can be concluded that the first deficiency is avoided when grigson ppm is used and hence the obtained rd are the lowest for this ppm another important deficiency are the scale effects on the wave coefficients and the wave pattern as claimed by raven et al 2008 the viscous effects on the stern wave making are present which is in direct correlation with the wave resistance since lower stern wave causes less radiated wave energy i e lower wave resistance therefore the stern wave system is reduced by the viscous effects and this reduction is higher at model scale since at model scale viscous effects are relatively higher than at full scale therefore wave coefficient should be higher for full scale rn than for model scale rn however it should be noted that the hull of full scale ship is not hydrodynamically smooth and hence the increase in the viscous effects caused by roughness of the ship hull leads to the decrease of the stern wave system and consequently wave coefficient as shown by demirel et al 2017 for that reason wave coefficient has both positive and negative scale effects i e it should be both increased and decreased at full scale due to lack of the total resistance data for full scale the assumption that wave coefficient is constant can be considered as reasonable especially for ships which sail at lower fn values where the portion of the wave resistance is relatively low compared to the other resistance components nevertheless additional research should be made regarding this problem in order to increase the accuracy of ppm 5 3 open water tests as said before owt are performed for full scale propeller and the obtained results are compared with extrapolated values of towing tank measurements numerical simulations of owt are performed utilizing all turbulence models described in section 2 1 and the obtained results for the thrust and torque coefficients as well as for the open water efficiency are presented for a range of advance coefficients around self propulsion point table 9 as it can be seen from table 9 the satisfactory agreement between numerical results and extrapolated values is achieved for all turbulence models furthermore it can be seen from table 9 that all numerical results are very similar regardless of turbulence model it should be noted that j spt i e advance coefficient at self propulsion point is closest to j 0 56 the lowest rd are obtained for η o and j 0 56 using all turbulence models i e r d are below 0 75 the obtained results for k t and k q have higher rd compared to the ones obtained for η o the highest rd obtained at j 0 56 for k t is equal to 5 82 and for k q is equal to 5 73 extrapolation method described in ittc 1978 ppm for owt results obtained in towing tank has several deficiencies first deficiency is that correlations described within equations 40 44 are based on statistics and the database for statistical analysis was relatively small helma 2016 this deficiency is more highlighted for unconventional propellers and since the propeller considered within this study is from the wageningen series it can be assumed that this deficiency does not affect the obtained results significantly another deficiency is that linear correlation between change in thrust coefficient δ k t torque coefficient δ k q and pitch to diameter ratio is assumed this assumption can lead to inaccurate results for the cambered propellers the last deficiency is that owt should be performed at higher rn values than prescribed by ittc helma 2016 since the obtained owt characteristics are not the same at lower and higher rn values it should be noted that within this paper experimental owt are performed at rn in the range from 3 10 5 to 3 9 10 5 which is above the lowest value prescribed by ittc i e 2 10 5 5 4 self propulsion test results numerical simulation of spt for the design draught at the design speed is performed using four turbulence models self propulsion point spp is obtained when r t t within spt in table 10 the obtained results regarding the propeller revolution rate and break power at spp as well as the validation of numerical results are shown it should be noted that mechanical losses are equal to 0 5 i e η m 0 995 validation is performed by comparison with the extrapolated values of towing tank results as it can be seen from table 10 the obtained results overestimate the extrapolated values for both n s p p and p b s p p the obtained rd for n s p p are lower than the ones for p b s p p the highest rd for n s p p is not greater than 6 3 regardless of chosen turbulence model and ppm rd obtained for p b s p p are generally below 10 it is important to notice that the highest rd for n s p p obtained utilizing different ppm is equal to 0 4 while for p b s p p it is equal to 1 5 since p b s p p depends on the prediction of both n s p p and q s p p i e torque at spp the higher rd for p b s p p is expected the best agreement with the extrapolated values is obtained using sstko turbulence model where rd obtained for both n s p p and p b s p p are below 5 the highest rd for both n s p p and p b s p p are obtained for ske turbulence model within table 11 hydrodynamic coefficients obtained with numerical simulations as well as using four ppm are shown furthermore rd between numerical and extrapolated results are also shown as it can be seen from table 11 all hydrodynamic coefficients obtained with numerical simulations have satisfactory agreement with the ones obtained using different ppm it can be seen that relatively high overestimation of 1 w is obtained however similar rd are obtained in the literature gaggero et al 2017 choi et al 2010 as well rd between numerically obtained hydrodynamic coefficients and the ones obtained using four ppm can be associated with various aspects for example insufficiently accurate prediction of the nominal wake as well as underestimation of the propeller performance in owt which can be directly correlated to the overestimated values of n s p p c f d furthermore modelling error should be also considered since in the body force method the effect of propeller is modelled rather than propeller itself there is a numerical error as well which could be decreased if a grid with higher number of cells is used however there are also aspects regarding ppm which cause the increase in rd for example ittc 1957 ppm does not scale w i e w obtained at model scale is the same as the one at the full scale which is proven to be inaccurate pereira et al 2017 in order to avoid introduced errors by ppm the obtained numerical results should be compared with the measured values at full scale still the data related to ship hydrodynamic coefficients measured at full scale is very rare and often confidential so many researches compare their numerical results with the extrapolated towing tank values the overall propulsive efficiency can be calculated as follows 59 η p 1 t 1 w η b where η b is the propeller efficiency behind the ship hull regarding η p it should be noted that the lowest rd between numerically obtained η p and the ones obtained using certain ppm is obtained with rsm turbulence model which is expected since this turbulence model is the most complex one however since numerical simulations with rsm turbulence model require larger computational time numerical simulations of spt for other load conditions and speeds are performed with rke turbulence model the obtained results regarding n s p p and p b s p p for different load conditions as well as for different speeds are shown in tables 12 and 13 respectively furthermore rd of the obtained numerical results and extrapolated towing tank results are also shown within tables 12 and 13 as it can be seen from tables 12 and 13 the obtained numerical results mostly overestimate the extrapolated results lower rd are obtained for n s p p and the highest rd does not exceed 6 75 regardless of ship speed and load condition rd for p b s p p are somewhat higher than rd for n s p p with the highest rd lower than 13 it should be noted that discrepancies between extrapolated results obtained with different ppm are relatively low for design and scantling draughts i e below 1 5 however these rd are higher for light ballast conditions where for the design speed the highest rd between the results obtained with different ppm is equal to 4 87 and for slow steaming speed it is equal to 3 76 these high deviations are caused by lower break power which is predicted by ittc 1957 ppm in ittc 1957 ppm c a as a function of rn is based on the statistics and taken as prescribed by brodarski institute due to significantly lower number of power predictions for ballast draughts the uncertainty is higher for the determination of c a for ballast condition this is the important benefit of using cfd for power prediction at spp since it is not necessary to know the value of c a which is the coefficient that takes into account a scale effects within all ppm described in this study scale effects are considered either through c a or δ c f the improvement in the assessment of these two coefficients can be done utilizing cfd methods based on viscous flow and this can have significant application especially for ballast conditions where scale effects are less investigated in tables 14 17 the obtained hydrodynamic coefficients in spt for different load conditions as well as for different speeds are shown the lowest rd between numerical and extrapolated results for the overall propulsive efficiency are obtained for ittc 1978 ppm regardless of load condition and ship speed while the highest rd are obtained for ittc 1957 ppm as expected since within this ppm w is not scaled considering the hydrodynamic coefficients the highest rd are obtained for w which was also obtained in the gaggero et al 2017 choi et al 2010 as explained before those rd can be explained through several aspects it can be concluded that smaller rd would be obtained if the ship propeller is discretized i e if rigid body simulation is performed for example in sezen et al 2018 the authors compared results obtained with body force method and rigid body simulation body force method predicted lower propulsive efficiency and consequently higher delivered power than rigid body simulation the main reason for that was the underestimated hull efficiency with body force method which can be explained with the inability of the method to predict accurately the interaction between ship hull and propeller it should be noted that required computational time for body force method is significantly lower than required computational time for rigid body simulation where required time step is significantly lower and more cells are needed for a proper discretization of the propeller therefore since the most important parameters for engine selection are n s p p and p b s p p it can be concluded that cfd based on viscous flow and body force method can be used for power prediction and assessment of spp even with relatively coarse grid i e 4 1 m cells for spt therefore cfd can be considered as very important tool especially at preliminary design stage 5 5 the flow around ship hull within this subsection the flow around the ship hull obtained with numerical simulations is presented the accurate prediction of nominal wake is extremely important since it directly influences the propeller performance in spt at model scale due to lower rn the boundary layer is relatively thicker than at full scale also the strength of bilge vortex is reduced at full scale but the wake gradient is higher than at model scale recently numerical simulations of viscous flow at full scale have been imposed as the only relevant tool for the determination of the nominal wake at full scale ittc 2011 regarding the numerical simulations the nominal wake distribution is significantly influenced by turbulence model and therefore beside the standard mesh and time step sensitivity analysis it is very important to investigate the influence of turbulence model on the obtained results as well nominal wake distributions obtained by numerical simulations utilizing fine grid with different turbulence models for design draught at design speed are shown in fig 9 the obtained nominal wake distribution is characterized by significant velocity reduction due to ship boundary layer at 0 which is accurately predicted with all turbulence models the obtained vortex around the location of the hub is significantly narrower for rke and ske turbulence models than for sstko and rsm the largest vortex is obtained with rsm turbulence model which is proven to be the most accurate turbulence model for the nominal wake prediction gaggero et al 2017 pereira et al 2017 the transversal velocity distribution obtained utilizing fine grid with different turbulence models is shown in fig 10 it can be seen from fig 10 that the obtained hub vortex is the largest for rsm turbulence model in fig 11 the obtained nominal wakes and transversal velocities for design and light ballast draughts at design speed using rke turbulence model and medium grid are shown the obtained hub vortex is larger for light ballast draught than for design draught fig 11 in fig 12 the obtained longitudinal wave cuts along the centreline of ship utilizing different turbulence models are shown the stern wave begins at the transom while bow wave starts at fore perpendicular as it can be seen from fig 12 the similar longitudinal wave cut along the centreline of the ship is obtained for all turbulence models especially in bow region in fig 13 the obtained longitudinal wave cuts along the centreline of the ship in resistance tests and spt utilizing rke turbulence model are shown the wave cuts are shown for design scantling and light ballast draughts at the design speed within fig 13 the influence of the propeller on the stern wave can be seen thus the propeller causes the increase of the stern wave amplitude as well as the increase of the stern wave length the influence of the propeller on the stern wave is larger for design than for scantling draught this is expected since the propeller is more submerged for scantling draught even though stern wave is obviously larger in spt in order to improve convergence ratio it is often assumed that propeller does not cause the increase in the wave resistance and thus spt is carried out with double body assumption gaggero et al 2017 choi et al 2010 this assumption can be taken as valid especially for ships which sail at lower fn where the wave resistance represents only small portion of the total resistance as it can be seen from fig 14 the highest difference between height of bow wave obtained at design and slow steaming speed is obtained for scantling draught even though at scantling draught there is the smallest difference between design and slow steaming speed the highest bow wave is obtained for design draught at the design speed while the deepest wave trough is obtained for scantling draught at the design speed in fig 15 the obtained pressure distributions utilizing rsm turbulence model for design draught at the design speed in resistance test and spt are shown while in fig 16 the obtained pressure distributions utilizing rke turbulence model for light ballast draught at the design speed in resistance test and spt are shown it should be noted that rudder is left out within figs 15 and 16 as it can be seen from figs 15 and 16 the propeller influence on the pressure distribution is limited only in the region near the ship stern i e behind the stern shoulder this is in accordance with huang and groves 1981 where the authors showed that propeller has influence on the velocity and pressure distribution only in the region extending two propeller diameters upstream in fig 17 the obtained pressure distribution around ship stern for design draught at the design speed rsm and for light ballast draught at the design speed rke is shown in fig 17 the hydrodynamic pressure at the rudder can be seen the pressure gradient is higher for light ballast than for design draught therefore the rudder at the light ballast draught is more loaded 6 conclusion a comprehensive numerical and experimental study was performed in order to predict the self propulsion point and required brake power in full scale for three different load conditions typical for bulk carriers at two fn the towing tank measurements which included resistance open water and self propulsion tests were performed at brodarski institute for ship model the obtained experimental results were then extrapolated to full scale values utilizing five extrapolation methods for the determination of total resistance at full scale and four extrapolation methods for the determination of self propulsion point and required brake power at full scale numerical simulations of viscous flow around full scale ship were performed utilizing the commercial software package star ccm the roughness effects are considered through modification in the wall function solver proposed by demirel et al 2017 verification study for two input parameters time step and grid size was performed based on the procedure proposed by ittc this study was made utilizing four turbulence models for resistance tests for design draught at the design speed furthermore a verification study was made for spt but only for design draught at the design speed utilizing rke turbulence model based on these studies the time step and grid that proved to be a good compromise between the accuracy and required computational effort are chosen the differences between results obtained with different turbulence models are investigated within three different tests resistance open water and self propulsion the advantages and disadvantages of four turbulence models commonly used in the practice are highlighted for all performed tests rsm was proven to be the most accurate one thus utilizing rsm turbulence model the obtained full scale resistance value has rd from the extrapolated value using grigson extrapolation procedure equal to 4 furthermore the obtained hydrodynamic coefficients in the self propulsion condition utilizing rsm turbulence model have the smallest rd from the extrapolated values however since this model solves additional six equations for reynolds stresses rather than modelling this tensor rsm turbulence model requires significantly larger computational time the differences in the obtained nominal wakes with different turbulence models are highlighted the significant velocity reduction at 0 above the hub is accurately predicted with all turbulence models on the other hand rsm turbulence model predicted the larger hub vortex around the hub than the other turbulence models the predicted hub vortex is larger in the light ballast than in the design load condition and this should be taken into account in the propeller design even though significant differences are obtained in nominal wake prediction with different turbulence models there is no significant difference in prediction of the longitudinal wave cuts at the centreline of the hull the influence of the propeller on the stern wave was shown in terms of the increase of the stern wave height and the increase of the stern wave length the influence of the propeller on the pressure distribution was proven to be limited in the region behind the stern shoulder the higher pressure gradient at the rudder was obtained for light ballast than for design draught which causes the higher load on the rudder in the light ballast condition and this should be considered in the rudder design the obtained results for different load conditions for both resistance and self propulsion tests pointed out the importance of using cfd methods in the investigation of the scale effects as well as in the investigation of more comprehensive extrapolation methods thus cfd based on viscous flow can be used for better understanding of the scale effects and for reducing or possibly eliminating the correlation allowance the obtained numerical results utilizing the relatively simple rke turbulence model and relatively coarse mesh i e 4 1 m cells in the spt have shown the satisfactory agreement with the extrapolated values of the towing tank experiments thus it can be concluded that cfd is useful tool for prediction of the required brake power and the propeller rotational speed at the self propulsion point for different load conditions and speeds especially at the preliminary design stage rd between numerically obtained values of the ship hydrodynamic coefficients n s p p c f d and p b s p p c f d and the ones obtained utilizing ppm can be explained through several aspects thus the insufficiently accurate prediction of the nominal wake as well as underestimation of the propeller performance in the open water test can be directly associated with the obtained overestimation of n s p p c f d also there is modelling error since the effect of propeller in spt is modelled utilizing body force method this method has inability to predict accurately the interaction between ship hull and propeller since propeller was not modelled in spt sezen et al 2018 thus the obtained hull efficiency was underestimated and consequently higher p b s p p c f d was predicted furthermore there is numerical error which could be decreased if the grid with higher number of cells was used there are also several aspects regarding ppm and towing tank experiments which caused the increase in rd aspects regarding the towing tank experiments are mostly related to the measurement uncertainties aspects regarding ppm are related to the several scale effects which are not considered within ppm for example scale effects for the form factor and wave coefficient also there are aspects regarding the extrapolation of the open water performance and the influence of the hull roughness which are based on the statistical data all these aspects are considered through correlation allowance which is defined through simple equation based on the statistical data and this is the reason for increased uncertainty of ppm in order to avoid experimental uncertainties and uncertainties related to ppm the obtained numerical results should be compared to the measured values at full scale unfortunately there is only small amount of data related to the ship hydrodynamic coefficients n s p p c f d and p b s p p c f d measured at full scale and it is often confidential in order to reduce the uncertainties regarding the use of ppm the further investigation of scale effects on the value of form factor and wave coefficient as well as an analysis of the correlation allowance will form part of a future work acknowledgement the authors would like to thank the faculty of mechanical engineering and naval architecture university of zagreb for funding the licence of the software package star ccm the authors are also grateful to jadroplov for providing the experimental data for scientific purposes

propulsion test performance prediction method full scale ship 1 introduction maritime transport is the most important mode of cargo transport throughout history and nowadays since 90 of the international trade is carried out at sea with more than one hundred thousand commercial ships worldwide registered in over 150 countries maritime transport is the core of the world economy following the increase in liberalisation of economy and growing efficiency of shipping as mode of transport it can be concluded that future of this industry is prosperous however most of the current world fleet is powered by carbon based fuel and thus the release of harmful gases is an inevitable occurrence lately the international maritime organization imo has implemented regulations such as the energy efficiency design index eedi the ship energy efficiency management plan seemp as well as the energy operational indicator eeoi in order to decrease harmful gases emission in the shipping industry demirel et al 2017 reducing the fuel consumption is therefore a crucial parameter for future of shipping industry not only from shipowner s point of view but from environmental point of view as well in order to design a more energy efficient ship an accurate prediction of the propeller operating point in the initial design stage is crucial traditionally this prediction has been made by extrapolating the towing tank results performed at model scale even though the flow around ship model and full scale ship is not the same as complete hydrodynamic similarity cannot be achieved this approach has been proven to be reliable the main drawback of this approach is an extensive amount of time required to carry out the experiments and the substantial costs the rapid advances in computational power and numerical methods has led to development of computational fluid dynamics cfd choi et al 2010 the methods based on cfd are becoming more reliable and nowadays cfd is used for investigating many problems related to the ship hydrodynamics the main advantage of cfd methods apart from savings in time and money is that local flow characteristics can be more readily obtained tezdogan et al 2015 have carried out unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans simulations of kriso container ship kcs for a range of regular head waves at design and slow steaming speed the authors predicted the increase in effective power and resistance and showed the influence of speed reduction on the decrease in effective power numerical investigation of the interference resistance has been carried out in farkas et al 2017 after verification and validation study interference resistance has been investigated through procedure based on the resistance decomposition the authors found that the form factor of catamaran is correlated with the separation and thus the form factor of monohull and catamaran with identical demihulls are not the same peng et al 2014 have developed a modified dawson method in order to improve prediction of wave pattern and wave making resistance for ships of full form utilizing the proposed method the authors obtained flow field and wave resistance coefficients validation of the computed results was performed by comparison with experimental results and satisfactory agreement was obtained also their method improved numerical stability in the assessment of the flow field wave pattern and wave resistance stern flow field has been investigated for several transom configurations of kcs utilizing cfd based on viscous flow duy et al 2017 modification of transom height is proven to be more significant for the flow field than the modification of transom breadth the obtained results indicated that resistance can decrease with proper modifications of the transom height and breadth kornev and kleinsorge 2011 have applied a new hybrid urans and large eddy simulation les method for the investigations of the wake field behind the kriso very large crude carrier 2 kvlcc2 the authors concluded that the unsteadiness in the wake behind ships of full form should be considered during investigation of propulsion and unsteady loadings since it can be very large since the complete hydrodynamic similarity between model and full scale ship cannot be achieved experimentally obtained results are subjected to scale effects one of the main parameters influenced by scale effects is the wake field in order to investigate the wake field around the ship stern numerous experimental studies have been performed and reliable computational methods have been developed and applied seo et al 2016 distributions of time averaged steady wake flow can be used for the design of propeller i e prediction of delivered power and rotational speed pecoraro et al 2015 nowadays the best approximation of the full scale nominal wake can be assessed utilizing high resolution cfd simulations ittc 2011 pereira et al 2017 have quantified the numerical and modelling errors of the solution for the flow around tanker model as well as numerical errors at full scale in order to evaluate the numerical accuracy in the prediction of the scale effects in guo et al 2013 the authors have performed a systematic analysis of the experimental and numerical uncertainty for the ship resistance distribution at the fore and aft segments as well as for ship s sinkage and trim the authors compared the results obtained with two turbulence models k ω sst and explicit algebraic stress k ω model easm and with four grid densities the results showed that anisotropic easm predicts the wake flow and resistance in the aft segment better other parameters which are subjected to the scale effect are force and moment coefficients of propeller bhattacharyya et al 2016 therefore the appropriate scaling method should be applied for scaling of the measured data obtained in open water test owt in model scale the rapid development of cfd has enabled a prediction of hydrodynamic characteristics of the propeller at full scale and has provided a new way to study scale effects of propellers wang et al 2016 helma 2016 has presented an alternative extrapolation method which uses the concept of the equivalent profile the author claimed that this method can be applied for all propeller geometries and that is independent of the load distribution on the blade the only requirement is that no separation occurs at model tests which should be performed at high enough reynolds number rn baek et al 2015 have investigated the effects of advance ratio j on the wake characteristics of a propeller in owt based on the obtained numerical results the authors provided empirical models of the tip vortex which can be used for establishment of reliable wake modelling lin and kouh 2015 have studied the scale effect of the thrust deduction factor on a newly proposed self propulsion procedure the authors showed that scale effects on the trust deduction factor are irrelevant from practical viewpoint hai long et al 2016 have assessed scale effects of two energy saving devices esd utilizing cfd the authors showed that predicted energy gains at model scale are significantly larger than the ones predicted at full scale a detailed analysis of design developments for a lng twin skeg hull has been shown in kim et al 2014 using cfd and by performing towing tank tests the authors highlighted benefits of twin skeg design significant decrease of fuel consumption was predicted for a particular ship with twin skeg design from computational point of view free surface computations of self propulsion at full scale using a discretized propeller and dynamic overset approach provide a complete cfd prediction of self propulsion factors at full scale castro et al 2011 these simulations represent a current state of the art but since they are computationally very expensive many researchers apply simplified methods in numerical self propulsion tests a coupled rans and boundary element method bem has been analysed in order to highlight advantages and disadvantages of the proposed coupling procedure gaggero et al 2017 the procedure was validated with the available experimental results for kcs and after that simulations were repeated for various ship types to investigate robustness of the proposed procedure in this paper hydrodynamic coefficients of typical handymax bulk carrier at full scale in sea trial conditions are determined utilizing cfd simulations the commercial software package star ccm is used for grid generation and for the numerical simulations of the resistance open water and self propulsion tests verification procedure is performed through grid and time step convergence study for four different turbulence models in towing and self propulsion conditions numerical uncertainties are calculated and grid independent solutions are obtained the effect of the hull roughness is taken into account and numerical simulations are performed for three different load conditions i e for design scantling and light ballast draughts furthermore simulations are performed for two different speeds the obtained results are validated against the obtained towing tank results since experimental values are obtained for model scale the obtained results are extrapolated using five extrapolation methods this paper is organised as follows section 2 gives governing equations and the explanation of the applied numerical procedure while in section 3 performed towing tank tests and five extrapolation methods are discussed in section 4 numerical setup used in this paper is briefly described along with the verification and validation procedure the numerically obtained results as well as comparison with experimentally obtained results are shown in section 5 finally in section 6 conclusions drawn from this research are discussed and plan for future research is given 2 governing equations numerical simulations of incompressible viscous flow are performed using commercial software package star ccm rans equations and averaged continuity equation are used for the quantitative description of the

applied standard k ε ske realizible k ε rke shear stress transport k ω sstko and reynolds stress model rsm first three turbulence models represent isotropic eddy viscosity models while rsm takes into account anisotropy of the reynolds stresses the eddy viscosity model for the reynolds stress is based on the assumption that turbulence effects can be described as increased viscosity ferziger and

interactions in turbulent flow fields can be solved more reliably along with six rst equations one equation is needed for the isotropic turbulent dissipation ε and this equation is the same as the one in ske turbulence model therefore rsm requires more computational power than ske rke and sstko turbulence models which require two additional equations for closing the equations 1 and 2 in following

moving reference frame mrf is the reference frame that can rotate and translate with the respect to the stationary reference frame this model is based on the assumption that the angular velocity of the body is constant and that the mesh is rigid the computational domain is divided into the stationary and rotational part for the numerical simulations of owt the absolute velocity u 0 i is related

used for modelling the effects of a marine propeller therefore numerical simulations of self propulsion tests are made without resolving the geometry of the propeller this method is based on a uniform distribution of volume force over the cylindrical virtual disk the volume force varies only in radial direction and its components follow the goldstein optimum star ccm user guide 2017 26 f b x a x r

typical handymax bulk carrier has been subjected to extensive towing tank measurements brodarski institute 2014 a ship model was made of wood in a scale λ 25 2 and hull lines can be seen in fig 1 the main particulars of ship model are shown in table 1 resistance and self propulsion tests were performed in brodarski institute zagreb in the towing tank no 1 for design scantling and light ballast draughts the main dimensions of towing tank no 1 are length 276 3 m width 12 5 m and depth 6 m considering these dimensions in relation to the main particulars of the ship model and since towing tank experiments were made for relatively low froude numbers fn no blockage effects were taken into account the total resistance was measured for different fn values in order to obtain resistance curve in fig 2 ship model towed at fn 0 202 is shown self propulsion tests spt were made using the stock propeller stock propeller is from wageningen series and its main particulars are shown in table 2 during owt propeller model was attached to the horizontal shaft the draught of the centre line of the shaft was one and a half diameter below the water surface the rotational speed of the propeller was kept constant i e n 18 01 s 1 while the advance velocity was varied thus the whole range of the advance coefficient was examined spt were performed by means of british method i e at different propeller loads for constant velocity furthermore tests were made for seven different velocities for each draught the obtained results of towing tank measurements can be scaled to full scale ship using the certain extrapolation method 3 1 extrapolation methods within this section five different extrapolation methods are described extrapolation methods described in subsections 3 1 3 and 3 1 4 are based on the ittc 1978 performance prediction method but slightly modified as described in those subsections 3 1 1 ittc 1957 performance prediction method international towing tank conference ittc has proposed in 1957 an extrapolation method for scaling the obtained towing tank results at model to full scale this method is based on the froude resistance decomposition using this method total resistance of full scale ship can be determined as follows 33 r t s 1 2 c t s ρ v 2 s where v is the ship speed and c t s is the total resistance coefficient of full scale ship which can be obtained as follows 34 c t s c f s c r c a where c f s is the frictional resistance coefficient obtained using the ittc 1957 model ship correlation line c r is the residual resistance coefficient which is the same for model and ship and c a is the incremental resistance coefficient which varies within different institutions thus several institutions use constant value of c a 0 0004 while some institutions consider c a as a function of ship type and ship size brodarski institute considers c a as a function of rn and for this particular ship following values were applied c a 0 00008 for design draught c a 0 0001 for scantling draught and c a 0 00002 for the light ballast draught brodarski institute 2014 as said before spt were made by means of british method the self propulsion point of ship was obtained at the propeller load that corresponds to the skin friction corrections which can be calculated as follows 35 f d 1 2 ρ m v m 2 s m c f m c f s c a where index m represents model values and index s represents ship values once the self propulsion point of ship for certain speed is obtained i e r t m t m f d propeller rate of revolution n s and speed v s for full scale ship can be calculated according to froude similarity law as follows 36 n s n m λ 37 v s v m λ obtained values of n s represent propeller rate of revolution in towing tank conditions those values are then multiplied by ship model correlation factors for propeller rate of revolution k 2 ship model correlation factors for propeller rate of revolution k 2 n t r i a l n tank were k 2 1 03 for design draught t 9 90 m k 2 1 025 for scantling draught t 11 3 m and k 2 1 05 for light ballast draught brodarski institute 2014 it should be noted that thrust and torque for full scale ship are obtained by applying the scaling laws i e by multiplying the model scale values with λ 3 for thrust and with λ 4 for torque and with density scale λ ρ ρ s ρ m thrust deduction factor t can be easily determined once the resistance and thrust values for full scale ship at certain speed are known effective wake coefficient w is calculated for model scale using the procedure described in section 3 1 2 obtained values for model scale are then taken as the full scale values i e no scaling of the effective wake coefficient is applied also there is no need for scaling of owt results 3 1 2 ittc 1978 performance prediction method this method has become widely accepted procedure for the evaluation of towing tank results within this method the total resistance coefficient is decomposed as follows 38 c t s 1 k c f s c w δ c f where k is the form factor c w is the wave resistance coefficient assumed the same for the model and ship and δ c f is the roughness allowance which can be calculated as follows 39 δ c f 0 001 105 k h l w l 1 3 0 64 where k h is the roughness taken as k h 150 10 6 m the extrapolation of owt results is carried out as follows 40 k t s k t m 0 3 c z d p d δ c d 41 k q s k q m 0 25 c z d δ c d where c is the chord length at radius 0 7d and δ c d is the difference between c dm and c ds 42 c d m 2 1 2 t c 0 044 r n c o 1 6 5 r n c o 2 3 43 c d s 2 1 2 t c 1 89 1 62 log c k p 2 5 where r n c o is rn at 0 7d t is the maximum blade thickness at radius 0 7d and k p is the blade roughness taken as k p 30 10 6 m using the thrust identity assumption advance number at model scale j m can be determined and thus w m can be calculated thrust deduction factor is assumed to be the same for the model and full scale ship and can be calculated as follows 44 t 1 f d r t m t m where f d is determined according to 35 and with c a δ c f the relative rotative efficiency η r can be determined as follows 45 η r m η r s k q o w t k q s p t where k q s p t is the torque coefficient obtained in spt while k q o w t is the torque coefficient obtained in owt effective wake fraction coefficient for full scale ship is calculated according to the following equation 46 w s w m c f s c f m t 0 04 1 c f s c f m in order to obtain n s curve with parameter k t j 2 s has to be drawn in owt diagram for full scale propeller and intersection of this curve and k t s curve from owt diagram represents j s afterwards n s as well as η o s can be easily determined 3 1 3 ittc 1978 performance prediction method 1999 in 1999 ittc has suggested modification of ittc 1978 performance prediction method ppm regarding the determination of w s as follows 47 w s t 0 04 w m t 0 04 1 k c f s δ c f 1 k c f m 3 1 4 ittc 1978 performance prediction method 2017 the main modification in this method is that correlation factor c a has been separated from roughness allowance δ c f in this method δ c f is calculated as follows 48 δ c f 0 044 k h l w l 1 3 10 r n 1 3 0 000125 while c a is calculated using following equation 49 c a 0 001 5 68 0 6 log r n however it is recommended that each institution use its own model ship correlation 3 1 5 grigson extrapolation method this method is used only for extrapolating the total resistance to full scale it is based on the grigson friction line defined as follows watson 1998 50 c f m 0 93 0 1377 log r n 6 3 2 0 06334 log r n 6 3 4 0 075 log r n 2 2 for 1 5 10 6 r n 2 10 7 51 c f s 1 032 0 02816 log r n 8 0 006273 log r n 8 2 0 075 log r n 2 2 for 10 8 r n 4 10 9 the form factor value used in this extrapolation method is calculated according to the following equation 52 k 1 4 c b 1 3 s l w l 2 the total resistance of the ship is calculated using the same procedure as described in ittc 1978 ppm but with the coefficients and form factor given with equations 50 52 it should be noted that roughness allowance within this method is taken according to equation 48 4 numerical setup numerical simulations of resistance open water and self propulsion tests are made within commercial software package star ccm for full scale ship governing equations of viscous flow are presented in section 2 finite volume method is used for discretization of governing equations which are solved in a segregated manner a second order upwind scheme is used for the discretization of convection terms in rans equations while the first order temporal scheme is used for temporal discretization the full scale ship within numerical simulations is kept fixed and its hull surface condition is assumed to be the same as proposed in ittc 1978 ppm since there is no prospect of adequately handling non uniform roughness effects with rans equations eca and hoekstra 2011 roughness effects can be handled through uniformly distributed sand grain roughness either using wall function or near wall treatment within this paper roughness effects are modelled using the roughness function proposed in demirel et al 2017 this roughness function δ u modifies the log law and non dimensional velocity is calculated as follows 53 u 1 κ ln y b δ u where κ is the von karman constant y is the non dimensional wall distance and b is the smooth wall log law intercept roughness function is divided into the three flow regimes hydrodynamically smooth transitionally rough and fully rough the value of this function in last two regimes depends on the roughness rn k while for hydrodynamically smooth flow regime δ u value is equal to zero k is defined according to the equivalent sand grain roughness height k s schultz 2007 has proposed a relation between surface condition equivalent to the one proposed by ittc k h 150 10 6 m and k s which is for this surface condition equal to k s 30 10 6 m it should be noted that equation 43 was suggested using the equation for drag coefficient of flat plate in fully rough regime proposed in schlichting 1979 in the equation proposed by schlichting 1979 k s is used and therefore k p in the equation 43 is actually k s thus the same surface roughness condition is assumed for hull and propeller surface 4 1 computational domain discretization boundary conditions the computational domain is discretized using the unstructured hexahedral mesh for numerical simulations of resistance tests only half of computational domain is created while for owt and spt whole computational domain is created in numerical simulations of spt rudder is included as done in towing tank experiments brodarski institute 2014 near wall mesh generation is performed carefully by creating the prism layers around hull and propeller surfaces prism layer thickness is set in order to keep y values above 30 since wall functions are used furthermore y values should be higher than k value as suggested in star ccm user guide 2017 the mesh for resistance tests and spt is refined in the bow and stern region close to the hull and near free surface in addition mesh is also refined in order to capture kelvin wake fig 3 for spt mesh is also refined in region where virtual disk is placed fig 4 the obtained y distribution for the velocity of 16 32 kn within numerical simulation of the resistance test is shown in fig 5 the domain boundaries must be placed far enough from the ship or propeller in order to avoid their influence on the numerical solution the domain boundaries for resistance tests and spt are placed at the same distance from the ship fig 6 since symmetry boundary condition is not applied in numerical simulations of spt right boundary is placed at the same distance as left boundary in the resistance tests i e 2 75 l p p applied boundary conditions for resistance tests and spt are the same except the symmetry condition used in resistance tests in fig 7 applied boundary conditions for numerical simulations of spt are shown volume of fluid vof wave damping is applied at the outlet inlet and left side boundaries in resistance tests while in spt was applied at the outlet inlet and side boundaries using the damping function defined in star ccm farkas et al 2017 within numerical simulations of resistance tests and spt damping length is set to l p p body force method uniformly distributes the volume force over the cylindrical virtual disk which is defined through inner radius outer radius and thickness inner radius is set as propeller hub radius outer radius is set as propeller radius r and thickness is set as propeller thickness an inflow velocity plane where an average velocity and density are calculated as propeller inflow must be specified this plane is defined with inflow plane radius which is set as 1 1r and inflow plane offset inflow velocity plane is offset by distance 1 1d towards the ship bow from the origin of the virtual disk coordinate system star ccm user guide 2017 after the propeller inflow is obtained thrust and torque used in equations 31 and 32 can be obtained using owt results afterwards volume force distribution in radial and tangential direction are calculated and the integration of these forces over the disk gives the thrust and torque of the propeller in spt it should be noted that simulations of resistance tests and spt are stopped when the total resistance force became steady as done in farkas et al 2017 the cylindrical computational domain for owt is created according to the recommendations proposed in star ccm user guide 2017 fig 8 in order to capture the shape of the blades more accurately the mesh refinement is made along the leading and trailing edge of the propeller thus a proper demarcation between the pressure and suction side of the propeller is made owt results are required as an input data for body force method which is used in spt therefore numerical simulations of owt are performed for full scale propeller at eleven values of j in the range from 0 08 to 0 88 the variations of j are obtained by changing the inlet velocity i e advance speed while rotational speed is kept constant it should be noted that simulations for each j are stopped after 2000 iterations applied boundary conditions for owt are as follows velocity inlet for inlet boundary pressure outlet for outlet boundary slip wall for lateral surface of a cylinder and no slip wall for propeller cap and shaft surfaces computational domain for owt is discretized using unstructured hexahedral mesh with five million cells as in resistance tests and spt wall functions are used and therefore y values are kept above 30 4 2 verification study numerical simulations are performed for four turbulence models described in section 2 1 firstly an extensive verification study is made for resistance test at t 9 9 m and v 16 32 kn for two input parameters grid size and time step according to the ittc procedure ittc 2017 this study for grid size is made with three meshes i e coarse 2 5 m cells medium 5 m cells and fine 10 m cells using the medium time step thus a uniform refinement ratio r i is equal to 2 3 verification study for time step is made with three time steps with r i 2 t 100 t 200 and t 400 using the medium mesh t is defined as the ratio between l p p and ship speed convergence ratio is defined as follows 54 r i ε i 21 ε i 32 where ε i 21 is the change between solution obtained using medium s ˆ i 2 and fine s ˆ i 1 input parameter and ε i 32 is the change between solution obtained using coarse s ˆ i 3 and medium input parameter r i is used for estimation of convergence conditions monotonic convergence is achieved when 0 r i 1 oscillatory convergence is achieved when 1 r i 0 and divergence is achieved when r i 1 numerical uncertainties and errors for monotonic convergence condition are estimated using generalized richardson extrapolation re the order of accuracy is defined as follows 55 p i ln ε i 32 ε i 21 ln r i re error is calculated using following equation 56 δ r e ε i 21 r p i 1 the generalized re solution s ˆ r e can then be calculated as the difference between s ˆ i 1 and δ r e factor of safety approach is used for estimating the uncertainty u i this approach defines u i as a product of safety factor f s 1 25 and δ r e the normalized uncertainties are calculated as follows 57 u u i s ˆ r e 100 4 3 validation study numerical simulations are validated with extrapolated towing tank results using extrapolation methods described in section 3 1 relative deviations between obtained numerical solutions φ c f d and extrapolated values φ e x are calculated as follows 58 r d φ c f d φ e x φ e x 100 5 results within this section the results of verification study are shown as well as the obtained results for break power propeller rotational speed and ship hydrodynamic coefficients for design and slow steaming speeds at three different draughts obtained numerical results are validated and relative deviations are calculated 5 1 verification verification study for grid size and time step is performed for resistance tests at design draught and design speed for all turbulence models described in section 2 1 furthermore verification study is performed for numerical simulations of spt at design draught and design speed with rke turbulence model but only for grid size the obtained results for verification study for resistance tests at design draught with time step as input parameter are shown in table 3 it should be noted that according to the ittc recommendations time step should be in range from 0 005 l v to 0 01 l v where l is the ship length and v is the ship speed the limits of this range correspond to the selected coarse 0 01 l v and medium 0 005 l v time step since resistance test which takes into account hull roughness represents a very complex problem demirel et al 2017 have used significantly lower time step than the recommended one i e 0 0005 l v therefore numerical simulation of resistance test with rke turbulence model is performed with time step proposed in demirel et al 2017 and the obtained value of total resistance is equal to 609 564 n this value is very close to s ˆ r e solution which is expected since proposed time step is ten times lower than the one proposed by ittc for each turbulence model the monotonic convergence is achieved the obtained normalized uncertainties are very low i e the highest u is obtained with rke turbulence model and it is equal to 0 167 the obtained values of total resistance with medium time step i e 0 005 l v for all turbulence models are already very close to s ˆ r e solutions the highest discrepancy between solution obtained with medium time step s ˆ i 2 and s ˆ r e solution can be observed for rke however it is low i e 0 326 to shorten the duration of numerical simulations and considering very low discrepancies between s ˆ i 2 and s ˆ r e medium time step is used in the remaining numerical simulations the verification study for resistance tests at design draught for grid size as input parameter is performed with three grid densities as mentioned in section 4 2 the obtained results of this study are shown in table 4 as can be seen from table 4 the monotonic convergence is achieved for all turbulence models except for ske where divergence is achieved normalized uncertainties are calculated for rke sstko and rsm and the highest u is obtained for rsm and it is equal to 0 033 the verification study of numerical spt with rke turbulence model is performed only for grid size with three grid densities coarse grid 1 9 m cells medium grid 4 1 m cells and fine grid 8 9 m cells thus r i is equal to 1 293 this study is performed for propeller rotational speed n and delivered power p d at self propulsion point and results are shown in table 5 as can be seen from table 5 monotonic convergence is achieved for both n and p d the obtained normalized uncertainty for n is low and equals 1 184 while for p d is higher and equals 6 806 considering low u and since discrepancies between s ˆ i 2 and s ˆ r e are relatively low medium grid can be considered as good compromise between computational time and accuracy for both resistance tests and spt therefore remaining numerical simulations are performed using the medium grid 5 2 resistance tests within this subsection the obtained results of resistance tests are presented and validated against the extrapolated values of towing tank tests in order to apply ittc 1978 ppm ittc 1978 ppm 1999 and ittc 1978 ppm 2017 form factor should be determined ittc have recommended the use of prohaska s method for determination of form factor value within this method ship model is towed at low fn where wave resistance is almost negligible and thus measured value of total resistance is actually viscous resistance in table 6 form factor values obtained using the prohaska s method for three different load conditions are shown as well as the form factor values obtained using the equation 52 it can be seen from table 6 that k values are very similar for both methods and that k value depends on the load condition thus the significant difference in k value is obtained for scantling and light ballast draughts this can be explained through a more considerable change of main particulars of a ship for ballast draught than for design or scantling draughts only resistance test for design draught and design speed is performed using four turbulence models described in section 2 1 while other resistance tests are performed using rke turbulence model numerical simulations of resistance tests are made for two ship speeds which are predicted by extrapolating the towing tank results with ittc 1957 ppm design speed v s which corresponds to 75 of maximum continuous rating mcr and slow steaming speed v s s corresponding to 50 of mcr in table 6 the obtained numerical results of resistance test for design draught at design speed are presented numerical results are validated against the extrapolated towing tank results using extrapolation methods described in section 3 1 it should be noted that results shown in table 7 are obtained utilizing medium grid as it can be seen from table 7 numerical results underpredict the extrapolated values of towing tank results the greatest rd are obtained for ittc 1957 ppm which decompose total resistance into frictional and residual resistance since residual resistance is also dependent on rn i e viscous pressure resistance r p v is dependent on the both rn and fn residual resistance should also be scaled as frictional resistance rather than assumed to be constant at model and full scale it should be noted that a part of this shortcoming of scaling procedure is taken into account with the incremental resistance coefficient since ittc has not prescribed how to determine c a this ppm is dependent on the selection of this coefficient and several towing tank institutes have different approaches for its determination ittc ppm 1978 and ittc ppm 1978 1999 use the same procedure for the determination of total resistance both methods scale r p v by introduction of form factor value and the roughness of ship hull is taken into account by introducing δ c f the main difference between ittc 1978 ppm and ittc 1978 ppm 2017 is separation of the correlation factor and roughness allowance in latter within ittc 1978 ppm 2017 both coefficients are given and thus this method is the most comprehensive one however it should be mentioned that results of the total resistance obtained using ittc 1978 ppm and ittc 1978 ppm 2017 are very similar with relative deviation lower than 0 2 for this load condition at design speed the result obtained with rsm turbulence model has the smallest relative deviation from the extrapolated values as said before within rsm rst is obtained from six additional equations rather than being modelled thus this model considers the anisotropy of rst and predicts the vortices better however the computational time of numerical simulation using rsm turbulence model is significantly larger in table 8 the numerical results obtained using rke turbulence model and medium grid are shown as it can be seen from table 8 numerically obtained results underpredict extrapolated values of towing tank measurements considering loading conditions and the ship speed the lowest rd are obtained for the design speed at scantling draught while the highest rd are obtained for the slow steaming speed at light ballast draught considering different ppm it should be noted that the highest rd are obtained with ittc 1957 ppm while the lowest rd are obtained with grigson extrapolation method which can be considered as the most accurate ppm currently watson 1998 extrapolation methods have several deficiencies first major deficiency is that form factor value is dependent on the scale i e rn as shown by pereira et al 2017 thus the scaling of the viscous resistance coefficient is not reliable the authors have used the results of numerical simulations and ittc 1957 model ship correlation line for the determination of form factor value however raven et al 2008 have shown that when grigson friction line is used the form factor value does not depend on the scale in the case of a containership and only slightly depends on scale for tanker thus an assumption of constant form factor for model scale and full scale is acceptable but only if grigson friction line is used therefore it can be concluded that the first deficiency is avoided when grigson ppm is used and hence the obtained rd are the lowest for this ppm another important deficiency are the scale effects on the wave coefficients and the wave pattern as claimed by raven et al 2008 the viscous effects on the stern wave making are present which is in direct correlation with the wave resistance since lower stern wave causes less radiated wave energy i e lower wave resistance therefore the stern wave system is reduced by the viscous effects and this reduction is higher at model scale since at model scale viscous effects are relatively higher than at full scale therefore wave coefficient should be higher for full scale rn than for model scale rn however it should be noted that the hull of full scale ship is not hydrodynamically smooth and hence the increase in the viscous effects caused by roughness of the ship hull leads to the decrease of the stern wave system and consequently wave coefficient as shown by demirel et al 2017 for that reason wave coefficient has both positive and negative scale effects i e it should be both increased and decreased at full scale due to lack of the total resistance data for full scale the assumption that wave coefficient is constant can be considered as reasonable especially for ships which sail at lower fn values where the portion of the wave resistance is relatively low compared to the other resistance components nevertheless additional research should be made regarding this problem in order to increase the accuracy of ppm 5 3 open water tests as said before owt are performed for full scale propeller and the obtained results are compared with extrapolated values of towing tank measurements numerical simulations of owt are performed utilizing all turbulence models described in section 2 1 and the obtained results for the thrust and torque coefficients as well as for the open water efficiency are presented for a range of advance coefficients around self propulsion point table 9 as it can be seen from table 9 the satisfactory agreement between numerical results and extrapolated values is achieved for all turbulence models furthermore it can be seen from table 9 that all numerical results are very similar regardless of turbulence model it should be noted that j spt i e advance coefficient at self propulsion point is closest to j 0 56 the lowest rd are obtained for η o and j 0 56 using all turbulence models i e r d are below 0 75 the obtained results for k t and k q have higher rd compared to the ones obtained for η o the highest rd obtained at j 0 56 for k t is equal to 5 82 and for k q is equal to 5 73 extrapolation method described in ittc 1978 ppm for owt results obtained in towing tank has several deficiencies first deficiency is that correlations described within equations 40 44 are based on statistics and the database for statistical analysis was relatively small helma 2016 this deficiency is more highlighted for unconventional propellers and since the propeller considered within this study is from the wageningen series it can be assumed that this deficiency does not affect the obtained results significantly another deficiency is that linear correlation between change in thrust coefficient δ k t torque coefficient δ k q and pitch to diameter ratio is assumed this assumption can lead to inaccurate results for the cambered propellers the last deficiency is that owt should be performed at higher rn values than prescribed by ittc helma 2016 since the obtained owt characteristics are not the same at lower and higher rn values it should be noted that within this paper experimental owt are performed at rn in the range from 3 10 5 to 3 9 10 5 which is above the lowest value prescribed by ittc i e 2 10 5 5 4 self propulsion test results numerical simulation of spt for the design draught at the design speed is performed using four turbulence models self propulsion point spp is obtained when r t t within spt in table 10 the obtained results regarding the propeller revolution rate and break power at spp as well as the validation of numerical results are shown it should be noted that mechanical losses are equal to 0 5 i e η m 0 995 validation is performed by comparison with the extrapolated values of towing tank results as it can be seen from table 10 the obtained results overestimate the extrapolated values for both n s p p and p b s p p the obtained rd for n s p p are lower than the ones for p b s p p the highest rd for n s p p is not greater than 6 3 regardless of chosen turbulence model and ppm rd obtained for p b s p p are generally below 10 it is important to notice that the highest rd for n s p p obtained utilizing different ppm is equal to 0 4 while for p b s p p it is equal to 1 5 since p b s p p depends on the prediction of both n s p p and q s p p i e torque at spp the higher rd for p b s p p is expected the best agreement with the extrapolated values is obtained using sstko turbulence model where rd obtained for both n s p p and p b s p p are below 5 the highest rd for both n s p p and p b s p p are obtained for ske turbulence model within table 11 hydrodynamic coefficients obtained with numerical simulations as well as using four ppm are shown furthermore rd between numerical and extrapolated results are also shown as it can be seen from table 11 all hydrodynamic coefficients obtained with numerical simulations have satisfactory agreement with the ones obtained using different ppm it can be seen that relatively high overestimation of 1 w is obtained however similar rd are obtained in the literature gaggero et al 2017 choi et al 2010 as well rd between numerically obtained hydrodynamic coefficients and the ones obtained using four ppm can be associated with various aspects for example insufficiently accurate prediction of the nominal wake as well as underestimation of the propeller performance in owt which can be directly correlated to the overestimated values of n s p p c f d furthermore modelling error should be also considered since in the body force method the effect of propeller is modelled rather than propeller itself there is a numerical error as well which could be decreased if a grid with higher number of cells is used however there are also aspects regarding ppm which cause the increase in rd for example ittc 1957 ppm does not scale w i e w obtained at model scale is the same as the one at the full scale which is proven to be inaccurate pereira et al 2017 in order to avoid introduced errors by ppm the obtained numerical results should be compared with the measured values at full scale still the data related to ship hydrodynamic coefficients measured at full scale is very rare and often confidential so many researches compare their numerical results with the extrapolated towing tank values the overall propulsive efficiency can be calculated as follows 59 η p 1 t 1 w η b where η b is the propeller efficiency behind the ship hull regarding η p it should be noted that the lowest rd between numerically obtained η p and the ones obtained using certain ppm is obtained with rsm turbulence model which is expected since this turbulence model is the most complex one however since numerical simulations with rsm turbulence model require larger computational time numerical simulations of spt for other load conditions and speeds are performed with rke turbulence model the obtained results regarding n s p p and p b s p p for different load conditions as well as for different speeds are shown in tables 12 and 13 respectively furthermore rd of the obtained numerical results and extrapolated towing tank results are also shown within tables 12 and 13 as it can be seen from tables 12 and 13 the obtained numerical results mostly overestimate the extrapolated results lower rd are obtained for n s p p and the highest rd does not exceed 6 75 regardless of ship speed and load condition rd for p b s p p are somewhat higher than rd for n s p p with the highest rd lower than 13 it should be noted that discrepancies between extrapolated results obtained with different ppm are relatively low for design and scantling draughts i e below 1 5 however these rd are higher for light ballast conditions where for the design speed the highest rd between the results obtained with different ppm is equal to 4 87 and for slow steaming speed it is equal to 3 76 these high deviations are caused by lower break power which is predicted by ittc 1957 ppm in ittc 1957 ppm c a as a function of rn is based on the statistics and taken as prescribed by brodarski institute due to significantly lower number of power predictions for ballast draughts the uncertainty is higher for the determination of c a for ballast condition this is the important benefit of using cfd for power prediction at spp since it is not necessary to know the value of c a which is the coefficient that takes into account a scale effects within all ppm described in this study scale effects are considered either through c a or δ c f the improvement in the assessment of these two coefficients can be done utilizing cfd methods based on viscous flow and this can have significant application especially for ballast conditions where scale effects are less investigated in tables 14 17 the obtained hydrodynamic coefficients in spt for different load conditions as well as for different speeds are shown the lowest rd between numerical and extrapolated results for the overall propulsive efficiency are obtained for ittc 1978 ppm regardless of load condition and ship speed while the highest rd are obtained for ittc 1957 ppm as expected since within this ppm w is not scaled considering the hydrodynamic coefficients the highest rd are obtained for w which was also obtained in the gaggero et al 2017 choi et al 2010 as explained before those rd can be explained through several aspects it can be concluded that smaller rd would be obtained if the ship propeller is discretized i e if rigid body simulation is performed for example in sezen et al 2018 the authors compared results obtained with body force method and rigid body simulation body force method predicted lower propulsive efficiency and consequently higher delivered power than rigid body simulation the main reason for that was the underestimated hull efficiency with body force method which can be explained with the inability of the method to predict accurately the interaction between ship hull and propeller it should be noted that required computational time for body force method is significantly lower than required computational time for rigid body simulation where required time step is significantly lower and more cells are needed for a proper discretization of the propeller therefore since the most important parameters for engine selection are n s p p and p b s p p it can be concluded that cfd based on viscous flow and body force method can be used for power prediction and assessment of spp even with relatively coarse grid i e 4 1 m cells for spt therefore cfd can be considered as very important tool especially at preliminary design stage 5 5 the flow around ship hull within this subsection the flow around the ship hull obtained with numerical simulations is presented the accurate prediction of nominal wake is extremely important since it directly influences the propeller performance in spt at model scale due to lower rn the boundary layer is relatively thicker than at full scale also the strength of bilge vortex is reduced at full scale but the wake gradient is higher than at model scale recently numerical simulations of viscous flow at full scale have been imposed as the only relevant tool for the determination of the nominal wake at full scale ittc 2011 regarding the numerical simulations the nominal wake distribution is significantly influenced by turbulence model and therefore beside the standard mesh and time step sensitivity analysis it is very important to investigate the influence of turbulence model on the obtained results as well nominal wake distributions obtained by numerical simulations utilizing fine grid with different turbulence models for design draught at design speed are shown in fig 9 the obtained nominal wake distribution is characterized by significant velocity reduction due to ship boundary layer at 0 which is accurately predicted with all turbulence models the obtained vortex around the location of the hub is significantly narrower for rke and ske turbulence models than for sstko and rsm the largest vortex is obtained with rsm turbulence model which is proven to be the most accurate turbulence model for the nominal wake prediction gaggero et al 2017 pereira et al 2017 the transversal velocity distribution obtained utilizing fine grid with different turbulence models is shown in fig 10 it can be seen from fig 10 that the obtained hub vortex is the largest for rsm turbulence model in fig 11 the obtained nominal wakes and transversal velocities for design and light ballast draughts at design speed using rke turbulence model and medium grid are shown the obtained hub vortex is larger for light ballast draught than for design draught fig 11 in fig 12 the obtained longitudinal wave cuts along the centreline of ship utilizing different turbulence models are shown the stern wave begins at the transom while bow wave starts at fore perpendicular as it can be seen from fig 12 the similar longitudinal wave cut along the centreline of the ship is obtained for all turbulence models especially in bow region in fig 13 the obtained longitudinal wave cuts along the centreline of the ship in resistance tests and spt utilizing rke turbulence model are shown the wave cuts are shown for design scantling and light ballast draughts at the design speed within fig 13 the influence of the propeller on the stern wave can be seen thus the propeller causes the increase of the stern wave amplitude as well as the increase of the stern wave length the influence of the propeller on the stern wave is larger for design than for scantling draught this is expected since the propeller is more submerged for scantling draught even though stern wave is obviously larger in spt in order to improve convergence ratio it is often assumed that propeller does not cause the increase in the wave resistance and thus spt is carried out with double body assumption gaggero et al 2017 choi et al 2010 this assumption can be taken as valid especially for ships which sail at lower fn where the wave resistance represents only small portion of the total resistance as it can be seen from fig 14 the highest difference between height of bow wave obtained at design and slow steaming speed is obtained for scantling draught even though at scantling draught there is the smallest difference between design and slow steaming speed the highest bow wave is obtained for design draught at the design speed while the deepest wave trough is obtained for scantling draught at the design speed in fig 15 the obtained pressure distributions utilizing rsm turbulence model for design draught at the design speed in resistance test and spt are shown while in fig 16 the obtained pressure distributions utilizing rke turbulence model for light ballast draught at the design speed in resistance test and spt are shown it should be noted that rudder is left out within figs 15 and 16 as it can be seen from figs 15 and 16 the propeller influence on the pressure distribution is limited only in the region near the ship stern i e behind the stern shoulder this is in accordance with huang and groves 1981 where the authors showed that propeller has influence on the velocity and pressure distribution only in the region extending two propeller diameters upstream in fig 17 the obtained pressure distribution around ship stern for design draught at the design speed rsm and for light ballast draught at the design speed rke is shown in fig 17 the hydrodynamic pressure at the rudder can be seen the pressure gradient is higher for light ballast than for design draught therefore the rudder at the light ballast draught is more loaded 6 conclusion a comprehensive numerical and experimental study was performed in order to predict the self propulsion point and required brake power in full scale for three different load conditions typical for bulk carriers at two fn the towing tank measurements which included resistance open water and self propulsion tests were performed at brodarski institute for ship model the obtained experimental results were then extrapolated to full scale values utilizing five extrapolation methods for the determination of total resistance at full scale and four extrapolation methods for the determination of self propulsion point and required brake power at full scale numerical simulations of viscous flow around full scale ship were performed utilizing the commercial software package star ccm the roughness effects are considered through modification in the wall function solver proposed by demirel et al 2017 verification study for two input parameters time step and grid size was performed based on the procedure proposed by ittc this study was made utilizing four turbulence models for resistance tests for design draught at the design speed furthermore a verification study was made for spt but only for design draught at the design speed utilizing rke turbulence model based on these studies the time step and grid that proved to be a good compromise between the accuracy and required computational effort are chosen the differences between results obtained with different turbulence models are investigated within three different tests resistance open water and self propulsion the advantages and disadvantages of four turbulence models commonly used in the practice are highlighted for all performed tests rsm was proven to be the most accurate one thus utilizing rsm turbulence model the obtained full scale resistance value has rd from the extrapolated value using grigson extrapolation procedure equal to 4 furthermore the obtained hydrodynamic coefficients in the self propulsion condition utilizing rsm turbulence model have the smallest rd from the extrapolated values however since this model solves additional six equations for reynolds stresses rather than modelling this tensor rsm turbulence model requires significantly larger computational time the differences in the obtained nominal wakes with different turbulence models are highlighted the significant velocity reduction at 0 above the hub is accurately predicted with all turbulence models on the other hand rsm turbulence model predicted the larger hub vortex around the hub than the other turbulence models the predicted hub vortex is larger in the light ballast than in the design load condition and this should be taken into account in the propeller design even though significant differences are obtained in nominal wake prediction with different turbulence models there is no significant difference in prediction of the longitudinal wave cuts at the centreline of the hull the influence of the propeller on the stern wave was shown in terms of the increase of the stern wave height and the increase of the stern wave length the influence of the propeller on the pressure distribution was proven to be limited in the region behind the stern shoulder the higher pressure gradient at the rudder was obtained for light ballast than for design draught which causes the higher load on the rudder in the light ballast condition and this should be considered in the rudder design the obtained results for different load conditions for both resistance and self propulsion tests pointed out the importance of using cfd methods in the investigation of the scale effects as well as in the investigation of more comprehensive extrapolation methods thus cfd based on viscous flow can be used for better understanding of the scale effects and for reducing or possibly eliminating the correlation allowance the obtained numerical results utilizing the relatively simple rke turbulence model and relatively coarse mesh i e 4 1 m cells in the spt have shown the satisfactory agreement with the extrapolated values of the towing tank experiments thus it can be concluded that cfd is useful tool for prediction of the required brake power and the propeller rotational speed at the self propulsion point for different load conditions and speeds especially at the preliminary design stage rd between numerically obtained values of the ship hydrodynamic coefficients n s p p c f d and p b s p p c f d and the ones obtained utilizing ppm can be explained through several aspects thus the insufficiently accurate prediction of the nominal wake as well as underestimation of the propeller performance in the open water test can be directly associated with the obtained overestimation of n s p p c f d also there is modelling error since the effect of propeller in spt is modelled utilizing body force method this method has inability to predict accurately the interaction between ship hull and propeller since propeller was not modelled in spt sezen et al 2018 thus the obtained hull efficiency was underestimated and consequently higher p b s p p c f d was predicted furthermore there is numerical error which could be decreased if the grid with higher number of cells was used there are also several aspects regarding ppm and towing tank experiments which caused the increase in rd aspects regarding the towing tank experiments are mostly related to the measurement uncertainties aspects regarding ppm are related to the several scale effects which are not considered within ppm for example scale effects for the form factor and wave coefficient also there are aspects regarding the extrapolation of the open water performance and the influence of the hull roughness which are based on the statistical data all these aspects are considered through correlation allowance which is defined through simple equation based on the statistical data and this is the reason for increased uncertainty of ppm in order to avoid experimental uncertainties and uncertainties related to ppm the obtained numerical results should be compared to the measured values at full scale unfortunately there is only small amount of data related to the ship hydrodynamic coefficients n s p p c f d and p b s p p c f d measured at full scale and it is often confidential in order to reduce the uncertainties regarding the use of ppm the further investigation of scale effects on the value of form factor and wave coefficient as well as an analysis of the correlation allowance will form part of a future work acknowledgement the authors would like to thank the faculty of mechanical engineering and naval architecture university of zagreb for funding the licence of the software
