17070,groundwater is a major drinking water resource but its quality with regard to organic micropollutants mps is insufficiently assessed therefore we aimed to investigate swiss groundwater more comprehensively using liquid chromatography high resolution tandem mass spectrometry lc hrms ms first samples from 60 sites were classified as having high or low urban or agricultural influence based on 498 target compounds associated with either urban or agricultural sources second all lc hrms signals were related to their potential origin urban urban and agricultural agricultural or not classifiable based on their occurrence and intensity in the classified samples a considerable fraction of estimated concentrations associated with urban and or agricultural sources could not be explained by the 139 detected targets the most intense nontarget signals were automatically annotated with structure proposals using metfrag and sirius4 csi fingerid with a list of 988 000 compounds additionally suspect screening was performed for 1162 compounds with predicted high groundwater mobility from primarily urban sources finally 12 nontargets and 11 suspects were identified unequivocally level 1 while 17 further compounds were tentatively identified level 2a 3 amongst these were 13 pollutants thus far not reported in groundwater such as the industrial chemicals 2 5 dichlorobenzenesulfonic acid 19 detections up to 100 ng l 1 phenylphosponic acid 10 detections up to 50 ng l 1 triisopropanolamine borate 2 detections up to 40 ng l 1 o des 2 aminoethyl o carboxymethyl dehydroamlodipine a transformation product tp of the blood pressure regulator amlodipine 17 detections and the tp syn542490 of the herbicide metolachlor level 3 33 detections estimated concentrations up to 100 500 ng l 1 one monitoring site was far more contaminated than other sites based on estimated total concentrations of potential mps which was supported by the elucidation of site specific nontarget signals such as the carcinogen chlorendic acid and various naphthalenedisulfonic acids many compounds remained unknown but overall source related prioritisation proved an effective approach to support identification of compounds in groundwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords target screening nontarget screening micropollutant persistent and mobile compounds pmoc acquirex 1 introduction groundwater is a major drinking water resource and therefore its quality is of high interest various micropollutants mps from agriculture households or industry entering aquifers via different pathways affect groundwater quality loos et al 2010 whereas pesticides are applied in high amounts to agricultural soils pimentel 2009 and then enter aquifers mainly via seepage pharmaceuticals household and industrial chemicals may contaminate aquifers predominantly via leaky sewers wolf et al 2012 or via bank filtration from wastewater impacted surface waters heberer et al 2004 consequently the land use in the catchment and or hydrogeological setting e g bank filtration characteristics of top layers influence the mp pattern at the groundwater monitoring site stuart et al 2014 ter laak et al 2012 given that i 350 000 chemicals and mixtures thereof are registered in national and regional inventories wang et al 2020 ii compounds undergo transformations in the environment and engineered systems kolpin et al 2009 and iii new mps are regularly reported to be in the water cycle e g weber et al 2007 schmidt and brauch 2008 reemtsma et al 2013 schlüsener et al 2015 zahn et al 2016 gago ferrero et al 2018 schulze et al 2019 or zahn et al 2019 it seems insufficient to evaluate water quality only on the basis of selected analytes liquid chromatography high resolution tandem mass spectrometry lc hrms ms enables the detection of possibly thousands of small molecules in a water sample both from natural and anthropogenic sources some of these compounds can be elucidated by broad scope target screening where reference standards are available in the laboratory while others are detected as part of suspect screening i e searching for specific structures without having reference material at hand krauss et al 2010 however usually most lc hrms ms signals remain unknown so called nontargets and should therefore be further investigated spectral libraries such as the european massbank horai et al 2010 massbank of north america mona http mona fiehnlab ucdavis edu and mzcloud www mzcloud org allow structural annotation of nontarget signals with high confidence level schymanski et al 2014b though their use is limited to compounds for which ms ms spectra were made accessible by other laboratories for compounds not present in spectral libraries in silico fragmentation tools e g metfrag ruttkies et al 2016 sirius4 csi fingerid dührkop et al 2015 dührkop et al 2019 and cfm id allen et al 2014 in combination with large chemical compound databases such as pubchem kim et al 2019 comptox chemistry dashboard williams et al 2017 or the norman suspect list exchange www norman network com nds sle are promising alternatives for structural annotation these tools enable the high throughput annotation of thousands of nontargets however with often hundreds or even thousands of candidates thus the final identification with reference material remains a major bottleneck so that so far only few nontargets have been elucidated with high confidence in water samples albergamo et al 2019 gago ferrero et al 2015 schymanski et al 2014a tian et al 2020 as a consequence nontargets of interest need to be prioritized before investing time and resources into structure elucidation or even purchasing reference material using one or a combination of several approaches depending on the study context most studies apply filters for analytical quality control e g excluding compounds detected in procedural blanks and including only compounds with high reproducibility in replicate and pooled samples broadhurst et al 2018 sangster et al 2006 the use of pooled samples i e samples comprising aliquots of all samples is more common in metabolomics than in environmental studies intensity is a crucial parameter in most studies hug et al 2014 schymanski et al 2014a as intense signals may provide higher quality ms ms data supporting elucidation additionally intensity correlates to some extent with concentration though it is important to highlight that high intensity or concentration does not necessarily mean high toxicological risk furthermore cl and br isotope patterns may point to compounds from anthropogenic origins chiaia hernandez et al 2014 hug et al 2014 and homologues to larger groups of related compounds such as surfactants schymanski et al 2014a comparing related samples such as raw water and final drinking water müller et al 2011 or road dust and surface water seiwert et al 2020 facilitate prioritization of persistent signals originating from a specific source in this regard multivariate statistical tools such as principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering can be applied for example to samples collected along a wastewater treatment plant schollée et al 2015 schollée et al 2018 or a riverbank transect albergamo et al 2019 to determine nontargets with specific trends the goal of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the quality of water derived from 60 groundwater monitoring sites in switzerland to do so all detected lc hrms signals were to be related to their potential sources urban agricultural followed by structural elucidation of the most prominent ones focusing in particular on potential mps from urban sources our hypothesis was that by combining an appropriate nontarget prioritization strategy with a highly automated structure elucidation workflow we would find previously unreported compounds in groundwater first we performed an extensive target screening for 498 mps to classify the samples according to their dominating urban and agricultural pollutants next all lc hrms signals were classified based on their pre dominating occurrence in urban or agricultural sources which was assessed by comparing samples with high vs low urban or high vs low agricultural influence structure elucidation focused on nontargets from potentially urban sources because we investigated already in detail major agricultural mps i e pesticides and their transformation products tps in a similar sample set kiefer et al 2019 accordingly most intense nontargets from potentially urban sources and in addition widespread nontargets were annotated with candidate proposals using metfrag and sirius4 csi fingerid and finally elucidated with reference standards if commercially available to not overlook important urban mps with lower signal intensity we applied additionally a suspect screening for 1162 polar and therefore mobile compounds from mainly urban sources 2 methods 2 1 groundwater samples the applied nontarget screening approach aimed to classify nontargets with regards to their origin urban agricultural based on their occurrence at monitoring sites that are i urban impacted ii agriculturally impacted or iii show only low anthropogenic impact therefore 60 monitoring sites 44 abstraction wells 16 springs were selected out of 500 sites from the swiss national groundwater monitoring naqua www bafu admin ch naqua based on long term monitoring data collected within naqua twenty sites contained mps from pre dominantly urban sources pharmaceuticals sweeteners while 20 other sites showed high frequency or concentrations of mps from agricultural sources pesticides and their tps a further 20 sites exhibited comparably low anthropogenic contamination several sites were not clearly classifiable as urban or agriculturally impacted due to the occurrence of pollutants from both source types the 60 groundwater samples were collected in laboratory glass bottles previously annealed at 500 c 1 l bottles simax kavalier czech republic in may and august 2018 within the routine sampling of naqua samples were stored cooled for up to four weeks and then frozen at 20 c until measurement for quality control pooled samples were prepared i e samples consisting of an equal amount of each sample for this aliquots 5 or 10 ml of each groundwater sample were transferred to laboratory glass bottles 0 5 l or 1 l using a 5 ml brown glass vial before samples were frozen to determine contaminations from sampling sample storage or handling ultrapure water 18 mωcm barnstead nanopure diamond system was filled into laboratory glass bottles transferred during sampling into another bottle at five monitoring sites and then stored and processed analogously to the groundwater samples as blank samples 2 2 sample preparation via vacuum assisted evaporation to avoid losses of polar compounds during sample enrichment samples were concentrated via vacuum assisted evaporation analogously to mechelke et al 2019 though with slight modifications samples were transferred to büchi glass vials 1 ml appendix previously annealed at 450 c at a volume of 120 ml and spiked with 35 isotope labelled internal standards at 100 ng l 1 samples were evaporated on a syncore analyst büchi switzerland for 7 8 h to approximately 1 ml at 20 mbar and 45 c appendix cooled at 7 10 c using the back flush unit the concentrate volume was adjusted to 1 6 ml by adding ultrapure water using annealed glass pasteur pipettes 747715 brand gmbh germany the büchi vials were rinsed thoroughly with the concentrate to reduce analyte losses due to sorption finally the concentrate was centrifuged at 3720 g heraeus megafuge 1 0 r thermo fisher scientific u s in annealed vials and transferred to 1 5 ml vials previously annealed at 500 c vials 080400 xl screw caps 090301 bgb analytik switzerland analogously to the samples four calibration standards 1 10 100 1000 ng l 1 in ultrapure water four spiked samples 1 10 100 250 ng l 1 six pooled samples i e replicates and seven field and laboratory blank samples ultrapure water spiked with internal standards were prepared for quality control and target quantification for details on spike solutions see si a1 2 3 lc hrms ms analysis samples were measured in triplicate in a randomized order after nine sample injections three triplicates a blank was injected followed by a pooled sample for quality control the concentrated samples 140 µl i e 10 5 ml of the original sample were injected to a lc system consisting of a pal rtc autosampler ctc analytics switzerland a reversed phase c18 column atlantis t3 3 µm 3 150 mm waters ireland and a dionex ultimate 3000 rs pump thermo fisher scientific rs the gradient elution started with 100 water containing 0 1 formic acid to achieve an optimal retention of polar compounds then methanol containing 0 1 formic acid was added and increased to 95 from 1 5 to 18 5 min and finally kept constant for 10 min the flow rate was 0 3 ml min 1 for details see table si a1 analytes were ionized in electrospray 3 5 2 5 kv and detected on an orbitrap mass spectrometer fusion lumos thermo fisher scientific u s with a resolution r of 240 000 at m z 200 full width at half maximum fwhm in ms1 full scan mode m z 100 1000 followed by three to four data dependant ms ms full scans high resolution product scans r 30 000 fwhm at m z 200 cycle time 1 s isolation window of precursor 1 m z internal calibration easy ic ensured a mass accuracy of 2 ppm in ms1 scans for 99 8 of detected target compound peaks and internal standard peaks 1 ppm for 98 4 of peaks acquirex software deep scan thermo fisher scientific u s was used to increase ms ms coverage in the first triplicate injection data dependant ms ms full scans were triggered based on a mass list containing target compounds then acquirex performed peak picking and added detected features m z and retention time to the mass list so that in the second triplicate injection data dependant ms ms full scans were triggered based on the mass list modified by acquirex before the third injection acquirex shifted features for which ms ms scans were already acquired during the second injection from the mass to the exclusion list so that these features were not triggered again if no features from the mass list were detected the ms ms scans for the most intense signals were acquired triggered features were excluded dynamically for 3 s for details see si a2 2 4 target screening for each target compound extracted ion chromatograms were plotted with the msnbase r package gatto and lilley 2012 and visually inspected if the target compound was detected in groundwater samples the concentration was determined using trace finder 4 1 thermo fisher scientific u s based on the peak area ratio of the target compound to that of corresponding internal standard if no structurally identical isotope labelled internal standard was available an internal standard was selected with similar retention time as the analyte and resulting in a relative recovery close to 100 in the spiked samples using an in house r script schollée 2018 for details on target quantification including determination of limit of quantification loq see si a3 2 5 suspect and nontarget screening measurement files were converted to mzxml format using msconvert 3 0 proteowizard chambers et al 2012 and then processed in the envimass workflow envibee gmbh switzerland data post processing was conducted in the r environment version 3 6 3 r core team 2020 2 5 1 data pre processing data pre processing was performed using the envimass workflow version 4 2633 including peak picking mass recalibration retention time alignment intensity normalization based on median intensity of internal standards replicate filtering and target and suspect annotation features i e chromatographic peaks defined by their m z and retention time that likely resulted from the same compound adducts isotopologues were grouped into so called components based on intensity correlation and m z distance the most intense feature within a component was used for further data analysis settings e g m z and retention time tolerances were optimized until 87 of target peaks detected with trace finder 4 1 section 2 4 were found 62 of target peaks that were not detected were 10 ng l 1 or exceeded the loq section 2 4 by less than factor 5 other non detects were mostly related to large retention time shifts i e exceeding the retention time tolerance for targets or poor peak shape for final settings see si a4 finally a table containing the peak height intensity pattern of each component across the samples so called profiles was exported profiles were prioritized for further inspection by excluding those with a retention time 3 min average sample blank intensity ratio 5 and maximum peak intensity 106 for comparison a peak height intensity of 106 corresponded to a concentration of 10 ng l 1 for approximately 90 of targets ionizing in positive ionization mode and 35 of targets ionizing in negative ionization mode it should be noted that for some compounds several components might exist e g positive and negative ionization in source fragments moreover for some target compounds two or three profiles were observed often related to shifting retention times or peak picking artefacts therefore profiles differing in m z by 2 ppm and retention time 30 s were grouped using an in house r function schollée et al in preparation peak intensities were averaged across replicates 2 5 2 prioritization of profiles using sample classification to classify nontarget compounds according to their potential origin urban agricultural groundwater samples were first classified based on the sum concentration of 269 targets from predominantly urban origin pharmaceuticals and their tps sweeteners industrial chemicals biocides illicit drugs personal care products and others si b1 and 229 targets from predominantly agricultural origin pesticides and their tps si b1 samples were defined as having high urban influence if the sum concentration of urban targets was 100 ng l 1 otherwise they were defined as samples with low urban influence likewise samples for which the sum concentration of agricultural targets exceeded 100 ng l 1 were defined as having high agricultural influence and otherwise as having low agricultural influence the cut off of 100 ng l 1 was guided by the european union s drinking water standard for single pesticides and relevant pesticide tps european commission 1998 the sum concentration instead of concentrations of single compounds was used so that the classification depended not only on single targets with high concentrations next the ratio of a compound s average intensity in samples with high urban agricultural influence to that of its average intensity in samples with low urban agricultural influence was calculated as a measure for the likelihood that the compound originated from urban sources or agricultural sources respectively 1 measure for urban origin average intensity in samples with high urban influence average intensity in samples with low urban influence 2 measure for agricultural origin average intensity in samples with high agricultural influence average intensity in samples with low agricultural influence if the compound was not detected in one of the sample groups it was assumed that the compound was detected in one sample with the minimum intensity observed in the whole dataset to avoid dividing by 0 profiles were classified as follows potential urban mp measure for urban origin 5 and measure for agricultural origin 5 potential agricultural mp measure for urban origin 5 and measure for agricultural origin 5 potential urban and agricultural mp measure for urban origin 5 and measure for agricultural origin 5 not classifiable remaining profiles here the decision to use a factor of five as threshold was guided by profiles annotated as target compounds i e 80 of profiles of urban targets and 90 of profiles of agricultural targets respectively showed on average more than five times higher intensities in samples with high urban agricultural influence vs samples with low urban agricultural influence however it should be pointed out that some target compounds which would be classified as potential urban and agricultural mp likely originate only from urban sources e g x ray contrast agent diatrizoic acid to gather more information on potential sources the most intense profiles in each group urban urban agricultural agricultural profiles with maximum intensity 5 106 not classifiable profiles with maximum intensity 107 and 30 detections were retrospectively screened for in the effluent of two swiss municipal wastewater treatment plants 24 h composite samples dry weather conditions for this extracted ion chromatograms eics were generated for blank and effluent samples measured with a comparable method without enrichment using the r package msnbase gatto and lilley 2012 the eics were then checked for peaks with intensity 105 and deviating 1 min from the average retention time of the corresponding profiles si c2 total concentrations in each sample were estimated assuming that the compounds ionize either less efficiently than as efficiently as or more efficiently than the 113 targets compounds 92 in positive ionization mode 21 in negative ionization mode spiked in to groundwater samples 1 10 100 250 ng l 1 here less efficiently than as efficiently as and more efficiently than correspond to the 25th 50th and 75th percentile of target compound peak intensities for details see si a5 2 5 3 elucidation of suspects and nontargets nontargets structural elucidation of nontargets focused on profiles that were classified as potentially of urban or urban and agricultural origin and that had maximum intensity 5 106 and on all profiles that had maximum intensity 107 and 30 detections for each profile ms1 and ms ms data were extracted from the sample with highest precursor intensity using the rmassbank package stravs et al 2013 structural proposals were then assigned using both metfrag cl 2 4 5 using functions from the r package resolution schymanski 2020 and sirius4 csi fingerid both in silico fragmenters were used with a list of 988 000 compounds of potential environmental relevance including those in comptox schymanski 2019 pubchemlite tier1 bolton and schymanski 2020 norman

al 2020b as well as 71 additional potentially mobile pesticide transformation products t poiger personal communication for details see si a6 nontargets were prioritized for confirmation based on multiple lines of evidence as in the following i a positive hit in the ms ms libraries nist17 national institute of standards and technology u s department of commerce mona lc ms ms spectra obtained

reference material suspects the suspect list comprised 1162 ms ready structures all with heteroatoms and exact masses 100 and was compiled from schulze et al 2019 kemi market list fischer 2017 ubapmt arp and hale 2020 and extended pmt h p arp and s e hale personal communication the extended pmt dataset was filtered for compounds classified as very mobile vm and highly expected in the environment h p arp personal communication e g due to high production volumes the kemi market list containing 25 000 chemicals that are expected on the eu market e g industrial chemicals pharmaceuticals pesticides was restricted to compounds that are more likely to occur in groundwater therefore only compounds were selected that exhibited a high water exposure index 15 water exposure index ranges from 1 to 27 and were classified as potentially mobile or very mobile pot m vm m vm or vm based on speciation and logdow predicted by jchem for office version 19 22 0 548 chemaxon ltd as described by arp and hale 2019 profiles annotated with the suspect list by envimass section 2 5 1 were prioritized in a similar workflow as nontarget profiles metfrag and sirius4 csi fingerid were run using both the suspect list and pubchemlite tier1 bolton and schymanski 2020 as databases to check how well the measured ms ms spectrum fits to the suspect compared to other candidates si a6 only suspects ranked amongst the top 3 candidates of sirius4 csi fingerid were checked manually as described for nontargets prioritized suspects and nontargets were classified in accordance with schymanski et al 2014b i as confirmed structures where reference material was available for identity confirmation level 1 ii as probable structures where an ms ms library match was achieved level 2a or iii as tentative structures where tentative identifications were based solely on ms ms interpretation level 3 the annotation of ms ms fragments with structural proposals for tentatively identified compounds was supported by cfm id 3 0 level 1 candidates were identified and quantified as follows ten selected samples were enriched and measured together with four calibration standards 1 10 100 1000 ng l 1 and six spiked samples 100 250 1000 ng l 1 with adjusted ms ms settings the determined calibration model was applied to the previously measured samples for quantification the quality of quantification was evaluated for each compound based on relative recoveries in spiked samples and the reproducibility of concentrations in the samples which were each measured twice not every compound could be quantified satisfactorily so that in some cases either concentration ranges or no concentrations are reported further details regarding structural confirmation quantification and associated ms ms spectra can be found in si a7 si a12 and si b4 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 sample classification based on targets the extent of urban and or agricultural influence on the 60 groundwater monitoring sites was evaluated based on the sum concentration of 269 urban and 229 agricultural target compounds for concentrations of individual targets see si b1 and for targets with detections 100 ng l 1 see table si a7 accordingly 17 sites showed only low urban and agricultural influence 18 sites were predominantly influenced by agricultural targets 22 sites were influenced by agricultural and urban targets and three sites were predominantly impacted by urban targets fig 1 these classifications which were based on the here presented target screening were consistent with classifications based on long term monitoring data for 53 out of 60 monitoring sites for details see si a8 for most monitoring sites the classification was also consistent with the land use of the catchment i e sites with high urban influence were often close to settlements or to wastewater impacted surface waters bank filtration sites with high agricultural influence were usually in areas with intensive agricultural land use and the catchments of sites with low urban and agricultural influence were usually dominated by grassland or forest urban classification was primarily associated with the sweetener acesulfame the biocide tp n n dimethylsulfamide may also originate from the banned plant protection product tolylfluanid the industrial chemical melamine and the corrosion inhibitor benzotriazole i e if one of these targets is removed from the dataset then two to five sites are no longer classified as having high urban influence or high urban and agricultural influence fig 1 analogously the agricultural classification was most driven by a tp of the fungicide chlorothalonil r471811 which was the only target compound detected in each sample maximum concentration 2200 ng l 1 kiefer et al 2020a for further details see figure si a2 if samples were classified based on detection frequency of urban or agricultural targets using a cut off of e g 10 detections then 44 sites would be classified in the same way figure si a3 here it should be noted that some pesticides may also be used as biocides e g n n dimethylsulfamide tp triazine herbicides and some pharmaceuticals are also used as veterinary drugs therefore these targets may be related to urban and agricultural activities potentially resulting in a wrong classification of some sites 3 2 classification of nontargets in the 60 groundwater samples 6504 intensity profiles across samples hereafter compounds were detected with maximum intensity 106 table 1 including 4800 nontargets and 98 targets in positive ionization mode and 1573 nontargets and 33 targets in negative ionization mode the total number of compounds was likely slightly lower due to ambiguities that arise during componentisation of isotopologues and adducts e g ten target compounds were associated with several profiles furthermore some compounds might be detected in both ionization modes such as 15 target compounds of the 6373 nontargets 4027 63 were found in less than five out of six pooled sample replicates or the intensity showed a relative standard deviation of 50 in pooled samples with detections see table 1 indicating that either the concentration was too low to be reproducibly detected potentially due to dilution during mixing of sample aliquots or that the peak shape was not reproducible moreover for 296 compounds the maximum intensity in the pooled samples was even higher than the maximum intensity in the groundwater samples this may be related to contamination during sample handling or peak picking artefacts e g noise from the 6373 nontargets 331 5 were classified as potential urban mps 945 15 as potential agricultural mps and 1892 30 as potential mps from urban and agricultural sources the remaining 3205 50 could not be assigned to one of these groups not classifiable and might be compounds of natural origins table 1 fig 2 more than 90 of profiles annotated as target compound were classified correctly which was expected because classification criteria 5 times higher intensity in contaminated samples were guided by the target compounds the not classifiable target compounds centre of fig 2 were unclassified due to one or more of the following reasons i a compound was incorrectly annotated different compound with similar retention time ii a compound had a noisy eic resulting in too many detections by envimass iii a compound originates from multiple sources the sweetener saccharin may originate from wastewater or from pig manure buerge et al 2011 and can therefore occur at less contaminated sites iv a compound was detected in only one sample with low urban and agricultural influence site specific v a compound had shifting retention time and was therefore not correctly grouped vi compounds that have probably been spread ubiquitously such as banned triazine pesticides and their tps and vii a compound eluted very early and was therefore affected by ion suppression this early eluting compound was melamine an industrial chemical and tp of the larvicide cyromazine which is often applied to manure echa 2015 based on concentrations determined with a structurally identical internal standard melamine would be correctly classified as an mp from urban and agricultural sources this compound was however hardly retained by the applied chromatographic method retention time 3 4 min eluting together with salts and other highly polar compounds leading to strong ion suppression effects and in turn low intensity which is used for automatic classification which hampered proper classification in total 20 of all detected compounds eluted between 3 and 4 min half of these compounds are located in the centre of fig 2 indicating either their ubiquitous occurrence or their possible misclassification as in the case of melamine in addition many compounds with broad late eluting peaks positive mass defect values and higher m z were located in the centre of fig 2 many were assigned as potential natural organic matter and occurred either at each site or were randomly distributed see si a9 for details table 1 further characterization and elucidation focused on the more intense compounds classified as potential mps from urban or urban and agricultural sources maximum intensity 5 106 and the most prominent compounds from the remaining dataset 107 30 detections from the resulting 488 compounds in the positive and negative mode si b2 480 compounds had at least one ms ms spectrum demonstrating the effectiveness of acquirex section 2 3 acquirex increased the ms ms coverage for the 488 nontargets by 39 for suspects an increase of 73 was observed detailed discussion in si a10 overall 409 compounds were annotated with between 1 and 576 candidate proposals using metfrag and or sirius4 csi fingerid most compounds without candidate proposals 80 eluted before 4 min and therefore might be artefacts from the lc hrms ms analysis to get further evidence for an anthropogenic origin 562 compounds were checked for characteristic isotope patterns such as cl si c1 and for their occurrence in effluent samples of two municipal wastewater treatment plants si c2 including 74 agricultural compounds with maximum intensity 5 106 which were not part of the 488 compounds at least 39 of the 488 compounds contained one or more cl atoms see si b2 and discussion in si a9 based on their isotope pattern in terms of occurrence 38 of the 56 urban compounds were detected in at least one of the two effluent samples only 12 of the 323 urban agricultural compounds and 12 of the 86 agricultural compounds showed a peak in the effluent samples interestingly also a high percentage of the 97 not classifiable compounds 39 were found in the wastewater effluents si b2 however the majority of these not classifiable compounds 70 eluted between 3 and 4 min i e they were possibly misclassified or occur naturally e g salts 3 3 characterization of groundwater quality at monitoring sites fig 3 illustrates the total estimated concentrations of detected compounds at the 60 monitoring sites after excluding potential false positives see figure caption the total concentrations were estimated assuming that the compounds ionize on average as efficiently as the target compounds section 2 5 2 the target screening shown for comparison demonstrates that anthropogenic activities affect the monitoring sites to very different extents total target concentrations ranged from 12 to 7000 ng l 1 for most monitoring sites the nontarget screening confirmed the contamination trend observed in the target screening monitoring sites with few target detections also had less nontarget detections than sites where several targets were found figure si a7 most not classifiable nontargets were detected in positive ionization mode figure si a8 to estimate which percentage of total contamination was explained by the target screening for 498 mps we compared the estimated concentration of targets with the estimated concentration of nontargets from each source without not classifiable site specific nontargets i e only 1 detection and without potential false positives according to this approximation the targets would explain 4 to 72 of the total contamination in individual samples median 34 pooled samples 30 33 based on detections 8 28 median 16 pooled samples 10 11 assuming that nontargets ionize as efficiently as target compounds 46 nontargets had concentrations 100 ng l 1 in at least one groundwater sample however it should be kept in mind that these estimates are subject to various uncertainties i the classification might be erroneous ii the true ionization efficiency of individual compounds might differ considerably from the ionization efficiency assumed by our quantification approach same ionization efficiency for all compounds iii matrix effects ion suppression and enhancement may influence signal intensities and thus the estimated concentrations in individual samples iv some potential mps might have been detected several times e g in both ionization modes or due to insufficient componentisation see section 3 2 despite these uncertainties nontarget screening indicated that the contamination from agriculture at sites with high agricultural influence might be considerably higher than assumed based solely on target screening indeed based on the roughly estimated compound concentrations 21 96 of potential agricultural mps detected at sites with high agricultural influence would not be explained by targets median 49 pooled samples 48 52 based on detections 62 89 median 77 pooled samples 81 this was at first glance surprising since we had previously performed a suspect screening for most registered pesticides including their tps using samples from partially the same monitoring sites kiefer et al 2019 the suspect list comprised more than 1000 pesticide tps compiled from various sources and mostly observed within the european pesticide registration however for many pesticides applied in switzerland between 2005 and 2017 relatively few tps could be gathered for the suspect list for 26 of pesticides transformation data was unavailable or inaccessible considering that for some pesticides e g chlorothalonil more than 20 tps are known efsa 2018 it is likely that the suspect list lacked important tps which were therefore not detected using the suspect screening approach whether groundwater quality is indeed more affected by agriculture than by urban activities as indicated by the target screening remains unclear many nontarget compounds were jointly assigned to both urban and agricultural sources potential urban and agricultural mps fig 3 purple though some of these probably originate from only urban sources as shown for some identified compounds see table 2 and section 3 4 2 one monitoring site differed strongly from the remaining sites in terms of estimated concentrations total number of nontarget compounds and the number of site specific compounds fig 3 figure si a6 to figure si a11 strikingly this site was not suspicious in the target screening except for high concentrations of the pesticide cycluron 140 ng l 1 si b1 which was banned in switzerland in 2005 and in the eu in 2003 european commission 2002 the elucidation of some nontargets supports the hypothesis that this monitoring site is highly contaminated section 3 4

accessible e g information on field of application for candidates and finally iv reference material could be purchased using 29 reference standards we confirmed 11 suspects and 12 nontargets level 1 and rejected three suspects and three nontargets moreover five nontargets and two suspects could be identified as probable structures by a library spectrum match level 2a while a further five nontargets and five suspects were assigned tentative structures level 3 fig 4 presents novel compounds level 1 or level 3 and table 2 compounds which were already reported to be detected in

novel micropollutants 2 5 dichlorobenzenesulfonic acid is pre registered under reach and was predicted as likely to be carcinogenic and persistent in the environment echa 2020 2 5 dichlorobenzenesulfonic acid was detected in 19 out of 60 samples mostly in the low ng l 1 range in one sample at 100 ng l 1 we did not find evidence for a prior detection in environmental samples in available literature phenylphosphonic acid is registered under reach 10 100 t a 1 echa 2020 and was detected at 10 monitoring sites with concentrations of up to 50 ng l 1 schulze et al 2019 compared various analytical approaches for the analysis of polar compounds phenylphosphonic acid could only be analysed by reversed phase lc but the tested enrichment methods all based on solid phase extraction were unsuitable for this industrial chemical the occurrence in environmental samples after evaporative enrichment is here reported for the first time o des 2 aminoethyl o carboxymethyl dehydroamlodipine is a tp of the blood pressure regulator amlodipine which is approved in switzerland the tp was detected in nearly one third of the samples at concentrations 100 ng l 1 and is probably reported here for the first time in environmental samples triisopropanolamine borate was detected at two monitoring sites at concentrations of up to 40 ng l 1 and was to our knowledge not reported before in the environment the sulphonamide diuretic drug xipamide was found in two samples at 30 ng l 1 previously li et al 2017 identified xipamide only tentatively in european wastewater impacted rivers interestingly xipamide is not approved in switzerland and was therefore also not on the target list pharmawiki 2020 one nontarget compound detected at five monitoring sites and classified as a potential urban and agricultural mp was tentatively identified as the pesticide tp pyroxsulam tp psa reference standard not available amongst the top ten most intense potential agricultural mps with a detection frequency 50 we tentatively identified metolachlor tp syn542490 reference standards not available assuming a similar ionization efficiency as metolachlor esa and metolachlor tp cga 368208 maximum concentrations were estimated to be in the range of 100 500 ng l 1 which is comparable to the concentrations of the target compounds metolachlor esa and metolachlor tp cga 368208 s metolachlor is currently under review for renewal in the eu in contrast to our previously performed target and suspect screening kiefer et al 2019 which included nine metolachlor tps here we had access to nine further metolachlor tps including tp syn542490 t poiger personal communication they were previously observed in a lysimeter study by the pesticide producer hand et al 2016 after the detection of syn542490 we manually screened for the remaining tps and tentatively identified the tps cga357704 reported previously by reemtsma et al 2013 syn542607 syn547977 syn542489 syn542491 and one or both of the isomers namely syn547969 and syn542488 all of which were detected at lower intensity and lower frequency compared to syn542490 3 4 2 evaluation of pre classification of elucidated compounds the identification efforts focused on compounds classified as potential mps from urban sources and urban and agricultural sources probably all elucidated compounds with this pre classification originate from urban or industrial sources except for the tentatively identified tp of the herbicide pyroxsulam namely pyroxsulam tp psa furthermore we investigated the most intense and wide spread potential agricultural pollutants leading to the identification of tps of the pesticides metolachlor and atrazine confirming the correct pre classification interestingly in addition to the mentioned pesticide tps we also detected the short chain perfluorinated compound trifluoromethanesulfonic acid 53 detections which has previously been reported by zahn et al 2016 and schulze et al 2019 as a wide spread mp with concentrations in the ng l 1 to µg l 1 range the highest concentrations in our study up to 90 ng l 1 were detected in samples with high agricultural influence explaining its classification as a potential agricultural mp in contrast to another short chain perfluorinated compound trifluoroacetic acid for which various sources have been reported including the degradation of pesticides scheurer et al 2017 trifluoromethanesulfonic acid is to our knowledge not known as being of potential agricultural origin four elucidated suspects could not be related to urban and or agricultural sources i e were not classifiable the industrial chemical hexa methoxymethyl melamine showed on average only four times higher intensity in samples with high urban influence compared to the average intensity in samples with low urban influence and was therefore not classifiable threshold was five section 2 5 2 in the case of p toluenesulfonic acid contamination during sample handling or analysis led to false positive detections in a few samples including the blank samples this compound is a known background contaminant schulze et al 2019 on average its intensity was 28 times higher in samples than in blanks meaning it was not removed during pre processing section 2 5 1 similarly 1 3 diphenylguanidine was detected in all samples and in 19 of these had an intensity five times greater than in blanks however in spiking experiments 100 ng l 1 we observed 3 4 times higher intensities in the sample matrix than in ultrapure water ion enhancement suggesting that the detections with relatively high intensity might represent contaminations therefore 1 3 diphenylguanidine is not reported in table 2 a further not classifiable compound was trifluoroacetic acid which is a ubiquitously spread pollutant and may enter groundwater via diffuse sources atmospheric deposition pesticide application or point sources industrial emissions to rivers berg et al 2000 freeling et al 2020 scheurer et al 2017 accordingly trifluoroacetic acid was detected in all samples though reliable quantification was not possible many identified nontargets and suspects were pre classified as potential urban and agricultural mp although they likely originate only from urban sources e g tps of x ray contrast agent iopromide benzotriazole derivates table 2 this imprecise classification results from the large number of monitoring sites which were influenced by both urban and agricultural activities whereas only few sites showed a high urban but low agricultural influence fig 1 to achieve a better classification of urban mps more monitoring sites with primarily urban influence would be needed for the workflow but this was difficult to obtain due to the swiss small scale structured landscape the characterization of the monitoring sites section 3 3 highlighted one site in particular due to its especially high contamination in terms of both the number and estimated concentrations of detected nontargets fig 3 figure si a6 to figure si a11 out of 46 nontargets with estimated concentrations 100 ng l 1 section 3 3 10 of the 46 were identified 23 were detected at this site the hypothesis that this site might be highly contaminated was further supported by the elucidation of various compounds being either site specific or showing highest concentrations at this site such as the industrial chemicals naphthalenedisulfonic acids various isomers 500 ng l 1 and p toluenesulfonic acid 200 700 ng l 1 the diazinone tp pyrimidinol 60 ng l 1 the industrial chemicals dimethylbenzenesulfonic acids various isomers 80 ng l 1 and 2 5 dichlorobenzenesulfonic acid 100 ng l 1 and chlorendic acid level 2a the echa classifies chlorendic acid as a carcinogen category 1b echa 2020 potential sources include the degradation of flame retardant polyesters or organochlorine pesticides such as endosulfan heptachlor or aldrin ipcs 1996 the reason for this contamination is unknown but the groundwater from this site is not currently used for drinking water production 4 conclusions by combining an appropriate compound prioritization strategy with a highly automated structural elucidation workflow we were able to characterize groundwater quality in a more comprehensive manner than previously possible using targeted methods and in doing so to identify as yet unreported mps nontargets were prioritized based on their potential origin for structural elucidation categorisation of nontargets also provided rough estimates of the number and the concentrations of thus far overlooked contaminants a combination of computational tools supported the structural elucidation process acquirex improved ms ms coverage for nontargets and suspects while metfrag and sirius4 csi fingerid together with an extensive compound database resulted in 23 unequivocally identified and 17 tentatively identified compounds 13 of these compounds are novel structural elucidation was most successful for compounds i with ms ms spectra in libraries or literature ii that were assigned limited numbers of candidate structures iii that had accessible metadata and iv for which reference material was available despite the high degree of automation of the structural elucidation workflow structural elucidation itself remains a major bottleneck in transforming unknowns into known compounds moreover elucidation of compounds not presently in any database e g so far not observed tps is highly challenging and was not covered at all by our elucidation approach one groundwater

17070,groundwater is a major drinking water resource but its quality with regard to organic micropollutants mps is insufficiently assessed therefore we aimed to investigate swiss groundwater more comprehensively using liquid chromatography high resolution tandem mass spectrometry lc hrms ms first samples from 60 sites were classified as having high or low urban or agricultural influence based on 498 target compounds associated with either urban or agricultural sources second all lc hrms signals were related to their potential origin urban urban and agricultural agricultural or not classifiable based on their occurrence and intensity in the classified samples a considerable fraction of estimated concentrations associated with urban and or agricultural sources could not be explained by the 139 detected targets the most intense nontarget signals were automatically annotated with structure proposals using metfrag and sirius4 csi fingerid with a list of 988 000 compounds additionally suspect screening was performed for 1162 compounds with predicted high groundwater mobility from primarily urban sources finally 12 nontargets and 11 suspects were identified unequivocally level 1 while 17 further compounds were tentatively identified level 2a 3 amongst these were 13 pollutants thus far not reported in groundwater such as the industrial chemicals 2 5 dichlorobenzenesulfonic acid 19 detections up to 100 ng l 1 phenylphosponic acid 10 detections up to 50 ng l 1 triisopropanolamine borate 2 detections up to 40 ng l 1 o des 2 aminoethyl o carboxymethyl dehydroamlodipine a transformation product tp of the blood pressure regulator amlodipine 17 detections and the tp syn542490 of the herbicide metolachlor level 3 33 detections estimated concentrations up to 100 500 ng l 1 one monitoring site was far more contaminated than other sites based on estimated total concentrations of potential mps which was supported by the elucidation of site specific nontarget signals such as the carcinogen chlorendic acid and various naphthalenedisulfonic acids many compounds remained unknown but overall source related prioritisation proved an effective approach to support identification of compounds in groundwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords target screening nontarget screening micropollutant persistent and mobile compounds pmoc acquirex 1 introduction groundwater is a major drinking water resource and therefore its quality is of high interest various micropollutants mps from agriculture households or industry entering aquifers via different pathways affect groundwater quality loos et al 2010 whereas pesticides are applied in high amounts to agricultural soils pimentel 2009 and then enter aquifers mainly via seepage pharmaceuticals household and industrial chemicals may contaminate aquifers predominantly via leaky sewers wolf et al 2012 or via bank filtration from wastewater impacted surface waters heberer et al 2004 consequently the land use in the catchment and or hydrogeological setting e g bank filtration characteristics of top layers influence the mp pattern at the groundwater monitoring

in the environment and engineered systems kolpin et al 2009 and iii new mps are regularly reported to be in the water cycle e g weber et al 2007 schmidt and brauch 2008 reemtsma et al 2013 schlüsener et al 2015 zahn et al 2016 gago ferrero et al 2018 schulze et al 2019 or zahn et al 2019 it seems insufficient to evaluate water quality only on the basis of selected analytes liquid chromatography high resolution tandem mass spectrometry lc hrms ms enables the detection of possibly thousands of small molecules in a water sample both from natural and anthropogenic sources some of these compounds can be elucidated by broad scope target screening where reference standards are available in the laboratory while others are detected as part of suspect screening i e searching for specific structures without having reference material at hand krauss et al 2010 however usually most lc hrms ms signals remain unknown so called nontargets and should therefore be further investigated spectral libraries such as the european massbank horai et al 2010 massbank of north america mona http mona fiehnlab ucdavis edu and mzcloud www mzcloud org allow structural annotation of nontarget signals with high confidence level schymanski et al 2014b though their use is limited to compounds for which ms ms spectra were made accessible by other laboratories for compounds not present in spectral libraries in silico fragmentation tools e g metfrag ruttkies et al 2016 sirius4 csi fingerid dührkop et al 2015 dührkop et al 2019 and cfm id allen et al 2014 in combination with large chemical compound databases such as pubchem kim et al 2019 comptox chemistry dashboard williams et al 2017 or the norman suspect list exchange www norman network com nds sle are promising alternatives for structural annotation these tools enable the high throughput annotation of thousands of nontargets however with often hundreds or even thousands of candidates thus the final identification with reference material remains a major bottleneck so that so far only few nontargets have been elucidated with high confidence in water samples albergamo et al 2019 gago ferrero et al 2015 schymanski et al 2014a tian et al 2020 as a consequence nontargets of interest need to be prioritized before investing time and resources into structure elucidation or even purchasing reference material using one or a combination of several approaches depending on the study context most studies apply filters for analytical quality control e g excluding compounds detected in procedural blanks and including only compounds with high reproducibility in replicate and pooled samples broadhurst et al 2018 sangster et al 2006 the use of pooled samples i e samples comprising aliquots of all samples is more common in metabolomics than in environmental studies intensity is a crucial parameter in most studies hug et al 2014 schymanski et al 2014a as intense signals may provide higher quality ms ms data supporting elucidation additionally intensity correlates to some extent with concentration though it is important to highlight that high intensity or concentration does not necessarily mean high toxicological risk furthermore cl and br isotope patterns may point to compounds from anthropogenic origins chiaia hernandez et al 2014 hug et al 2014 and homologues to larger groups of related compounds such as surfactants schymanski et al 2014a comparing related samples such as raw water and final drinking water müller et al 2011 or road dust and surface water seiwert et al 2020 facilitate prioritization of persistent signals originating from a specific source in this regard multivariate statistical tools such as principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering can be applied for example to samples collected along a wastewater treatment plant schollée et al 2015 schollée et al 2018 or a riverbank transect albergamo et al 2019 to determine nontargets with specific trends the goal of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the quality of water derived from 60 groundwater monitoring sites in switzerland to do so all detected lc hrms signals were to be related to their potential sources urban agricultural followed by structural elucidation of the most prominent ones focusing in particular on potential mps from urban sources our hypothesis was that by combining an appropriate nontarget prioritization strategy with a highly automated structure elucidation workflow we would find previously unreported compounds in groundwater first we performed an extensive target screening for 498 mps to classify the samples according to their dominating urban and agricultural pollutants next all lc hrms signals were classified based on their pre dominating occurrence in urban or agricultural sources which was assessed by comparing samples with high vs low urban or high vs low agricultural influence structure elucidation focused on nontargets from potentially urban sources because we investigated already in detail major agricultural mps i e pesticides and their transformation products tps in a similar sample set kiefer et al 2019 accordingly most intense nontargets from potentially urban sources and in addition widespread nontargets were annotated with candidate proposals using metfrag and sirius4 csi fingerid and finally elucidated with reference standards if commercially available to not overlook important urban mps with lower signal intensity we applied additionally a suspect screening for 1162 polar and therefore mobile compounds from mainly urban sources 2 methods 2 1 groundwater samples the applied nontarget screening approach aimed to classify nontargets with regards to their origin urban agricultural based on their occurrence at monitoring sites that are i urban impacted ii agriculturally impacted or iii show only low anthropogenic impact therefore 60 monitoring sites 44 abstraction wells 16 springs were selected out of 500 sites from the swiss national groundwater monitoring naqua www bafu admin ch naqua based on long term monitoring data collected within naqua twenty sites contained mps from pre dominantly urban sources pharmaceuticals sweeteners while 20 other sites showed high frequency or concentrations of mps from agricultural sources pesticides and their tps a further 20 sites exhibited comparably low anthropogenic contamination several sites were not clearly classifiable as urban or agriculturally impacted due to the occurrence of pollutants from both source types the 60 groundwater samples were collected in laboratory glass bottles previously annealed at 500 c 1 l bottles simax kavalier czech republic in may and august 2018 within the routine sampling of naqua samples were stored cooled for up to four weeks and then frozen at 20 c until measurement for quality control pooled samples were prepared i e samples consisting of an equal amount of each sample for this aliquots 5 or 10 ml of each groundwater sample were transferred to laboratory glass bottles 0 5 l or 1 l using a 5 ml brown glass vial before samples were frozen to determine contaminations from sampling sample storage or handling ultrapure water 18 mωcm barnstead nanopure diamond system was filled into laboratory glass bottles transferred during sampling into another bottle at five monitoring sites and then stored and processed analogously to the groundwater samples as blank samples 2 2 sample preparation via vacuum assisted evaporation to avoid losses of polar compounds during sample enrichment samples were

gradient elution started with 100 water containing 0 1 formic acid to achieve an optimal retention of polar compounds then methanol containing 0 1 formic acid was added and increased to 95 from 1 5 to

triplicate injection data dependant ms ms full scans were triggered based on a mass list containing target compounds then acquirex performed peak picking and added detected features m z and retention time to the mass list so that in the second triplicate injection data dependant ms ms full scans were triggered based on the mass list modified by acquirex before the third injection acquirex shifted features for which ms ms scans were already acquired during the second injection from the mass to the exclusion list so that these features were not triggered again if no features from the mass list were detected the ms ms scans for the most intense signals were acquired triggered features were excluded dynamically for 3 s for details see si a2 2 4 target screening for each target compound extracted ion chromatograms were plotted with the msnbase r package gatto and lilley 2012 and visually inspected if the target compound was detected in groundwater samples the concentration was determined using trace finder 4 1 thermo fisher scientific u s based on the peak area ratio of the target compound to that of corresponding internal standard if no structurally identical isotope labelled internal standard was available an internal standard was selected with similar retention time as the analyte and resulting in a relative recovery close to 100 in the spiked samples using an in house r script schollée 2018 for details on target quantification including determination of limit of quantification loq see si a3 2 5 suspect and nontarget screening measurement files were converted to mzxml format using msconvert 3 0 proteowizard chambers et al 2012 and then processed in the envimass workflow envibee gmbh switzerland data post processing was conducted in the r environment version 3 6 3 r core team 2020 2 5 1 data pre processing data pre processing was performed using the envimass workflow version 4 2633 including peak picking mass recalibration retention time alignment intensity normalization based on median intensity of internal standards replicate filtering and target and suspect annotation features i e chromatographic peaks defined by their m z and retention time that likely resulted from the same compound adducts isotopologues were grouped into so called components based on intensity correlation and m z distance the most intense feature within a component was used for further data analysis settings e g m z and retention time tolerances were optimized until 87 of target peaks detected with trace finder 4 1 section 2 4 were found 62 of target peaks that were not detected were 10 ng l 1 or exceeded the loq section 2 4 by less than factor 5 other non detects were mostly related to large retention time shifts i e exceeding the retention time tolerance for targets or poor peak shape for final settings see si a4 finally a table containing the peak height intensity pattern of each component across the samples so called profiles was exported profiles were prioritized for further inspection by excluding those with a retention time 3 min average sample blank intensity ratio 5 and maximum peak intensity 106 for comparison a peak height intensity of 106 corresponded to a concentration of 10 ng l 1 for approximately 90 of targets ionizing in positive ionization mode and 35 of targets ionizing in negative ionization mode it should be noted that for some compounds several components might exist e g positive and negative ionization in source fragments moreover for some target compounds two or three profiles were observed often related to shifting retention times or peak picking artefacts therefore profiles differing in m z by 2 ppm and retention time 30 s were grouped using an in house r function schollée et al in preparation peak intensities were averaged across replicates 2 5 2 prioritization of profiles using sample classification to classify nontarget compounds according to their potential origin urban agricultural groundwater samples were first classified based on the sum concentration of 269 targets from predominantly urban origin pharmaceuticals and their tps sweeteners industrial chemicals biocides illicit drugs personal care products and others si b1 and 229 targets from predominantly agricultural origin pesticides and their tps si b1 samples were defined as having high urban influence if the sum concentration of urban targets was 100 ng l 1 otherwise they were defined as samples with low urban influence likewise samples for which the sum concentration of agricultural targets exceeded 100 ng l 1 were defined as having high agricultural influence and otherwise as having low agricultural influence the cut off of 100 ng l 1 was guided by the european union s drinking water standard for single pesticides and relevant pesticide tps european commission 1998 the sum concentration instead of concentrations of single compounds was used so that the classification depended not only on single targets with high concentrations next the ratio of a compound s average intensity in samples with high urban agricultural influence to that of its average intensity in samples with low urban agricultural influence was calculated as a measure for the likelihood that the compound originated from urban sources or agricultural sources respectively 1 measure for urban origin average intensity in samples with high urban influence average intensity in samples with low urban influence 2 measure for agricultural origin average intensity in samples with high agricultural influence average intensity in samples with low agricultural influence if the compound was not detected in one of the sample groups it was assumed that the compound was detected in one sample with the minimum intensity observed in the whole dataset to avoid dividing by 0 profiles were classified as follows potential urban mp measure for urban origin 5 and measure for agricultural origin 5 potential agricultural mp measure for urban origin 5 and measure for agricultural origin 5 potential urban and agricultural mp measure for urban origin 5 and measure for agricultural origin 5 not classifiable remaining profiles here the decision to use a factor of five as threshold was guided by profiles annotated as target compounds i e 80 of profiles of urban targets and 90 of profiles of agricultural targets respectively showed on average more than five times higher intensities in samples with high urban agricultural influence vs samples with low urban agricultural influence however it should be pointed out that some target compounds which would be classified as potential urban and agricultural mp likely originate only from urban sources e g x ray contrast agent diatrizoic acid to gather more information on potential sources the most intense profiles in each group urban urban agricultural agricultural profiles with maximum intensity 5 106 not classifiable profiles with maximum intensity 107 and 30 detections were retrospectively screened for in the effluent of two swiss municipal wastewater treatment plants 24 h composite samples dry weather conditions for this extracted ion chromatograms eics were generated for blank and effluent samples measured with a comparable method without enrichment using the r package msnbase gatto and lilley 2012 the eics were then checked for peaks with intensity 105 and deviating 1 min from the average retention time of the corresponding profiles si c2 total concentrations in each sample were estimated assuming that the compounds ionize either less efficiently than as efficiently as or more efficiently than the 113 targets compounds 92 in positive ionization mode 21 in negative ionization mode spiked in to groundwater samples 1 10

maximum intensity 5 106 and on all profiles that had maximum intensity 107 and 30 detections for each profile ms1 and ms ms data were extracted from the sample with highest precursor intensity using the rmassbank package stravs et al 2013 structural proposals were then assigned using both metfrag cl 2 4 5 using functions from the r package resolution schymanski 2020 and sirius4 csi fingerid both

top 3 candidates of sirius4 csi fingerid were checked manually as described for nontargets prioritized suspects and nontargets were classified in accordance with schymanski et al 2014b i as confirmed

tentative identifications were based solely on ms ms interpretation level 3 the annotation of ms ms fragments with structural proposals for tentatively identified compounds was supported by cfm id 3 0 level 1 candidates were identified and quantified as follows ten selected samples were enriched and measured together with four calibration standards 1 10 100 1000 ng l 1 and six spiked samples 100 250 1000 ng l 1 with adjusted ms ms settings the determined calibration model was applied to the previously measured samples for quantification the quality of quantification was evaluated for each compound based on relative recoveries in spiked samples and the reproducibility of concentrations in the samples which were each measured twice not every compound could be quantified satisfactorily so that in some cases either concentration ranges or no concentrations are reported further details regarding structural confirmation quantification and associated ms ms spectra can be found in si a7 si a12 and si b4 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 sample classification based on targets the extent of urban and or agricultural influence on the 60 groundwater monitoring sites was evaluated based on the sum concentration of 269 urban and 229 agricultural target compounds for concentrations of individual targets see si b1 and for targets with detections 100 ng l 1 see table si a7 accordingly 17 sites showed only low urban and agricultural influence 18 sites were predominantly influenced by agricultural targets 22 sites were influenced by agricultural and urban targets and three sites were predominantly impacted by urban targets fig 1 these classifications which were based on the here presented target screening were consistent with classifications based on long term monitoring data for 53 out of 60 monitoring sites for details see si a8 for most monitoring sites the classification was also consistent with the land use of the catchment i e sites with high urban influence were often close to settlements or to wastewater impacted surface waters bank filtration sites with high agricultural influence were usually in areas with intensive agricultural land use and the catchments of sites with low urban and agricultural influence were usually dominated by grassland or forest urban classification was primarily associated with the sweetener acesulfame the biocide tp n n dimethylsulfamide may also originate from the banned plant protection product tolylfluanid the industrial chemical melamine and the corrosion inhibitor benzotriazole i e if one of these targets is removed from the dataset then two to five sites are no longer classified as having high urban influence or high urban and agricultural influence fig 1 analogously the agricultural classification was most driven by a tp of the fungicide chlorothalonil r471811 which was the only target compound detected in each sample maximum concentration 2200 ng l 1 kiefer et al 2020a for further details see figure si a2 if samples were classified based on detection frequency of urban or agricultural targets using a cut off of e g 10 detections then 44 sites would be classified in the same way figure si a3 here it should be noted that some pesticides may also be used as biocides e g n n dimethylsulfamide tp triazine herbicides and some pharmaceuticals are also used as veterinary drugs therefore these targets may be related to urban and agricultural activities potentially resulting in a wrong classification of some sites 3 2 classification of nontargets in the 60 groundwater samples 6504 intensity profiles across samples hereafter compounds were detected with maximum intensity 106 table 1 including 4800 nontargets and 98 targets in positive ionization mode and 1573 nontargets and 33 targets in negative ionization mode the total number of compounds was likely slightly lower due to ambiguities that arise during componentisation of isotopologues and adducts e g ten target compounds were associated with several profiles furthermore some compounds might be detected in both ionization modes such as 15 target compounds of the 6373 nontargets 4027 63 were found in less than five out of six pooled sample replicates or the intensity showed a relative standard deviation of 50 in pooled samples with detections see table 1 indicating that either the concentration was too low to be reproducibly detected potentially due to dilution during mixing of sample aliquots or that the peak shape was not reproducible moreover for 296 compounds the maximum intensity in the pooled samples was even higher than the maximum intensity in the groundwater samples this may be related to contamination during sample handling or peak picking artefacts e g noise from the 6373 nontargets 331 5 were classified as potential urban mps 945 15 as potential agricultural mps and 1892 30 as potential mps from urban and agricultural sources the remaining 3205 50 could not be assigned to one of these groups not classifiable and might be compounds of natural origins table 1 fig 2 more than 90 of profiles annotated as target compound were classified correctly which was expected because classification criteria 5 times higher intensity in contaminated samples were guided by the target compounds the not classifiable target compounds centre of fig 2 were unclassified due to one or more of the following reasons i a compound was incorrectly annotated different compound with similar retention time ii a compound had a noisy eic resulting in too many detections by envimass iii a compound originates from multiple sources the sweetener saccharin may originate from wastewater or from pig manure buerge et al 2011 and can therefore occur at less contaminated sites iv a compound was detected in only one sample with low urban and agricultural influence site specific v a compound had shifting retention time and was therefore not correctly grouped vi compounds that have probably been spread ubiquitously such as banned triazine pesticides and their tps and vii a compound eluted very early and was therefore affected by ion suppression this early eluting compound was melamine an industrial chemical and tp of the larvicide cyromazine which is often applied to manure echa 2015 based on concentrations determined with a structurally identical internal standard melamine would be correctly classified as an mp from urban and agricultural sources this compound was however hardly retained by the applied chromatographic method retention time 3 4 min eluting together with salts and other highly polar compounds leading to strong ion suppression effects and in turn low intensity which is used for automatic classification which hampered proper classification in total 20 of all detected compounds eluted between 3 and 4 min half of these compounds are located in the centre of fig 2 indicating either their ubiquitous occurrence or their possible misclassification as in the case of melamine in addition many compounds with broad late eluting peaks positive mass defect values and higher m z were located in the centre of fig 2 many were assigned as potential natural organic matter and occurred either at each site or were randomly distributed see si a9 for details table 1 further characterization and elucidation focused on the more intense compounds classified as potential mps from urban or urban and agricultural sources maximum intensity 5 106 and the most prominent compounds from the remaining dataset 107 30 detections from the resulting 488 compounds in the positive and negative mode si b2 480 compounds had at least one ms ms spectrum demonstrating the effectiveness of acquirex section 2 3 acquirex increased the ms ms coverage for the 488 nontargets by 39 for suspects an increase of 73 was observed detailed discussion in si a10 overall 409 compounds were annotated with between 1 and 576 candidate proposals using metfrag and or sirius4 csi fingerid most compounds without candidate proposals 80 eluted before 4 min and therefore might be artefacts from the lc hrms ms analysis to get further evidence for an anthropogenic origin 562 compounds were checked for characteristic isotope patterns such as cl si c1 and for their occurrence in effluent samples of two municipal wastewater treatment plants si c2 including 74 agricultural compounds with maximum intensity 5 106 which were not part of the 488 compounds at least 39 of the 488 compounds contained one or more cl atoms see si b2 and discussion in si a9 based on their isotope pattern in terms of occurrence 38 of the 56 urban compounds were detected in at least one of the two effluent samples only 12 of the 323 urban agricultural compounds and 12 of the 86 agricultural compounds showed a peak in the effluent samples interestingly also a high percentage of the 97 not classifiable compounds 39 were found in the wastewater effluents si b2 however the majority of these not classifiable compounds 70 eluted between 3 and 4 min i e they were possibly misclassified or occur naturally e g salts 3 3 characterization of groundwater quality at monitoring sites fig 3 illustrates the total estimated concentrations of detected compounds at the 60 monitoring sites after excluding potential false positives see figure caption the total concentrations were estimated assuming that the compounds ionize on average as efficiently as the target compounds section 2 5 2 the target screening shown for comparison demonstrates that anthropogenic activities affect the monitoring sites to very different extents total target concentrations ranged from 12 to 7000 ng l 1 for most monitoring sites the nontarget screening confirmed the contamination trend observed in the target screening monitoring sites with few target detections also had less nontarget detections than sites where several targets were found figure si a7 most not classifiable nontargets were detected in positive ionization mode figure si a8 to estimate which percentage of total contamination was explained by the target screening for 498 mps we compared the estimated concentration of targets with the estimated concentration of nontargets from each source without not classifiable site specific nontargets i e only 1 detection and without potential false positives according to this approximation the targets would explain 4 to 72 of the total contamination in individual samples median 34 pooled samples 30 33 based on detections 8 28 median 16 pooled samples 10 11 assuming that nontargets ionize as efficiently as target compounds 46 nontargets had concentrations 100 ng l 1 in at least one groundwater sample however it should be kept in mind that these estimates are subject to various uncertainties i the classification might be erroneous ii the true ionization efficiency of individual compounds might differ considerably from the ionization efficiency assumed by our quantification approach same ionization efficiency for all compounds iii matrix effects ion suppression and enhancement may influence signal intensities and thus the estimated concentrations in individual samples iv some potential mps might have been detected several times e g in both ionization modes or due to insufficient componentisation see section 3 2 despite these uncertainties nontarget screening indicated that the contamination from agriculture at sites with high agricultural influence might be considerably higher than assumed based solely on target screening indeed based on the roughly estimated compound concentrations 21 96 of potential agricultural mps detected at sites with high agricultural influence would not be explained by targets median 49 pooled samples 48 52 based on detections 62 89 median 77 pooled samples 81 this was at first glance surprising since we had previously performed a suspect screening for most registered pesticides including their tps using samples from partially the same monitoring sites kiefer et al 2019 the suspect list comprised more than 1000 pesticide tps compiled from various sources and mostly observed within the european pesticide registration however for many pesticides applied in switzerland between 2005 and 2017 relatively few tps could be gathered for the suspect list for 26 of pesticides transformation data was unavailable or inaccessible considering that for some pesticides e g chlorothalonil more than 20 tps are known efsa 2018 it is likely that the suspect list lacked important tps which were therefore not detected using the suspect screening approach whether groundwater quality is indeed more affected by agriculture than by urban activities as indicated by the target screening remains unclear many nontarget compounds were jointly assigned to both urban and agricultural sources potential urban and agricultural mps fig 3 purple though some of these probably originate from only urban sources as shown for some identified compounds see table 2 and section 3 4 2 one monitoring site differed strongly from the remaining sites in terms of estimated concentrations total number of nontarget compounds and the number of site specific compounds fig 3 figure si a6 to figure si a11 strikingly this site was not suspicious in the target screening except for high concentrations of the pesticide cycluron 140 ng l 1 si b1 which was banned in switzerland in 2005 and in the eu in 2003 european commission 2002 the elucidation of some nontargets supports the hypothesis that this monitoring site is highly contaminated section 3 4 3 4 identification of nontargets and suspects structural elucidation efforts were especially successful where i nontargets were annotated with relatively few structural candidates 12 of 21 unequivocally or tentatively identified nontargets had 10 candidates ii ms ms spectra of the correct candidate were available in libraries or literature 13 nontargets iii useful metadata was accessible e g information on field of application for candidates and finally iv reference material could be purchased using 29 reference standards we confirmed 11 suspects and 12 nontargets level 1 and rejected three suspects and three nontargets moreover five nontargets and two suspects could be identified as probable structures by a library spectrum match level 2a while a further five nontargets and five suspects were assigned tentative structures level 3 fig 4 presents novel compounds level 1 or level 3 and table 2 compounds which were already reported to be detected in environmental samples further details including quantification results and ms ms spectra are given in si a12 and si b4 in addition ms ms spectra will be uploaded to massbank www massbank eu 3 4 1 novel micropollutants 2 5 dichlorobenzenesulfonic acid is pre registered under reach and was predicted as likely to be carcinogenic and persistent in the environment echa 2020 2 5 dichlorobenzenesulfonic acid was detected in 19 out of 60 samples mostly in the low ng l 1 range in one sample at 100 ng l 1 we did not find evidence for a prior detection in environmental samples in available literature phenylphosphonic acid is registered under reach 10 100 t a 1 echa 2020 and was detected at 10 monitoring sites with concentrations of up to 50 ng l 1 schulze et al 2019 compared various analytical approaches for the analysis of polar compounds phenylphosphonic acid could only be analysed by reversed phase lc but the tested enrichment methods all based on solid phase extraction were unsuitable for this industrial chemical the occurrence in environmental samples after evaporative enrichment is here reported for the first time o des 2 aminoethyl o carboxymethyl dehydroamlodipine is a tp of the blood pressure regulator amlodipine which is approved in switzerland the tp was detected in nearly one third of the samples at concentrations 100 ng l 1 and is probably reported here for the first time in environmental samples triisopropanolamine borate was detected at two monitoring sites at concentrations of up to 40 ng l 1 and was to our knowledge not reported before in the environment the sulphonamide diuretic drug xipamide was found in two samples at 30 ng l 1 previously li et al 2017 identified xipamide only tentatively in european wastewater impacted rivers interestingly xipamide is not approved in switzerland and was therefore also not on the target list pharmawiki 2020 one nontarget compound detected at five monitoring sites and classified as a potential urban and agricultural mp was tentatively identified as the pesticide tp pyroxsulam tp psa reference standard not available amongst the top ten most intense potential agricultural mps with a detection frequency 50 we tentatively identified metolachlor tp syn542490 reference standards not available assuming a similar ionization efficiency as metolachlor esa and metolachlor tp cga 368208 maximum concentrations were estimated to be in the range of 100 500 ng l 1 which is comparable to the concentrations of the target compounds metolachlor esa and metolachlor tp cga 368208 s metolachlor is currently under review for renewal in the eu in contrast to our previously performed target and suspect screening kiefer et al 2019 which included nine metolachlor tps here we had access to nine further metolachlor tps including tp syn542490 t poiger personal communication they were previously observed in a lysimeter study by the pesticide producer hand et al 2016 after the detection of syn542490 we manually screened for the remaining tps and tentatively identified the tps cga357704 reported previously by reemtsma et al 2013 syn542607 syn547977 syn542489 syn542491 and one or both of the isomers namely syn547969 and syn542488 all of which were detected at lower intensity and lower frequency compared to syn542490 3 4 2 evaluation of pre classification of elucidated compounds the identification efforts focused on compounds classified as potential mps from urban sources and urban and agricultural sources probably all elucidated compounds with this pre classification originate from urban or industrial sources except for the tentatively identified tp of the herbicide pyroxsulam namely pyroxsulam tp psa furthermore we investigated the most intense and wide spread potential agricultural pollutants leading to the identification of tps of the pesticides metolachlor and atrazine confirming the correct pre classification interestingly in addition to the mentioned pesticide tps we also detected the short chain perfluorinated compound trifluoromethanesulfonic acid 53 detections which has previously been reported by zahn et al 2016 and schulze et al 2019 as a wide spread mp with concentrations in the ng l 1 to µg l 1 range the highest concentrations in our study up to 90 ng l 1 were detected in samples with high agricultural influence explaining its classification as a potential agricultural mp in contrast to another short chain perfluorinated compound trifluoroacetic acid for which various sources have been reported including the degradation of pesticides scheurer et al 2017 trifluoromethanesulfonic acid is to our knowledge not known as being of potential agricultural origin four elucidated suspects could not be related to urban and or agricultural sources i e were not classifiable the industrial chemical hexa methoxymethyl melamine showed on average only four times higher intensity in samples with high urban influence compared to the average intensity in samples with low urban influence and was therefore not classifiable threshold was five section 2 5 2 in the case of p toluenesulfonic acid contamination during sample handling or analysis led to false positive detections in a few samples including the blank samples this compound is a known background contaminant schulze et al 2019 on average its intensity was 28 times higher in samples than in blanks meaning it was not removed during pre processing section 2 5 1 similarly 1 3 diphenylguanidine was detected in all samples and in 19 of these had an intensity five times greater than in blanks however in spiking experiments 100 ng l 1 we observed 3 4 times higher intensities in the sample matrix than in ultrapure water ion enhancement suggesting that the detections with relatively high intensity might represent contaminations therefore 1 3 diphenylguanidine is not reported in table 2 a further not classifiable compound was trifluoroacetic acid which is a ubiquitously spread pollutant and may enter groundwater via diffuse sources atmospheric deposition pesticide application or point sources industrial emissions to rivers berg et al 2000 freeling et al 2020 scheurer et al 2017 accordingly trifluoroacetic acid was detected in all samples though reliable quantification was not possible many identified nontargets and suspects were pre classified as potential urban and agricultural mp although they likely originate only from urban sources e g tps of x ray contrast agent iopromide benzotriazole derivates table 2 this imprecise classification results from the large number of monitoring sites which were influenced by both urban and agricultural activities whereas only few sites showed a high urban but low agricultural influence fig 1 to achieve a better classification of urban mps more monitoring sites with primarily urban influence would be needed for the workflow but this was difficult to obtain due to the swiss small scale structured landscape the characterization of the monitoring sites section 3 3 highlighted one site in particular due to its especially high contamination in terms of both the number and estimated concentrations of detected nontargets fig 3 figure si a6 to figure si a11 out of 46 nontargets with estimated concentrations 100 ng l 1 section 3 3 10 of the 46 were identified 23 were detected at this site the hypothesis that this site might be highly contaminated was further supported by the elucidation of various compounds being either site specific or showing highest concentrations at this site such as the industrial chemicals naphthalenedisulfonic acids various isomers 500 ng l 1 and p toluenesulfonic acid 200 700 ng l 1 the diazinone tp pyrimidinol 60 ng l 1 the industrial chemicals dimethylbenzenesulfonic acids various isomers 80 ng l 1 and 2 5 dichlorobenzenesulfonic acid 100 ng l 1 and chlorendic acid level 2a the echa classifies chlorendic acid as a carcinogen category 1b echa 2020 potential sources include the degradation of flame retardant polyesters or organochlorine pesticides such as endosulfan heptachlor or aldrin ipcs 1996 the reason for this contamination is unknown but the groundwater from this site is not currently used for drinking water production 4 conclusions by combining an appropriate compound prioritization strategy with a highly automated structural elucidation workflow we were able to characterize groundwater quality in a more comprehensive manner than previously possible using targeted methods and in doing so to identify as yet unreported mps nontargets were prioritized based on their potential origin for structural elucidation categorisation of nontargets also provided rough estimates of the number and the concentrations of thus far overlooked contaminants a combination of computational tools supported the structural elucidation process acquirex improved ms ms coverage for nontargets and suspects while metfrag and sirius4 csi fingerid together with an extensive compound database resulted in 23 unequivocally identified and 17 tentatively identified compounds 13 of these compounds are novel structural elucidation was most successful for compounds i with ms ms spectra in libraries or literature ii that were assigned limited numbers of candidate structures iii that had accessible metadata and iv for which reference material was available despite the high degree of automation of the structural elucidation workflow structural elucidation itself remains a major bottleneck in transforming unknowns into known compounds moreover elucidation of compounds not presently in any database e g so far not observed tps is highly challenging and was not covered at all by our elucidation approach one groundwater sample was revealed to be much more polluted than assumed based on target screening highlighting the relevance of comprehensive screening approaches for evaluating water quality declaration of

17071,freshwater lakes are threatened by harmful cyanobacterial blooms whose basic unit is cyanobacterial aggregate ca ca attached bacteria play a significant role through different blooming stages with substantial variation of their taxonomic structure however little is known about their functional variations and functional links with cyanobacteria due to the lack of reference genomes in this longitudinal study we collected 16 ca samples from lake taihu one of china s largest freshwater lakes from april 2015 to february 2016 and sequenced their v4 region of 16s rrna genes full metagenomes mg and metatranscriptomes mt the analysis of these data revealed the dynamics of microbial taxonomic and functional structure in cas influenced by both external environmental factors and internal metabolism 55 otus 456 genes and 37 transcripts showed significantly differential abundance across the early middle and late blooming stages anova test p 0 05 total nitrogen and total phosphorus were proved to be the most important environmental drivers of microbial taxonomic and functional variations in cas mantel s r 0 25 p 0 05 we constructed 161 high quality metagenome assembled genomes mags out of which 22 were cyanobacterial strains with diverse energy pathways transporters and prokaryotic defense systems based on these mags we constructed a cyanobacteria bacteria co nitrogen pathway and a cyanobacteria bacteria co phosphorus pathway by which we demonstrated how nitrogen and phosphorus influence the dynamics of the microbial structure to a certain extent by affecting these co pathways overall these results characterized the taxonomic functional and transcriptional variations of microbes in cas through different blooming stages genome assembly and metabolic analysis of

qiime quantitative insights into microbial ecology otus operational taxonomic units 1 introduction eutrophication has threatened freshwater lakes worldwide leading to cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms cyanohabs paerl et al 2014 paerl and huisman 2008 lake taihu is the third largest freshwater lake in china irrigating millions of hectares of grains and supplying drinking water for over 2 million citizens qin et al 2007 however since the beginning of the twentieth century cyanohabs have been a frequent occurrence in lake taihu and have accelerated in frequency and intensity during the last three decades due to excessive nutrient loadings qin et al 2007 wang and chen 2008 the blooming regions have recently spread from bays to the lake s center and the blooming time has also expanded to a longer period chen et al 2003 hai et al 2010 the threat of cyanohab in lake taihu has increased demands for more research to understand the underlying mechanisms and find effective treatment and prevention measures cyanobacterial aggregate ca the basic unit wherein cyanobacteria and bacteria coexist in close contact is the primary form of cyanobacteria during blooms as autotrophic organisms cyanobacteria provide food for their attached microbes by excreting rich extracellular organic matters and in return attached bacteria supply nitrogen phosphorous sulfur and trace elements to the cyanobacteria grant et al 2014 shi et al 2012 metagenomics studies focused on ca attached bacteria have brought important insights into ca s bacterial community structure with its seasonal variation and spatial distribution tang et al 2015 zhu et al 2019b one of the significant discoveries was the alternate succession of two cyanobacteria genera microcystis and dolichospermum in ca and the attached bacteria s change zhu et al 2019a however since many studies have shown the high functional redundancy of microbial communities across multiple environments we want to investigate whether the functional structure of the cas remains stable or alters greatly throughout the seasons additionally since many studies have suggested a mutualistic relationship between cyanobacteria and their attached bacteria shia et al 2010 wang et al 2015 xie et al 2016 zhao et al 2012 we want to investigate how such a relationship is established through gene expressions molecular pathways and their functional links to uncover these cellular and molecular mechanisms the assembly of reference genomes is critical in this study we performed a multi omic study of microbiomes on the ca communities during different cyanobacterial blooming stages we have collected 16 ca samples from lake taihu in cyanobacterial blooming early middle and late stages and then sequenced their 16s rrna genes metagenomes and metatranscriptomes forming a multi omic analysis in this report we were able to 1 reveal the variations of taxonomic functional and transcriptional compositions of cas along different blooming stages 2 detect the environmental drivers of microbial taxonomic and functional variations and 3 construct the metagenome assembled genomes and co metabolic pathways to reveal the functional links between cyanobacteria and their attached bacteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and remote sensing data from march 4 2015 to january 27 2016 a total 16 cas samples covering the yearly cycle of a cyanohab were collected from lake taihu these samples were collected using weekly time series when cyanohab occurred from four sampling sites shown in table s1 to extract cas samples water at 0 5 m depth was collected by using 5 l schindler sampler and then filtered by 40 μm pore size cell strainer bd falcon and processed according to the previous study zhu et al 2019a in brief the aggregates were collected by micropipetting into tubes after the samples were kept motionless until most cas had floated to the surface aggregates were then collected by micropipetting into tubes to remove free living bacteria the samples were treated according to a vortex and washing method which was proposed to analyze the attached microbial community on cyanobacterial aggregates cai et al 2013 a we adopted a vortex and washing method with new parameters which were validated by numerous experiments in order to remove as much free living bacteria as possible while maintaining cellular contents of cyanobacterial aggregates supplementary text we used a remote sensing method to monitor the cyanohabs in lake taihu to provide real time monitoring of the whole blooming area the remote sensing image data of lake taihu came from the modis sensor of nasa and were analyzed by envi environment for visualizing images version 4 2 kiage and walker 2009 we calculated the covering area of cyanobacteria in lake taihu and summarized the pattern of cyanobacteria bloom in a year besides eight physicochemical factors of the collected ca samples were measured and recorded they included total

wilmington de usa and 1 agarose gel electrophoresis age deben et al 2013 to examine the quality and quantity considering rrna accounting for more than 80 of the total rna content the ribo zero rrna removal kits illumina were used to remove most rrna and obtain ribo free mrna the extracted mrna was dissolved in rnase free water sigma mo we took culture independent multi omics approaches targeted 16s rrna gene sequencing 16s to determine the microbial community composition total metagenome sequencing mg to determine the phylogenetic and functional genes and total metatranscriptome sequencing mt to determine the activity of genes the library constructions for 16s mg and mt were shown in the supplementary text the 16s were sequenced on an illumina miseq pe250 sequencer at the beijing genomics institute shenzhen china bgi and data have been submitted to the sequence read archive bioproject accession number prjna664292 all qualified mg and mt libraries were loaded to illumina hiseq2500 to be sequenced and the clean sequences were deposited to the sequence read archive mg prjna664299 mt prjna664620 2 3 sequence data processing the raw data of 16s and mg sequences of cas were processed as previously described zhu et al 2019a and the detailed steps were shown in the supplementary text for the mt raw reads the quality control step used the same criteria as that of the metagenome sequencing data clean reads were then mapped to the rrna and silva database by using blastin to identify those rrna followed by perl script to separate the rrna from other rnas then filtered mrna reads were assembled into gene sequences by trinity grabherr et al 2011 haas et al 2013 using the default parameters followed by gene prediction and functional analysis as used in metagenomic data processing additionally we estimated gene activity by calculating the ratio of gene transcript abundance over gene sequence abundance annotated as mt mg hultman et al 2015 furthermore phosphate and nitrogen were thought to be the key nutrients responsible for cyanobacteria proliferation and blooming we used wilcoxon rank sum test to select differently abundant genes relative abundance ratios 2 2 4 genome recovering and co pathway constructing before binning bowtie2 quinlan and hall 2010 was used to align short read sequences to contigs options very fast and samtools li and et al 2009 was used to sort and convert sam files to bam format sorted bam files were then used to calculate the coverage of each contig in each metagenome sample then the contigs longer than 1 kbp were used with concoct version 0 4 1 alneberg et al 2014 to recover microbial population genomes based on conitg compositions and coverages across multiple samples finally we applied checkm version 1 0 6 parks et al 2015 to estimate the completeness and contamination for each bin the bins with high completeness 70 and few contaminants 10 were retained as metagenome assembled genomes mags then the drep rahman et al 2018 dereplication workflow was used to obtain non redundant consolidation with options dereplicate wf p 16 comp 70 con 10 str 100 strw 0 bin scores were calculated by completeness 0 5 contamination 0 5 log n50 and only the highest scoring mags from each cluster was retained in the dereplicated set for the non redundant mags we inferred the phylogenetic relationship using the bacterial core gene set that is defined by an up to date bacterial genome database by ubcg na et al 2018 the phylogenetic tree was drawn using evolview zhang et al 2012 we aligned all cleam reads to genes mags by bowtie2 and calculated the mag s abundance using bedtools version 2 26 quinlan and hall 2010 protein encoding genes were predicted with metaprodigal version 2 6 3 hyatt et al 2012 for each mag and searched against the ncbi bacterial archaeal and viral non redundant genome databases using diamon buchfink et al 2015 the functional analysis was conducted by mapping genes to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg kanehisa et al 2004 and seed overbeek et al 2005 to obtain the functional profiling of cas we used humann3 louca et al 2018 to quantify the gene and metabolic pathway contents contributed by known and uncharacterized community members especially for nitrogen and phosphorus pathways nitrogen and phosphorus were known as important environmental factors for cyanobacterial blooms sommer 1989 vézie et al 2002 bacteria in cas were found to be closely related to cyanobacterial composition described zhu et al 2019a suggesting that nitrogen and phosphorus cycles form important functional links between cyanobacteria and their attached bacteria to test this hypothesis we first identified the modules of nitrogen and phosphorus pathways appearing in cas and assigned the microbes participating in those modules according to the functional profiling results to construct the cyanobacteria bacteria co nitrogen pathway and co phosphorus pathway 2 5 comparative analysis between different blooming stages 2 5 1 sample grouping using real time remote sensing image data of lake taihu we calculated the maximum aggregation area of the cyanobacterial blooms and the frequency of cyanobacterial blooms per month data were missing for several samples because remote sensing data were not available during cloudy days we replaced it with the data of the closest day from the sampling time according to the remote sensing data lake taihu s blooming area dramatically increased in june and remained relatively steady until january to start decreasing table s1 the blooming area was very small 4 5 km2 in april and may and expanded dramatically 129 1 km2 in june and declined 1 70 km2 in january therefore the blooming cycle is divided into three stages the early blooming stage early stage from april to may the middle blooming stage mid stage from june to december and the late blooming stage late stage from january to february 2 5 2 statistic analyses considering the uneven sample numbers between different groups we randomly under sampled the mid stage to three samples the under sampling was repeated three times and the results were averaged differences in the relative abundance of otus genes and transcripts among the three stages were analyzed using stamp v 2 parks et al 2014 anova test and welch s t test were respectively used to compare among three groups and between two groups fdr was adjusted for multiple testing correction and the adjusted p vlaue 0 05 was used to indicate statistical significance for all statistic tests the taxa of differentially abundant otus were annotated with the greengene database while the functions of differentially abundant genes and transcripts were annotated with kegg alpha diversity shannon index values were computed and compared for the three stages to identify the environmental drivers of ca s taxonomic and functional variations independent of geographic distance we computed distance corrected correlations between the ca composition and the environmental factors by partial mantel test using the r package vegan with 9999 permutations we also calculated the spearman s rank correlation coefficients between the environmental variables and the top 30 otus genes and transcripts with the most significant differences among the three stages 3 results 3 1 data description we collected 16 cas from the northern bays of lake taihu from april 2015 to february 2016 during which cyanobacteria showed a full bloom cycle table 1 all samples underwent 16s rrna gene sequencing to detect bacterial community composition metagenome sequencing mg to detect functional potentials and metatranscriptome sequencing mt to detect community gene expression a total of 424 mb of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequence data were generated from illumina miseq sequencing and 122 gb of high quality mg sequence data and 160 gb of high quality mt sequence data were generated from illumina hiseq sequencing these are among the biggest dataset obtained for any ca studies so far these 16 ca samples spanned the three blooming stages three samples in the early stage 10 samples in the mid stage and three samples in late stage table s1 considering the sample size imbalance in three groups we corrected the sample size in all subsequent analyses 3 2 dynamics of microbial taxonomic and functional structure in cas the most abundant bacterial phyla found in the 16s data were members of cyanobacteria 47 6 5 8 s d proteobacteria 26 8 5 2 and bacteroidetes 20 8 5 6 similar distributions of these phyla were observed in the mg and mt datasets correlation coefficients r 0 659 for 16s and mg r 0 854 for mg and mt and r 0 907 for 16s and mt suggesting that the datasets were of excellent quality fig 1 a different alpha diversity values based on the otu abundance were calculated for the three stages with the early stage exhibiting the highest alpha diversity fig 1b the early stage and mid stage samples had similar 16s rrna operon copy numbers and total nitrogen levels in contrast the late stage samples had the lowest alpha diversity but the highest 16s rrna operon copy numbers and total nitrogen levels which are consistent with the resource copy number theory more resource more copy number lauro et al 2009 and the resource ratio theory more resource less diversity tilman 1982 when comparing the microbial compositions among the three stages 50 otus 456 genes and 37 transcripts showed significantly differential abundance among the three stages via anova test p 0 05 table s2 the annotation of these genes and transcripts using the kegg database showed that the microbial functions differences among the three stages were nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism and transporters fig 1c the annotation of these genes and transcripts with the seed database demonstrated the enrichment of abc transporter fatty acids alkyl phosphonate utilization and monosaccharides in early stage compared to those in the mid stage fig 1d photosynthesis related subsystems such as electron transport and photophosphorylation nad and nadp light harvesting complexes and tetrapyrroles were significantly enriched in the mid stage while the restriction modification system was significantly enriched in the late stage 3 3 environmental drivers of microbial taxonomic and functional variations to identify the geographically independent environmental drivers of ca composition we correlated the distance corrected dissimilarities of community compositions with that of the major environmental factors by partial mantel test fig s1 overall wt tn tp cod do and nh4 n were correlated with the otu abundance of cas mantel s r 0 25 p 0 05 tn tp and cod were correlated with the gene abundance of cas tn tp and do were correlated with the transcript abundance of cas we detected the environmental drivers that were correlated with the top 30 otus genes and transcripts that had the highest differential abundance among the three stages out of the top 30 otus 27 were significantly correlated adjusted p 0 05 with at least one out of the eight environmental variables and nearly half of the correlations 58 were positive fig 2 a it should be noted that 11 otus annotated to cytophagaceae were all positively correlated to tp and tn out of the top 30 genes 18 were significantly correlated adjusted p 0 05 with at least one out of the eight environmental variables and nearly all of the correlation coefficients 96 were positive fig 2b gene k02043 spearman s ρ 0 747 adjusted p 0 01 involved in phosphonate transport and gene k06269 spearman s ρ 0 679 adjusted p 0 01 involved in phosphatase biosynthesis were strongly correlated with tp out of the top 30 transcripts 14 were significantly correlated adjusted p 0 05 with at least one out of the eight environmental variables and nearly all of the correlations 95 were positive fig 2c several subunit ribosomal protein related genes k02866 k02938 k02297 and k02921 were strongly correlated adjusted p 0 01 with tn these results indicate that the taxonomic and functional structure of ca bacterial communities were significantly influenced by tn and tp 3 4 metagenome assembled genomes mags and cyanobacterial strains we generated 233 metagenome assembled genomes mags with 60 completeness and 10 contamination and out of them 161 were high quality draft genomes with 70 completeness and 5 contamination bowers et al 2017 de replicating highly similar mags based on fastani values of 97 resulted in consolidating 78 non redundant mags and their phylogenetic tree fig 3 a their completeness contamination length taxonomic annotation and relative abundance were shown in table s3 using a cut off of 1 coverage 72 mags were present in more than one samples and 26 mags were present in more than eight samples 19 mags showed significantly differential relative abundance among the three stages anova test p 0 01 fig s2 the most abundant mag was 151 222 71 fa and its constructed metabolic pathways were shown in fig 3b it has various energy metabolism systems including the nitrogen metabolism transferring nitrate to ammonia the sulfur metabolism transferring thiosulfate to sulfate the fatty acid metabolism transferring acetyl coa to palmitic acid and the oxidative phosphorylation pathway releasing energy supply adp and inorganic phosphoric acid to synthesize atp through the respiratory chain it has rich transporters of ammonia phosphate amino acid peptide sugar and several metallic elements such as iron nickel cobalt and magnesium it also has the flagellar biosynthesis pathway to synthesize flagellar to improve movement in viscous environments twenty two high quality cyanobacterial mags were constructed from the binning analysis a phylogenetic tree based on a bacterial core gene set was constructed for these genomes alongside public cyanobacterial genomes from ncbi fig s3 these twenty two cyanobacterial mags could be divided into three groups in the phylogenetic tree group 1 consisting of 2 mags is close to microcystis aeruginosa with the center genome mag 150 402 41 fa that is similar to microcystis aeruginosa nies 88 dna dna hybridization ddh meierkolthoff et al 2013 12 9 2 7 group 2 is close to dolichospermum flos aquae with the center mag 150 608 59 fa similar to dolichospermum flos aquae chab 1629 ddh 18 4 2 4 group 3 is similar to pseudanabaena yagii with the center mag 150 514 75 fa similar to pseudanabaena yagii gihe nhr1 ddh 17 1 3 3 although the two cyanobacterial strains in group 1 150 402 41 fa and 160 119 54 fa are close to one another in the phylogenetic tree their metabolisms are quite different especially on the energy pathways nitrogen metabolism sulfur metabolism and photosynthesis membrane transport and prokaryotic defense system fig 4 they both have the modules of m00145 nad p h quinone oxidoredfuctase chloroplasts and cyanobacteria m00163 photosystem i m00161 photosystem ii and m00616 sulfate sulfur assimilation however 150 402 41 fa has extra sulfur metabolic modules m00596 dissimilatory sulfate reduction m00176 assimilatory sulfate reduction and 160 119 54 fa has extra nitrogen metabolic modules m00531 assimilatory nitrate reduction m00615 nitrate assimilation the energy pathways in group 2 and group 3 were less diverse than those in group 1 fig s4 all of the three groups have prokaryotic defense system and cluster 4 has three crisp associated proteins csm1 cmr3 and cmr4 besides three cyanobacterial mags groups have dramatically different transporters fig 4 and fig s4 3 5 nitrogen and phosphorus drive the microbial dynamics by co pathways nitrogen and phosphate were closely related to microbial taxonomic and functional variations the genes in phosphate and nitrogen metabolic pathways were observed in both mg and mt data from all three stages with the highest abundance in the mid stage fig s5 to investigate which microbes contain those genes we performed functional profiling of cas to capture the bacteria that participate in the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles we found 18 species participating in the nitrogen cycle forming a complex co pathway fig 5 and table s4 first except for bosea sp rac05 and bosea vaviloviae mainly cyanobacterial species transport the extracellular nitrite and nitrate into cells in the early stage it was gene k15577 from the two bosea species involved in nitrite and nitrate transport in the mid stage it was gene k15578 from four microcystis species involved in nitrite and nitrate transport and in the late stage it was gene k15576 from dolichospermum compactum and aphanizomenon flos aquae involved in nitrite and nitrate transport many species then participate in dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium dnra including two bosea species three aeromonas species and one betaproteobacterium species besides dolichospermum compactum and two proteobacteria species sulfuricurvum sp pd mw2 and aphanizomenon flos aquae can converse atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia by nitrogen fixation finally cyanobacteria and their attached bacteria are both involved in the utilization of ammonium these results suggested that cyanobacteria and their attached bacteria formed a nitrogen cycling co pathway as their functional links the same conclusion was found in the phosphorus cycle fig s6 in different stages different species participated in the phosphate pathways more specifically cyanobacteria microcystis aphanizomenon and dolichospermum species were major contributors to the phosphorous metabolic pathways besides sandarakinorhabdus cyanobacterium betaproteobacterium aap51 porphyrobacter sp th134 and phenylobacterium sp hyn0004 also participated in forming the phosphorous cycling co pathway as their functional links to cyanobacteria 4 discussion 4 1 significantly changed taxonomy and function in cas seasonal dynamics of microbial communities is apparent including the succession of dominant cyanobacterial genera niu et al 2011 tan et al 2009 ye et al 2011 and the variation of attached bacteria cai et al 2013 niu et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 in our results four otus of dolichospermum were enriched in early stage and late stage while microcystis was enriched in mid stage demonstrating the alternate succession of dominant cyanobacterial genera fifty cyanobacteria attached otus also shifted in relative abundance and 16 of them were cytophagaceae which are heterotrophic and can digest macromolecules such as polysaccharides or proteins secreted by cyanobacterial cells mcbride et al 2014 the transcripts related to photosystems and subunit ribosomal proteins shifted in relative abundance among the three stages photosystems are related to longer day time and the subunit ribosomal proteins are related to translations a higher abundance indicating more proteins being produced more biomass and faster growth grant et al 2014 the protein secretion system and abc transporter were significantly enriched in the early stage which means that there is a frequent exchange of substances and signal transduction between microbes in the early stage photosynthesis related subsystems were significantly enriched in the mid stage which most likely was resulted from the mass propagation and fast growth of the cyanobacteria during heavy blooming in the mid stage the mid stage exhibited both more genes and transcripts than the other two stages showing more functional diversity in order to adapt to the heavy cyanobacterial bloom 4 2 cyanobacterial energy pathways and transporters showed high diversity cyanobacterial mags can be divided into three groups in the phylogenetic tree two cyanobacterial strains in group 1 both are annotated as microcystis species but their metabolisms are quite different the varied metabolisms of microcystis species were resulted from the dynamic genotype and phenotype of microcystis which are evident in the high abundance of insertion sequences transposable elements restriction enzymes and genes likely acquired through lateral transfer takakazu et al 2008 group 2 close to dolichospermum can transport vitamin b12 which verifies the hypothesis that cyanobacteria obtain vitamins from synthesizing bacteria associated with them and that the heterotrophic bacteria were awarded photosynthate in return karl 2002 group 3 close to pseudanabaena has three crispr associated proteins csm1 cmr3 and cmr4 our results verify that the photosynthetic cyanobacteria lack homologs to those cas proteins commonly associated with the cascade complex in bacteria but instead possess cmr proteins scholz et al 2013 additionally the most abundant mag 151 222 71 fa can synthesize flagella and mass of transporters and has the energy pathways of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur flagella can help it move in the viscous aggregates formed by extracellular polysaccharides of cyanobacteria rich transporters allow it to exchange nutrients and organic matters with cyanobacteria it can transport several metallic elements signifying the importance of trace metal elements on the growth and proliferation bbosa and oyoo 2013 moreover it has the nitrogen metabolism transferring nitrate to ammonia the sulfur metabolism transferring thiosulfate to sulfate the fatty acid metabolism transferring acetyl coa to palmitic acid and the oxidative phosphorylation pathway releasing energy supplies adp and inorganic phosphoric acid to synthesize atp through the respiratory chain this finding proved that the bacteira close attaching to cyanobacterial cell is often highly evolved wagner döbler et al 2010 4 3 microbes participate in nitrogen and phosphorus co pathways multiple cyanobacteria species and their attached bacteria participated in the nitrogen cycling co pathway and phosphorus cycling co pathway these functional links may explain the microbial taxonomic and functional dynamics driven by nitrogen and phosphorus microcystis and dolichospermum transport the extracellular nitrite and nitrate into cells respectively in the mid stage and late stage with different genes based on the functional profiling besides in late stage dolichospermum uptake nitrogen and fix into ammonia the variation of total nitrogen in the lake may lead to the succession of the dominant cyanobacterial genus to a certain extent because their abilities to absorb and utilize nitrogen were different except for dolichospermum aphanizomenon also showed a relative high abundance in late stage as nitrogen fixation cyanobacteria genera adam et al 2015 in the late stage a large proportion of ammonia may be released into the cyanobacterial aggregates by these two genera providing an essential source of biologically available nitrogen to the ecosystem and explaining the high measurements of total nitrogen besides aphanizomenon becomes an abundant bacteria because of its ability to induce phosphate limitation in other phytoplankton while also increasing phosphate availability through the release of cylindrospermopsin bar yosef et al 2010 in early stage comamonadaceae willems was detected in the phosphorus cycling pathway pentose phosphate pathway and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide phosphorylation comamonadaceae are aerobic and harbor a remarkable phenotypic diversity that includes anaerobic denitrifies photoautotrophic and photoheterotrophic bacteria willem 1991 5 conclusions the dynamics of microbial taxonomic and functional structure in cas along different blooming stages show microbes responses to algal blooms nitrogen and phosphorus drive those dynamics by affecting the co nitrogen pathway and co phosphorus pathway which are functional links between cyanobacteria and their closely attached bacteria genome construction and metabolic analysis of cyanobacteria and their attached bacteria suggested the material exchange and signal transmission among them providing biological clues potentially leading to the control of blooms by interventional strategies to disrupt the expression of critical microbe credit authorship

17071,freshwater lakes are threatened by harmful cyanobacterial blooms whose basic unit is cyanobacterial aggregate ca ca attached bacteria play a significant role through different blooming stages with substantial variation of their taxonomic structure however little is known about their functional variations and functional links with cyanobacteria due to the lack of reference genomes in this longitudinal study we collected 16 ca samples from lake taihu one of china s largest freshwater lakes from april 2015 to february 2016 and sequenced their v4 region of 16s rrna genes full metagenomes mg and metatranscriptomes mt the analysis of these data revealed the dynamics of microbial taxonomic and functional structure in cas influenced by both external environmental factors and internal metabolism 55 otus 456 genes and 37 transcripts showed significantly differential abundance across the early middle and late blooming stages anova test p 0 05 total nitrogen and total phosphorus were proved to be the most important environmental drivers of microbial taxonomic and functional variations in cas mantel s r 0 25 p 0 05 we constructed 161 high quality metagenome assembled genomes mags out of which 22 were cyanobacterial strains with diverse energy pathways transporters and prokaryotic defense systems based on these mags we constructed a cyanobacteria bacteria co nitrogen pathway and a cyanobacteria bacteria co phosphorus pathway by which we demonstrated how nitrogen and phosphorus influence the dynamics of the microbial structure to a certain extent by affecting these co pathways overall these results characterized the taxonomic functional and transcriptional variations of microbes in cas through different blooming stages genome assembly and metabolic analysis of cyanobacteria and their attached bacteria suggested that the material exchange and signal transduction do indeed exist among them our understanding of the underlying molecular pathways for

qiime quantitative insights into microbial ecology otus operational taxonomic units 1 introduction eutrophication has threatened freshwater lakes worldwide leading to cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms cyanohabs paerl et al 2014 paerl and huisman 2008 lake taihu is the third largest freshwater lake in china irrigating millions of hectares of grains and supplying drinking water for over 2 million citizens qin et al 2007 however since the beginning of the twentieth century cyanohabs have been a frequent occurrence in lake taihu and have accelerated in frequency and intensity during the last three decades due to excessive nutrient loadings qin et al 2007 wang and chen 2008 the blooming regions have recently spread from bays to the lake s center and the blooming time has also expanded to a longer period chen et al 2003 hai et al 2010 the threat of cyanohab in lake taihu has increased demands for more research to understand the underlying mechanisms and find effective treatment and prevention measures cyanobacterial aggregate ca the basic unit wherein cyanobacteria and bacteria coexist in close contact is the primary form of cyanobacteria during blooms as autotrophic organisms cyanobacteria provide food for their attached microbes by excreting rich extracellular organic matters and in return attached bacteria supply nitrogen phosphorous sulfur and trace elements to the cyanobacteria grant et al 2014 shi et al 2012 metagenomics studies focused on ca attached bacteria have brought important insights into ca s bacterial community structure with its seasonal variation and spatial distribution tang et al 2015 zhu et al 2019b one of the significant discoveries was the alternate succession of two cyanobacteria genera microcystis and dolichospermum in ca and the attached bacteria s change zhu et al 2019a however since many studies have shown the high functional redundancy of microbial communities across multiple environments we want to investigate whether the functional structure of the cas remains stable or alters greatly throughout the seasons additionally since many studies have suggested a mutualistic relationship between cyanobacteria and their attached bacteria shia et al 2010 wang et al 2015 xie et al 2016 zhao et al 2012 we want to investigate how such a relationship is established through gene expressions molecular pathways and their functional links to uncover these cellular and molecular mechanisms the assembly of reference genomes is critical in this study we performed a multi omic study of microbiomes on the ca communities during different cyanobacterial blooming stages we have collected 16 ca samples from lake taihu in cyanobacterial blooming early middle and late stages and then sequenced their 16s rrna genes metagenomes and metatranscriptomes forming a multi omic analysis in this report we were able to 1 reveal the variations of taxonomic functional and transcriptional compositions of cas along different blooming stages 2 detect the environmental drivers of microbial taxonomic and functional variations and 3 construct the metagenome assembled genomes and co metabolic pathways to reveal the functional links between cyanobacteria and their attached bacteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and remote sensing data from march 4 2015 to january 27 2016 a total 16 cas samples covering the yearly cycle of a cyanohab were collected from lake taihu these samples were collected using weekly time series when cyanohab occurred from four sampling sites shown in table s1 to extract cas samples water at 0 5 m depth was collected by using 5 l schindler sampler and then filtered by 40 μm pore size cell strainer bd falcon and processed according to the previous study zhu et al 2019a in brief the aggregates were collected by micropipetting into tubes after the samples were kept motionless until most cas had floated to the surface aggregates were then collected by micropipetting into tubes to remove free living bacteria the samples were treated according to a vortex and washing method which was proposed to analyze the attached microbial community on cyanobacterial aggregates cai et al 2013 a we adopted a vortex and washing method with new parameters which were validated by numerous experiments in order to remove as much free living bacteria as possible while maintaining cellular contents of cyanobacterial aggregates supplementary text we used a remote sensing method to monitor the cyanohabs in lake taihu to provide real time monitoring of the whole blooming area the remote sensing image data of lake taihu came from the modis sensor of nasa and were analyzed by envi environment for visualizing images version 4 2 kiage and walker 2009 we calculated the covering area of cyanobacteria in lake taihu and summarized the pattern of cyanobacteria bloom in a year besides eight physicochemical factors of the collected ca samples were measured and recorded they included total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ammonium nh4 n biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod wei fs 2002 water temperature wt ph and dissolved oxygen do the wt ph and do were measured with a ysi 6600 multi parameter water quality sonde ding and zhang 2011 2 2 dna extraction and mrna extraction for sequencing a unified protocol zhu et al 2019a was performed to extract dnas supplementary text to extract mrnas from cas the collected samples were immediately placed in trizol reagent ambion foster city ca usa adding 1 ml trizol reagent per 50 100 mg of the sample to prevent rna degradation and the samples were stored at 80 c until extraction total rna was extracted according to the manufacturer s protocol followed by nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies wilmington de usa and 1 agarose gel electrophoresis age deben et al 2013 to examine the quality and quantity considering rrna accounting for more than 80 of the total rna content the ribo zero rrna removal kits illumina were used to remove most rrna and obtain ribo free mrna the extracted mrna was dissolved in rnase free water sigma mo we took culture independent multi omics approaches targeted 16s rrna gene sequencing 16s to determine the microbial community composition total metagenome sequencing mg to determine the phylogenetic and functional genes and total metatranscriptome sequencing mt to determine the activity of genes the library constructions for 16s mg and mt were shown in the supplementary text the 16s were sequenced on an illumina miseq pe250 sequencer at the beijing genomics institute shenzhen china bgi and data have been submitted to the sequence read archive bioproject accession number prjna664292 all qualified mg and mt libraries were loaded to illumina hiseq2500 to be sequenced and the clean sequences were deposited to the sequence read archive mg prjna664299 mt prjna664620 2 3 sequence data processing the raw data of 16s and mg sequences of cas were processed as previously described zhu et al 2019a and the detailed steps were shown in the supplementary text for the mt raw reads the quality control step used the same criteria as that of the metagenome sequencing data clean reads were then mapped to the rrna and silva database by using blastin to identify those rrna followed by perl script to separate the rrna from other rnas then filtered mrna reads were assembled into gene sequences by trinity grabherr et al 2011 haas et al 2013 using the default parameters followed by gene prediction and functional analysis as used in metagenomic data processing additionally we estimated gene activity by calculating the ratio of gene transcript abundance over gene sequence abundance annotated as mt mg hultman et al 2015 furthermore phosphate and nitrogen were thought to be the key nutrients responsible for cyanobacteria proliferation and blooming we used wilcoxon rank sum test to select differently abundant genes relative abundance ratios 2 2 4 genome recovering and co pathway constructing before binning bowtie2 quinlan and hall 2010 was used to align short read sequences to contigs options very fast and samtools li and et al 2009 was used to sort and convert sam files to bam format sorted bam files were then used to calculate the coverage of each contig in each metagenome sample then the contigs longer than 1 kbp were used with concoct version 0 4 1 alneberg et al 2014 to recover microbial population genomes based on conitg compositions and coverages across multiple samples finally we applied checkm version 1 0 6 parks et al 2015 to estimate the completeness and contamination for each bin the bins with high completeness 70 and few contaminants 10 were retained as metagenome assembled genomes mags then the drep rahman et al 2018 dereplication workflow was used to obtain non redundant consolidation with options dereplicate wf p 16 comp 70 con 10 str 100 strw 0 bin scores were calculated by completeness 0 5 contamination 0 5 log n50 and only the highest scoring mags from each cluster was retained in the dereplicated set for the non redundant mags we inferred the phylogenetic relationship using the bacterial core gene set that is defined by an up to date bacterial genome database by ubcg na et al 2018 the phylogenetic tree was drawn using evolview zhang et al 2012 we aligned all cleam reads to genes mags by bowtie2 and calculated the mag s abundance using bedtools version 2 26 quinlan and hall 2010 protein encoding genes were predicted with metaprodigal version 2 6 3 hyatt et al 2012 for each mag and searched against the ncbi bacterial archaeal and viral non redundant genome databases using diamon buchfink et al 2015 the functional analysis was conducted by mapping genes to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg kanehisa et al 2004 and seed overbeek et al 2005 to obtain the functional profiling of cas we used humann3 louca et al 2018 to quantify the gene and metabolic pathway contents contributed by known and uncharacterized community members especially for nitrogen and phosphorus pathways nitrogen and phosphorus were known as important environmental factors for cyanobacterial blooms sommer 1989 vézie et al 2002 bacteria in cas were found to be closely related to cyanobacterial composition described zhu et al 2019a suggesting that nitrogen and phosphorus cycles form important functional links between cyanobacteria and their attached bacteria to test this hypothesis we first identified the modules of nitrogen and phosphorus pathways appearing in cas and assigned the microbes participating in those modules according to the functional profiling results to construct the cyanobacteria bacteria co nitrogen pathway and co phosphorus pathway 2 5 comparative analysis between different blooming stages 2 5 1 sample grouping using real time remote sensing image data of lake taihu we calculated the maximum aggregation area of the cyanobacterial blooms and the frequency of cyanobacterial blooms per month data were missing for several samples because remote sensing data were not available during cloudy days we replaced it with the data of the closest day from the sampling time according to the remote sensing data lake taihu s blooming area dramatically increased in june and remained relatively steady until january to start decreasing table s1 the blooming area was very small 4 5 km2 in april and may and expanded dramatically 129 1 km2 in june and declined 1 70 km2 in january therefore the blooming cycle is divided into three stages the early blooming stage early stage from april to may the middle blooming stage mid stage from june to december and the late blooming stage late stage from january to february 2 5 2 statistic analyses considering the uneven sample numbers between different groups we randomly under sampled the mid stage to three samples the under sampling was repeated three times and the results were averaged differences in the relative abundance of otus genes and transcripts among the three stages were analyzed using stamp v 2 parks et al 2014 anova test and welch s t test were respectively used to compare among three groups and between two groups fdr was adjusted for multiple testing correction and the adjusted p vlaue 0 05 was used to indicate statistical significance for all statistic tests the taxa of differentially abundant otus were annotated with the greengene database while the functions of differentially abundant genes and transcripts were annotated with kegg alpha diversity shannon index values were computed and compared for the three stages to identify the environmental drivers of ca s taxonomic and functional variations independent of geographic distance we computed distance corrected correlations between the ca composition and the environmental factors by partial mantel test using the r package vegan with 9999 permutations we also calculated the spearman s rank correlation coefficients between the environmental variables and the top 30 otus genes and transcripts with the most significant differences among the three stages 3 results 3 1 data description we collected 16 cas from the northern bays of lake taihu from april 2015 to february 2016 during which cyanobacteria showed a full bloom cycle table 1 all samples underwent 16s rrna gene sequencing to detect bacterial community composition metagenome sequencing mg to detect functional potentials and metatranscriptome sequencing mt to detect community gene expression a total of 424 mb of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequence data were generated from illumina miseq sequencing and 122 gb of high quality mg sequence data and 160 gb of high quality mt sequence data were generated from illumina hiseq sequencing these are among the biggest dataset obtained for any ca studies so far these 16 ca samples spanned the three blooming stages three samples in the early stage 10 samples in the mid stage and three samples in late stage table s1 considering the sample size imbalance in three groups we corrected the sample size in all subsequent analyses 3 2 dynamics of microbial taxonomic and functional structure in cas the most abundant bacterial phyla found in the 16s data were members of cyanobacteria 47 6 5 8 s d proteobacteria 26 8 5 2 and bacteroidetes 20 8 5 6 similar distributions of these phyla were observed in the mg and mt datasets correlation coefficients r 0 659 for 16s and mg r 0 854 for mg and mt and r 0 907 for 16s and mt suggesting that the datasets were of excellent quality fig 1 a different alpha diversity values based on the otu abundance were calculated for the three stages with the early stage exhibiting the highest alpha diversity fig 1b the early stage and mid stage samples had similar 16s rrna operon copy numbers and total nitrogen levels in contrast the late stage samples had the lowest alpha diversity but the highest 16s rrna operon copy numbers and total nitrogen levels which are consistent with the resource copy number theory more resource more copy number lauro et al 2009 and the resource ratio theory more resource less diversity tilman 1982 when comparing the microbial compositions among the three stages 50 otus 456 genes and 37 transcripts showed significantly differential abundance among the three stages via anova test p 0 05 table s2 the annotation of these genes and transcripts using the kegg database showed that the microbial functions differences among the three stages were nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism and transporters fig 1c the annotation of these genes and transcripts with the seed database demonstrated the enrichment of abc transporter fatty acids alkyl phosphonate utilization and monosaccharides in early stage compared to those in the mid stage fig 1d photosynthesis related subsystems such as electron transport and photophosphorylation nad and nadp light harvesting complexes and tetrapyrroles were significantly enriched in the mid stage while the restriction modification system was significantly enriched in the late stage 3 3 environmental drivers of microbial taxonomic and functional variations to identify the geographically independent environmental drivers of ca composition we correlated the distance corrected dissimilarities of community compositions with that of the major environmental factors by partial mantel test fig s1 overall wt tn tp cod do and nh4 n were correlated with the otu abundance of cas mantel s r 0 25 p 0 05 tn tp and cod were correlated with the gene abundance of cas tn tp and do were correlated with the transcript abundance of cas we detected the environmental drivers that were correlated with the top 30 otus genes and transcripts that had the highest differential abundance among the three stages out of the top 30 otus 27 were significantly correlated adjusted p 0 05 with at least one out of the eight environmental variables and nearly half of the correlations 58 were positive fig 2 a it should be noted that 11 otus annotated to cytophagaceae were all positively correlated to tp and tn out of the top 30 genes 18 were significantly correlated adjusted p 0 05 with at least one out of the eight environmental variables and nearly all of the correlation coefficients 96 were positive fig 2b gene k02043 spearman s ρ 0 747 adjusted p 0 01 involved in phosphonate transport and gene k06269 spearman s ρ 0 679 adjusted p 0 01 involved in phosphatase biosynthesis were strongly correlated with tp out of the top 30 transcripts 14 were significantly correlated adjusted p 0 05 with at least one out of the eight environmental variables and nearly all of the correlations 95 were positive fig 2c several subunit ribosomal protein related genes k02866 k02938 k02297 and k02921 were strongly correlated adjusted p 0 01 with tn these results indicate that the taxonomic and functional structure of ca bacterial communities were significantly influenced by tn and tp 3 4 metagenome assembled genomes mags and cyanobacterial strains we generated 233 metagenome assembled genomes mags with 60 completeness and 10 contamination and out of them 161 were high quality draft genomes with 70 completeness and 5 contamination bowers et al 2017 de replicating highly similar mags based on fastani values of 97 resulted in consolidating 78 non redundant mags and their phylogenetic tree fig 3 a their completeness contamination length taxonomic annotation and relative abundance were shown in table s3 using a cut off of 1 coverage 72 mags were present in more than one samples and 26 mags were present in more than eight samples 19 mags showed significantly differential relative abundance among the three stages anova test p 0 01 fig s2 the most abundant mag was 151 222 71 fa and its constructed metabolic pathways were shown in fig 3b it has various energy metabolism systems including the nitrogen metabolism transferring nitrate to ammonia the sulfur metabolism transferring thiosulfate to sulfate the fatty acid metabolism transferring acetyl coa to palmitic acid and the oxidative phosphorylation pathway releasing energy supply adp and inorganic phosphoric acid to synthesize atp through the respiratory chain it has rich transporters of ammonia phosphate amino acid peptide sugar and several metallic elements such as iron nickel cobalt and magnesium it also has the flagellar biosynthesis pathway to synthesize flagellar to improve movement in viscous environments twenty two high quality cyanobacterial mags were constructed from the binning analysis a phylogenetic tree based on a bacterial core gene set was constructed for these genomes alongside public cyanobacterial genomes from ncbi fig s3 these twenty two cyanobacterial mags could be divided into three groups in the phylogenetic tree group 1 consisting of 2 mags is close to microcystis aeruginosa with the center genome mag 150 402 41 fa that is similar to microcystis aeruginosa nies 88 dna dna hybridization ddh meierkolthoff et al 2013 12 9 2 7 group 2 is close to dolichospermum flos aquae with the center mag 150 608 59 fa similar to dolichospermum flos aquae chab 1629 ddh 18 4 2 4 group 3 is similar to pseudanabaena yagii with the center mag 150 514 75 fa similar to pseudanabaena yagii gihe nhr1 ddh 17 1 3 3 although the two cyanobacterial strains in group 1 150 402 41 fa and 160 119 54 fa are close to one another in the phylogenetic tree their metabolisms are quite different especially on the energy pathways nitrogen metabolism sulfur metabolism and photosynthesis membrane transport and prokaryotic defense system fig 4 they both have the modules of m00145 nad p h quinone oxidoredfuctase chloroplasts and cyanobacteria m00163 photosystem i m00161 photosystem ii and m00616 sulfate sulfur assimilation however 150 402 41 fa has extra sulfur metabolic modules m00596 dissimilatory sulfate reduction m00176 assimilatory sulfate reduction and 160 119 54 fa has extra nitrogen metabolic modules m00531 assimilatory nitrate reduction m00615 nitrate assimilation the energy pathways in group 2 and group 3 were less diverse than those in group 1 fig s4 all of the three groups have prokaryotic defense system and cluster 4 has three crisp associated proteins csm1 cmr3 and cmr4 besides three cyanobacterial mags groups have dramatically different transporters fig 4 and fig s4 3 5 nitrogen and phosphorus drive the microbial dynamics by co pathways nitrogen and phosphate were closely related to microbial taxonomic and functional variations the genes in phosphate and nitrogen metabolic pathways were observed in both mg and mt data from all three stages with the highest abundance in the mid stage fig s5 to investigate which microbes contain those genes we performed functional profiling of cas to capture the bacteria that participate in the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles we found 18 species participating in the nitrogen cycle forming a complex co pathway fig 5 and table s4 first except for bosea sp rac05 and bosea vaviloviae mainly cyanobacterial species transport the extracellular nitrite and nitrate into cells in the early stage it was gene k15577 from the two bosea species involved in nitrite and nitrate transport in the mid stage it was gene k15578 from four microcystis species involved in nitrite and nitrate transport and in the late stage it was gene k15576 from dolichospermum compactum and aphanizomenon flos aquae involved in nitrite and nitrate transport many species then participate in dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium dnra including two bosea species three aeromonas species and one betaproteobacterium species besides dolichospermum compactum and two proteobacteria species sulfuricurvum sp pd mw2 and aphanizomenon flos aquae can converse atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia by nitrogen fixation finally cyanobacteria and their attached bacteria are both involved in the utilization of ammonium these results suggested that cyanobacteria and their attached bacteria formed a nitrogen cycling co pathway as their functional links the same conclusion was found in the phosphorus cycle fig s6 in different stages different species participated in the phosphate pathways more specifically cyanobacteria microcystis aphanizomenon and dolichospermum species were major contributors to the phosphorous metabolic pathways besides sandarakinorhabdus cyanobacterium betaproteobacterium aap51 porphyrobacter sp th134 and phenylobacterium sp hyn0004 also participated in forming the phosphorous cycling co pathway as their functional links to cyanobacteria 4 discussion 4 1 significantly changed taxonomy and function in cas seasonal dynamics of microbial communities is apparent including the succession of dominant cyanobacterial genera niu et al 2011 tan et al 2009 ye et al 2011 and the variation of attached bacteria cai et al 2013 niu et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 in our results four otus of dolichospermum were enriched in early stage and late stage while microcystis was enriched in mid stage demonstrating the alternate succession of dominant cyanobacterial genera fifty cyanobacteria attached otus also shifted in relative abundance and 16 of them were cytophagaceae which are heterotrophic and can digest macromolecules such as polysaccharides or proteins secreted by cyanobacterial cells mcbride et al 2014 the transcripts related to photosystems and subunit ribosomal proteins shifted in relative abundance among the three stages photosystems are related to longer day time and the subunit ribosomal proteins are related to translations a higher abundance indicating more proteins being produced more biomass and faster growth grant et al 2014 the protein secretion system and abc transporter were significantly enriched in the early stage which means that there is a frequent exchange of substances and signal transduction between microbes in the early stage photosynthesis related subsystems were significantly enriched in the mid stage which most likely was resulted from the mass propagation and fast growth of the cyanobacteria during heavy blooming in the mid stage the mid stage exhibited both more genes and transcripts than the other two stages showing more functional diversity in order to adapt to the heavy cyanobacterial bloom 4 2 cyanobacterial energy pathways and transporters showed high diversity cyanobacterial mags can be divided into three groups in the phylogenetic tree two cyanobacterial strains in group 1 both are annotated as microcystis species but their metabolisms are quite different the varied metabolisms of microcystis species were resulted from the dynamic genotype and phenotype of microcystis which are evident in the high abundance of insertion sequences transposable elements restriction enzymes and genes likely acquired through lateral transfer takakazu et al 2008 group 2 close to dolichospermum can transport vitamin b12 which verifies the hypothesis that cyanobacteria obtain vitamins from synthesizing bacteria associated with them and that the heterotrophic bacteria were awarded photosynthate in return karl 2002 group 3 close to pseudanabaena has three crispr associated proteins csm1 cmr3 and cmr4 our results verify that the photosynthetic cyanobacteria lack homologs to those cas proteins commonly associated with the cascade complex in bacteria but instead possess cmr proteins scholz et al 2013 additionally the most abundant mag 151 222 71 fa can synthesize flagella and mass of transporters and has the energy pathways of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur flagella can help it move in the viscous aggregates formed by extracellular polysaccharides of cyanobacteria rich transporters allow it to exchange nutrients and organic matters with cyanobacteria it can transport several metallic elements signifying the importance of trace metal elements on the growth and proliferation bbosa and oyoo 2013 moreover it has the nitrogen metabolism transferring nitrate to ammonia the sulfur metabolism transferring thiosulfate to sulfate the fatty acid metabolism transferring acetyl coa to palmitic acid and the oxidative phosphorylation pathway releasing energy supplies adp and inorganic phosphoric acid to synthesize atp through the respiratory chain this finding proved that the bacteira close attaching to cyanobacterial cell is often highly evolved wagner döbler et al 2010 4 3 microbes participate in nitrogen and phosphorus co pathways multiple cyanobacteria species and their attached bacteria participated in the nitrogen cycling co pathway and phosphorus cycling co pathway these functional links may explain the microbial taxonomic and functional dynamics driven by nitrogen and phosphorus microcystis and dolichospermum transport the extracellular nitrite and nitrate into cells respectively in the mid stage and late stage with different genes based on the functional profiling besides in late stage dolichospermum uptake nitrogen and fix into ammonia the variation of total nitrogen in the lake may lead to the succession of the dominant cyanobacterial genus to a certain extent because their abilities to absorb and utilize nitrogen were different except for dolichospermum aphanizomenon also showed a relative high abundance in late stage as nitrogen fixation cyanobacteria genera adam et al 2015 in the late stage a large proportion of ammonia may be released into the cyanobacterial aggregates by these two genera providing an essential source of biologically available nitrogen to the ecosystem and explaining the high measurements of total nitrogen besides aphanizomenon becomes an abundant bacteria because of its ability to induce phosphate limitation in other phytoplankton while also increasing phosphate availability through the release of cylindrospermopsin bar yosef et al 2010 in early stage comamonadaceae willems was detected in the phosphorus cycling pathway pentose phosphate pathway and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide phosphorylation comamonadaceae are aerobic and harbor a remarkable phenotypic diversity that includes anaerobic denitrifies photoautotrophic and photoheterotrophic bacteria willem 1991 5 conclusions the dynamics of microbial taxonomic and functional structure in cas along different blooming stages show microbes responses to algal blooms nitrogen and phosphorus drive those dynamics by affecting the co nitrogen pathway and co phosphorus pathway which are functional links between cyanobacteria and their closely attached bacteria genome construction and metabolic analysis of cyanobacteria and their attached bacteria suggested the material exchange and signal transmission among them providing biological clues potentially leading to the control of blooms by interventional strategies to disrupt the expression of critical microbe credit authorship

17072,harmful cyanobacterial blooms which frequently contain toxic secondary metabolites are reported in aquatic environments around the world more than two thousand cyanobacterial secondary metabolites have been reported from diverse sources over the past fifty years a comprehensive publically accessible database detailing these secondary metabolites would facilitate research into their occurrence functions and toxicological risks to address this need we created cyanometdb a highly curated flat file openly accessible database of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites collated from 850 peer reviewed articles published between 1967 and 2020 cyanometdb contains 2010 cyanobacterial metabolites and 99 structurally related compounds this has nearly doubled the number of entries with complete literature metadata and structural composition information compared to previously available open access databases the dataset includes microcytsins cyanopeptolins other depsipeptides anabaenopeptins microginins aeruginosins cyclamides cryptophycins saxitoxins spumigins microviridins and anatoxins among other metabolite classes a comprehensive database dedicated to cyanobacterial secondary metabolites facilitates 1 the detection and dereplication of known cyanobacterial toxins and secondary metabolites 2 the identification of novel natural products from cyanobacteria 3 research on biosynthesis of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites including substructure searches and 4 the investigation of their abundance persistence and toxicity in natural environments keywords cyanobacteria secondary metabolite database toxin cyanopeptide cyanometdb 1 introduction cyanobacteria inhabit diverse freshwater marine and terrestrial environments across the globe and can survive under extreme irradiation temperature ph or salinity conditions when cyanobacteria proliferate rapidly to form harmful blooms they can produce high amounts of unique and bioactive secondary metabolites baumann and juttner 2008 ferranti et al 2013 gkelis et al 2015 grabowska et al 2014 jancula et al 2014 kurmayer et al 2011 lopes et al 2012 mazur marzec et al 2013 the early assumption that secondary metabolite production evolved in ecologically disadvantaged species experiencing high selection pressure was later underscored by molecular analysis of the genes that control their biosynthesis hartmann 2008 secondary metabolites from cyanobacteria can fulfill diverse roles including defense against other organisms antibiotics herbicides fungicides etc as metal transporting agents as facilitators of symbiosis as photoprotectants antioxidants differentiation effectors or allelochemicals in signaling among other functions demain a l and fang a 2001 pereira daniel and giani

research actively explores their use e g to fight cancers cardiac and autoimmune disorders or infectious diseases a number of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites show antimicrobial or antifungal activity swain et al 2017 despite the recognition of their bioactivity little is known about the potential human and ecotoxicological risks posed by exposure to cyanobacteria and their less studied secondary metabolites epidemiological studies indicate human health effects and potential cancer development from acute and chronic exposure to cyanopeptides and other work offers clues regarding the toxicity of less studied cyanopeptides janssen 2019 liu et al 2017 svircev et al 2017 various countries have put forward drinking water guidelines for one toxic metabolite microcystin lr ibelings et al 2014 for which the world health organization who proposed a threshold concentration of 1 µg l 1 for free and cell bound exposure who 2004 recent updates of these guidelines now include thresholds for a total microcystin content and short term exposure thresholds of 12 µg l 1 for microcystins as well as threshold values for cylindrospermopsin anatoxin a and saxitoxins with 3 30 and 3 µg l 1 in drinking water respectively who 2020a b c d despite recent progress in establishing guidelines for these compounds data on the occurrence fate transformation processes and toxicity of most cyanobacterial secondary metabolites is lacking and improved high throughput analytical and effect based methods are needed to overcome this information gap two of the major challenges associated with studying cyanobacterial secondary metabolites are 1 availability of analytical methods capable of detecting and identifying a broad range of compounds and 2 a publically available list of known metabolites including chemical structure information research into analytical and toxicological methods for cyanobacterial metabolites relies on a comprehensive understanding of their structures one obstacle that contributes to this is the lack of a bioinformatics platform that the cyanobacterial research community collectively supports while information from commercial databases of secondary metabolites is only accessible to paying customers e g antibase marinlit the dictionary of natural products several open access databases exist but are often limited in terms of the number of cyanobacterial metabolites or parameters listed e g algaltox list norine database handbook of marine natural products recently a new database unified 411 621 entries of natural products from various organisms using stereochemistry free inchi key information from 50 open and accessible databases termed coconut collection of open natural products sorokina and steinbeck 2020 key open access databases regarding cyano bacterial metabolites are listed in table 1 the cyanomet mass list by lemanach et al 2019 contains 852 entries of which 35 belong to the class of microcystins and nearly 500 compounds are listed with complete molecular formulae and literature references but no further structural information is given le manach et al 2019 in 2017 the handbook of cyanobacterial monitoring and cyanotoxin analysis was published including a list of 248 microcystins and 10 nodularins spoof and catherine 2017 today the most comprehensive list of microcystins and nodularins was recently updated 2019 to include 286 microcystin and 10 nodularin variants with molecular formulae references and a systematic naming implying the structural compositions but no structural codes bouaicha et al 2019 miles and stirling 2019 the natural products atlas presents a repository maintained and actively updated by the simon fraser university in canada and covers all microbially derived natural products it includes compounds published in peer reviewed primary literature and contained 1006 cyanobacterial metabolites including structural identifiers isomeric smiles codes as of december 2019 van santen et al 2019 here we describe a database of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites termed cyanometdb containing 2010 unique entries cyanometdb has been compiled from existing databases and in house libraries as well as through manual curation of available peer reviewed primary literature published between 1967 and 2020 we present an overview of the structure of this database and explain the methodology used in its compilation and curation we summarize areas of research that can benefit from this openly accessible resource including supporting compound identification using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry analysis of biosynthetic variations bioactivity environmental behavior and finally we provide future perspectives on the database herein we supply the cyanometdb and literature metadata as i separate flat files and ii converted spreadsheet format files the current and future versions of cyanometdb are available on zenodo jones et al 2021 and the norman suspect list exchange https www norman network com nds sle we recommend citing the repository on zenodo along with this article when cyanometdb content is used this work was initiated at the 11th international conference of toxic cyanobacteria ictc 2019 krakow poland and we welcome participation of the wider research community in future editions of cyanometdb 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources and curation procedure cyanometdb was established as a consolidation of multiple disparate sources of information pertaining to cyanobacterial secondary metabolites including in house libraries of the cyanometdb curation team members and various open access databases table 1 cyanometdb was then extended to include additional cyanobacterial secondary metabolites reported in the scientific literature for each compound the primary literature metadata was manually verified and where required corrected the sample type from which a compound was extracted and identified e g genus species strain of cyanobacterium or field sample as well as whether nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used for its structure elucidation were recorded furthermore the 2d chemical structure of each compound was manually drawn chemdraw chemdraw professional acd chemsketch based on the information provided in the primary references from which structural identifiers were generated including simplified molecular input line entry system smiles string international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac international chemical identifier inchi and inchikey and iupac name in some instances this led to the correction of structures originally reported in one of the consolidated data sources e g aeruginosin 101 and aeruginosin 98c both contain a d allo ile in their structure but were previously misreported as l allo ile derivatives in the primary literature ishida et al 1999 entries extracted from pubchem were carefully checked to verify the structure from the primary literature where discrepancies were observed between structures reported in the primary literature and those found in pubchem we report the information from the primary literature in cyanometdb in the above mentioned example aeruginosin 101 was misreported as its l allo ile derivative whereas aeruginosin 98c was correctly reported in pubchem accessed 08 september 2020 it is useful to highlight that some issues emerged for example with the representation of olefin stereochemistry when a compound s structure was drawn using an inchi code in chemdraw for this reason we recommend the use of smiles codes from cyanometdb for accurate representation of a compound s 2d structure after the initial compilation and expansion of cyanometdb the accuracy of data in the database was confirmed through multiple rounds of database integrity checks in each round members of the cyanometdb curation team received sub sets of cyanometdb compounds whereupon they evaluated and if necessary corrected the assignment of the primary and secondary literature sources and chemical structural descriptors smiles inchi inchikey and iupac name 2 2 cyanometdb structure cyanometdb is presented as a flat file database comprising the following core fields compound identifier key compound name compound class molecular formula molecular weight monoisotopic mass primary reference in which the compound was first reported smiles string inchl string inchlkey and iupac name together the smiles inchi inchikey and iupac name fields serve as textual identifiers for each compound heller et al 2015 for each entry in cyanometdb the following additional fields were also optionally populated to clarify aspects of a compound s identification the field nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr used indicates whether nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to confirm a compound s structure or partial relative stereochemistry the field secondary reference if populated provides a citation to an article in which 1 a compound was first reported in a cyanobacterial species after having first been reported in the primary reference in a non cyanobacterial species or 2 the structural annotation information reported in the primary reference has since been clarified or refined the genus species and strain fields collectively provide an overview of the sample type in which a compound was identified the field field sample includes information for instances where a compound was identified in samples from bloom material comprising one or multiple potentially undefined cyanobacterial species finally the notes field provides further comments of interest concerning a compound s origin and structural annotation table 2 provides a detailed description and illustrative examples for each data field in cyanometdb for a subset of 1097 compounds we also provide the structural representation as a building block string with abbreviated monomers e g three letter amino acid codes for all entries in cyanometdb we provide as a minimum the canonical smiles code describing the connectivity of each atom in the compound s planar structure an isomeric smiles code is provided when a compound s stereochemistry was clearly reported in the primary or secondary reference s or where evidence from related compounds or known biosynthetic pathways provides evidence for probable stereochemical configurations for example in all microcystins characterized to date by multiple and complimentary analytical techniques the monomers identified in positions 2 and 4 of the cyclic structure have always been found to be l amino acids while in positions 1 3 and 6 d amino acids are always reported consequently the microcystins in cyanometdb identified solely by lc ms have been assumed to retain this stereochemistry the notes column provides additional details as to whether uncertainty remains regarding some aspect of a compound s structure compounds in cyanometdb are classified into major metabolite classes based on conserved molecular substructures as outlined in previous studies fig 1 welker and von döhren 2006 for example microcystins are heptapeptides with a characteristic adda moiety i e 2s 3s 4e 6e 8s 9s 3 amino 9 methoxy 2 6 8 trimethyl 10 phenyldeca 4 6 dienoic acid or derivatives thereof cyanopeptolins contain a β lactone ring and a characteristic ahp 3 amino 6 hydroxy 2 piperidone moiety anabaenopeptins contain a ureido bond connecting the primary amine of lysine with the primary amine of the neighboring amino acid and lysine s ε amine with the carboxyl group of the c terminal amino acid to form a urea moiety and five membered peptide ring aeruginosins contain a choi 2 carboxy 6 hydroxyoctahydroindole moiety and its 3 4 substituents and microginins contain the characteristic ahda moiety 3 amino 2 hydroxydecanoic acid or octanoic acid fig 1 we conducted substructure searches to verify the class assignments and to identify other structural motifs chemaxon jchem base software 20 4 0 2020 3 results and discussion to date cyanometdb includes 2010 cyanobacterial secondary metabolites with complete literature and structural information and some additional entries 50 semi synthetic and synthetic entries presenting related compounds that have only been chemically derived or where cyanobacterial metabolites have been chemically modified 41 metabolites that are structurally related to metabolites from cyanobacteria but so far have only been identified in other organisms and 5 metabolites that have been identified in other organisms that were feeding on cyanobacteria the earliest entry in cyanometdb was published in 1967 for the chromophore phycoerythrobilin followed by more than 115 additional compounds by the end of 1990 there was a four fold increase in the number of reported cyanobacterial metabolites between 1990 and 2000 this rapid increase in the number of reported secondary metabolites during the 1990s was in part likely associated with the realization that microcystins pose significant hepatotoxic risks to humans this led to mc lr being included in the who water quality guidelines who 2004 prompting significant research on cyanobacteria nearly one thousand cyanobacterial compounds were identified by the year 2010 and a further one thousand compounds have been reported in the subsequent decade the increasing incidences of cyanobacterial blooms and availability of advanced analytical instrumentation e g high resolution mass spectrometry hrms and high field nmr spectroscopy with cryogenic probes have contributed to discoveries in recent years fig 2a inset 3 1 publication trends publication trends in the field suggest that the discovery of cyanobacterial metabolites has not yet reached a plateau fig 2a the question arises how close are we to identifying the majority of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites also how many of the newly described compounds are chemical variants of known families and how many describe new families these are also overarching questions in the general domain of natural product research pye and coworkers recently surveyed the chemical space of natural products and concluded that new discoveries mostly relate structurally to previously published compounds and that the range of scaffolds readily accessible from nature is limited pye et al 2017 this limitation does not mean that new discoveries are expected to be exhausted but rather that most new secondary metabolites are likely to share structural similarities to previous reported ones in cyanometdb 27 of the entries have been identified by mass spectrometry and such data acquisition or processing methods are generally optimized for known classes of compound such as cyanopeptides e g microcystins or low molecular weight molecules e g anatoxins this increases the probability of identifying additional variants of these classes rather than compounds with structural differences that could require different lc ms settings the discovery of new variants in a known class is still highly relevant because the toxicity is dependent on chemical structure for example among 18 microcystin congeners the ic50 values for enzyme inhibition of serine threonine protein phosphatases ranged over six orders of magnitude altaner et al 2020 another reason may be that scientific results are limited by the environments that are predominantly explored while less focus has thus far been paid to for example cyanobacteria from terrestrial or extreme environments or that live symbiotically with other organisms kaasalainen et al 2012 discoveries of natural products from other bacteria started in the 1940s pye et al 2017 whereas cyanobacterial metabolite discoveries began only in the late 1960s the overall trend is especially driven by discoveries of peptide based metabolites and common cyanopeptide classes make up more than one third of all peptidic metabolites in cyanometdb top 5 contributing classes in fig 2 b to date the database contains 2010 compounds including 310 microcystins 193 cyanopeptolins also called micropeptins 211 other depsipeptides 101 anabaenopeptins 85 microginins 67 aeruginosins 64 cylamides 38 cryptophycins 38 saxitoxins 26 spumigins 25 microviridins 16 nodularins 11 anatoxins and 5 cylindrospermopsins within each class compounds show high structural similarity supporting the previous observations that the contribution of novel structural scaffolds is typically low for natural products including within the pool of cyanobacterial metabolites pye et al 2017 3 2 chemical space cyanometdb shows that cyanobacterial secondary metabolites cover a wide range of molecular weights between 118 and 2708 da of these 59 are cyclic compounds and 69 are peptides the distribution of molecular weights of the 2010 compounds is shown in fig 3 a and 3b which demonstrate that compounds with at least one peptide bond account for most of the compounds with molecular weights of 900 da and higher particularly among the peptides many compounds are present in the 1000 1100 da range these peptides can be classified to a large extent into common peptide classes including microcystins cyanopeptolins and other cyclic depsipeptides that cover the majority of compounds with molecular weights above 900 da fig 4 the distribution based on metabolite classes shows that microcystins and cyanopeptolins in particular contribute to the high abundance of known metabolites between 1000 and 1100 da for the other non peptide metabolites there is a particularly high frequency of metabolites with masses between 350 and 500 da fig 3b dominated by linear non peptides fig 4 the molecular weight distribution of more than 28 000 marine natural products has previously been shown to also center around 350 da and the chemical diversity aligned with biological diversity of the producing species blunt et al 2018 these authors reported that compounds with higher molecular weights that diverged from this trend were predominantly produced by cyanobacteria as well as echinodermata dinophyta and tracheophyta mangroves non peptide secondary metabolites make up only 41 of entries in cyanometdb but this might be an underrepresentation in general the non peptide based metabolites from cyanobacteria are more difficult to classify because they lack unifying structural features the structural information smiles codes in the database allows for substructure searching to identify common molecular motifs for example of the non peptide compounds 15 contain an ester bond and 11 a pyrrolidine ring most compounds show unsaturation with 64 carrying at least one aromatic ring 30 having 1 2 aromatic rings and 6 having 3 6 aromatic rings halogen atoms are present in 35 of the non peptide compounds 30 cl and 5 br and 12 contain sulfur isomeric compounds i e compounds with the same molecular formulae but different atom connectivity are common among the cyanobacterial secondary metabolites for 270 unique molecular formulae we identified between 2 and 11 isomeric compounds affecting 706 compounds in the database data in fig 3c show the distribution of isomeric compounds across molecular weights microcystins show the highest number of isomeric compounds 5 to 11 for molecular weights around 1000 da the database contains 179 molecular formulae with 2 isomeric compounds 56 formulae with 3 isomeric compounds and 20 formulae with 4 isomeric compounds the presence of isomeric compounds makes unequivocal identification of individual compounds challenging for mass spectrometry based analytical methods and highlights the importance of ms ms data interpretation and availability of authentic standards for retention time matching secondary metabolites from cyanobacteria have mostly been discovered by top down approaches from extraction of biomass and analyses that were guided by chemical motifs e g peptides molecular weight groups common mass spectrometric product ions or non targeted searches by ms within cyanometdb 12 of compounds were first identified from field samples and the remaining compounds were identified from laboratory grown cultures in total more than 50 different cyanobacterial genera were used considering the genera listed in the associated publications that first identified the structure note that the taxonomic classification has subsequently changed for some genera and additional changes may be introduced in accordance with future knowledge on taxonomy of cyanobacteria dominant genera were moorea lyngbya microcystis nostoc anabaena dolichospermum oscillatoria planktothrix nodularia scytonema fischerella and symploca in decreasing order of total entries these genera are not necessarily the main producers of the respective metabolites but were predominantly used for initial structure elucidation compounds from cyanometdb that were not previously listed in the natural products atlas but that fulfilrequirements for inclusion have now been added to this online repository of bacterial secondary metabolites the np atlas version 2020 08 van santen et al 2019 comparing the chemical space of these 1640 natural products from cyanobacteria against more than 28 000 natural products from any bacterium the np atlas demonstrates a relatively even spread of cyanobacterial metabolites supporting their high structural diversity fig 5 the spherical plot uses the molecular composition to position each compound based on c h ratios radial value in xy plane c o ratios angle with z axis and c n ratios distance from origin and nodes illustrate the relationship among clusters regarding their structural similarities van santen et al 2019 here cyanobacterial secondary metabolites are linked by 239 out of 6800 nodes in the natural products atlas repository 3 3 implications for cyanobacterial research cyanometdb holds significant potential as a tool for supporting diverse areas of cyanobacterial research for instance aiding the identification of known and novel cyanobacterial metabolites exploring the impact of biosynthetic pathways on cyanobacterial metabolite profiles and dynamics as a framework around which information may be collated regarding structural characteristics and biological activity of cyanobacterial metabolites understanding the environmental occurrence fate and transformation of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites below we explore some of these opportunities in further detail 3 4 identification by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms just as mass spectrometry based analytical methods have played a significant role in the rapid discovery of many of the cyanobacterial metabolites included in cyanometdb modern lc ms ms methods are also one of the primary applications of the database comprehensive screening of culture or field derived samples for cyanobacterial secondary metabolites presents a significant analytical challenge in part due to the large number of chemically diverse compounds that exist and due to the presence of many isomeric compounds moreover commercially available chemical standards do not exist for the vast majority of these compounds together these factors render targeted triple quadrupole based lc ms ms methods less effective for analysis of a wider range cyanobacterial metabolites instead lc high resolution ms lc hrms methods that are able to efficiently separate and selectively detect ionizable chemicals in complex matrices with or without fragmentation hold great potential a popular strategy by which to analyze compounds by lc hrms is termed suspect screening this approach involves searching full scan hrms data for exact m z values of interest which is usually done using commercial or open source software e g thermo trace finder and compound discoverer or skyline respectively gunthardt et al 2020 natumi and janssen 2020 detected compounds of interest require further confirmation ideally through retention time matching against a chemical standard and with detection of characteristic ms ms fragmentation spectra applying standardized criteria to specify the confidence of compound identification schymanski et al 2014 relatively comprehensive full scan and tandem hrms data can be acquired using either data dependent or data independent hrms ms acquisition strategies which are suitable for suspect screening and confirmation of abundant cyanobacterial secondary metabolites cyanometdb will greatly expand the power of such lc hrms based suspect screening workflows allowing known metabolites to be detected more routinely and thereby avoid rediscoveries of known compounds i e dereplication in the case of data dependent acquisition the m z values in cyanometdb can be used as an inclusion list to preferentially trigger ms ms fragmentation of precursors detected in full scan with the m z values of interest in addition to suspect screening one can also interrogate lc hrms datasets in more holistic ways referred to as untargeted or non target analysis non target screening is primarily done using commercial or open source metabolomics software packages hohrenk et al 2020 schymanski et al 2015 walsh et al 2019 or with dedicated custom tools e g global natural product social molecular networking gnps wang et al 2016 these workflows typically build upon suspect screening strategies starting with the identification of expected compounds and then extending the search space to detect compounds outside the realm of known compounds as defined by a list or database of known compounds here novel compounds are revealed through similarities in ms ms data mass defect analysis searching for retention time or molecular formulae ranges of interest and by assessing statistical differences between sample groups within a dataset for example untargeted workflows have been reported for microcystins that can detect new analogues based on characteristic product ions that are sensitively detected for most known microcystins ortiz et al 2017 roy lachapelle et al 2019 the comprehensive structural and formula data within cyanometdb will enable development of such untargeted workflows and improve the detection of known and novel cyanobacterial secondary metabolites in cultured and environmental samples moreover this information can also be used in combination with in silico ms ms fragmentation tools e g mass frontier mmass metfrag to predict possible structures for ms ms product ions i e to aid compound annotation natumi and janssen 2020 niedermeyer and strohalm 2012 ruttkies et al 2016 sheldon et al 2009 you can now find cyanometdb among the databases available in metfrag https msbi ipb halle de metfragbeta to generate predicted ms ms data recent developments in the area of machine learning guided ms ms data interpretation hold great potential in enhancing the accuracy of in silico based compound identification efforts in particular through their capacity to predict both the types and intensities of product ions likely to be generated from a given structure e g competitive fragmentation model cfm id djoumbou feunang et al 2019 naturally the effectiveness of such approaches hinge upon the availability and quality of the ms ms data which is not always the case in environmental samples with low abundant metabolites or in the presence of complex matrices 3 5 biosynthetic analysis discovery of secondary metabolites based on genetic information is a promising bottom up approach that can reveal additional unknown compounds moosmann et al 2018 recent advances in microbial genomics have greatly improved our understanding of the biochemical mechanisms responsible for the biosynthesis of cyanobacterial natural products dittmann et al 2015 the majority of these natural products are synthesized through secondary metabolic pathways in coordinated enzyme cascades dittmann et al 2015 approximately 75 of the natural products included in the cyanometdb dataset can be assigned to structural families for which biosynthetic pathways have been reported from one or more representatives many families of secondary cyanobacterial metabolites exhibit extensive chemical variation but share a structural core that defines the family fig 1 typically the biosynthesis of compounds in one family shares a set of conserved enzymes for the synthesis of the defining structural core but also a set of accessory tailoring enzymes that are not universally conserved dittmann et al 2013 2015 the biosynthetic logic underlying the biosynthesis of most common cyanobacterial toxins including microcystins tillett et al 2000 nodularins moffitt and neilan 2004 saxitoxins kellmann et al 2009 cylindrospermopsins mihali et al 2008 and anatoxins mejean et al 2009 are now well understood however the basis for the biosynthesis of specific chemical variants is incomplete in many cases numerous molecular ecology methods have been developed to characterize the types of toxin producers in blooms based on the biosynthetic gene clusters dittmann et al 2013 the compilation of cyanometdb has shown that the chemical variation of the major secondary metabolites is more extensive than previously thought a more complete understanding of the biosynthetic basis for the chemical variation of secondary metabolites from cyanobacteria is necessary to ensure the unbiased detection of their biosynthetic pathways directly from environmental samples 3 6 bioactivity and structure with the fast growing number of new secondary metabolites from cyanobacteria and the growing awareness of their sometimes beneficial and sometimes detrimental biological activities the availability of a comprehensive database is essential cyanobacterial metabolites present cytotoxic dermatotoxic hepatotoxic neurotoxic enzyme inhibiting antimicrobial antifungal antiprotozoal and anti inflammatory activities that can also be exploited by the pharmaceutical industry to develop new drugs that are potentially beneficial to humans huang and zimba 2019 kini et al 2020 singh et al 2011 future discoveries are likely to share structural similarities to previously discovered metabolites but may however exhibit differing potencies and thus are important to identify any modifications to the structure such as replacement of amino acids by other residues substitution by methylation halogenation or oxidation and changes in configuration can significantly affect the ability of cyanobacterial metabolites to evoke a biological or toxic response for example in the case of microcystins biological activity toward protein phosphatases is underpinned by their cyclic structure and the adda d glu region which interacts with the catalytic unit of these enzymes mclellan and manderville 2017 the modification of the less conserved positions 2 and 4 fig 1 also plays a significant role in microcystin bioactivity bouaicha et al 2019 fontanillo and kohn 2018 the selective activity of cyanopeptolins against serine proteases depends on the residue in the ahp neighboring position the arg ahp containing cyanopeptolin variants are mainly active against trypsin whereas cyanopeptolins with hydrophobic amino acids e g phe tyr ile show potent activity against chymotrypsin yamaki et al 2005 in the case of cryptophycins which are cyclic depsipeptides composed of four subunits their effect on microtubule dynamics is determined by the intact 16 membered macrolide structure reactive epoxide ring in unit 1 methyl groups in units 1 and 3 o methyl group and chloro substituent in unit 2 and isobutyl group in unit 4 units 1 4 in fig 1 correspond to units a d in golakoti et al 1996 the interaction of a metabolite with cellular molecules that causes an observable adverse outcome i e toxicodynamics depends critically on the structure of the metabolite in silico studies termed virtual screening target based or ligand based use structural information of compounds deposited in databases to overcome problems related to the limited availability of chemical standards i e pure compounds and lack of information on their physico chemical properties kirchweger and rollinger 2018 in the case of new drug development from cyanopeptides virtual screening could also help reduce the cost and increase the success rate of the process cheminformatics can also assist the discovery of as yet unknown cyanobacterial metabolites in so called target fishing brzuzan et al 2020 liang et al 2018 zhu et al 2015 modern techniques of machine learning can assist in predicting the effect of an unknown metabolite after training the model with known compounds as recently demonstrated for microcystins altaner et al 2020 cyanometdb presents a database including structural information for each metabolite that is deposited in a format immediately accessible to software tools the deposited structures in cyanometdb can also be used as templates in these approaches and to design new chemical entities with desirable traits and ligand target interactions 3 7 environmental behavior as thousands of secondary metabolites have been identified from cyanobacteria we now face the questions how persistent are they how stable are they in surface waters how do their concentrations change during bloom events can they reach water treatment plant intakes and does sufficient abatement occur during treatment answers to these questions are needed to quantify the exposure side of the risk assessment equation and to prioritize cyanobacterial metabolites for toxicity testing monitoring of surface waters and evaluating removal in engineered water treatment systems physico chemical properties reactivity with oxidants in surface waters and during water treatment and biotransformation mechanisms are relevant to predict the behavior of secondary metabolites with known chemical structures models can be developed to predict physico chemical properties from quantitative structure activity relationships qsars for example water octanol partitioning coefficients were predicted for 45 polar plant toxins with three different models kowwin acd percepta and chemicalize and results were in close agreement with empirically derived values schonsee and bucheli 2020 good correlations i e qsars have also been observed among structurally related organic micropollutants and their reaction with oxidants used in advanced water treatment e g o3 clo3 hocl hfeo4 lee and von gunten 2012 the use of training sets enables calibration of such models and improves their predictive power for properties of unknown compounds machine learning can be combined with such modeling to train qsars as recently demonstrated for the prediction of pk a values of more than 6000 organic molecules mansouri et al 2019 also biotransformation mechanisms can in part be predicted for compounds with known structures for example envipath presents an open access tool that uses known transformation rules to propose degradation pathways for organic molecules wickert et al 2016 such predictions can also assist in the search for transformation products of known metabolites the structural information in cyanometdb allows substructure searching for moieties with known reactivity in biotic and abiotic transformation processes and the transformation products can be included in qsar models qsar models may be particularly useful within compound classes that share a core structure but where empirical parameters are only available for some congeners such models can be explored to prioritize secondary metabolites from cyanobacteria for further research and monitoring according to their expected toxicity persistence and mobility in the environment 4 conclusion cyanobacterial metabolites have now been studied for over 60 years during this time thousands of chemical structures have been reported across hundreds of primary research articles which have only in part been included in curated lists by individual research groups in this work with a view to promoting effective analysis and interchange of information about cyanobacterial metabolites we have manually collated and evaluated these disparate resources including 850 primary research articles as of december 2020 to generate a single unified database of known cyanobacterial secondary metabolites termed cyanometdb this database contains 2010 individual records each corresponding to a unique cyanobacterial secondary metabolite and associated chemical descriptors smiles string molecular weight monoisotopic mass molecular formula etc we made cyanometdb an open access resource to ensure that it is accessible to a broad audience whilst also fulfilling the goal of supporting the analysis and identification of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites in the future herein we supply cyanometdb and literature metadata as separate flat files and converted spreadsheet format files to this end the current and future versions of cyanometdb are and will be available on zenodo jones et al 2021 and the norman suspect list exchange https www norman network com nds sle we recommend citingcrecommiting the repository on zenodo along with this article when cyanometdb content is used moving forward our aim is to continue the work presented herein by 1 adding missing and newly reported cyanobacterial secondary metabolites to cyanometdb as they are published and 2 using cyanometdb as a framework for connecting and collating various data sources associated with cyanobacterial metabolites e g their tandem mass spectrometry product ion spectra toxicity data etc we anticipate that the continued curation of cyanometdb will enrich existing and establish new collaborative research efforts enhance the frequency with which compound annotations are assigned and aid communication comparison and interpretation of results the approach used to build the cyanometdb dataset could also be applied to build related datasets containing toxins and secondary metabolites from other organisms e g those produced by marine microalgae such efforts would be highly beneficial to facilitate monitoring of marine microalgal toxins in the food chain for research and monitoring purposes indeed some toxin classes such as saxitoxins were first identified in marine dinoflagellates before their discovery in cyanobacterial samples thus datasets of cyanobacterial and marine microalgal metabolites will partially overlap declaration of competing interest none

17072,harmful cyanobacterial blooms which frequently contain toxic secondary metabolites are reported in aquatic environments around the world more than two thousand cyanobacterial secondary metabolites have been reported from diverse sources over the past fifty years a comprehensive publically accessible database detailing these secondary metabolites would facilitate research into their occurrence functions and toxicological risks to address this need we created cyanometdb a highly curated flat file openly accessible database of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites collated from 850 peer reviewed articles published between 1967 and 2020 cyanometdb contains 2010 cyanobacterial metabolites and 99 structurally related compounds this has nearly doubled the number of entries with complete literature metadata and structural composition information compared to previously available open access databases the dataset includes microcytsins cyanopeptolins other depsipeptides anabaenopeptins microginins aeruginosins cyclamides cryptophycins saxitoxins spumigins microviridins and anatoxins among other metabolite classes a comprehensive database dedicated to cyanobacterial secondary metabolites facilitates 1 the detection and dereplication of known cyanobacterial toxins and secondary metabolites 2 the identification of novel natural products from cyanobacteria 3 research on biosynthesis of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites including substructure searches and 4 the investigation of their abundance persistence and toxicity in natural environments keywords cyanobacteria secondary metabolite database toxin cyanopeptide cyanometdb 1 introduction cyanobacteria inhabit diverse freshwater marine and terrestrial environments across the globe and can survive under extreme irradiation temperature ph or salinity conditions when cyanobacteria proliferate rapidly to form harmful blooms they can produce high amounts of unique and bioactive secondary metabolites baumann and juttner 2008 ferranti et al 2013 gkelis et al 2015 grabowska et al 2014 jancula et al 2014 kurmayer et al 2011 lopes et al 2012 mazur marzec et al 2013 the early assumption that secondary metabolite production evolved in ecologically disadvantaged species experiencing high selection pressure was later underscored by molecular analysis of the genes that control their biosynthesis hartmann 2008 secondary metabolites from cyanobacteria can fulfill diverse roles including defense against other organisms antibiotics herbicides fungicides etc as metal transporting

research actively explores their use e g to fight cancers cardiac and autoimmune disorders or infectious diseases a number of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites show antimicrobial or antifungal activity swain et al 2017 despite the recognition of their bioactivity little is known about the potential human and ecotoxicological risks posed by exposure to cyanobacteria and their less studied secondary metabolites epidemiological studies indicate human health effects and potential cancer development from acute and chronic exposure to cyanopeptides and other work offers clues regarding the toxicity of less studied cyanopeptides janssen 2019 liu et al 2017 svircev et al 2017 various countries have put forward drinking water guidelines for one toxic metabolite microcystin lr ibelings et al 2014 for which the world health organization who proposed a threshold concentration of 1 µg l 1 for free and cell bound exposure who 2004 recent updates of these guidelines now include thresholds for a total microcystin content and short term exposure thresholds of 12 µg l 1 for microcystins as well as threshold values for cylindrospermopsin anatoxin a and saxitoxins with 3 30 and 3 µg l 1 in drinking water respectively who 2020a b c d despite recent progress in establishing guidelines for these compounds data on the occurrence fate transformation processes and toxicity of most cyanobacterial secondary metabolites is lacking and improved high throughput analytical and effect based methods are needed to overcome this information gap two of the major challenges associated with studying cyanobacterial secondary metabolites are 1 availability of analytical methods capable of detecting and identifying a broad range of compounds and 2 a publically available list of known metabolites including chemical structure information research into analytical and toxicological methods for cyanobacterial metabolites relies on a comprehensive understanding of their structures one obstacle that contributes to this is the lack of a bioinformatics platform that the cyanobacterial research community collectively supports while information from commercial databases of secondary metabolites is only accessible to paying customers e g antibase marinlit the dictionary of natural products several open access databases exist but are often limited in terms of the number of cyanobacterial metabolites or parameters listed e g algaltox list norine database handbook of marine natural products recently a new database unified 411 621 entries of natural products from various organisms using stereochemistry free inchi key information from 50 open and accessible databases termed coconut collection of open natural products sorokina and steinbeck 2020 key open access databases regarding cyano bacterial metabolites are listed in table 1 the cyanomet mass list by lemanach et al 2019 contains 852 entries of which 35 belong to the class of microcystins and nearly 500 compounds are listed with complete molecular formulae and literature references but no further structural information is given le manach et al 2019 in 2017 the handbook of cyanobacterial monitoring and cyanotoxin analysis was published including a list of 248 microcystins and 10 nodularins spoof and catherine 2017 today the most comprehensive list of microcystins and nodularins was recently updated 2019 to include 286 microcystin and 10 nodularin variants with molecular formulae references and a systematic naming implying the structural compositions but no structural codes bouaicha et al 2019 miles and stirling 2019 the natural products atlas presents a repository maintained and actively updated by the simon fraser university in canada and covers all microbially derived natural products it includes compounds published in peer reviewed primary literature and contained 1006 cyanobacterial metabolites including structural identifiers isomeric smiles codes as of december 2019 van santen et al 2019 here we describe a database of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites termed cyanometdb containing 2010 unique entries cyanometdb has been compiled from existing databases and in house libraries as well as through manual curation of available peer reviewed primary literature published between 1967 and 2020 we present an overview of the structure of this database and explain the methodology used in its compilation and curation we summarize areas of research that can benefit from this openly accessible resource including supporting compound identification using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry analysis of biosynthetic variations bioactivity environmental behavior and finally we provide future perspectives on the database herein we supply the cyanometdb and literature metadata as i separate flat files and ii converted spreadsheet format files the current and future versions of cyanometdb are available on zenodo jones et al 2021 and the norman suspect list exchange https www norman network com nds sle we recommend citing the repository on zenodo along with this article when cyanometdb content is used this work was initiated at the 11th international conference of toxic cyanobacteria ictc 2019 krakow poland and we welcome participation of the wider research community in future editions of cyanometdb 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources and curation procedure cyanometdb was established as a consolidation of multiple disparate sources of information pertaining to cyanobacterial secondary metabolites including in house libraries of the cyanometdb curation team members and various open access databases table 1 cyanometdb was then extended to include additional cyanobacterial secondary metabolites reported in the scientific literature for each compound the primary literature metadata was manually verified and where required corrected the sample type from which a compound was extracted and identified e g genus species strain of cyanobacterium or field sample as well as whether nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used for its structure elucidation were recorded furthermore the 2d chemical structure of each compound was manually drawn chemdraw chemdraw professional acd chemsketch based on the information provided in the primary references from which structural identifiers were generated including simplified molecular input line entry system smiles string international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac international chemical identifier inchi and inchikey and iupac name in some instances this led to the correction of structures originally reported in one of the consolidated data sources e g aeruginosin 101 and aeruginosin 98c both contain a d allo ile in their structure but were previously misreported as l allo ile derivatives in the primary literature ishida et al 1999 entries extracted from pubchem were carefully checked to verify the structure from the primary literature where discrepancies were observed between structures reported in the primary literature and those found in pubchem we report the information from the primary literature in cyanometdb in the above mentioned example aeruginosin 101 was misreported as its l allo ile derivative whereas aeruginosin 98c was correctly reported in pubchem accessed 08 september 2020 it is useful to highlight that some issues emerged for example with the representation of olefin stereochemistry when a compound s structure was drawn using an inchi code in chemdraw for this reason we recommend the use of smiles codes from cyanometdb for accurate representation of a compound s 2d structure after the initial compilation and expansion of cyanometdb the accuracy of data in the database was confirmed through multiple rounds of database integrity checks in each round members of the cyanometdb curation team received sub sets of cyanometdb compounds whereupon they evaluated and if necessary corrected the assignment of the primary and secondary literature sources and chemical structural descriptors smiles inchi inchikey and iupac name 2 2 cyanometdb structure cyanometdb is presented as a flat file database comprising the following core fields compound identifier key compound name compound class molecular formula molecular weight monoisotopic mass primary reference in which the compound was first reported smiles string inchl string inchlkey and iupac name together the smiles inchi inchikey and iupac name fields serve as textual identifiers for each compound heller et al 2015 for each entry in cyanometdb the following additional fields were also optionally populated to clarify aspects of a compound s identification the field nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr used indicates whether nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to confirm a compound s structure or partial relative stereochemistry the field secondary reference if populated provides a citation to an article in which 1 a compound was first reported in a cyanobacterial species after having first been reported in the primary reference in a non cyanobacterial species or 2 the structural annotation information reported in the primary reference has since been clarified or refined the genus species and strain fields collectively provide an overview of the sample type in which a compound was identified the field field sample includes information for instances where a compound was identified in samples from bloom material comprising one or multiple potentially undefined cyanobacterial species finally the notes field provides further comments of interest concerning a compound s origin and structural annotation table 2 provides a detailed description and illustrative examples for each data field in cyanometdb for a subset of 1097 compounds we also provide the structural representation as a building block string with abbreviated monomers e g three letter amino acid codes for all entries in cyanometdb we provide as a minimum the canonical smiles code describing the connectivity of each atom in the compound s planar structure an isomeric smiles code is provided when a compound s stereochemistry was clearly reported in the primary or secondary reference s or where evidence from related compounds or known biosynthetic pathways provides evidence for probable stereochemical configurations for example in all microcystins characterized to date by multiple and complimentary analytical techniques the monomers identified in positions 2 and 4 of the cyclic structure have always been found to be l amino acids while in positions 1 3 and 6 d amino acids are always reported consequently the microcystins in cyanometdb identified solely by lc ms have been assumed to retain this stereochemistry the notes column provides additional details as to whether uncertainty remains regarding some aspect of a compound s structure compounds in cyanometdb are classified into major metabolite classes based on conserved molecular substructures as outlined in previous studies fig 1 welker and von döhren 2006 for example microcystins are heptapeptides with a characteristic adda moiety i e 2s 3s 4e 6e 8s 9s 3 amino 9 methoxy 2 6 8 trimethyl 10 phenyldeca 4 6 dienoic acid or derivatives thereof cyanopeptolins contain a β lactone ring and a characteristic ahp 3 amino 6 hydroxy 2 piperidone moiety anabaenopeptins contain a ureido bond connecting the primary amine of lysine with the primary amine of the neighboring amino acid and lysine s ε amine with the carboxyl group of the c terminal amino acid to form a urea moiety and five membered peptide ring aeruginosins contain a choi 2 carboxy 6 hydroxyoctahydroindole moiety and its 3 4 substituents and microginins contain the characteristic ahda moiety 3 amino 2 hydroxydecanoic acid or octanoic acid fig 1 we conducted substructure searches to verify the class assignments and to identify other structural motifs chemaxon jchem base software 20 4 0 2020 3 results and discussion to date cyanometdb includes 2010 cyanobacterial secondary metabolites with complete literature and structural information and some additional entries 50 semi synthetic and synthetic entries presenting related compounds that have only been chemically derived or where cyanobacterial metabolites have been chemically modified 41 metabolites that are structurally related to metabolites from cyanobacteria but so far have only been identified in other organisms and 5 metabolites that have been identified in other organisms that were feeding on cyanobacteria the earliest entry in cyanometdb was published in 1967 for the chromophore phycoerythrobilin followed by more than 115 additional compounds by the end of 1990 there was a four fold increase in the number of reported cyanobacterial metabolites between 1990 and 2000 this rapid increase in the number of reported secondary metabolites during the 1990s was in part likely associated with the realization that microcystins pose significant hepatotoxic risks to humans this led to mc lr being included in the who water quality guidelines who 2004 prompting significant research on cyanobacteria nearly one thousand cyanobacterial compounds were identified by the year 2010 and a further one thousand compounds have been reported in the subsequent decade the increasing incidences of cyanobacterial blooms and availability of advanced analytical instrumentation e g high resolution mass spectrometry hrms and high field nmr spectroscopy with cryogenic probes have contributed to discoveries in recent years fig 2a inset 3 1 publication trends publication trends in the field suggest that the discovery of cyanobacterial metabolites has not yet reached a plateau fig 2a the question arises how close are we to identifying the majority of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites also how many of the newly described compounds are chemical variants of known families and how many describe new families these are also overarching questions in the general domain of natural product research pye and coworkers recently surveyed the chemical space of natural products and concluded that new discoveries mostly relate structurally to previously published compounds and that the range of scaffolds readily accessible from nature is limited pye et al 2017 this limitation does not mean that new discoveries are expected to be exhausted but rather that most new secondary metabolites are likely to share structural similarities to previous reported ones in cyanometdb 27 of the entries have been identified by mass spectrometry and such data acquisition or processing methods are generally optimized for known classes of compound such as cyanopeptides e g microcystins or low molecular weight molecules e g anatoxins this increases the probability of identifying additional variants of these classes rather than compounds with structural differences that could require different lc ms settings the discovery of new variants in a known class is still highly relevant because the toxicity is dependent on chemical structure for example among 18 microcystin congeners the ic50 values for enzyme inhibition of serine threonine protein phosphatases ranged over six orders of magnitude altaner et al 2020 another reason may be that scientific results are limited by the environments that are predominantly explored while less focus has thus far been paid to for example cyanobacteria from terrestrial or extreme environments or that live symbiotically with other organisms kaasalainen et al 2012 discoveries of natural products from other bacteria started in the 1940s pye et al 2017 whereas cyanobacterial metabolite discoveries began only in the late 1960s the overall trend is especially driven by discoveries of peptide based metabolites and common cyanopeptide classes make up more than one third of all peptidic metabolites in cyanometdb top 5 contributing classes in fig 2 b to date the database contains 2010 compounds including 310 microcystins 193 cyanopeptolins also called micropeptins 211 other depsipeptides 101 anabaenopeptins 85 microginins 67 aeruginosins 64 cylamides 38 cryptophycins 38 saxitoxins 26 spumigins 25 microviridins 16 nodularins 11 anatoxins and 5 cylindrospermopsins within each class compounds show high structural similarity supporting the previous observations that the contribution of novel structural scaffolds is typically low for natural products including within the pool of cyanobacterial metabolites pye et al 2017 3 2 chemical space cyanometdb shows that cyanobacterial secondary metabolites cover a wide range of molecular weights between 118 and 2708 da of these 59 are cyclic compounds and 69 are peptides the distribution of molecular weights of the 2010 compounds is shown in fig 3 a and 3b which demonstrate that compounds with at least one peptide bond account for most of the compounds with molecular weights of 900 da and higher particularly among the peptides many compounds are present in the 1000 1100 da range these peptides can be classified to a large extent into common peptide classes including microcystins cyanopeptolins and other cyclic depsipeptides that cover the majority of compounds with molecular weights above 900 da fig 4 the distribution based on metabolite classes shows that microcystins and cyanopeptolins in particular contribute to the high abundance of known metabolites between 1000 and 1100 da for the other non peptide metabolites there is a particularly high frequency of metabolites with masses between 350 and 500 da fig 3b dominated by linear non peptides fig 4 the molecular weight distribution of more than 28 000 marine natural products has previously been shown to also center around 350 da and the chemical diversity aligned with biological diversity of the producing species blunt et al 2018 these authors reported that compounds with higher molecular weights that diverged from this trend were predominantly produced by cyanobacteria as well as echinodermata dinophyta and tracheophyta mangroves non peptide secondary metabolites make up only 41 of entries in cyanometdb but this might be an underrepresentation in general the non peptide based metabolites from cyanobacteria are more difficult to classify because they lack unifying structural features the structural information smiles codes in the database allows for substructure searching to identify common molecular motifs for example of the non peptide compounds 15 contain an ester bond and 11 a pyrrolidine ring most compounds show unsaturation with 64 carrying at least one aromatic ring 30 having 1 2 aromatic rings and 6 having 3 6 aromatic rings halogen atoms are present in 35 of the non peptide compounds 30 cl and 5 br and 12 contain sulfur isomeric compounds i e compounds with the same molecular formulae but different atom connectivity are common among the cyanobacterial secondary metabolites for 270 unique molecular formulae we identified between 2 and 11 isomeric compounds affecting 706 compounds in the database data in fig 3c show the distribution of isomeric compounds across molecular weights microcystins show the highest number of isomeric compounds 5 to 11 for molecular weights around 1000 da the database contains 179 molecular formulae with 2 isomeric compounds 56 formulae with 3 isomeric compounds and 20 formulae with 4 isomeric compounds the presence of isomeric compounds makes unequivocal identification of individual compounds challenging for mass spectrometry based analytical methods and highlights the importance of ms ms data interpretation and availability of authentic standards for retention time matching secondary metabolites from cyanobacteria have mostly been discovered by top down approaches from extraction of biomass and analyses that were guided by chemical motifs e g peptides molecular weight groups common mass spectrometric product ions or non targeted searches by ms within cyanometdb 12 of compounds were first identified from field samples and the remaining compounds were identified from laboratory grown cultures in total more than 50 different cyanobacterial genera were used considering the genera listed in the associated publications that first identified the structure note that the taxonomic classification has subsequently changed for some genera and additional changes may be introduced in accordance with future knowledge on taxonomy of cyanobacteria dominant genera were moorea lyngbya microcystis nostoc anabaena dolichospermum oscillatoria planktothrix nodularia scytonema fischerella and symploca in decreasing order of total entries these genera are not necessarily the main producers of the respective metabolites but were predominantly used for initial structure elucidation compounds from cyanometdb that were not previously listed in the natural products atlas but that fulfilrequirements for inclusion have now been added to this online repository of bacterial secondary metabolites the np atlas version 2020 08 van santen et al 2019 comparing the chemical space of these 1640 natural products from cyanobacteria against more than 28 000 natural products from any bacterium the np atlas demonstrates a relatively even spread of cyanobacterial metabolites supporting their high structural diversity fig 5 the spherical plot uses the molecular composition to position each compound based on c h ratios radial value in xy plane c o ratios angle with z axis and c n ratios distance from origin and nodes illustrate the relationship among clusters regarding their structural similarities van santen et al 2019 here cyanobacterial secondary metabolites are linked by 239 out of 6800 nodes in the natural products atlas repository 3 3 implications for cyanobacterial research cyanometdb holds significant potential as a tool for supporting diverse areas of cyanobacterial research for instance aiding the identification of known and novel cyanobacterial metabolites exploring the impact of biosynthetic pathways on cyanobacterial metabolite profiles and dynamics as a framework around which information may be collated regarding structural characteristics and biological activity of cyanobacterial metabolites understanding the environmental occurrence fate and transformation of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites below we explore some of these opportunities in further detail 3 4 identification by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms just as mass spectrometry based analytical methods have played a significant role in the rapid discovery of many of the cyanobacterial metabolites included in cyanometdb modern lc ms ms methods are also one of the primary applications of the database comprehensive screening of culture or field derived samples for cyanobacterial secondary metabolites presents a significant analytical challenge in part due to the large number of chemically diverse compounds that exist and due to the presence of many isomeric compounds moreover commercially available chemical standards do not exist for the vast majority of these compounds together these factors render targeted triple quadrupole based lc ms ms methods less effective for analysis of a wider range cyanobacterial metabolites instead lc high resolution ms lc hrms methods that are able to efficiently separate and selectively detect ionizable chemicals in complex matrices with or without fragmentation hold great potential a popular strategy by which to analyze compounds by lc hrms is termed suspect screening this approach involves searching full scan hrms data for exact m z values of interest which is usually done using commercial or open source software e g thermo trace finder and compound discoverer or skyline respectively gunthardt et al 2020 natumi and janssen 2020 detected compounds of interest require further confirmation ideally through retention time matching against a chemical standard and with detection of characteristic ms ms fragmentation spectra applying standardized criteria to specify the confidence of compound identification schymanski et al 2014 relatively comprehensive full scan and tandem hrms data can be acquired using either data dependent or data independent hrms ms acquisition strategies which are suitable for suspect screening and confirmation of abundant cyanobacterial secondary metabolites cyanometdb will greatly expand the power of such lc hrms based suspect screening workflows allowing known metabolites to be detected more routinely and thereby avoid rediscoveries of known compounds i e dereplication in the case of data dependent acquisition the m z values in cyanometdb can be used as an inclusion list to preferentially trigger ms ms fragmentation of precursors detected in full scan with the m z values of interest in addition to suspect screening one can also interrogate lc hrms datasets in more holistic ways referred to as untargeted or non target analysis non target screening is primarily done using commercial or open source metabolomics software packages hohrenk et al 2020 schymanski et al 2015 walsh et al 2019 or with dedicated custom tools e g global natural product social molecular networking gnps wang et al 2016 these workflows typically build upon suspect screening strategies starting with the identification of expected compounds and then extending the search space to detect compounds outside the realm of known compounds as defined by a list or database of known compounds here novel compounds are revealed through similarities in ms ms data mass defect analysis searching for retention time or molecular formulae ranges of interest and by assessing statistical differences between sample groups within a dataset for example untargeted workflows have been reported for microcystins that can detect new analogues based on characteristic product ions that are sensitively detected for most known microcystins ortiz et al 2017 roy lachapelle et al 2019 the comprehensive structural and formula data within cyanometdb will enable development of such untargeted workflows and improve the detection of known and novel cyanobacterial secondary metabolites in cultured and environmental samples moreover this information can also be used in combination with in silico ms ms fragmentation tools e g mass frontier mmass metfrag to predict possible structures for ms ms product ions i e to aid compound annotation natumi and janssen 2020 niedermeyer and strohalm 2012 ruttkies et al 2016 sheldon et al 2009 you can now find cyanometdb among the databases available in metfrag https msbi ipb halle de metfragbeta to generate predicted ms ms data recent developments in the area of machine learning guided ms ms data interpretation hold great potential in enhancing the accuracy of in silico based compound identification efforts in particular through their capacity to predict both the types and intensities of product ions likely to be generated from a given structure e g competitive fragmentation model cfm id djoumbou feunang et al 2019 naturally the effectiveness of such approaches hinge upon the availability and quality of the ms ms data which is not always the case in environmental samples with low abundant metabolites or in the presence of complex matrices 3 5 biosynthetic analysis discovery of secondary metabolites based on genetic information is a promising bottom up approach that can reveal additional unknown compounds moosmann et al 2018 recent advances in microbial genomics have greatly improved our understanding of the biochemical mechanisms responsible for the biosynthesis of cyanobacterial natural products dittmann et al 2015 the majority of these natural products are synthesized through secondary metabolic pathways in coordinated enzyme cascades dittmann et al 2015 approximately 75 of the natural products included in the cyanometdb dataset can be assigned to structural families for which biosynthetic pathways have been reported from one or more representatives many families of secondary cyanobacterial metabolites exhibit extensive chemical variation but share a structural core that defines the family fig 1 typically the biosynthesis of compounds in one family shares a set of conserved enzymes for the synthesis of the defining structural core but also a set of accessory tailoring enzymes that are not universally conserved dittmann et al 2013 2015 the biosynthetic logic underlying the biosynthesis of most common cyanobacterial toxins including microcystins tillett et al 2000 nodularins moffitt and neilan 2004 saxitoxins kellmann et al 2009 cylindrospermopsins mihali et al 2008 and anatoxins mejean et al 2009 are now well understood however the basis for the biosynthesis of specific chemical variants is incomplete in many cases numerous molecular ecology methods have been developed to characterize the types of toxin producers in blooms based on the biosynthetic gene clusters dittmann et al 2013 the compilation of cyanometdb has shown that the chemical variation of the major secondary metabolites is more extensive than previously thought a more complete understanding of the biosynthetic basis for the chemical variation of secondary metabolites from cyanobacteria is necessary to ensure the unbiased detection of their biosynthetic pathways directly from environmental samples 3 6 bioactivity and structure with the fast growing number of new secondary metabolites from cyanobacteria and the growing awareness of their sometimes beneficial and sometimes detrimental biological activities the availability of a comprehensive database is essential cyanobacterial metabolites present cytotoxic dermatotoxic hepatotoxic neurotoxic enzyme inhibiting antimicrobial antifungal antiprotozoal and anti inflammatory activities that can also be exploited by the pharmaceutical industry to develop new drugs that are potentially beneficial to humans huang and zimba 2019 kini et al 2020 singh et al 2011 future discoveries are likely to share structural similarities to previously discovered metabolites but may however exhibit differing potencies and thus are important to identify any modifications to the structure such as replacement of amino acids by other residues substitution by methylation halogenation or oxidation and changes in configuration can significantly affect the ability of cyanobacterial metabolites to evoke a biological or toxic response for example in the case of microcystins biological activity toward protein phosphatases is underpinned by their cyclic structure and the adda d glu region which interacts with the catalytic unit of these enzymes mclellan and manderville 2017 the modification of the less conserved positions 2 and 4 fig 1 also plays a significant role in microcystin bioactivity bouaicha et al 2019 fontanillo and kohn 2018 the selective activity of cyanopeptolins against serine proteases depends on the residue in the ahp neighboring position the arg ahp containing cyanopeptolin variants are mainly active against trypsin whereas cyanopeptolins with hydrophobic amino acids e g phe tyr ile show potent activity against chymotrypsin yamaki et al 2005 in the case of cryptophycins which are cyclic depsipeptides composed of four subunits their effect on microtubule dynamics is determined by the intact 16 membered macrolide structure reactive epoxide ring in unit 1 methyl groups in units 1 and 3 o methyl group and chloro substituent in unit 2 and isobutyl group in unit 4 units 1 4 in fig 1 correspond to units a d in golakoti et al 1996 the interaction of a metabolite with cellular molecules that causes an observable adverse outcome i e toxicodynamics depends critically on the structure of the metabolite in silico studies termed virtual screening target based or ligand based use structural information of compounds deposited in databases to overcome problems related to the limited availability of chemical standards i e pure compounds and lack of information on their physico chemical properties kirchweger and rollinger 2018 in the case of new drug development from cyanopeptides virtual screening could also help reduce the cost and increase the success rate of the process cheminformatics can also assist the discovery of as yet unknown cyanobacterial metabolites in so called target fishing brzuzan et al 2020 liang et al 2018 zhu et al 2015 modern techniques of machine learning can assist in predicting the effect of an unknown metabolite after training the model with known compounds as recently demonstrated for microcystins altaner et al 2020 cyanometdb presents a database including structural information for each metabolite that is deposited in a format immediately accessible to software tools the deposited structures in cyanometdb can also be used as templates in these approaches and to design new chemical entities with desirable traits and ligand target interactions 3 7 environmental behavior as thousands of secondary metabolites have been identified from cyanobacteria we now face the questions how persistent are they how stable are they in surface waters how do their concentrations change during bloom events can they reach water treatment plant intakes and does sufficient abatement occur during treatment answers to these questions are needed to quantify the exposure side of the risk assessment equation and to prioritize cyanobacterial metabolites for toxicity testing monitoring of surface waters and evaluating removal in engineered water treatment systems physico chemical properties reactivity with oxidants in surface waters and during water treatment and biotransformation mechanisms are relevant to predict the behavior of secondary metabolites with known chemical structures models can be developed to predict physico chemical properties from quantitative structure activity relationships qsars for example water octanol partitioning coefficients were predicted for 45 polar plant toxins with three different models kowwin acd percepta and chemicalize and results were in close agreement with empirically derived values schonsee and bucheli 2020 good correlations i e qsars have also been observed among structurally related organic micropollutants and their reaction with oxidants used in advanced water treatment e g o3 clo3 hocl hfeo4 lee and von gunten 2012 the use of training sets enables calibration of such models and improves their predictive power for properties of unknown compounds machine learning can be combined with such modeling to train qsars as recently demonstrated for the prediction of pk a values of more than 6000 organic molecules mansouri et al 2019 also biotransformation mechanisms can in part be predicted for compounds with known structures for example envipath presents an open access tool that uses known transformation rules to propose degradation pathways for organic molecules wickert et al 2016 such predictions can also assist in the search for transformation products of known metabolites the structural information in cyanometdb allows substructure searching for moieties with known reactivity in biotic and abiotic transformation processes and the transformation products can be included in qsar models qsar models may be particularly useful within compound classes that share a core structure but where empirical parameters are only available for some congeners such models can be explored to prioritize secondary metabolites from cyanobacteria for further research and monitoring according to their expected toxicity persistence and mobility in the environment 4 conclusion cyanobacterial metabolites have now been studied for over 60 years during this time thousands of chemical structures have been reported across hundreds of primary research articles which have only in part been included in curated lists by individual research groups in this work with a view to promoting effective analysis and interchange of information about cyanobacterial metabolites we have manually collated and evaluated these disparate resources including 850 primary research articles as of december 2020 to generate a single unified database of known cyanobacterial secondary metabolites termed cyanometdb this database contains 2010 individual records each corresponding to a unique cyanobacterial secondary metabolite and associated chemical descriptors smiles string molecular weight monoisotopic mass molecular formula etc we made cyanometdb an open access resource to ensure that it is accessible to a broad audience whilst also fulfilling the goal of supporting the analysis and identification of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites in the future herein we supply cyanometdb and literature metadata as separate flat files and converted spreadsheet format files to this end the current and future versions of cyanometdb are and will be available on zenodo jones et al 2021 and the norman suspect list exchange https www norman network com nds sle we recommend citingcrecommiting the repository on zenodo along with this article when cyanometdb content is used moving forward our aim is to continue the work presented herein by 1 adding missing and newly reported cyanobacterial secondary metabolites to cyanometdb as they are published and 2 using cyanometdb as a framework for connecting and collating various data sources associated with cyanobacterial metabolites e g their tandem mass spectrometry product ion spectra toxicity data etc we anticipate that the continued curation of cyanometdb will enrich existing and establish new collaborative research efforts enhance the frequency with which compound annotations are assigned and aid communication comparison and interpretation of results the approach used to build the cyanometdb dataset could also be applied to build related datasets containing toxins and secondary metabolites from other organisms e g those produced by marine microalgae such efforts would be highly beneficial to facilitate monitoring of marine microalgal toxins in the food chain for research and monitoring purposes indeed some toxin classes such as saxitoxins were first identified in marine dinoflagellates before their discovery in cyanobacterial samples thus datasets of cyanobacterial and marine microalgal metabolites will partially overlap declaration of competing interest none

17073,recently acidic i e ph 5 nitrification in activated sludge is attracting attention because it enables stable nitritation nh4 no2 and enhances sludge reduction and stabilization however the key acid tolerant ammonia oxidizers involved are poorly understood in this study we performed stoichiometric and kinetic characterization of a new acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing bacterium aob belonging to gamma proteobacterium candidatus nitrosoglobus ca nitrosoglobus was cultivated in activated sludge in a laboratory membrane bioreactor over 200 days with a relative abundance of 55 1 0 5 indicated by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing at the time of the characterization experiments among all known nitrifiers ca nitrosoglobus bears the highest resistance to nitrite low ph and free nitrous acid fna these traits define ca nitrosoglobus as an adversity strategist that tends to prosper in acidic activated sludge where the low ph 5 0 and high levels of fna at parts per million levels sustained and inhibited all other nitrifiers in contrast in the conventional ph neutral activated sludge process ca nitrosoglobus is less competitive with canonical aob e g nitrosomonas due to the relatively slow specific growth rate and low affinities to both oxygen and total ammonia these results advance our understanding of acid tolerant ammonia oxidizers and support further development of the acidic activated sludge process in which ca nitrosoglobus can play a critical role graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords acidic acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing bacteria candidatus nitrosoglobus stoichiometry kinetics 1 introduction activated sludge is a well established and widely used process in wastewater treatment plants wwtps for the biological treatment of wastewater the activated sludge process is generally operated at near neutral ph at which diverse biological reactions take place to remove the pollutants in wastewater for example nitrogen as a key nutrient leading to eutrophication is generally removed via nitrification nh4 no2 no3 and denitrification no3 no2 n2 in recent years a novel nitrogen removal process the so called pn a process has been proposed which achieves nitrogen removal via the nitritation nh4 no2 and anammox nh4 no2 n2 reactions compared to the conventional nitrification and denitrification process the pn a process reduces aeration demand by 60 and eliminates the need for carbon sources kartal et al 2010 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 despite enormous efforts the application of pn a in municipal wastewater treatment is still hampered by the challenge of achieving stable nitritation agrawal et al 2018 cao et al 2017 xu et al 2015 another major challenge of the activated sludge process is the high cost associated with the handling and disposal of the excess sludge a by product generated during wastewater treatment this process incurs up to 60 of the total operational expenditures in wwtps collivignarelli et al 2015 qian et al 2016 the acidic activated sludge process has opened up a new path to address the challenges aforementioned in a conventional activated sludge process the novel process operated at acidic conditions i e ph 4 5 can enable stable nitritation li et al 2020 wang et al 2021b and also reduce and stabilize excess sludge duan et al 2019 wang et al 2021a for instance in a fully aerated membrane bioreactor mbr operated at ph 4 5 5 0 for real mainstream wastewater treatment robust nitritation i e high no2 no2 no3 ratio of 95 5 was maintained for a year and the obtained volumetric nh4 removal rate i e 188 14 mg n l 1 d 1 was also practically useful wang et al 2021b in a follow up study the acidic activated sludge from the mbr was inoculated into a post aerobic digestion reactor receiving anaerobically digested ad sludge the inoculation rapidly acidified the sludge to ph around 5 0 and achieved up to 30 reduction of volatile solids vs of ad sludge wang et al 2021a which was regarded hardly biodegradable in previous studies novak et al 2011 parravicini et al 2008a b tomei et al 2011a b notedly low ph in the acidic activated sludge process was not attained by adding chemical acids e g hcl but self sustained by microbial ammonia oxidation eq 1 the oxidation of one mole ammonium nh4 generates two mole protons h which causes ph to decrease the ph could drop to below 5 0 in a system where alkalinity in the wastewater sludge is inadequate to buffer the generated protons li et al 2020 meanwhile ammonia oxidation also produces nitrite a fraction of which is protonated to form free nitrous acid fna i e hno2 particularly at acidic conditions the generated fna inhibits nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob zheng et al 2021 hence stopping nitrite from being further oxidized to nitrate as such the products of ammonium oxidation i e nitrite and its protonated form fna are self sustained in an acidic activated sludge process duan et al 2019 li et al 2020 wang et al 2021b 1 nh 4 1 5 o 2 no 2 2 h h 2 o however the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob commonly found in conventional activated sludge e g nitrosomonas cease to function at acidic ph 6 0 and fna at parts per million ppm mg n l 1 levels therefore unable to sustain protons and nitrite in an acidic activated sludge process intriguingly in the lately demonstrated acidic activated sludge process a new aob genus candidatus ca nitrosoglobus was detected based on 16s rrna gene sequencing analyses wang et al 2021b ca nitrosoglobus was firstly described as a new phylogenetic aob branch in 2017 with an isolate ca nitrosoglobus terrae from acidic soil samples hayatsu et al 2017 the detection of ca nitrosoglobus in the acidic activated sludge systems in the latest studies wang et al 2021b suggest that this aob may play a critical role in sustaining the acidic ph but it is poorly understood hitherto due to its low abundance i e 2 in the total community this study aims to bridge the knowledge gap by stoichiometrically and kinetically characterizing a highly enriched ca nitrosoglobus culture firstly the aob was enriched in a laboratory scale mbr that was operated at ph 5 0 the mbr received synthetic wastewater containing ammonium but no organic carbon upon obtaining ca nitrosoglobus with a high relative abundance i e 50 assessed by 16s rrna gene amplicon analysis the key stoichiometric and kinetic parameters including yield maximum growth and decay rates affinity to oxygen and ammonia and susceptibility to common environmental factors e g nitrite fna ph salinity and temperature were determined the results of this study are pivotal to further development of acidic activated sludge processes which are promising for achieving nitrogen removal via pn a wang et al 2021b and sludge reduction via acidic digestion 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation experiment ca nitrosoglobus was cultivated in an mbr with a working volume of 10 l the mbr was initially inoculated with 100 ml activated sludge containing ca nitrosoglobus relative abundance 1 9 0 1 from our previous work wang et al 2021b the parent reactor received real municipal wastewater and performed nitritation at ph 4 5 5 0 as detailed in wang et al 2021b the mbr was well mixed with a magnetic stirrer at 250 rpm the operational temperature was controlled at 22 1 c in an air conditioned room compressed air was constantly supplied via an air pump at a flow rate of 1 0 l min 1 the dissolved oxygen do in the mbr was non limiting at 7 0 8 0 mg o2 l 1 as confirmed by continuous monitoring with an optical do probe mettler toledo switzerland and transmitter mettler toledo switzerland the mbr in this study was fed with synthetic wastewater with no organic carbon the synthetic feed contained ammonium nitrogen at 160 0 10 5 mg nh4 n l 1 and alkalinity of 680 5 mg caco3 l 1 with the alkalinity to ammonium molar ratio of 0 6 mol caco3 mol 1nh4 n the specific composition of feed is per liter 0 9 g of

the mbr effluent was separated from biomass via a submerged microfiltration membrane module pvdf litree purifying technology co ltd china with a total surface of 0 02 m2 and maximum pore size of 0 1 μm the mbr was operated with a ph based feeding scheme which lead to an self regulated hydraulic retention time hrt this scheme is described as follows i a desired ph was set at 5 0 ii when the measured reactor ph was lower than the set point both the influent and effluent pumps would be switched on delivering synthetic feed that contains bicarbonate to elevate the ph iii when reactor ph was higher than the set point both the influent and effluent pumps would be switched off and the ph would naturally decrease due to microbial ammonium oxidation as a result ph in the mbr was constantly maintained at 5 0 in effect a higher ammonium oxidation rate aor would trigger the operation of pumps more frequently and would thereby result in a shorter hrt this ph based feeding scheme was implemented in a programmable logic controller plc system the plc received ph signal from a ph probe via a transmitter tps australia and switched on off the influent and effluent pumps seko italia pr1 italy according to the preset ph the programming was executed in labview 2014 national instruments austin tx using custom built virtual instruments the sludge retention time srt was gradually shortened from days 0 25 no sludge was wasted giving rise to an infinite srt between days 26 55 the srt was controlled at 13 3 days through daily discharge of 0 75 l mixed liquor via a peristaltic pump seko italia pr1 italy the srt was further reduced to 12 days during days 56 75 and to 8 days during days 76 92 at the srt of 8 days aor decreased sharply signaling the wash out of aob afterwards the srt was readjusted to 10 days and was maintained till the end of this study under which the aor stabilized in the mbr the effluent sample was taken once per week for the analysis of nitrogen species ammonium nitrite and nitrate triplicated mixed liquor samples on days 0 30 and 200 were stored in an 80 c freezer before microbial analysis during the steady state days 200 240 biomass was collected for stoichiometric and kinetic characterizations based on batch experiments 2 3 dna extraction amplicon sequencing phylogenetic analysis and quantification of amoa genes the dna was extracted using fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals santa ana ca following the protocol provided by the manufacturer the quality and quantity of the extracted dna were checked by gel electrophoresis and

firstly the 16s rrna gene library was prepared following the workflow outlined by illumina the universal primers 926f 5 aaactyaaakgaattgrcgg 3 and 1392r 5 acgggcggtgwgtrc 3 were used to amplify the v6

diego california 2 y 3 43 mg o 2 mg n h 4 n o x y g e n c o n s u m p t i o n mg o 2 l 1 a m m o n i u m c o n s u m p t i o n mg n h 4 n l 1 where 3 43 mg o2 mg 1nh4 n means that 3 43 mg oxygen is consumed per mg ammonium oxidation to nitrite according to stoichiometry in reality the ratio of oxygen consumption ammonium consumption would be lower than 3 43 because ammonium can be assimilated into biomass for bacterial growth here heterotrophic bacterial growth is assumed to be negligible since no cod is supplemented into the batch test therefore ammonium assimilation by aob is the only cause for the observed discrepancy between the theoretical ratio 3 43 mg o2 mg 1nh4 n and the measured oxygen consumption ammonium consumption ratio 2 4 2 maximum growth rate μ m and decay rate b the maximum growth rate μ m and decay rate b were estimated from an incubation batch test and the mass balance of the mbr incubation test the incubation test was conducted in triplicate in 250 ml erlenmeyer cell culture flasks at 22 c for each flask 5 ml mixed liquor from the mbr was suspended in 95 ml modified schmidt growth media bollmann et al 2011 the media was buffered with 80 mm 2 morpholinoethanesulfonic acid mes to maintain ph at 5 0 the initial ammonium was controlled at 70 mg n l 1 via dosing a pre calculated volume 1 ml of nh4cl stock solution 70 g nh4 n l 1 the flask was equipped with vent caps which ensure continuous gas exchange while prevent leakage through constant rotary shaking at 150 rpm the do in the flask was constantly higher than 5 mg o2 l 1 as verified with an optical do probe mettler toledo switzerland the incubation test lasted for around 8 days until ammonium was depleted during which 1 ml sample was withdrawn at 12 hour intervals for nitrogen analysis mass balance of mbr in the steady state of mbr the aob concentration x aob mg cod l 1 is related to the decay rate b via eq 3 deduction in supplementary material 3 x aob y r b 1 s r t where y mg cod mg 1 n denotes the yield obtained in section 2 3 1 b d 1 is the decay rate x aob mg cod l 1 denotes aob concentration r mg n l 1 d 1 is the aor in the mbr in steady state estimation of μ m and b the nitrogen transformation during the incubation tests can be modelled by an incubation model as detailed in wang et al 2020 since x aob can be expressed as a function of b eq 3 μ m and b are only unknowns which can be estimated through fitting the nitrogen profiles in the aquasim software reichert 1998 the standard errors and 95 confidence intervals of μ m and b were calculated from the mean square fitting errors and the sensitivities of the parameters a gradient search technique was used to find the surface of the confidence region batstone et al 2009 2003 2 4 3 apparent oxygen affinity

initial ammonium was supplemented at 70 mg n l 1 via dosing a pre calculated volume 1 ml of nh4cl stock solution 70 g nh4 n l 1 the ph was manually controlled at 5 0 by adding 0 1 m naoh each batch test lasted 50 min during which 2 3 ml mixed liquor was taken at 10 min intervals to quantify nitrogen species the ammonium oxidation rate was determined as the deprivation rate of ammonium by linearly fitting the ammonium profile in prism graphpad v 8 00 san diego california using aor r measured at the corresponding s o 2 ko was estimated via non linear least square regression of the monod equation r r m s o 2 s o 2 k o r m denotes the maximum aor the 95 confidence interval of ko was determined through the in built model in prism graphpad v 8 00 san diego california to assess the effect of mass transfer limitation on ko value the ko estimation was performed for two different floc sizes the original size and a reduced size after sonication the sonication was conducted for 10 min in a 70 w sonicator the sonication caused negligible activity loss of the sludge as shown in literature biggs and lant 2000 which was verified via our tests in this study 2 4 4 apparent total ammonia

value was estimated via non linear least square regression of the monod equation and the 95 confidence interval of ks was obtained through the in built model in prism graphpad v 8 00 san diego california 2 5 susceptibility to environmental factors 2 5 1 nitrite and fna the effects of nitrite and fna were evaluated by measuring the our attributable to ammonium oxidation detailed in 2 5 2 under different nitrite and fna concentrations during each measurement ph was maintained at 5 0 and the initial ammonium concentration of 70 mg n l 1 was achieved by dosing 1 ml ammonium chloride stock solution the nitrite were controlled at a concentration gradient from 100 to 3000 mg no2 n l 1 by dosing corresponding amounts of sodium nitrite stock solution 10 g no2 n l 1 resulting in an fna concentration range of 2 4 71 2 mg hno2 n l 1 at 22 c fna concentration c hn o 2 mg hno2 n l 1 was calculated based on the total nitrite concentration c no 2 mg no2 n l 1 ph and temperature t c anthonisen et al 1976 4 c hn o 2 c no 2 e 2300 273 t 10 ph 2 5 2 salinity the effects of salinity on aor were assessed by determining the our attributable to ammonium oxidation details in 2 5 2 under a variety of nacl concentrations namely 0 0 5 1 2 and 4 in each our determination ph was maintained at 5 0 initial ammonium was dosed at 70 mg n l 1 by adding 1 ml of nh4cl stock solution 70 g nh4 n l 1 to avoid ammonium limitation and fa inhibition 2 5 3 ph the effect of ph on aor was evaluated by measuring the our derived from ammonium oxidation details in 2 5 2 under varying ph values 2 0 2 5 3 5 4 5 5 5 6 5 7 5 8 5 and 9 0 the initial ammonium concentration was spiked at 70 mg n l 1 through dosing 1 ml of nh4cl stock solution 70 g nh4 n l 1 2 5 4 temperature the temperature dependency of aor was investigated using batch assays the our derived from ammonium oxidation 2 5 2 was measured under temperatures at 13 15 17 19 20 25 27 and 29 c respectively the relationship between our and temperature t can be expressed using the simplified arrhenius equation sözen et al 1996 5 ou r t ou r 20 θ t 20 where our t is the our measured at temperature t c and θ is the temperature coefficient with the our determined at different temperatures the temperature coefficient was obtained by least square nonlinear regression of the simplified arrhenius equation above in prism graphpad v 8 00 san diego california furthermore the activation energy of the ammonium oxidation reaction mediated by ca nitrosoglobus was estimated by linearly regressing the natural logarithm of our t ln our t against 1 rt as shown in the following equation 6 ln ou r t e a r t 273 ln a where e a is the activation energy j mol 1 r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 and a the frequency factor of the reaction the linear regression was also performed in prism graphpad v 8 00 san diego california 2 6 analytical methods 2 6 1 chemical analysis mixed liquor was sampled by syringes and filtered immediately through 0 45 μm disposable sterile millipore filters merck u s the concentrations of nitrite nitrate and ammonium nitrogen were assayed with a lachat quickchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wi 2 6 2 determination of our arising from ammonium oxidation the total ourtotal consisted of three components ourammonium attributable to ammonium oxidation ourendogenous from endogenous respiration through oxidizing the decayed biomass and ourchem from chemical oxidation of nitrite under ph 4 5 udert et al 2005 a 1 l respirometer was used to determine the our under different experimental conditions the respirometer contained an oxygen electrode mettler toledo switzerland and a ph electrode tps australia both of which were connected to a computer for data acquisition through labview 2014 national instruments austin tx one liter of enriched culture in the respirometer was aerated with compressed air till do was above 8 mg o2 l 1 then the respirometer was tightly sealed and do was recorded every 0 5 second the our was determined by linear regression of the raw respirograms do profile against time the ph was controlled at the desired value during the our determination through an automatic ph controlling system to measure ourammonium sludge from the mbr was washed by 0 1 m phosphate buffer solution pbs for three times to remove residual ammonium and nitrite firstly ourendogenous was determined by respiration experiment in the absence of ammonium then the total our ourtotal was determined in the presence of desired ammonium concentrations through dosing corresponding amounts of the nh4cl stock solution 70 g nh4 n l 1 the ourammonium was calculated according to eq 7 at ph above 4 5 the difference between ourtotal and ourendogenous was the ourammonium due to the absence of nitrite oxidizers at ph lower than 4 5 nitrite can be rapidly oxidized to nitrate via chemical reactions no nitrite accumulation was observed which also contributed to oxygen consumption ourchem in this case ourammonium was determined according to stoichiometric relations i e 1 mg nh4 n oxidation to no2 n consumed 3 42 mg o2 and 1 mg no2 n

nitrosoglobus the mbr was operated continuously for 240 days to enrich ca nitrosoglobus the synthetic feed contained roughly 0 6 mol caco3 mol 1nh4 n inadequate to neutralize the protons produced from ammonium oxidation 1 mol caco3 is required per mol nh4 n oxidation eq 1 as a result the ph dropped to 5 0 when approximately 60 of influent ammonium was oxidized with the ph based feeding section 2 1 further ph drop driven by ammonium oxidation would trigger the feeding which contained bicarbonate alkalinity and ammonium as such the ph and ammonium in the mbr were maintained at constant levels i e 5 0 and 58 2 4 6 mg nh4 n l 1 fig 1 a respectively the product of ammonium oxidation i e nitrite therefore stabilized at 98 0 2 6 mg no2 n l 1 which formed 2 3 0 1 mg hno2 n l 1 fna at ph 5 low concentrations of nitrate 2 3 0 4 mg no3 n l 1 were observed in the effluent indicating the long term stable nitritation the variations of aor mg n l 1 d is presented in fig 1b along with the hrt aor kept increasing during days 0 70 as the srt was progressively decreased to 12 days when the srt was further shortened to 8 days during days 70 90 the aor started to decrease sharply therefore from day 90 onwards the srt was fixed at 10 days till the end of the study and the aor stabilized at 0 12 0 01 kg n m 3 d 1 as a result of the ph based feeding strategy the hrt varied synchronously with the aor section 2 1 hrt decreased from 100 to 0 6 day in the period of day 0 70 then increased to 0 9 day during day 70 90 and finally stabilized at 0 83 0 03 day this suggested stable operation of the mbr over the last 120 days the microbial community variations were monitored with 16s rrna gene sequencing and qpcr the relative abundance of ca nitrosoglobus like population increased from 1 1 0 2 on day 0 to 38 5 1 0 on day 30 and further to 55 1 0 5 on day 200 steady state no other known ammonia oxidizers or nitrite oxidizers were detected the qpcr results of amoa functional genes show the abundance of ca nitrsoglobus reached 4 23 107 copies ml 1 mixed liquor on day 200 the results of 16s rrna gene sequencing and amoa gene quantification together demonstrated the successful enrichment of ca nitrosoglobus the top 20 genera in the microbial community are presented in fig s2 on day 200 apart from the most abundant genus ca nitrosoglobus heterotrophic bacteria belonging to genera mycobaterium weeksellaceae and ottowia were detected at a relative abundance of 11 0 0 8 6 6 0 1 and 5 2 0 6 respectively despite the absence of organics their growth were presumably supported by the decayed biomass rittmann et al 1994 nevertheless none of these heterotrophs have been reported to possess an ammonia oxidation capability therefore ca nitrosoglobus was likely responsible for the observed ammonia oxidation under acidic and fna rich conditions in the mbr based on the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree fig 2 the ca nitrosoglobus asv shares 99 8 16s rrna gene similarity with a γ proteobacterial aob γ aob ca nitrosoglobus terrae which was recently isolated from acidic agricultural soil hayatsu et al 2017 the enriched ca nitrosoglobus is closely related to other γ aob species within nitrosococcus genus with the 16s rrna gene similarity values of 96 0 95 6 and 94 0 to nitrosococcus halophilus nc 4 nitrosococcus watsonii c 113 nitrosococcus oceani respectively however this asv is distantly related to known beta proteobacterial aob β aob genera including nitrosomonas and nitrosospira and comammox nitrospira 3 2 stoichiometric and kinetic characterization the biomass of the mbr at the steady state day 200 240 was taken for stoichiometric and kinetic characterization of the ca nitrosoglobus enrichment culture the obtained parameter values are summarized in table 1 3 3 1 yield y the slope of total oxygen consumption against ammonium consumption was determined to be 3 27 r 2 0 99 fig 3 according to eq 2 the yield of the ca nitrosoglobus aob was estimated to be 0 15 mg biomass cod mg 1nh4 n oxidized the yield of ca nitrosoglobus enrichment culture is comparable to that of other aob cultures representing a typical chemoautotrophic lifestyle table s1 3 3 2 maximum growth rate and decay rate the maximum growth rate μ m and decay rate b of aob are crucial kinetic parameters for the design of nutrient removal activated sludge systems as they jointly determin the minimum srt value allowed for nitrification at 22 c and ph 5 the μ m and b for the ca nitrosoglobus aob were estimated to be 0 32 0 03 d 1 and 0 16 0 03 d 1 respectively fig 4 the estimated μ m is much lower than that of β aob nitrosomonas europea 1 42 d 1 27 c belser and schmidt 1980 and the default value 0 8 d 1 20 c recommended in activated sludge models asms for the design of the conventional activated sludge process henze et al 2000 in contrast the μ m value is close to that of a β aob nitrosospira culture 0 57 d 1 27 c martikainen and nurmiaho lassila 1985 and γ aob e g a representative nitrosococcus oceani strain 0 21 0 33 d 1 25 c el sheikh and klotz 2008 the b value was only estimated for mixed cultures in activated sludge systems with a typical value of 0 1 d 1 20 c in asms ca nitrosoglobus has a relatively higher b value which could be related to their acidic and nitrite rich living environment 3 3 3 apparent affinities to oxygen and ammonia the apparent affinity constant with respect to oxygen ko of ca nitrosoglobus was estimated to be 0 97 0 41 mg o2 l 1 fig 5 a higher than the reported values for other known aob table s3 0 16 0 79 mg o2 l 1 floc size induced resistance could be a factor limiting oxygen transfer during the measurement to exclude this effect biomass was sonicated for 10 min before ko measurement as previously reported blackburne et al 2007 which successfully reduced the volumetric median floc size from 152 to 68 μm the characterization of the sonicated biomass generated a similar relatively high apparent oxygen affinity constant 0 92 0 34 mg o2 l 1 fig s4 the total ammonia affinity constant ks of the ca nitrosoglobus was estimated as 13 5 3 3 mg nh4 nh3 n l 1 at ph 5 0 the value is at the upper end of the range of that of the nitrosomonas related cultures table s3 0 07 46 2 mg n l 1 particularly it is much higher than the value of 1 mg n l 1 recommended in asms henze et al 2000 the total ammonia affinity constant of the ca nitrosoglobus enrichment culture is also higher than that of other aob including nitrosospira 2 5 10 mg n l 1 bollmann et al 2005 jiang and bakken 1999 and nitrosococcus 2 8 mg n l 1 ward 1987 the affinity constant of ca nitrosoglobus is calculated to be 0 6 0 0 μg nh3 n l 1 at ph 5 0 assuming ammonia rather than ammonium is the true substrate this result is 1 4 orders of magnitude lower than those of other bacterial ammonia oxidizers kits et al 2017 and close to that of ammonia oxidizing archaea martens habbena et al 2009 the molecular mechanism of the high nh3 affinity remains to be further investigated 3 4 susceptibility to environmental factors to shed light on the robustness of the acidic activated sludge process to varying environmental conditions to be encountered in real life applications the susceptibility of ca nitrosoglobus to four critical environmental factors namely nitrite fna salinity ph and temperature were further investigated using batch assays these results are presented in figs 6 and 7 fig 6a shows that the our of the enriched culture declined as nitrite was progressively increased from 100 to 3000 mg n l 1 at a constant ph value of 5 0 corresponding to fna concentrations of 2 4 71 2 mg hno2 n l 1 to distinguish the effects of fna from nitrite the experiments were also conducted at ph 7 5 under which fna was negligible even if nitrite was up to 3000 mg n l 1 the results showed that nitrite up to 3000 mg n l 1 at ph 7 5 barely impacted the activity of ca nitrosoglobus fig s5 thus the activity decline at ph 5 should be mainly due to fna indeed fna is known as an inhibiting and or inactivating chemical for nitrifying microorganisms vadivelu et al 2007 2006 wang et al 2014 however the ic50 of fna for ca nitrosoglobus at which 50 of activity is lost was identified at a much higher level 29 5 mg hno2 n l 1 than that 1 mg n l 1 of any other known nitrifiers li et al 2020 vadivelu et al 2007 wang et al 2014 suggesting the high tolerance to fna of this organism previously known γ aob nitrosococcus are halophiles growing optimally at 3 4 nacl campbell et al 2011 wang et al 2016 ca nitrosoglobus terrae which originated from acidic soils was also found to maintain unjeopardized activity when exposed to 1 nacl hayatsu et al 2017 similarly β aob genera including nitrosomonas and nitrosospira can resist 2 nacl with an unaltered activity li et al 2018 macfarlane and herbert 1984 however the enriched ca nitrosoglobus culture in this study was found to lose 50 activity when exposed to 1 nacl fig 6b indicating high sensitivity to saline condition ca nitrosoglobus culture can oxidize ammonia at a very broad ph range from 2 to 9 fig 6c although the optimal ph was identified to be 5 5 comparable activities were achieved between ph 4 5 to 8 5 the ability to work under strongly acidic condition e g ph 2 is congruent with literature hayatsu et al 2017 making ca nitrosoglobus the only identified acid tolerant aob genus hitherto in comparison the nitrosomonas aob often cease to function at ph 5 6 fumasoli et al 2015 and nitrosospira despite being isolated from acidic soils were also found to be acid intolerant in pure culture jiang and bakken 1999 fig 7 illustrates the temperature dependence of the our attributed to the ca nitrosoglobus like enrichment culture generally the oxygen uptake activity increased with temperature rising from 13 29 c which can be satisfactorily fitted with the arrhenius equation r2 0 93 fig 7a the temperature coefficient θ was estimated to be 1 105 indicating that the activity of ca nitrosoglobus is highly dependent on temperature the estimated θ value remains within the reported range 1 045 1 172 for microbial ammonium oxidation guo et al 2010 further the activation energy of the ammonium oxidation process mediated by ca nitrosoglobus was determined to be 109 8 kj mol 1 fig 7b 3 5 implications to the development of acidic activated sludge processes acidic activated sludge processes including acidic nitritation and acidic sludge treatment have opened up new opportunities to address the main challenges in wwtps i e attaining satisfied pollutant removal while minimizing operational costs in the reported acidic activated sludge processes a new aob population ca nitrosoglobus was detected wang et al 2021b this study further obtained an elaborate set of stoichiometric and kinetic parameters on an enriched ca nitrosoglobus culture which are essential to the design and further development of acidic activated sludge processes in an activated sludge system the srt is a critical design parameter the minimum srt for retaining ca nitrosoglobus is calculated to be 5 10 days based on its maximum specific growth rate 0 32 0 03 d 1 and the decay rate 0 16 0 03 d 1 in practice the srt required for the acidic activated sludge systems should be even longer due to potential negative impacts of environmental factors such as ammonium limitation on the net growth rate for instance in the previously demonstrated acidic activated sludge processes the srt was kept at up to 35 days wang et al 2021b in addition biofilm configuration can also be an efficient platform to retain ca nitrosoglobus and to perform acidic wastewater sludge treatment processes ca nitrosoglobus is featured by a low affinity to total ammonia with the affinity constant of 13 5 3 3 mg n l 1 table 1 compared with the value of 1 mg n l 1 recommended in the conventional activated sludge process henze et al 2000 the higher total ammonia affinity constant suggests it would be challenging to attain a low ammonium concentration e g 1 mg l 1 as required by the regulation limit via the acidic activated sludge process alone this suggests that the acidic pn process could be integrated with anammox with the latter removing the residual ammonium along with nitrite produced by ca nitrosoglobus however according to literature reports anammox activity can be detected within a ph range of 6 5 9 3 jin et al 2012 and the optimal ph for the growth of anammox bacteria lies in ph 6 7 8 3 strous et al 1999 therefore the low ph of acidic nitritation effluent ph 5 5 might have negative impacts on anammox to mitigate the potential negative impacts of acidic ph the acidic nitritation effluent could be mixed with an alkalinity adequate stream i e raw wastewater before feeding into the anammox reactor it should be noted that the cod in raw wastewater could promote heterotrophic denitrification which may compete nitrite with anammox bacteria as such pretreatment processes e g high rate activated sludge are recommended to separate the organic carbon from raw wastewater which can be redirected to anaerobic digestion process for bioenergy recovery the oxygen affinity constant of ca nitrosoglobus ko 0 92 0 37 mg o2 l 1 is higher than most aob table s3 as well as the majority of nob 0 13 1 69 mg o2 l 1 blackburne et al 2007 park et al 2017 it implies that low do which is widely adopted to suppress nob in canonical nitritation systems may not be applicable to the acidic nitritation process in the reported acidic nitritation reactors do was constantly higher than 2 mg l 1 but still robust nob suppression was demonstrated wang et al 2021b the low do strategy for nob suppression albeit effective would inevitably jeopardize aob activity as well thus limiting the overall efficiency of canonical nitritation processes the acidic nitritation mediated by ca nitrosoglobus which does not rely on low do to repress nob can potentially achieve a much higher process rate than canonical nitritation processes the acidic activated sludge system could be more susceptible to ph variations compared with ph neutral systems at the ph below 6 the alkalinity i e hco3 is nearly depleted by microbial ammonium oxidation leading to a low buffering capacity of the acidic activated sludge systems as a result the alkalinity fluctuations in the influent e g real sewage which would only cause minor ph variation in alkalinity adequate systems could significantly alter the ph in alkalinity depleted acidic systems albeit the potential ph variations acidic stable nitritation performance can still be achieved by ca nitrosoglobus as the characterization results show that ca nitrosoglobus can carry out ammonium oxidation within a wide ph range of 2 9 fig 6c 3 6 implications to the occurrence of ca nitrosoglobus in activated sludge ca nitrosoglobus is rarely detected in conventional activated sludge in the conventional activated sludge process nitrosomonas is generally the dominating ammonia oxidizer attributable to its relatively high growth rate table s3 1 42 1 52 d 1 at 27 c recently it was found that comammox nitrospira could play an important role in wastewater treatment systems operated at low do low ammonium and long srt roots et al 2019 possibly due to its high substrate affinity ks 0 009 0 6 nh4 nh3 n l 1 kits et al 2017 in comparison the low net growth rate and low oxygen total ammonia affinities of ca nitrosoglobus suggest that ca nitrosoglobus would not be competitive with fast growing r strategist e g nitrosomonas in eutrophic conditions or with efficient scavenging k strategist e g comammox nitrospira in oligotrophic conditions therefore ca nitrosoglobus has been barely detected in conventional near ph neutral activated sludge as revealed in this study ca nitrosoglobus has strong resistance to adverse environmental factors such as acidic ph 6 and ppm levels of fna this unique acid and fna resistance defines ca nitrosoglobus as an adversity strategist a strategist greenslade 1983 as opposed to the conventional r strategist and k strategist a strategists tend to prosper in adverse conditions and in the case of ca nitrosoglobus at ph of 4 5 and in situ fna of 2 8 ppm wang et al 2021a as a result ca nitrosoglobus earned a unique niche and prevailed in such acidic and fna rich systems where no other known ammonia oxidizers are able to survive it is notable that the another member from the ca nitrosoglobus genus i e ca nitrosoglobus terrae isolated from acidic soils also bears comparable acid and fna resistance however ca nitrosoglobus terrae has a much lower affinity to total ammonia ks 819 mg nh4 nh3 n l 1 hayatsu et al 2017 and a higher salt tolerance up to 1 nacl than this activated sludge originated ca nitrosoglobus the low total ammonia affinity makes the soil originated ca nitrosoglobus terrae unlikely to prosper in engineered acidic activated sludge systems although the distinct physiological properties suggest that the enriched ca nitrosoglobus might be a new species this hypothesis is not supported by the current 16s rrna gene similarity comparison based on illumina amplicon sequencing which only retrieved short 16s rrna sequences e g 466 bp full length 16s rrna gene and genome comparison is required in future studies to shed a more accurate light on the identification on a species level 4 conclusions this study characterized the stoichiometry and kinetics of a new aob ca nitrosoglobus enriched in activated sludge in a lab scale mbr operated at ph 5 0 and in situ fna concentration of 2 3 0 1 mg hno2 n l 1 ca nitrosoglobus became the only known ammonia oxidizer with a relative abundance of 55 1 0 5 based on 16s rrna gene sequencing the yield maximum growth and decay rates were estimated and the results indicate a relatively low net growth rate compared to other aob species the sludge originated ca nitrosoglobus have relatively low affinities to oxygen and total ammonia compared to other aob commonly found in activated sludge these render ca nitrosoglobus uncompetitive with traditional r strategist or k strategist ammonia oxidizers in current activated sludge systems however ca nitrosoglobus possesses strong resistance to acidic ph as low as 2 0 and high fna ic50 of 29 5 mg hno2 n l 1 the acid and fna resistance made ca nitrosoglobus an a strategist prospering under these adverse conditions where no other ammonia oxidizers and nitrite oxidizers can survive these findings provide support to the design and operation of acidic activated sludge processes in which ca nitrosoglobus can play a critical role declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

17073,recently acidic i e ph 5 nitrification in activated sludge is attracting attention because it enables stable nitritation nh4 no2 and enhances sludge reduction and stabilization however the key acid tolerant ammonia oxidizers involved are poorly understood in this study we performed stoichiometric and kinetic characterization of a new acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing bacterium aob belonging to gamma proteobacterium candidatus nitrosoglobus ca nitrosoglobus was cultivated in activated sludge in a laboratory membrane bioreactor over 200 days with a relative abundance of 55 1 0 5 indicated by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing at the time of the characterization experiments among all known nitrifiers ca nitrosoglobus bears the highest resistance to nitrite low ph and free nitrous acid fna these traits define ca nitrosoglobus as an adversity strategist that tends to prosper in acidic activated sludge where the low ph 5 0 and high levels of fna at parts per million levels sustained and inhibited all other nitrifiers in contrast in the conventional ph neutral activated sludge process ca nitrosoglobus is less competitive with canonical aob e g nitrosomonas due to the relatively slow specific growth rate and low affinities to both oxygen and total ammonia these results advance our understanding of acid tolerant ammonia oxidizers and support further development of the acidic activated sludge process in which ca nitrosoglobus can play a critical role graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords acidic acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing bacteria candidatus nitrosoglobus stoichiometry kinetics 1 introduction activated sludge is a well established and widely used process in wastewater treatment plants wwtps for the biological treatment of wastewater the activated sludge process is generally operated at near neutral ph at which diverse biological reactions take place to remove the pollutants in wastewater for example nitrogen as a key nutrient leading to eutrophication is generally removed via nitrification nh4 no2 no3 and denitrification no3 no2 n2 in recent years a novel nitrogen removal process the so called pn a process has been proposed which achieves nitrogen removal via the nitritation nh4 no2 and anammox nh4 no2 n2 reactions compared to the conventional nitrification and denitrification process the pn a process reduces aeration demand by 60 and eliminates the need for carbon sources kartal et al 2010 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 despite enormous efforts the application of pn a in municipal wastewater treatment is still hampered by the challenge of achieving stable nitritation agrawal et al 2018 cao et al 2017 xu et al 2015 another major challenge of the activated sludge process is the high cost associated with the handling and disposal of the excess sludge a by product generated during wastewater treatment this process incurs up to 60 of the total operational expenditures in wwtps collivignarelli et al 2015 qian et al 2016 the acidic activated sludge process has opened up a new path to address the challenges aforementioned in a conventional activated sludge process the novel process operated at acidic conditions i e ph 4 5 can enable stable nitritation li et al 2020 wang et al 2021b and also reduce and stabilize excess sludge duan et al 2019 wang et al 2021a for instance in a fully aerated membrane bioreactor mbr operated at ph 4 5 5 0 for real mainstream wastewater treatment robust nitritation i e high no2 no2 no3 ratio of 95 5 was maintained for a year and the obtained volumetric nh4 removal rate i e 188 14 mg n l 1 d 1 was also practically useful wang et al 2021b in a follow up study the acidic activated sludge from the mbr was inoculated into a post aerobic digestion reactor receiving anaerobically digested ad sludge the inoculation rapidly acidified the sludge to ph around 5 0 and achieved up to 30 reduction of volatile solids vs of ad sludge wang et al 2021a which was regarded hardly biodegradable in previous studies novak et al 2011 parravicini et al 2008a b tomei et al 2011a b notedly low ph in the acidic activated sludge process was not attained by adding chemical acids e g hcl but self sustained by microbial ammonia oxidation eq 1 the oxidation of one mole ammonium nh4 generates two mole protons h which causes ph to decrease the ph could drop to below 5 0 in a system where alkalinity in the wastewater sludge is inadequate to buffer the generated protons li et al 2020 meanwhile ammonia oxidation also produces nitrite a fraction of which is protonated to form free nitrous acid fna i e hno2 particularly at acidic conditions the generated fna inhibits nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob zheng et al 2021 hence stopping nitrite from being further oxidized to nitrate as such the products of ammonium oxidation i e nitrite and its protonated form fna are self sustained in an acidic activated sludge process duan et al 2019 li et al 2020 wang et al 2021b 1 nh 4 1 5 o 2 no 2 2 h h 2 o however the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob commonly found in conventional activated sludge e g nitrosomonas cease to function at acidic ph 6 0 and fna at parts per million ppm mg n l 1 levels therefore unable to sustain protons and nitrite in an acidic activated sludge process intriguingly in the lately demonstrated acidic activated sludge process a new aob genus candidatus ca nitrosoglobus was detected based on 16s rrna gene sequencing analyses wang et al 2021b ca nitrosoglobus was firstly described as a new phylogenetic aob branch in 2017 with an isolate ca nitrosoglobus terrae from acidic soil samples hayatsu et al 2017 the detection of ca nitrosoglobus in the acidic activated sludge systems in the latest studies wang et al 2021b suggest that this aob may play a critical role in sustaining the acidic ph but it is poorly understood hitherto due to its low abundance i e 2 in the total community this study aims to bridge the knowledge gap by stoichiometrically and kinetically characterizing a highly enriched ca nitrosoglobus culture firstly the aob was enriched in a laboratory scale mbr that was operated at ph 5 0 the mbr received synthetic wastewater containing ammonium but no organic carbon upon obtaining ca nitrosoglobus with a high relative abundance i e 50 assessed by 16s rrna gene amplicon analysis the key stoichiometric and kinetic parameters including yield maximum growth and decay rates affinity to oxygen and ammonia and susceptibility to common environmental factors e g nitrite fna ph salinity and temperature were determined the results of this study are pivotal to further development of acidic activated sludge processes which are promising for achieving nitrogen removal via pn a wang et al 2021b and sludge reduction via acidic digestion 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation experiment ca nitrosoglobus was cultivated in an mbr with a working volume of 10 l the mbr was initially inoculated with 100 ml activated sludge containing ca nitrosoglobus relative abundance 1 9 0 1 from our previous work wang et al 2021b the parent reactor received real municipal wastewater and performed nitritation at ph 4 5 5 0 as detailed in wang et al 2021b the mbr was well mixed with a magnetic stirrer at 250 rpm the operational temperature was controlled at 22 1 c in an air conditioned room compressed air was constantly supplied via an air pump at a flow rate of 1 0 l min 1 the dissolved oxygen do in the mbr was non limiting at 7 0 8 0 mg o2 l 1 as confirmed by continuous monitoring with an optical do probe mettler toledo switzerland and transmitter mettler toledo switzerland the mbr in this study was fed with synthetic wastewater with no organic carbon the synthetic feed contained ammonium nitrogen at 160 0 10 5 mg nh4 n l 1 and alkalinity of 680 5 mg caco3 l 1 with the alkalinity to ammonium molar ratio of 0 6 mol caco3 mol 1nh4 n the specific composition of feed is per liter 0 9 g of nh4hco3 160 mg nh4 n 0 072 g of nah2po4 0 184 g of nacl 0 035 g of mgso4 7h2o 0 072 g of nah2po4 0 029 g kcl and 0 3 ml of trace element stock solution prepared as described previously wang et al 2020 the mbr effluent was separated from biomass via a submerged microfiltration membrane module pvdf litree purifying technology co ltd china with a total surface of 0 02 m2 and maximum pore size of 0 1 μm the mbr was operated with a ph based feeding scheme which lead to an self regulated hydraulic retention time hrt this scheme is described as follows i a desired ph was set at 5 0 ii when the measured reactor ph was lower than the set point both the influent and effluent pumps would be switched on delivering synthetic feed that contains bicarbonate to elevate the ph iii when reactor ph was higher than the set point both the influent and effluent pumps would be switched off and the ph would naturally decrease due to microbial ammonium oxidation as a result ph in the mbr was constantly maintained at 5 0 in effect a higher ammonium oxidation rate aor would trigger the operation of pumps more frequently and would thereby result in a shorter hrt this ph based feeding scheme was implemented in a programmable logic controller plc system the plc received ph signal from a ph probe via a transmitter tps australia and switched on off the influent and effluent pumps seko italia pr1 italy according to the preset ph the programming was executed in labview 2014 national instruments austin tx using custom built virtual instruments the sludge retention time srt was gradually shortened from days 0 25 no sludge was wasted giving rise to an infinite srt between days 26 55 the srt was controlled at 13 3 days through daily discharge of 0 75 l mixed liquor via a peristaltic pump seko italia pr1 italy the srt was further reduced to 12 days during days 56 75 and to 8 days during days 76 92 at the srt of 8 days aor decreased sharply signaling the wash out of aob afterwards the srt was readjusted to 10 days and was maintained till the end of this study under which the aor stabilized in the mbr the effluent sample was taken once per week for the analysis of nitrogen species ammonium nitrite and nitrate triplicated mixed liquor samples on days 0 30 and 200 were stored in an 80 c freezer before microbial analysis during the steady state days 200 240 biomass was collected for stoichiometric and kinetic characterizations based on batch experiments 2 3 dna extraction amplicon sequencing phylogenetic analysis and quantification of amoa genes the dna was extracted using fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals santa ana ca following the protocol provided by the manufacturer the quality and quantity of the extracted dna were checked by gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometer analysis nanodrop technologies wilmington de usa respectively amplicon sequencing of the extracted dna was conducted at the australian centre for ecogenomics brisbane australia firstly the 16s rrna gene library was prepared following the workflow outlined by illumina the universal primers 926f 5 aaactyaaakgaattgrcgg 3 and 1392r 5 acgggcggtgwgtrc 3 were used to amplify the v6 v8 regions of the 16s rrna genes through polymerase chain reaction pcr using nebnext ultratm ii q5 mastermix new england biolabs the obtained pcr amplicons were purified using agencourt ampure xp beads beckman coulter after purification the pcr amplicons were indexed with unique 8 bp barcodes using the illumina nextera xt 384 sample index kit a d illumina fc 131 1002 afterwards the indexed amplicons were pooled together in equimolar concentrations and sequenced on a miseq sequencing system illumina in paired end mode according to manufacturer s protocol raw reads were processed using dada2 with default parameters to infer amplicon sequencing variants asvs of length 250 bp these asvs were classified against the silva small subunit ssu database release 138 callahan et al 2016 quast et al 2013 to investigate the phylogenetic placement of the aob found in this study a 16s rrna gene phylogenetic tree was inferred briefly the 16s rrna gene of this aob was aligned with that of known ammonia oxidizers i e comammox nitrospira nitrosomonas nitrosospira nitrosococcus and ca nitrosoglobus terrae in mafft v 7 055b parameters auto reorder katoh et al 2005 the alignment was used to infer a maximum likelihood tree in iqtree with 1000 bootstrap iterations v 1 6 12 parameters alrt 1000 bb 1000 m test nguyen et al 2015 with the extracted total dna the copy numbers of the ca nitrosoglobus amoa functional gene were further quantified by real time pcr the amoa primers tttggttgactggaaagatcg and gatactgggacaacatccttacc were adopted which was specifically designed for ca nitrosoglobus hayatsu et al 2017 the amoa genes amplification was carried out under the following cycling conditions 94 c for 2 min 40 cycles of 30 s at 94 c 30 s at 58 c 45 s at 72 c and assessment at 72 c a standard curve was obtained using the constructed plasmids which contains the target gene i e ca nitrosoglobus specific amoa gene the results were expressed as gene copies ml 1 mixed liquor 2 4 determination of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters 2 4 1 yield y chemoautotrophic yield of ammonia oxidation was determined using batch tests with different initial ammonium dosages s n h 4 0 the initial ammonium concentrations were controlled at 10 30 50 100 200 300 and 500 mg n l 1 by dosing pre calculated amounts of the nh4cl stock solution 70 g nh4 n l 1 during each batch test compressed air was constantly supplied via an air pump at a flow rate of 1 5 l min 1 until ammonium was depleted the real time oxygen uptake rate our derived from ammonia oxidation was measured with an online our device details in supplementary material the total oxygen consumption mg o2 l 1 was calculated as the integral of our over time for each batch test the yield y mg cod mg 1nh4 n was then estimated based on eq 2 the slope of the oxygen consumption mg o2 l 1 against the total ammonium consumption mg n l 1 was obtained through the in built simple linear regression function in prism v 8 00 san diego california 2 y 3 43 mg o 2 mg n h 4 n o x y g e n c o n s u m p t i o n mg o 2 l 1 a m m o n i u m c o n s u m p t i o n mg n h 4 n l 1 where 3 43 mg o2 mg 1nh4 n means that 3 43 mg oxygen is consumed per mg ammonium oxidation to nitrite according to stoichiometry in reality the ratio of oxygen consumption ammonium consumption would be lower than 3 43 because ammonium can be assimilated into biomass for bacterial growth here heterotrophic bacterial growth is assumed to be negligible since no cod is supplemented into the batch test therefore ammonium assimilation by aob is the only cause for the observed discrepancy between the theoretical ratio 3 43 mg o2 mg 1nh4 n and the measured oxygen consumption ammonium consumption ratio 2 4 2 maximum growth rate μ m and decay rate b the maximum growth rate μ m and decay rate b were estimated from an incubation batch test and the mass balance of the mbr incubation test the incubation test was conducted in triplicate in 250 ml erlenmeyer cell culture flasks at 22 c for each flask 5 ml mixed liquor from the mbr was suspended in 95 ml modified schmidt growth media bollmann et al 2011 the media was buffered with 80 mm 2 morpholinoethanesulfonic acid mes to maintain ph at 5 0 the initial ammonium was controlled at 70 mg n l 1 via dosing a pre calculated volume 1 ml of nh4cl stock solution 70 g nh4 n l 1 the flask was equipped with vent caps which ensure continuous gas exchange while prevent leakage through constant rotary shaking at 150 rpm the do in the flask was constantly higher than 5 mg o2 l 1 as verified with an optical do probe mettler toledo switzerland the incubation test lasted for around 8 days until ammonium was depleted during which 1 ml sample was withdrawn at 12 hour intervals for nitrogen analysis mass balance of mbr in the steady state of mbr the aob concentration x aob mg cod l 1 is related to the decay rate b via eq 3 deduction in supplementary material 3 x aob y r b 1 s r t where y mg cod mg 1 n denotes the yield obtained in section 2 3 1 b d 1 is the decay rate x aob mg cod l 1 denotes aob concentration r mg n l 1 d 1 is the aor in the mbr in steady state estimation of μ m and b the nitrogen transformation during the incubation tests can be modelled by an incubation model as detailed in wang et al 2020 since x aob can be expressed as a function of b eq 3 μ m and b are only unknowns which can be estimated through fitting the nitrogen profiles in the aquasim software reichert 1998 the standard errors and 95 confidence intervals of μ m and b were calculated from the mean square fitting errors and the sensitivities of the parameters a gradient search technique was used to find the surface of the confidence region batstone et al 2009 2003 2 4 3 apparent oxygen affinity ko the aor r mg n l 1 h 1 were measured at ph 5 0 in batch tests with do concentration s o 2 mg o2 l 1 controlled at 0 5 1 0 1 7 3 0 5 0 8 0 mg o2 l 1 in triplicate respectively for each test the initial ammonium was supplemented at 70 mg n l 1 via dosing a pre calculated volume 1 ml of nh4cl stock solution 70 g nh4 n l 1 the ph was manually controlled at 5 0 by adding 0 1 m naoh each batch test lasted 50 min during which 2 3 ml mixed liquor was taken at 10 min intervals to quantify nitrogen species the ammonium oxidation rate was determined as the deprivation rate of ammonium by linearly fitting the ammonium profile in prism graphpad v 8 00 san diego california using aor r measured at the corresponding s o 2 ko was estimated via non linear least square regression of the monod equation r r m s o 2 s o 2 k o r m denotes the maximum aor the 95 confidence interval of ko was determined through the in built model in prism graphpad v 8 00 san diego california to assess the effect of mass transfer limitation on ko value the ko estimation was performed for two different floc sizes the original size and a reduced size after sonication the sonication was conducted for 10 min in a 70 w sonicator the sonication caused negligible activity loss of the sludge as shown in literature biggs and lant 2000 which was verified via our tests in this study 2 4 4 apparent total ammonia affinity ks ks value was determined according to monod equation our ou r m s n h 3 n h 4 s n h 3 n h 4 k s ou r m denotes the maximum our our mg o2 l 1 h 1 was measured at a gradient of total ammonia concentrations with unlimited do concentration do 7 mg o2 l 1 at ph 5 0 the details of our determination were described in section 2 5 2 similarly with the our obtained at different ammonium levels ks value was estimated via non linear least square regression of the monod equation and the 95 confidence interval of ks was obtained through the in built model in prism graphpad v 8 00 san diego california 2 5 susceptibility to environmental factors 2 5 1 nitrite and fna the effects of nitrite and fna were evaluated by measuring the our attributable to ammonium oxidation detailed in 2 5 2 under different nitrite and fna concentrations during each measurement ph was maintained at 5 0 and the initial ammonium concentration of 70 mg n l 1 was achieved by dosing 1 ml ammonium chloride stock solution the nitrite were controlled at a concentration gradient from 100 to 3000 mg no2 n l 1 by dosing corresponding amounts of sodium nitrite stock solution 10 g no2 n l 1 resulting in an fna concentration range of 2 4 71 2 mg hno2 n l 1 at 22 c fna concentration c hn o 2 mg hno2 n l 1 was calculated based on the total nitrite concentration c no 2 mg no2 n l 1 ph and temperature t c anthonisen et al 1976 4 c hn o 2 c no 2 e 2300 273 t 10 ph 2 5 2 salinity the effects of salinity on aor were assessed by determining the our attributable to ammonium oxidation details in 2 5 2 under a variety of nacl concentrations namely 0 0 5 1 2 and 4 in each our determination ph was maintained at 5 0 initial ammonium was dosed at 70 mg n l 1 by adding 1 ml of nh4cl stock solution 70 g nh4 n l 1 to avoid ammonium limitation and fa inhibition 2 5 3 ph the effect of ph on aor was evaluated by measuring the our derived from ammonium oxidation details in 2 5 2 under varying ph values 2 0 2 5 3 5 4 5 5 5 6 5 7 5 8 5 and 9 0 the initial ammonium concentration was spiked at 70 mg n l 1 through dosing 1 ml of nh4cl stock solution 70 g nh4 n l 1 2 5 4 temperature the temperature dependency of aor was investigated using batch assays the our derived from ammonium oxidation 2 5 2 was measured under temperatures at 13 15 17 19 20 25 27 and 29 c respectively the relationship between our and temperature t can be expressed using the simplified arrhenius equation sözen et al 1996 5 ou r t ou r 20 θ t 20 where our t is the our measured at temperature t c and θ is the temperature coefficient with the our determined at different temperatures the temperature coefficient was obtained by least square nonlinear regression of the simplified arrhenius equation above in prism graphpad v 8 00 san diego california furthermore the activation energy of the ammonium oxidation reaction mediated by ca nitrosoglobus was estimated by linearly regressing the natural logarithm of our t ln our t against 1 rt as shown in the following equation 6 ln ou r t e a r t 273 ln a where e a is the activation energy j mol 1 r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 and a the frequency factor of the reaction the linear regression was also performed in prism graphpad v 8 00 san diego california 2 6 analytical methods 2 6 1 chemical analysis mixed liquor was sampled by syringes and filtered immediately through 0 45 μm disposable sterile millipore filters merck u s the concentrations of nitrite nitrate and ammonium nitrogen were assayed with a lachat quickchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wi 2 6 2 determination of our arising from ammonium oxidation the total ourtotal consisted of three components ourammonium attributable to ammonium oxidation ourendogenous from endogenous respiration through oxidizing the decayed biomass and ourchem from chemical oxidation of nitrite under ph 4 5 udert et al 2005 a 1 l respirometer was used to determine the our under different experimental conditions the respirometer contained an oxygen electrode mettler toledo switzerland and a ph electrode tps australia both of which were connected to a computer for data acquisition through labview 2014 national instruments austin tx one liter of enriched culture in the respirometer was aerated with compressed air till do was above 8 mg o2 l 1 then the respirometer was tightly sealed and do was recorded every 0 5 second the our was determined by linear regression of the raw respirograms do profile against time the ph was controlled at the desired value during the our determination through an automatic ph controlling system to measure ourammonium sludge from the mbr was washed by 0 1 m phosphate buffer solution pbs for three times to remove residual ammonium and nitrite firstly ourendogenous was determined by respiration experiment in the absence of ammonium then the total our ourtotal was determined in the presence of desired ammonium concentrations through dosing corresponding amounts of the nh4cl stock solution 70 g nh4 n l 1 the ourammonium was calculated according to eq 7 at ph above 4 5 the difference between ourtotal and ourendogenous was the ourammonium due to the absence of nitrite oxidizers at ph lower than 4 5 nitrite can be rapidly oxidized to nitrate via chemical reactions no nitrite accumulation was observed which also contributed to oxygen consumption ourchem in this case ourammonium was determined according to stoichiometric relations i e 1 mg nh4 n oxidation to no2 n consumed 3 42 mg o2 and 1 mg no2 n oxidation to no3 n consumed 1 14 mg o2 7 ou r ammonium ou r total ou r endogenous p h 4 5 ou r ammonium 3 42 3 42 1 14 ou r total ou r endogenous p h 4 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 cultivation of ca nitrosoglobus the mbr was operated continuously for 240 days to enrich ca nitrosoglobus the synthetic feed contained roughly 0 6 mol caco3 mol 1nh4 n inadequate to neutralize the protons produced from ammonium oxidation 1 mol caco3 is required per mol nh4 n oxidation eq 1 as a result the ph dropped to 5 0 when approximately 60 of influent ammonium was oxidized with the ph based feeding section 2 1 further ph drop driven by ammonium oxidation would trigger the feeding which contained bicarbonate alkalinity and ammonium as such the ph and ammonium in the mbr were maintained at constant levels i e 5 0 and 58 2 4 6 mg nh4 n l 1 fig 1 a respectively the product of ammonium oxidation i e nitrite therefore stabilized at 98 0 2 6 mg no2 n l 1 which formed 2 3 0 1 mg hno2 n l 1 fna at ph 5 low concentrations of nitrate 2 3 0 4 mg no3 n l 1 were observed in the effluent indicating the long term stable nitritation the variations of aor mg n l 1 d is presented in fig 1b along with the hrt aor kept increasing during days 0 70 as the srt was progressively decreased to 12 days when the srt was further shortened to 8 days during days 70 90 the aor started to decrease sharply therefore from day 90 onwards the srt was fixed at 10 days till the end of the study and the aor stabilized at 0 12 0 01 kg n m 3 d 1 as a result of the ph based feeding strategy the hrt varied synchronously with the aor section 2 1 hrt decreased from 100 to 0 6 day in the period of day 0 70 then increased to 0 9 day during day 70 90 and finally stabilized at 0 83 0 03 day this suggested stable operation of the mbr over the last 120 days the microbial community variations were monitored with 16s rrna gene sequencing and qpcr the relative abundance of ca nitrosoglobus like population increased from 1 1 0 2 on day 0 to 38 5 1 0 on day 30 and further to 55 1 0 5 on day 200 steady state no other known ammonia oxidizers or nitrite oxidizers were detected the qpcr results of amoa functional genes show the abundance of ca nitrsoglobus reached 4 23 107 copies ml 1 mixed liquor on day 200 the results of 16s rrna gene sequencing and amoa gene quantification together demonstrated the successful enrichment of ca nitrosoglobus the top 20 genera in the microbial community are presented in fig s2 on day 200 apart from the most abundant genus ca nitrosoglobus heterotrophic bacteria belonging to genera mycobaterium weeksellaceae and ottowia were detected at a relative abundance of 11 0 0 8 6 6 0 1 and 5 2 0 6 respectively despite the absence of organics their growth were presumably supported by the decayed biomass rittmann et al 1994 nevertheless none of these heterotrophs have been reported to possess an ammonia oxidation capability therefore ca nitrosoglobus was likely responsible for the observed ammonia oxidation under acidic and fna rich conditions in the mbr based on the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree fig 2 the ca nitrosoglobus asv shares 99 8 16s rrna gene similarity with a γ proteobacterial aob γ aob ca nitrosoglobus terrae which was recently isolated from acidic agricultural soil hayatsu et al 2017 the enriched ca nitrosoglobus is closely related to other γ aob species within nitrosococcus genus with the 16s rrna gene similarity values of 96 0 95 6 and 94 0 to nitrosococcus halophilus nc 4 nitrosococcus watsonii c 113 nitrosococcus oceani respectively however this asv is distantly related to known beta proteobacterial aob β aob genera including nitrosomonas and nitrosospira and comammox nitrospira 3 2 stoichiometric and kinetic characterization the biomass of the mbr at the steady state day 200 240 was taken for stoichiometric and kinetic characterization of the ca nitrosoglobus enrichment culture the obtained parameter values are summarized in table 1 3 3 1 yield y the slope of total oxygen consumption against ammonium consumption was determined to be 3 27 r 2 0 99 fig 3 according to eq 2 the yield of the ca nitrosoglobus aob was estimated to be 0 15 mg biomass cod mg 1nh4 n oxidized the yield of ca nitrosoglobus enrichment culture is comparable to that of other aob cultures representing a typical chemoautotrophic lifestyle table s1 3 3 2 maximum growth rate and decay rate the maximum growth rate μ m and decay rate b of aob are crucial kinetic parameters for the design of nutrient removal activated sludge systems as they jointly determin the minimum srt value allowed for nitrification at 22 c and ph 5 the μ m and b for the ca nitrosoglobus aob were estimated to be 0 32 0 03 d 1 and 0 16 0 03 d 1 respectively fig 4 the estimated μ m is much lower than that of β aob nitrosomonas europea 1 42 d 1 27 c belser and schmidt 1980 and the default value 0 8 d 1 20 c recommended in activated sludge models asms for the design of the conventional activated sludge process henze et al 2000 in contrast the μ m value is close to that of a β aob nitrosospira culture 0 57 d 1 27 c martikainen and nurmiaho lassila 1985 and γ aob e g a representative nitrosococcus oceani strain 0 21 0 33 d 1 25 c el sheikh and klotz 2008 the b value was only estimated for mixed cultures in activated sludge systems with a typical value of 0 1 d 1 20 c in asms ca nitrosoglobus has a relatively higher b value which could be related to their acidic and nitrite rich living environment 3 3 3 apparent affinities to oxygen and ammonia the apparent affinity constant with respect to oxygen ko of ca nitrosoglobus was estimated to be 0 97 0 41 mg o2 l 1 fig 5 a higher than the reported values for other known aob table s3 0 16 0 79 mg o2 l 1 floc size induced resistance could be a factor limiting oxygen transfer during the measurement to exclude this effect biomass was sonicated for 10 min before ko measurement as previously reported blackburne et al 2007 which successfully reduced the volumetric median floc size from 152 to 68 μm the characterization of the sonicated biomass generated a similar relatively high apparent oxygen affinity constant 0 92 0 34 mg o2 l 1 fig s4 the total ammonia affinity constant ks of the ca nitrosoglobus was estimated as 13 5 3 3 mg nh4 nh3 n l 1 at ph 5 0 the value is at the upper end of the range of that of the nitrosomonas related cultures table s3 0 07 46 2 mg n l 1 particularly it is much higher than the value of 1 mg n l 1 recommended in asms henze et al 2000 the total ammonia affinity constant of the ca nitrosoglobus enrichment culture is also higher than that of other aob including nitrosospira 2 5 10 mg n l 1 bollmann et al 2005 jiang and bakken 1999 and nitrosococcus 2 8 mg n l 1 ward 1987 the affinity constant of ca nitrosoglobus is calculated to be 0 6 0 0 μg nh3 n l 1 at ph 5 0 assuming ammonia rather than ammonium is the true substrate this result is 1 4 orders of magnitude lower than those of other bacterial ammonia oxidizers kits et al 2017 and close to that of ammonia oxidizing archaea martens habbena et al 2009 the molecular mechanism of the high nh3 affinity remains to be further investigated 3 4 susceptibility to environmental factors to shed light on the robustness of the acidic activated sludge process to varying environmental conditions to be encountered in real life applications the susceptibility of ca nitrosoglobus to four critical environmental factors namely nitrite fna salinity ph and temperature were further investigated using batch assays these results are presented in figs 6 and 7 fig 6a shows that the our of the enriched culture declined as nitrite was progressively increased from 100 to 3000 mg n l 1 at a constant ph value of 5 0 corresponding to fna concentrations of 2 4 71 2 mg hno2 n l 1 to distinguish the effects of fna from nitrite the experiments were also conducted at ph 7 5 under which fna was negligible even if nitrite was up to 3000 mg n l 1 the results showed that nitrite up to 3000 mg n l 1 at ph 7 5 barely impacted the activity of ca nitrosoglobus fig s5 thus the activity decline at ph 5 should be mainly due to fna indeed fna is known as an inhibiting and or inactivating chemical for nitrifying microorganisms vadivelu et al 2007 2006 wang et al 2014 however the ic50 of fna for ca nitrosoglobus at which 50 of activity is lost was identified at a much higher level 29 5 mg hno2 n l 1 than that 1 mg n l 1 of any other known nitrifiers li et al 2020 vadivelu et al 2007 wang et al 2014 suggesting the high tolerance to fna of this organism previously known γ aob nitrosococcus are halophiles growing optimally at 3 4 nacl campbell et al 2011 wang et al 2016 ca nitrosoglobus terrae which originated from acidic soils was also found to maintain unjeopardized activity when exposed to 1 nacl hayatsu et al 2017 similarly β aob genera including nitrosomonas and nitrosospira can resist 2 nacl with an unaltered activity li et al 2018 macfarlane and herbert 1984 however the enriched ca nitrosoglobus culture in this study was found to lose 50 activity when exposed to 1 nacl fig 6b indicating high sensitivity to saline condition ca nitrosoglobus culture can oxidize ammonia at a very broad ph range from 2 to 9 fig 6c although the optimal ph was identified to be 5 5 comparable activities were achieved between ph 4 5 to 8 5 the ability to work under strongly acidic condition e g ph 2 is congruent with literature hayatsu et al 2017 making ca nitrosoglobus the only identified acid tolerant aob genus hitherto in comparison the nitrosomonas aob often cease to function at ph 5 6 fumasoli et al 2015 and nitrosospira despite being isolated from acidic soils were also found to be acid intolerant in pure culture jiang and bakken 1999 fig 7 illustrates the temperature dependence of the our attributed to the ca nitrosoglobus like enrichment culture generally the oxygen uptake activity increased with temperature rising from 13 29 c which can be satisfactorily fitted with the arrhenius equation r2 0 93 fig 7a the temperature coefficient θ was estimated to be 1 105 indicating that the activity of ca nitrosoglobus is highly dependent on temperature the estimated θ value remains within the reported range 1 045 1 172 for microbial ammonium oxidation guo et al 2010 further the activation energy of the ammonium oxidation process mediated by ca nitrosoglobus was determined to be 109 8 kj mol 1 fig 7b 3 5 implications to the development of acidic activated sludge processes acidic activated sludge processes including acidic nitritation and acidic sludge treatment have opened up new opportunities to address the main challenges in wwtps i e attaining satisfied pollutant removal while minimizing operational costs in the reported acidic activated sludge processes a new aob population ca nitrosoglobus was detected wang et al 2021b this study further obtained an elaborate set of stoichiometric and kinetic parameters on an enriched ca nitrosoglobus culture which are essential to the design and further development of acidic activated sludge processes in an activated sludge system the srt is a critical design parameter the minimum srt for retaining ca nitrosoglobus is calculated to be 5 10 days based on its maximum specific growth rate 0 32 0 03 d 1 and the decay rate 0 16 0 03 d 1 in practice the srt required for the acidic activated sludge systems should be even longer due to potential negative impacts of environmental factors such as ammonium limitation on the net growth rate for instance in the previously demonstrated acidic activated sludge processes the srt was kept at up to 35 days wang et al 2021b in addition biofilm configuration can also be an efficient platform to retain ca nitrosoglobus and to perform acidic wastewater sludge treatment processes ca nitrosoglobus is featured by a low affinity to total ammonia with the affinity constant of 13 5 3 3 mg n l 1 table 1 compared with the value of 1 mg n l 1 recommended in the conventional activated sludge process henze et al 2000 the higher total ammonia affinity constant suggests it would be challenging to attain a low ammonium concentration e g 1 mg l 1 as required by the regulation limit via the acidic activated sludge process alone this suggests that the acidic pn process could be integrated with anammox with the latter removing the residual ammonium along with nitrite produced by ca nitrosoglobus however according to literature reports anammox activity can be detected within a ph range of 6 5 9 3 jin et al 2012 and the optimal ph for the growth of anammox bacteria lies in ph 6 7 8 3 strous et al 1999 therefore the low ph of acidic nitritation effluent ph 5 5 might have negative impacts on anammox to mitigate the potential negative impacts of acidic ph the acidic nitritation effluent could be mixed with an alkalinity adequate stream i e raw wastewater before feeding into the anammox reactor it should be noted that the cod in raw wastewater could promote heterotrophic denitrification which may compete nitrite with anammox bacteria as such pretreatment processes e g high rate activated sludge are recommended to separate the organic carbon from raw wastewater which can be redirected to anaerobic digestion process for bioenergy recovery the oxygen affinity constant of ca nitrosoglobus ko 0 92 0 37 mg o2 l 1 is higher than most aob table s3 as well as the majority of nob 0 13 1 69 mg o2 l 1 blackburne et al 2007 park et al 2017 it implies that low do which is widely adopted to suppress nob in canonical nitritation systems may not be applicable to the acidic nitritation process in the reported acidic nitritation reactors do was constantly higher than 2 mg l 1 but still robust nob suppression was demonstrated wang et al 2021b the low do strategy for nob suppression albeit effective would inevitably jeopardize aob activity as well thus limiting the overall efficiency of canonical nitritation processes the acidic nitritation mediated by ca nitrosoglobus which does not rely on low do to repress nob can potentially achieve a much higher process rate than canonical nitritation processes the acidic activated sludge system could be more susceptible to ph variations compared with ph neutral systems at the ph below 6 the alkalinity i e hco3 is nearly depleted by microbial ammonium oxidation leading to a low buffering capacity of the acidic activated sludge systems as a result the alkalinity fluctuations in the influent e g real sewage which would only cause minor ph variation in alkalinity adequate systems could significantly alter the ph in alkalinity depleted acidic systems albeit the potential ph variations acidic stable nitritation performance can still be achieved by ca nitrosoglobus as the characterization results show that ca nitrosoglobus can carry out ammonium oxidation within a wide ph range of 2 9 fig 6c 3 6 implications to the occurrence of ca nitrosoglobus in activated sludge ca nitrosoglobus is rarely detected in conventional activated sludge in the conventional activated sludge process nitrosomonas is generally the dominating ammonia oxidizer attributable to its relatively high growth rate table s3 1 42 1 52 d 1 at 27 c recently it was found that comammox nitrospira could play an important role in wastewater treatment systems operated at low do low ammonium and long srt roots et al 2019 possibly due to its high substrate affinity ks 0 009 0 6 nh4 nh3 n l 1 kits et al 2017 in comparison the low net growth rate and low oxygen total ammonia affinities of ca nitrosoglobus suggest that ca nitrosoglobus would not be competitive with fast growing r strategist e g nitrosomonas in eutrophic conditions or with efficient scavenging k strategist e g comammox nitrospira in oligotrophic conditions therefore ca nitrosoglobus has been barely detected in conventional near ph neutral activated sludge as revealed in this study ca nitrosoglobus has strong resistance to adverse environmental factors such as acidic ph 6 and ppm levels of fna this unique acid and fna resistance defines ca nitrosoglobus as an adversity strategist a strategist greenslade 1983 as opposed to the conventional r strategist and k strategist a strategists tend to prosper in adverse conditions and in the case of ca nitrosoglobus at ph of 4 5 and in situ fna of 2 8 ppm wang et al 2021a as a result ca nitrosoglobus earned a unique niche and prevailed in such acidic and fna rich systems where no other known ammonia oxidizers are able to survive it is notable that the another member from the ca nitrosoglobus genus i e ca nitrosoglobus terrae isolated from acidic soils also bears comparable acid and fna resistance however ca nitrosoglobus terrae has a much lower affinity to total ammonia ks 819 mg nh4 nh3 n l 1 hayatsu et al 2017 and a higher salt tolerance up to 1 nacl than this activated sludge originated ca nitrosoglobus the low total ammonia affinity makes the soil originated ca nitrosoglobus terrae unlikely to prosper in engineered acidic activated sludge systems although the distinct physiological properties suggest that the enriched ca nitrosoglobus might be a new species this hypothesis is not supported by the current 16s rrna gene similarity comparison based on illumina amplicon sequencing which only retrieved short 16s rrna sequences e g 466 bp full length 16s rrna gene and genome comparison is required in future studies to shed a more accurate light on the identification on a species level 4 conclusions this study characterized the stoichiometry and kinetics of a new aob ca nitrosoglobus enriched in activated sludge in a lab scale mbr operated at ph 5 0 and in situ fna concentration of 2 3 0 1 mg hno2 n l 1 ca nitrosoglobus became the only known ammonia oxidizer with a relative abundance of 55 1 0 5 based on 16s rrna gene sequencing the yield maximum growth and decay rates were estimated and the results indicate a relatively low net growth rate compared to other aob species the sludge originated ca nitrosoglobus have relatively low affinities to oxygen and total ammonia compared to other aob commonly found in activated sludge these render ca nitrosoglobus uncompetitive with traditional r strategist or k strategist ammonia oxidizers in current activated sludge systems however ca nitrosoglobus possesses strong resistance to acidic ph as low as 2 0 and high fna ic50 of 29 5 mg hno2 n l 1 the acid and fna resistance made ca nitrosoglobus an a strategist prospering under these adverse conditions where no other ammonia oxidizers and nitrite oxidizers can survive these findings provide support to the design and operation of acidic activated sludge processes in which ca nitrosoglobus can play a critical role declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

17074,cyanobacteria blooms threaten water supply and are potential sources for disinfection byproducts dbps formation in this study the underlying mechanisms for effective removal of a spiroides and the following depression on the formation of dbps were disclosed highly efficient inactivation more than 99 99 of a spiroides was realized by the plasma treatment within 12 min and 93 4 of anatoxin a was also removed within 12 min with no signals of resurrection after 7 days re cultivation transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that the expressions of the genes related to cell walls and peripherals thylakoid membranes photosynthetic membranes and detoxification of toxins were distinctly altered the generated reactive oxidative species ros including oh o2 and 1o2 attacked a spiroides and resulted in membrane damage and algae organic matter aom release eem parafac analysis illustrated that the aom compositions were subsequently decomposed by the ros as a result the formation potentials of the c dbps and n dbps were significantly inhibited due to the effectively removal of aom and anatoxin a this study disclosed the underneath mechanisms for the effective inactivation of a spiroides and inhibition of the following formation of the dbps and supplied a prospective technique for integrated pollutant control of cyanobacterial containing drinking water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anabaena spiroides discharge plasma inactivation mechanisms anataoxin a disinfection byproducts 1 introduction the eutrophication issue has become increasingly serious in water environments worldwide leading to widespread outbreaks of harmful cyanobacterial blooms xie et al 2013 cao et al 2019 kim et al 2020 these algae not only cause the death of aquatic organisms due to depletion of oxygen in the process of reproduction and metabolism but also produce harmful substances including toxins munoz et al 2019 in recent years cyanotoxins have raised public concerns due to their negative effects on human health such as neurotoxicity hepatoxicity cytotoxicity and skin irritation cao et al 2019 munoz et al 2019 kurtz et al 2021 unfortunately these algae and cyanotoxins are usually difficult to be effectively removed by traditional drink water treatment processes e g coagulation and sedimentation due to the surface hydrophilicity electrostatic repulsion and steric effect xie et al 2013 moreover algal organic matters aom are generally released during algae inactivation including intracellular organic matters iom and extracellular organic matters eom fang et al 2010 in the disinfection process of drinking water containing cyanobacterial and cyanotoxins some chlorinated disinfection byproducts dbps such as trihalomethanes thms haloacetonitriles hans and haloacetic acids haas are prone to produce due to chlorination of the aoms u s epa 2006 fang et al 2010 liu et al 2020 dbps are highly mutagenic and carcinogenic and long term drinking water containing dbps increases the risk of bladder cancer villanueva et al 2003 chu et al 2017 therefore it is highly prominent to explore efficient technologies to remove the cyanobacterial and cyanotoxins various methods have been adopted to remove cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in drinking water including ultraviolet radiation pestana et al 2020 chemical algae inhibitors zhou et al 2020 kmno4 oxidation li et al 2018 chlorination gonsior et al 2019 liu et al 2020 and photocatalytic degradation pestana et al 2020 kurtz et al 2021 however it took quite a long time 120 min for algae removal by ultraviolet radiation and other oxidants such as persulfate should be used conjunctively to achieve satisfactory effect wang et al 2016a chemical algae inhibitors and photocatalysts would bring secondary pollution due to application of oxidative chemical reagents xie et al 2013 the chlorination of cyanobacteria increases the risk of dbps formation liu et al 2020 an ideal method should achieve effective removal of algae and inhibition the formation of secondary dbps discharge plasma an advanced oxidation process has attracted widely concerns in environmental pollution control due to its advantages of strong oxidation ability green process and environmental friendliness kim et al 2005 jiang et al 2013 wang et al 2018 plasma is triggered by collision of high energy electrons with gas and or water molecules and then a large amount of reactive oxygen species ros such as o3 no3 oh o2 and 1o2 are produced plasma systems have been used to inactivate cyanobacteria cells in water bodies but most studies were subjected to improve the removal efficiency of cyanobacteria cells by using different types of plasma methods including three phase discharge plasma packed bed plasma and dielectric barrier discharge plasma wang et al 2010 jin et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 some efforts have been devoted to the removal of cyanotoxins by plasma zhang et al 2012 2014 reported that plasma oxidation could effectively remove microcystin lr where oh played an important role similar research was also conducted by park et al 2021 who reported that cyanotoxins in wastewater could be effectively removed by plasma oxidation however the relationships among the algae cell inactivation cyanotoxins removal aom release and reduction and subsequent dbps formation potentials have not been disclosed yet albeit the algae cell morphology intracellular proteins and chlorophyll were generally characterized to explore the possible inactivation mechanisms tang et al 2008 jin et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 the inherent mechanisms of algae removal induced by plasma oxidation at molecular level remain unclear anabaena spiroides a spiroides is a typical cyanobacteria bloom bacterium and it can generate anatoxin a atx chorus and bartram 1999 atx is a cholinergic agonist with a high affinity for nicotine receptors and a high acute neurotoxicity ld50 200 250 μg kg 1 i p mice and generally detected in drinking water thomas et al 1993 klitzke et al 2011 christensen and khan 2020 atx was reported to be a potent cyanobacterial neurotoxin that has extremely adverse effects on human health even at low exposure levels li et al 2020 therefore the removal of a spiroides by discharge plasma was investigated in this research the purposes of this study were 1 to evaluate the inactivation performance of a spiroides by discharge plasma in terms of a spiroides removal and atx degradation 2 to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of a spiroides inactivation via transcriptomics analysis 3 to reveal the relationships among aom release anataoxin a degradation and dbps formation potentials 2 material and methods 2 1 a spiroides culture a spiroides no fachb 709 was purchased from the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology fachb chinese academy of sciences algae species were cultured in bg 11 medium at 25 1 in a 12 12 h light dark cycle and with 4000 lux illumination intensity until the logarithmic growth period in a light incubator after that the culture solution was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min to remove the supernatant then the residue remaining in the tube was diluted to 1 5 108 cells ml 1 with ultra pure water to simulate the high algal concentration during the outbreak of harmful cyanobacterial bloom zhang et al 2014 qiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 other reagents used in this study are described in text s1 in the supporting information 2 2 experimental procedures for a spiroides removal a spiroides removal was conducted in a dielectric barrier discharge plasma system as shown in fig s1 the details of this system are introduced in text s2 a high frequency electric source ctp 2000k bought from nanjing suman electronics co ltd china was used for plasma generation and its frequency was set at 7 0 khz in a batch treatment 500 ml of water containing 1 5 108 cells ml 1 algal was treated with plasma 2 3 analytical methods for inactivation the fiber length and total particles of the a spiroides were measured using the plankton counting chamber under an optical microscope cx41rf olympus jpn the cell length was measured randomly for 10 times the average length was calculated and the counting error was estimated to be 15 cell concentrations were obtained based on the total fiber length and average cell length the absorbance was measured at 680 nm with a spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2550 japan to determine the inactivation of a spiroides as depicted in text s2 chlorophyll a and carotenoids were extracted and measured after the discharge plasma treatment as depicted in text s3 the integrity of algal cells before and after discharge plasma treatment was monitored by flow cytometry cyto flex bd biosciences usa and laser confocal fluorescence microscope lcfm fv3000 olympus japan and the details are described in text s4 the dissolved organic carbon doc was analyzed with a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcsh shimadzu japan at different time intervals the contents of malondialdehyde mda and superoxide dismutase sod of algae were determined as reported previously shiu and lee 2005 and the detailed procedures are illustrated in text s5 excitation emission matrix eem is a new type of spectral fingerprint analytical technology which has the advantages of high sensitivity high selectivity high information content and does not damage the sample structure li et al 2017 it can obtain the real time information of the water solubility and structural characteristics and content of algae organic matter aom change meanwhile it can also realize direct and rapid fluorescence quantitative analysis of multi components in complex systems in water the fluorescence properties of aom were analyzed using a fluorescence spectrophotometer rf 6000 shimadzu japan as depicted in text s6 then the detailed substances were analyzed based on parallel factor analysis parafac the dom fluor v 1 7 toolbox was used to perform parafac analysis with matlab r2018a mathworks usa software the compositions of aom were determined mainly based on several methods such as semi analysis residual analysis and visual inspection several important optical indexes were used including suva254 and sr stedmon and bro 2008 anataoxin a was determined using an abraxis anatoxin a elisa kit abraxis analytical systems warminster usa the basic information on the anataoxin a is introduced in table s1 2 4 ros detection electronic paramagnetic resonance spectrometer epr bruker e500 germany was used to identify the generated ross wang et al 2018 o3 h2o2 and no3 were measured using the methods suggested by the supplier merck to identify the contributions of the major ross superoxide dismutase sod mannitol and l histidine were applied to capture o2 oh and 1o2 respectively sehmi et al 2015 tiwari et al 2018 song et al 2019 2 5 dbps identification after discharge plasma treatment phosphate buffer solution was used to adjust the ph of algal suspension to 8 0 0 2 then excessive amount of naclo solution the residual chlorine after reaction was higher than 1 mg l 1 was added into the reaction solution the mixtures were placed in an incubator at 25 in dark condition after 72 h sodium sulfite was added to quench residual oxidants after peroxidation and then dbps were analyzed using gas chromatography agilent 6890 gc usa and the detailed analytical procedures are described in text s7 2 6 rna extraction and transcriptional analysis the a spiroides after 30 s of the discharge plasma treatment were collected for rna extraction detailed descriptions of the methods used to extract the rna and perform the transcriptomic analysis are provided in text s8 each test performed three times independently and each sample was measured in three replicates the data were expressed as the means with standard deviations a two tailed paired t test was used to determine the significance of the data at a 95 confidence level p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 discharge plasma treatment of a spiroides 3 1 1 cell viability of a spiroides the inactivation efficiencies of a spiroides algae cells at different discharge voltages were investigated and the results are shown in fig 1 a the algae cell concentration significantly decreased with the increasing of the discharge voltage when the input voltage was 4 5 6 and 7 kv the cell concentration in the algae suspension decreased from 1 5 108 to 4 05 107 2 19 107 6 105 and 1 103 cells ml 1 after 12 min treatment respectively the removal efficiency at 7 kv after 12 min treatment was nearly 100 0 usually higher voltage would accelerate the generation of ros and thus improved the algae cell inactivation performance wang et al 2016b previous studies also reported that under a stronger plasma treatment the production of active substances such as oh 1o2 and ozone were enhanced which was effective for the degradation of algae cells wang et al 2010 jin et al 2011 the detailed roles of these species will be discussed later fig 1 b depicts the changes in pigment of algae cells with the plasma exposure times at the voltage of 7 kv as the exposure time prolonged both of the content of chlorophyll a and carotenoid in algae cells decreased gradually the initial concentration of chlorophyll a was 9 46 mg l 1 and complete degradation was generally achieved after 9 min of treatment similarly the initial concentration of carotenoids was 0 49 mg l 1 and it was only 0 12 mg l 1 after 12 min of treatment these results indicated that discharge plasma oxidation effectively inactivated the a spirorion jin et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 the death and or spoilage of a spiroides would result in the release of a large amount of atx into the water body previous studies reported that the algal toxins were precursors of dbps chu et al 2017 cao et al 2019 in addition to the aom fang et al 2010 goslan et al 2017 fig 1 c illustrates the variation of atx concentrations in the reaction solution with the discharge plasma treatment time at the voltage of 7 kv the concentration of atx increased from 7 62 μg l 1 to 11 67 μg l 1 after 1 min treatment this might be attributed to the rupture of a spiroides cells by the plasma treatment accompanied by cytoplasmic overflow from the ruptured algae cells ross et al 2006 zamyadi et al 2013 park et al 2021 zhang et al 2014 reported that discharge plasma oxidation could effectively inactivate and destroy m aeruginosa cells but it could also lead to the release of large amounts of microcystin however the atx concentration decreased by 93 4 after 12 min plasma treatment these results suggested that the toxins released from the algal cells were also effectively decomposed by the plasma oxidation in the following reaction process the removal efficiency of atx was lower than that of the parent a spiroides therefore atx control should be paid more attention during algae inactivation and longer treatment time might be used to fully control the contamination of the released atx zhou et al 2018 3 1 2 cell integrity of a spiroides fig 2 a c shows the integrity of a spiroides cells under different plasma treatment times in the control test without plasma treatment the number of live cells observed by the flow cytometry accounted for 99 83 of a spiroides the proportion of dead cells was 92 73 within 3 min of the plasma treatment implying that most of the cell walls suffered from vigorous morphological changes and damage zhang et al 2017 a large amount of ros were produced by long time plasma treatment which oxidized and damaged a spiroides cells leading to the decrease in their integrity park et al 2021 this could be further confirmed by the changes in lcfm images of cell surface morphology of cyanobacteria before and after discharge plasma oxidation chlorophyll phycobilicin and other substances in algae cells stimulate auto fluorescence and exhibit red fluorescence under fluorescent irradiation fig 2 d f shows the lcfm spectra of a spiroides cells under different plasma treatment times as could be seen the discharge plasma oxidation resulted in significant decrease in the chlorophyll autofluorescence in a spiroides cells compared with the control group fig 2d the autofluorescence intensity of a spiroides cells decreased dramatically after 3 min plasma oxidation fig 2f magnifying that most of the cells were damaged by plasma oxidation and the intracellular phycocyanin chlorophyll and carotenoid fluorescent substances were degraded as well liu et al 2015 therefore long term plasma oxidation treatment can severely damage cells and cause cell lysis zhang et al 2014 also reported that there were almost no complete m aeruginosa cells after 20 min of glow discharge plasma treatment as an autotrophic species a spiroides relies significantly on its photosynthetic system for energy conversion so photosynthetic capacity is an important factor affecting the growth of algae cells zhou et al 2018 as shown in fig s2 the maximum fluorescence quantum yield f v f m of a spiroides after 60 s of plasma treatment decreased by 41 7 compared with that in the control similarly the maximum electron transfer efficiency etr max also decreased by 69 6 these data were obtained immediately after plasma oxidation treatment without cultivation the cultivation time was 0 day after 6 days of continuous cultivation the f v f m and etr max did not return to their original levels indicating that the damage caused by plasma oxidation to the photosynthetic system of a spiroides was irreversible as a photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll is essential for light absorption and conversion of light energy into chemical energy xiong et al 2017 the f v f m and etr max are two important photosynthetic parameters reflecting the activity of photosynthesis ng et al 2014 the rapid decrease of f v f m suggested that plasma oxidation directly attacked the psii system leading to the closure of most reaction centers and the suppression of major photochemical reactions ng et al 2014 liu et al 2018 the reduction of etr max would lead to the depressed electron transfer and charge separation which are closely related to the formation of atp and the fixation of co2 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 these results certified that the discharge plasma oxidation destroyed the chloroplasts interfered with photosynthesis and ultimately inhibited algae growth yang et al 2020 3 2 physiological and biochemical behaviors and transcriptional analysis the sod activity of algae is induced to resist adverse environmental stress and the tolerance of algae to oxidative stress is usually associated with high sod activity sun et al 2018b fig s3 a shows that the sod activity in the cell first increased and then decreased during the discharge plasma treatment in the initial stage of plasma treatment the algae cells exhibited defensive behaviors by inducing sod activity to resist adversity stress qi et al 2020 similar phenomena were also observed previously li et al 2011 wert et al 2013 xu et al 2016 after prolonged exposure to plasma the sod activity then decreased significantly indicating that the cell integrity was damaged and the anti oxidant defense system collapsed meng et al 2015 mda is the product of membrane lipid peroxidation and decomposition and is used as a biomarker for vital signs of oxidative damage to cells cai et al 2009 the content of mda in a spiroides cells gradually increased with the plasma treatment time as shown in fig s3 b this further suggested that severe oxidative damage induced by discharge plasma occurred wert et al 2013 the reactive ros species generated in the discharge plasma process may interfere with dna synthesis in cells destroy protein structure inhibit cell growth and reproduction and interfere with the normal metabolism of microorganisms tao et al 2010 to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of a spiroides inactivation under the discharge plasma exposure the overall transcriptional changes in relevant genes of a spiroides after plasma exposure were explored fig 3 illustrates the variations of the most trusted regulatory genes involved in the metabolic network of stimulus responses and changes p 0 05 among these genes the expressions of 24 genes were up regulated while 52 genes were down regulated after plasma exposure compared with the control gene ontology go enrichment analysis was performed on the differentially expressed genes degs after plasma exposure and the results are shown in fig s4 a most of the genes with altered expressions were related to the cell walls and peripherals thylakoid membranes and photosynthetic membranes a kegg kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis was performed to elucidate the metabolic pathways in which these altered genes actively involved in as shown in fig s4 b the up regulated genes generally involved in the ribosome photosynthesis purine metabolism carotenoid biosynthesis nitrogen metabolism biosynthesis of secondary metabolites biofilm formation table s2 the down regulated genes mostly involved in the pathways of glycolysis gluconeogenesis histidine metabolism folate biosynthesis citrate cycle and pyruvate metabolism porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism and biosynthesis of amino acids table s2 the transcriptomic profile indicated that the genes in the four constituent modules phycobilisome psi psii and calvin cycle of photosynthesis were differentially modulated in response to plasma treatment psii genes psb genes and phycobilisome genes cpc and apc genes showed differential expressions with half of them up regulated and the rest down regulated the down regulated psal gene implied the inhibition of rubisco a key enzyme in photosynthesis carpinelli et al 2014 yang et al 2020 in this study the porphyrins and genes associated with chlorophyll synthesis were significantly down regulated after plasma exposure compared with the control p 0 05 indicating that chlorophyll synthesis was inhibited at the same time most of the annotated genes in the oxidative fcps fucoxanthin a c protein by leaves were down regulated after plasma treatment zhou et al 2020 in addition plasma oxidation treatment had a serious effect on electron transport of a spiroides cells which was demonstrated by the down regulation of etrmax components fig s2 for example the expression levels of ferredoxin nadp reductase gene photosystem ii viscose binding protein cp47 and photosystem ii reaction center protein psb28 that encode photosynthetic electron transport showed decreasing trends the reduction of these photosynthetic proteins hindered nadp reduction and reduced electron transfer efficiency resulting in the decrease in fv fm and etrmax this perfectly explains the results in fig s2 moreover reactive oxygen species is also considered to be the central secondary messengers controlling multiple genetic stress programs rosenwasser et al 2014 in the algal cells chloroplasts are considered to be the main sites of reactive oxygen species production myouga et al 2008 in this study the photosynthetic efficiency and pigment content of algal cells decreased significantly after the plasma treatment which promoted reactive oxygen species production oxidative damage and chloroplast dysfunction various antioxidant defense mechanisms have been proposed in algae to explain the excessive production of reactive oxygen species under oxidative stress zhang et al 2018 the results showed that the activities of some genes associated with glutathione gsh including glycine hydroxymethyltransferase cystathionine beta synthase and glutathione s transferase in a spiroides cells significantly increased after plasma treatment table s2 moreover the dna repair protein recn was down regulated indicating that plasma exposure inhibited the cell phospholipid transport thereby changing the spontaneous diffusion of the membrane and ultimately leading to membrane damage vance 2015 these results explained the observed increase in ros and mda contents fig s3 and table s2 the excessive accumulation of ros in the cells changed the permeability of the cell membrane triggered the oxidative damage of biomolecules and generated lipid peroxidation related signal molecules leading to cell dysfunction and death mittler 2002 previous studies found that glutathione s transferase and glutathione were involved in the detoxification of toxins in algal cells pflugmacher et al 1998 zhang et al 2018 therefore the plasma oxidation treatment probably inhibited the production of algal toxins by changing gene expression in addition it also significantly up regulated many antioxidant genes such as reca reco recf and recq etc oxidative stress as shown in fig 4 when the ros produced by the discharge plasma entered the algal cells they modified the expression of proteins leading to the inhibition of photosynthesis especially the interference of electron transport chain chlorophyll synthesis and light trapping of the photosystem yang et al 2020 in response to these external presses the algae cells enhanced the generation of reactive oxygen species which was followed by lipid peroxidation membrane damage and cell population growth the algae would be in a state of suspended animation under oxidative stress after uv chlorine treatment and some algae cells probably resurrection after a period of re cultivation sun et al 2018a fig s5 depicts the cell regrowth of a spiroides after discharge plasma treatment the algae cells after 12 min of plasma treatment at 4 kv still showed signs of regrowth no regrowth after 7 day incubation was observed if the treatment was longer than 1 min at 6 kv this demonstrated that appropriate plasma exposure intensity and duration time were able to realize satisfactory inactivation of a spiroides 3 3 involved reactive species in a spiroides removal previous studies reported that the active substances generated by discharge plasma played important roles in pollutants removal wang et al 2016b fig 5 a depicts the changes in the short lived active species with without a spiroides as detected by epr by using dmpo and dmpo dmso solutions as spin trapping reagents oh o2 1o2 signals were detected in the discharge plasma process at the same time it was found that the epr signals of these three species in water containing a spiroides significantly decreased compared with those in the deionized water these results strongly proved that oh o2 and 1o2 were involved in the inactivation of a spiroides and degradation of cyanotoxins fig 5 b depicts the generation of long life active substances h2o2 o3 and no3 it was found that the concentrations of h2o2 o3 and no3 all increased with the increase of discharge plasma treatment time and their concentrations in the deionized water were also significantly higher than those in the solution containing a spiroides therefore h2o2 o3 and no3 were also involved in the inactivation of a spiroides and degradation of cyanotoxins the h2o2 and o3 were the long life species in the discharge plasma process which were easily prone to produce oh and other active species kanazawa et al 2011 wang et al 2016b to further confirm the potential roles of these active species in the removal of a spiroides mannitol sod and l histidine were selected as radical scavengers for oh o2 and 1o2 respectively sehmi et al 2015 tiwari et al 2018 song et al 2019 fig 6 depicts the evolution of the removal efficiency of a spiroides under different radical scavenger doses after 6 min of discharge plasma treatment the removal efficiency of a spiroides decreased by 26 6 as the dosage of mannitol increased from 0 to 400 mmol l 1 fig 6a similarly the presence of sod and or l histidine also dramatically decreased the removal of a spiroides these results further confirmed the contributions of oh o2 and 1o2 to a spiroides removal 3 4 relationships among atx removal aom release and dbps formation excitation emission matrices eem can realize direct and rapid fluorescence quantitative analysis of multiple components in complex water bodies li et al 2017 this can provide a basis for understanding the structural characteristics and changes of aom in a spiroides cells after discharge plasma oxidation in this study four different eems fluorescence components c1 c2 c3 and c4 were identified using eem parafac analysis and their eems contours ex em loads and fluorescence peak positions are given in table 1 the component c1 has two peaks at ex em of 615 642 and 370 642 which represent the photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll a in the photosystem reaction dartnell et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 the component c2 has two peaks at ex em of 270 454 and 360 454 corresponding to a large molecular weight uvc humic like substances lapierre and del giorgio 2014 the component c3 with the ex em of 280 326 is assigned to a tryptophan like substance which reveals the diversity of amino acids and proteins in algal cells and correlates with the compositions of cyanotoxins zhang et al 2014 the component c4 with the ex em of 320 394 represents uva humic like substance with low molecular weight peleato et al 2017 the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax was used to understand the variability of these four components in aom in this study as shown in fig 7 a higher fmax suggests a higher content of the component the fmax value of the algae containing water increased firstly and then gradually decreased with the discharge plasma treatment time this indicated that the plasma oxidation caused the destruction of a spiroides cells accompanied by the release of the aom such as proteins peptides amino acids nucleic acids and other bioactive substances and then these aom would be further decomposed by the plasma oxidation zhang et al 2014 zhou et al 2018 similar with the aom the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration also first increased and then decreased with the discharge plasma treatment time fig s6 the increase of doc concentration at the initial stage of plasma treatment may be related to cell lysis caused by oxidation zhou et al 2014 carbonaceous dbps c dbps and nitrogenous dbps n dbps formation potentials including haloacetic acids haas trihalomethanes thms trichloronitromethane hnms and haloacetonitriles hans were evaluated after a spiroides removal by discharge plasma as shown in fig 8 obviously much lower concentrations of dbps due to chlorination were observed after the discharge plasma treatment as compared with the control group among them thms and haas were the main dbps with the maximum production of trichloromethane tcm dichloroacetic acid dcaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa being 105 6 51 1 and 37 9 μg l 1 before the plasma treatment respectively after 12 min of the plasma treatment the removal rates of tcm dcaa and tcaa were 78 7 90 6 and 93 4 respectively in addition hans and hnms are the two dominant n dbps in chlorination disinfection in fig 8 the concentrations of dichloroacetonitrile dcan and trichloronitromethane tcnm generated by the discharge plasma treatment decreased by 85 9 and 74 5 respectively compared with the control group these results demonstrated that the discharge plasma not only effectively inactivated the algae cells but could also significantly reduce the generation potentials of c dbps and n dbps in the subsequent chlorination disinfection treatment liu et al 2020 park et al 2021 the correlations among atx removal aom release and dbps formation were analyzed using pearson correlation coefficients as shown in table 2 a significant positive correlation between atx and aom p 0 01 as well as atx and doc p 0 05 was observed the correlations between dbps formation and aom p 0 01 as well as dbps formation and doc p 0 01 were also significantly positive therefore the removal of aom and or doc during a spiroides inactivation by the discharge plasma oxidation could effectively reduce atx accumulation and dbps formation potentials zhou et al 2014 concluded that the toxins released in m aeruginosa suspension increased with the degree of cell lysis by clo2 and dbps formation was positively related to doc release in the oxidation of clo2 similar phenomenon was also observed by coral et al 2013 during m aeruginosa removal by ozonation in addition many previous studies quantitatively evaluated the reactivity of m aeruginosa cells and their metabolites as precursors of dbps nguyen et al 2005 fang et al 2010 coral et al 2013 chu et al 2017 liu et al 2020 and concluded that aom released from algal cells contributed to the formation of dbps 4 conclusions the underlying molecular mechanisms of a spiroides inactivation and simultaneous control of the dbps formation by discharge plasma oxidation were unveiled in this study a spiroides removal performance was positively related to applied voltage and satisfactory removal efficiency more than 99 99 was realized after 12 min of plasma treatment which were further confirmed by the flow cytometry and lcfm analysis transcriptomics analysis of a spiroides genes demonstrated that genes with altered expressions were mainly related to cell walls and peripherals thylakoid membranes photosynthetic membranes and detoxification of toxins qualitative and quantitative analysis of ros demonstrated that oh o2 and 1o2 played significant roles in a spiroides inactivation aom and anatoxin a were firstly accumulated and then effectively degraded by the continuous attacks of ros resulting in dramatical reduction of formation potentials of subsequent dbps this study provides new insights into the development of effective and efficient approach to control cyanobacterial blooms in water bodies and to better understand the control of dbps

17074,cyanobacteria blooms threaten water supply and are potential sources for disinfection byproducts dbps formation in this study the underlying mechanisms for effective removal of a spiroides and the following depression on the formation of dbps were disclosed highly efficient inactivation more than 99 99 of a spiroides was realized by the plasma treatment within 12 min and 93 4 of anatoxin a was also removed within 12 min with no signals of resurrection after 7 days re cultivation transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that the expressions of the genes related to cell walls and peripherals thylakoid membranes photosynthetic membranes and detoxification of toxins were distinctly altered the generated reactive oxidative species ros including oh o2 and 1o2 attacked a spiroides and resulted in membrane damage and algae organic matter aom release eem parafac analysis illustrated that the aom compositions were subsequently decomposed by the ros as a result the formation potentials of the c dbps and n dbps were significantly inhibited due to the effectively removal of aom and anatoxin a this study disclosed the underneath mechanisms for the effective inactivation of a spiroides and inhibition of the following formation of the dbps and supplied a prospective technique for integrated pollutant control of cyanobacterial containing drinking water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anabaena spiroides discharge plasma inactivation mechanisms anataoxin a disinfection byproducts 1 introduction the eutrophication issue has become increasingly serious in water environments worldwide leading to widespread outbreaks of harmful cyanobacterial blooms xie et al 2013 cao et al 2019 kim et al 2020 these algae not only cause the death of aquatic organisms due to depletion of oxygen in the process of reproduction and metabolism but also produce harmful substances including toxins munoz et al 2019 in recent years cyanotoxins have raised public concerns due to their negative effects on human health such as neurotoxicity hepatoxicity cytotoxicity and skin irritation cao et al 2019 munoz et al 2019 kurtz et al 2021 unfortunately these algae and cyanotoxins are usually difficult to be effectively removed by traditional drink water treatment processes e g coagulation and sedimentation due to the surface hydrophilicity electrostatic repulsion and steric effect xie et al 2013 moreover algal organic matters aom are generally released during algae inactivation including intracellular organic matters iom and extracellular organic matters eom fang et al 2010 in the disinfection process of drinking water containing cyanobacterial and cyanotoxins some chlorinated disinfection byproducts dbps such as trihalomethanes thms haloacetonitriles hans and haloacetic acids haas are prone to produce due to chlorination of the aoms u s epa 2006 fang et al 2010 liu et al 2020 dbps are highly mutagenic and carcinogenic and long term drinking water containing dbps increases the risk of bladder cancer villanueva et al 2003 chu et al 2017 therefore it is highly prominent to explore efficient technologies to remove the cyanobacterial and cyanotoxins various methods have been adopted to remove cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in drinking water including ultraviolet radiation pestana et al 2020 chemical algae inhibitors zhou et al 2020 kmno4 oxidation li et al 2018 chlorination gonsior et al 2019 liu et al 2020 and photocatalytic degradation pestana et al 2020 kurtz et al 2021 however it took quite a long time 120 min for algae removal by ultraviolet radiation and other oxidants such as persulfate should be used conjunctively to achieve satisfactory effect wang et al 2016a chemical algae inhibitors and photocatalysts would bring secondary pollution due to application of oxidative chemical reagents xie et al 2013 the chlorination of cyanobacteria increases the risk of dbps formation liu et al 2020 an ideal method should achieve effective removal of algae and inhibition the formation of secondary dbps discharge plasma an advanced oxidation process has attracted widely concerns in environmental pollution control due to its advantages of strong oxidation ability green process and environmental friendliness kim et al 2005 jiang et al 2013 wang et al 2018 plasma is triggered by collision of high energy electrons with gas and or water molecules and then a large amount of reactive oxygen species ros such as o3 no3 oh o2 and 1o2 are produced plasma systems have been used to inactivate cyanobacteria cells in water bodies but most studies were subjected to improve the removal efficiency of cyanobacteria cells by using different types of plasma methods including three phase discharge plasma packed bed plasma and dielectric barrier discharge plasma wang et al 2010 jin et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 some efforts have been devoted to the removal of cyanotoxins by plasma zhang et al 2012 2014 reported that plasma oxidation could effectively remove microcystin lr where oh played an important role similar research was also conducted by park et al 2021 who reported that cyanotoxins in wastewater could be effectively removed by plasma oxidation however the relationships among the algae cell inactivation cyanotoxins removal aom release and reduction and subsequent dbps formation potentials have not been disclosed yet albeit the algae cell morphology intracellular proteins and chlorophyll were generally characterized to explore the possible inactivation mechanisms tang et al 2008 jin et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 the inherent mechanisms of algae removal induced by plasma oxidation at molecular level remain unclear anabaena spiroides a spiroides is a typical cyanobacteria bloom bacterium and it can generate anatoxin a atx chorus and bartram 1999 atx is a cholinergic agonist with a high affinity for nicotine receptors and a high acute neurotoxicity ld50 200 250 μg kg 1 i p mice and generally detected in drinking water thomas et al 1993 klitzke et al 2011 christensen and khan 2020 atx was reported to be a potent cyanobacterial neurotoxin that has extremely adverse effects on human health even at low exposure levels li et al 2020 therefore the removal of a spiroides by discharge plasma was investigated in this research the purposes of this study were 1 to evaluate the inactivation performance of a spiroides by discharge plasma in terms of a spiroides removal and atx degradation 2 to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of a spiroides inactivation via transcriptomics analysis 3 to reveal the relationships among aom release anataoxin a degradation and dbps formation potentials 2 material and methods 2 1 a spiroides culture a spiroides no fachb 709 was purchased from the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology fachb chinese academy of sciences algae species were cultured in bg 11 medium at 25 1 in a 12 12 h light dark cycle and with 4000 lux illumination intensity until the logarithmic growth period in a light incubator after that the culture solution was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min to remove the supernatant then the residue remaining in the tube was diluted to 1 5 108 cells ml 1 with ultra pure water to simulate the high algal concentration during the outbreak of harmful cyanobacterial bloom zhang et al 2014 qiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 other reagents used in this study are described in text s1 in the supporting information 2 2 experimental procedures for a spiroides removal a spiroides removal was conducted in a dielectric barrier discharge plasma system as shown in fig s1 the details of this system are introduced in text s2 a high frequency electric source ctp 2000k bought from nanjing suman electronics co ltd china was used for plasma generation and its frequency was set at 7 0 khz in a batch treatment 500 ml of water containing 1 5 108 cells ml 1 algal was treated with plasma 2 3 analytical methods for inactivation the fiber length and total particles of the a spiroides were measured using the plankton counting chamber under an optical microscope cx41rf olympus jpn the cell length was measured randomly for 10 times the average length was calculated and the counting error was estimated to be 15 cell concentrations were obtained based on the total fiber length and average cell length the absorbance was measured at 680 nm with a spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2550 japan to determine the inactivation of a spiroides as depicted in text s2 chlorophyll a and carotenoids were extracted and measured after the discharge plasma treatment as depicted in text s3 the integrity of algal cells before and after discharge plasma treatment was monitored by flow cytometry cyto flex bd biosciences usa and laser confocal fluorescence microscope lcfm fv3000 olympus japan and the details are described in text s4 the dissolved organic carbon doc was analyzed with a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcsh shimadzu japan at different time intervals the contents of malondialdehyde mda and superoxide dismutase sod of algae were determined as reported previously shiu and lee 2005 and the detailed procedures are illustrated in text s5 excitation emission matrix eem is a new type of spectral fingerprint analytical technology which has the advantages of high sensitivity high selectivity high information content and does not damage the sample structure li et al 2017 it can obtain the real time information of the water solubility and structural characteristics and content of algae organic matter aom change meanwhile it can also realize direct and rapid fluorescence quantitative analysis of multi components in complex systems in water the fluorescence properties of aom were analyzed using a fluorescence spectrophotometer rf 6000 shimadzu japan as depicted in text s6 then the detailed substances were analyzed based on parallel factor analysis parafac the dom fluor v 1 7 toolbox was used to perform parafac analysis with matlab r2018a mathworks usa software the compositions of aom were determined mainly based on several methods such as semi analysis residual analysis and visual inspection several important optical indexes were used including suva254 and sr stedmon and bro 2008 anataoxin a was determined using an abraxis anatoxin a elisa kit abraxis analytical systems warminster usa the basic information on the anataoxin a is introduced in table s1 2 4 ros detection electronic paramagnetic resonance spectrometer epr bruker e500 germany was used to identify the generated ross wang et al 2018 o3 h2o2 and no3 were measured using the methods suggested by the supplier merck to identify the contributions of the major ross superoxide dismutase sod mannitol and l histidine were applied to capture o2 oh and 1o2 respectively sehmi et al 2015 tiwari et al 2018 song et al 2019 2 5 dbps identification after discharge plasma treatment phosphate buffer solution was used to adjust the ph of algal suspension to 8 0 0 2 then excessive amount of naclo solution the residual chlorine after reaction was higher than 1 mg l 1 was added into the reaction solution the mixtures were placed in an incubator at 25 in dark condition after 72 h sodium sulfite was added to quench residual oxidants after peroxidation and then dbps were analyzed using gas chromatography agilent 6890 gc usa and the detailed analytical procedures are described in text s7 2 6 rna extraction and transcriptional analysis the a spiroides after 30 s of the discharge plasma treatment were collected for rna extraction detailed descriptions of the methods used to extract the rna and perform the transcriptomic analysis are provided in text s8 each test performed three times independently and each sample was measured in three replicates the data were expressed as the means with standard deviations a two tailed paired t test was used to determine the significance of the data at a 95 confidence level p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 discharge plasma treatment of a spiroides 3 1 1 cell viability of a spiroides the inactivation efficiencies of a spiroides algae cells at different discharge voltages were investigated and the results are shown in fig 1 a the algae cell concentration significantly decreased with the increasing of the discharge voltage when the input voltage was 4 5 6 and 7 kv the cell concentration in the algae suspension decreased from 1 5 108 to 4 05 107 2 19 107 6 105 and 1 103 cells ml 1 after 12 min treatment respectively the removal efficiency at 7 kv after 12 min treatment was nearly 100 0 usually higher voltage would accelerate the generation of ros and thus improved the algae cell inactivation performance wang et al 2016b previous studies also reported that under a stronger plasma treatment the production of active substances such as oh 1o2 and ozone were enhanced which was effective for the degradation of algae cells wang et al 2010 jin et al 2011 the detailed roles of these species will be discussed later fig 1 b depicts the changes in pigment of algae cells with the plasma exposure times at the voltage of 7 kv as the exposure time prolonged both of the content of chlorophyll a and carotenoid in algae cells decreased gradually the initial concentration of chlorophyll a was 9 46 mg l 1 and complete degradation was generally achieved after 9 min of treatment similarly the initial concentration of carotenoids was 0 49 mg l 1 and it was only 0 12 mg l 1 after 12 min of treatment these results indicated that discharge plasma oxidation effectively inactivated the a spirorion jin et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 the death and or spoilage of a spiroides would result in the release of a large amount of atx into the water body previous studies reported that the algal toxins were precursors of dbps chu et al 2017 cao et al 2019 in addition to the aom fang et al 2010 goslan et al 2017 fig 1 c illustrates the variation of atx concentrations in the reaction solution with the discharge plasma treatment time at the voltage of 7 kv the concentration of atx increased from 7 62 μg l 1 to 11 67 μg l 1 after 1 min treatment this might be attributed to the rupture of a spiroides cells by the plasma treatment accompanied by cytoplasmic overflow from the ruptured algae cells ross et al 2006 zamyadi et al 2013 park et al 2021 zhang et al 2014 reported that discharge plasma oxidation could effectively inactivate and destroy m aeruginosa cells but it could also lead to the release of large amounts of microcystin however the atx concentration decreased by 93 4 after 12 min plasma treatment these results suggested that the toxins released from the algal cells were also effectively decomposed by the plasma oxidation in the following reaction process the removal efficiency of atx was lower than that of the parent a spiroides therefore atx control should be paid more attention during algae inactivation and longer treatment time might be used to fully control the contamination of the released atx zhou et al 2018 3 1 2 cell integrity of a spiroides fig 2 a c shows the integrity of a spiroides cells under different plasma treatment times in the control test without plasma treatment the number of live cells observed by the flow cytometry accounted for 99 83 of a spiroides the proportion of dead cells was 92 73 within 3 min of the plasma treatment implying that most of the cell walls suffered from vigorous morphological changes and damage zhang et al 2017 a large amount of ros were produced by long time plasma treatment which oxidized and damaged a spiroides cells leading to the decrease in their integrity park et al 2021 this could be further confirmed by the changes in lcfm images of cell surface morphology of cyanobacteria before and after discharge plasma oxidation chlorophyll phycobilicin and other substances in algae cells stimulate auto fluorescence and exhibit red fluorescence under fluorescent irradiation fig 2 d f shows the lcfm spectra of a spiroides cells under different plasma treatment times as could be seen the discharge plasma oxidation resulted in significant decrease in the chlorophyll autofluorescence in a spiroides cells compared with the control group fig 2d the autofluorescence intensity of a spiroides cells decreased dramatically after 3 min plasma oxidation fig 2f magnifying that most of the cells were damaged by plasma oxidation and the intracellular phycocyanin chlorophyll and carotenoid fluorescent substances were degraded as well liu et al 2015 therefore long term plasma oxidation treatment can severely damage cells and cause cell lysis zhang et al 2014 also reported that there were almost no complete m aeruginosa cells after 20 min of glow discharge plasma treatment as an autotrophic species a spiroides relies significantly on its photosynthetic system for energy conversion so photosynthetic capacity is an important factor affecting the growth of algae cells zhou et al 2018 as shown in fig s2 the maximum fluorescence quantum yield f v f m of a spiroides after 60 s of plasma treatment decreased by 41 7 compared with that in the control similarly the maximum electron transfer efficiency etr max also decreased by 69 6 these data were obtained immediately after plasma oxidation treatment without cultivation the cultivation time was 0 day after 6 days of continuous cultivation the f v f m and etr max did not return to their original levels indicating that the damage caused by plasma oxidation to the photosynthetic system of a spiroides was irreversible as a photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll is essential for light absorption and conversion of light energy into chemical energy xiong et al 2017 the f v f m and etr max are two important photosynthetic parameters reflecting the activity of photosynthesis ng et al 2014 the rapid decrease of f v f m suggested that plasma oxidation directly attacked the psii system leading to the closure of most reaction centers and the suppression of major photochemical reactions ng et al 2014 liu et al 2018 the reduction of etr max would lead to the depressed electron transfer and charge separation which are closely related to the formation of atp and the fixation of co2 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 these results certified that the discharge plasma oxidation destroyed the chloroplasts interfered with photosynthesis and ultimately inhibited algae growth yang et al 2020 3 2 physiological and biochemical behaviors and transcriptional analysis the sod activity of algae is induced to resist adverse environmental stress and the tolerance of algae to oxidative stress is usually associated with high sod activity sun et al 2018b fig s3 a shows that the sod activity in the cell first increased and then decreased during the discharge plasma treatment in the initial stage of plasma treatment the algae cells exhibited defensive behaviors by inducing sod activity to resist adversity stress qi et al 2020 similar phenomena were also observed previously li et al 2011 wert et al 2013 xu et al 2016 after prolonged exposure to plasma the sod activity then decreased significantly indicating that the cell integrity was damaged and the anti oxidant defense system collapsed meng et al 2015 mda is the product of membrane lipid peroxidation and decomposition and is used as a biomarker for vital signs of oxidative damage to cells cai et al 2009 the content of mda in a spiroides cells gradually increased with the plasma treatment time as shown in fig s3 b this further suggested that severe oxidative damage induced by discharge plasma occurred wert et al 2013 the reactive ros species generated in the discharge plasma process may interfere with dna synthesis in cells destroy protein structure inhibit cell growth and reproduction and interfere with the normal metabolism of microorganisms tao et al 2010 to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of a spiroides inactivation under the discharge plasma exposure the overall transcriptional changes in relevant genes of a spiroides after plasma exposure were explored fig 3 illustrates the variations of the most trusted regulatory genes involved in the metabolic network of stimulus responses and changes p 0 05 among these genes the expressions of 24 genes were up regulated while 52 genes were down regulated after plasma exposure compared with the control gene ontology go enrichment analysis was performed on the differentially expressed genes degs after plasma exposure and the results are shown in fig s4 a most of the genes with altered expressions were related to the cell walls and peripherals thylakoid membranes and photosynthetic membranes a kegg kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis was performed to elucidate the metabolic pathways in which these altered genes actively involved in as shown in fig s4 b the up regulated genes generally involved in the ribosome photosynthesis purine metabolism carotenoid biosynthesis nitrogen metabolism biosynthesis of secondary metabolites biofilm formation table s2 the down regulated genes mostly involved in the pathways of glycolysis gluconeogenesis histidine metabolism folate biosynthesis citrate cycle and pyruvate metabolism porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism and biosynthesis of amino acids table s2 the transcriptomic profile indicated that the genes in the four constituent modules phycobilisome psi psii and calvin cycle of photosynthesis were differentially modulated in response to plasma treatment psii genes psb genes and phycobilisome genes cpc and apc genes showed differential expressions with half of them up regulated and the rest down regulated the down regulated psal gene implied the inhibition of rubisco a key enzyme in photosynthesis carpinelli et al 2014 yang et al 2020 in this study the porphyrins and genes associated with chlorophyll synthesis were significantly down regulated after plasma exposure compared with the control p 0 05 indicating that chlorophyll synthesis was inhibited at the same time most of the annotated genes in the oxidative fcps fucoxanthin a c protein by leaves were down regulated after plasma treatment zhou et al 2020 in addition plasma oxidation treatment had a serious effect on electron transport of a spiroides cells which was demonstrated by the down regulation of etrmax components fig s2 for example the expression levels of ferredoxin nadp reductase gene photosystem ii viscose binding protein cp47 and photosystem ii reaction center protein psb28 that encode photosynthetic electron transport showed decreasing trends the reduction of these photosynthetic proteins hindered nadp reduction and reduced electron transfer efficiency resulting in the decrease in fv fm and etrmax this perfectly explains the results in fig s2 moreover reactive oxygen species is also considered to be the central secondary messengers controlling multiple genetic stress programs rosenwasser et al 2014 in the algal cells chloroplasts are considered to be the main sites of reactive oxygen species production myouga et al 2008 in this study the photosynthetic efficiency and pigment content of algal cells decreased significantly after the plasma treatment which promoted reactive oxygen species production oxidative damage and chloroplast dysfunction various antioxidant defense mechanisms have been proposed in algae to explain the excessive production of reactive oxygen species under oxidative stress zhang et al 2018 the results showed that the activities of some genes associated with glutathione gsh including glycine hydroxymethyltransferase cystathionine beta synthase and glutathione s transferase in a spiroides cells significantly increased after plasma treatment table s2 moreover the dna repair protein recn was down regulated indicating that plasma exposure inhibited the cell phospholipid transport thereby changing the spontaneous diffusion of the membrane and ultimately leading to membrane damage vance 2015 these results explained the observed increase in ros and mda contents fig s3 and table s2 the excessive accumulation of ros in the cells changed the permeability of the cell membrane triggered the oxidative damage of biomolecules and generated lipid peroxidation related signal molecules leading to cell dysfunction and death mittler 2002 previous studies found that glutathione s transferase and glutathione were involved in the detoxification of toxins in algal cells pflugmacher et al 1998 zhang et al 2018 therefore the plasma oxidation treatment probably inhibited the production of algal toxins by changing gene expression in addition it also significantly up regulated many antioxidant genes such as reca reco recf and recq etc oxidative stress as shown in fig 4 when the ros produced by the discharge plasma entered the algal cells they modified the expression of proteins leading to the inhibition of photosynthesis especially the interference of electron transport chain chlorophyll synthesis and light trapping of the photosystem yang et al 2020 in response to these external presses the algae cells enhanced the generation of reactive oxygen species which was followed by lipid peroxidation membrane damage and cell population growth the algae would be in a state of suspended animation under oxidative stress after uv chlorine treatment and some algae cells probably resurrection after a period of re cultivation sun et al 2018a fig s5 depicts the cell regrowth of a spiroides after discharge plasma treatment the algae cells after 12 min of plasma treatment at 4 kv still showed signs of regrowth no regrowth after 7 day incubation was observed if the treatment was longer than 1 min at 6 kv this demonstrated that appropriate plasma exposure intensity and duration time were able to realize satisfactory inactivation of a spiroides 3 3 involved reactive species in a spiroides removal previous studies reported that the active substances generated by discharge plasma played important roles in pollutants removal wang et al 2016b fig 5 a depicts the changes in the short lived active species with without a spiroides as detected by epr by using dmpo and dmpo dmso solutions as spin trapping reagents oh o2 1o2 signals were detected in the discharge plasma process at the same time it was found that the epr signals of these three species in water containing a spiroides significantly decreased compared with those in the deionized water these results strongly proved that oh o2 and 1o2 were involved in the inactivation of a spiroides and degradation of cyanotoxins fig 5 b depicts the generation of long life active substances h2o2 o3 and no3 it was found that the concentrations of h2o2 o3 and no3 all increased with the increase of discharge plasma treatment time and their concentrations in the deionized water were also significantly higher than those in the solution containing a spiroides therefore h2o2 o3 and no3 were also involved in the inactivation of a spiroides and degradation of cyanotoxins the h2o2 and o3 were the long life species in the discharge plasma process which were easily prone to produce oh and other active species kanazawa et al 2011 wang et al 2016b to further confirm the potential roles of these active species in the removal of a spiroides mannitol sod and l histidine were selected as radical scavengers for oh o2 and 1o2 respectively sehmi et al 2015 tiwari et al 2018 song et al 2019 fig 6 depicts the evolution of the removal efficiency of a spiroides under different radical scavenger doses after 6 min of discharge plasma treatment the removal efficiency of a spiroides decreased by 26 6 as the dosage of mannitol increased from 0 to 400 mmol l 1 fig 6a similarly the presence of sod and or l histidine also dramatically decreased the removal of a spiroides these results further confirmed the contributions of oh o2 and 1o2 to a spiroides removal 3 4 relationships among atx removal aom release and dbps formation excitation emission matrices eem can realize direct and rapid fluorescence quantitative analysis of multiple components in complex water bodies li et al 2017 this can provide a basis for understanding the structural characteristics and changes of aom in a spiroides cells after discharge plasma oxidation in this study four different eems fluorescence components c1 c2 c3 and c4 were identified using eem parafac analysis and their eems contours ex em loads and fluorescence peak positions are given in table 1 the component c1 has two peaks at ex em of 615 642 and 370 642 which represent the photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll a in the photosystem reaction dartnell et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 the component c2 has two peaks at ex em of 270 454 and 360 454 corresponding to a large molecular weight uvc humic like substances lapierre and del giorgio 2014 the component c3 with the ex em of 280 326 is assigned to a tryptophan like substance which reveals the diversity of amino acids and proteins in algal cells and correlates with the compositions of cyanotoxins zhang et al 2014 the component c4 with the ex em of 320 394 represents uva humic like substance with low molecular weight peleato et al 2017 the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax was used to understand the variability of these four components in aom in this study as shown in fig 7 a higher fmax suggests a higher content of the component the fmax value of the algae containing water increased firstly and then gradually decreased with the discharge plasma treatment time this indicated that the plasma oxidation caused the destruction of a spiroides cells accompanied by the release of the aom such as proteins peptides amino acids nucleic acids and other bioactive substances and then these aom would be further decomposed by the plasma oxidation zhang et al 2014 zhou et al 2018 similar with the aom the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration also first increased and then decreased with the discharge plasma treatment time fig s6 the increase of doc concentration at the initial stage of plasma treatment may be related to cell lysis caused by oxidation zhou et al 2014 carbonaceous dbps c dbps and nitrogenous dbps n dbps formation potentials including haloacetic acids haas trihalomethanes thms trichloronitromethane hnms and haloacetonitriles hans were evaluated after a spiroides removal by discharge plasma as shown in fig 8 obviously much lower concentrations of dbps due to chlorination were observed after the discharge plasma treatment as compared with the control group among them thms and haas were the main dbps with the maximum production of trichloromethane tcm dichloroacetic acid dcaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa being 105 6 51 1 and 37 9 μg l 1 before the plasma treatment respectively after 12 min of the plasma treatment the removal rates of tcm dcaa and tcaa were 78 7 90 6 and 93 4 respectively in addition hans and hnms are the two dominant n dbps in chlorination disinfection in fig 8 the concentrations of dichloroacetonitrile dcan and trichloronitromethane tcnm generated by the discharge plasma treatment decreased by 85 9 and 74 5 respectively compared with the control group these results demonstrated that the discharge plasma not only effectively inactivated the algae cells but could also significantly reduce the generation potentials of c dbps and n dbps in the subsequent chlorination disinfection treatment liu et al 2020 park et al 2021 the correlations among atx removal aom release and dbps formation were analyzed using pearson correlation coefficients as shown in table 2 a significant positive correlation between atx and aom p 0 01 as well as atx and doc p 0 05 was observed the correlations between dbps formation and aom p 0 01 as well as dbps formation and doc p 0 01 were also significantly positive therefore the removal of aom and or doc during a spiroides inactivation by the discharge plasma oxidation could effectively reduce atx accumulation and dbps formation potentials zhou et al 2014 concluded that the toxins released in m aeruginosa suspension increased with the degree of cell lysis by clo2 and dbps formation was positively related to doc release in the oxidation of clo2 similar phenomenon was also observed by coral et al 2013 during m aeruginosa removal by ozonation in addition many previous studies quantitatively evaluated the reactivity of m aeruginosa cells and their metabolites as precursors of dbps nguyen et al 2005 fang et al 2010 coral et al 2013 chu et al 2017 liu et al 2020 and concluded that aom released from algal cells contributed to the formation of dbps 4 conclusions the underlying molecular mechanisms of a spiroides inactivation and simultaneous control of the dbps formation by discharge plasma oxidation were unveiled in this study a spiroides removal performance was positively related to applied voltage and satisfactory removal efficiency more than 99 99 was realized after 12 min of plasma treatment which were further confirmed by the flow cytometry and lcfm analysis transcriptomics analysis of a spiroides genes demonstrated that genes with altered expressions were mainly related to cell walls and peripherals thylakoid membranes photosynthetic membranes and detoxification of toxins qualitative and quantitative analysis of ros demonstrated that oh o2 and 1o2 played significant roles in a spiroides inactivation aom and anatoxin a were firstly accumulated and then effectively degraded by the continuous attacks of ros resulting in dramatical reduction of formation potentials of subsequent dbps this study provides new insights into the development of effective and efficient approach to control cyanobacterial blooms in water bodies and to better understand the control of dbps
