4220,understanding the spatial variability of the snowpack is valuable for hydrologists and ecologists seeking to predict hydrological processes in a cold region snow distribution is a function of interactions among static variables such as terrain vegetation and soil properties and dynamic meteorological variables such as solar radiation wind speed and direction and soil moisture however identifying the dominant physical drivers responsible for spatial patterns of the snowpack particularly for ephemeral shallow snowpacks has been challenging due to the lack of the high resolution snowpack and physical variables with high vertical accuracy as well as inherent limitations in traditional approaches this study uses an unpiloted aerial system uas lidar based snow depth and static variables 1 m spatial resolution to analyze field scale spatial structures of snow depth and apply the maximum entropy maxent model to identify primary controls over open terrain and forests at the university of new hampshire thompson farm research observatory new hampshire united states we found that among nine topographic and soil variables plant functional type and terrain roughness contribute up to 80 and 76 of relative importance in the maxent framework to predict locations of deeper or shallower snowpacks respectively across a mixed temperate forested and field landscape soil variables such as organic matter and saturated hydraulic conductivity were also important controls up to 70 and 81 on snow depth spatial variations for both open and forested landscapes suggesting spatial variations in soil variables under snow can control thermal transfer among soil snowpack and surface atmosphere this work contributes to improving land surface and snow models by informing

spatial patterns in soil moisture and temperature shook et al 1993 mott et al 2013 however there is limited research regarding if and how soil property spatial variations contribute to snow distribution during the accumulation and ablation periods traditional manual ground sampling methods have been used to characterize snow depth spatial variability using statistical indicators probability distributions and fractal methods using traditional point measurements with a limited sample size requires a balance between the sampling spatial extent and sample density this impacts the

physical controls including vegetation and topography that are relatively consistent from year to year i e time stable grayson et al 2002 pflug and lundquist 2020 revuelto et al 2014 because these snowpack patterns repeat on an annual basis high resolution snow depth datasets in combination with increasingly sophisticated and ubiquitous terrain vegetation and soil property datasets are well suited to improve characterization of the role of fixed physical controls via data intensive methods e g generalized linear or additive models ensembles of regression trees such as random forests or

peters et al 2007 one such spatial modeling technique that has not been used to study snow depth patterns is the maximum entropy maxent model the maxent in combination with high resolution remote sensing techniques has the potential to characterize the role of multiple physical variables simultaneously on snow depth spatial variability as well as their relative importance maxent is a machine learning approach that uses the spatial location of focal features and predictor variables to extrapolate these features across a landscape where those predictor variables are present baldwin 2009 phillips et al 2004 phillips et al 2006 phillips and dudík 2008 in the ecological science community the maxent model has been successfully utilized for species distribution modeling with numerous applications elith et al 2006 phillips and dudík 2008 merow et al 2013 algeo et al 2017 using the maxent model ecologists predicted habitat suitability of animal and plant species using related spatial environmental factors as predictor variables dudik et al 2007 the principle of the maxent model originates in information theory jaynes 1957 but its application has been expanded to various disciplines such as archaeology howey et al 2016 2020 plant distribution mcmichael et al 2014 and soil and drought palace et al 2017 maxent has been applied in hydrology to a range of problems singh

variable importance with model reliability that dominates the overall contribution for developing a maxent model while entropy based methods have advantages over traditional statistical methods mishra and coulibaly 2009 research regarding the use of entropy theory for understanding snow variability across a landscape is currently limited keum et al 2018 the main objective of this study is to identify physical drivers controlling spatial heterogeneity of snow depth focusing on shallow ephemeral snowpacks using the maxent framework with information from a uas based lidar platform maxent

snow density ranges from 100 to 400 kg m3 burakowski et al 2013 3 datasets and methods 3 1 uas lidar snow depth surveys uas lidar snow depth surveys were conducted at the thompson farm research station during two consecutive winter seasons this study compares two lidar derived snow depth products that represent the distribution of snow depth at a spatial resolution of one meter snow surface elevations were collected on january 23rd 2019 hereafter termed water year wy 2019 and december 4th 2019 wy2020 the respective bare earth baseline elevations were collected following snowmelt on april 11th 2019 and march 18th 2020 the total area surveyed was approximately 0 11 km2 of which 0 7 km2 was open field and 0 4 km2 was mixed deciduous dormant and coniferous forest snowpacks for both dates were formed by heavy and wet snowfall total precipitation from the initial snowfall event to the date when the uas survey was conducted was 27 mm and 45 mm respectively january 19th to 23rd 2019 for wy2019 december 1st to 4th 2019 for wy2020 for both events the wind speed during snowfall and prior to the uas lidar surveys were minimal averaging approximately 2 5 m s see the windrose diagrams in fig s2 based on a directional semivariogram analysis there were no clear relationships between the wind speed and direction the parameters of the associated semivariogram and the deposition and redistribution of snow for either event a heavy lift quadcopter manufactured by uav america was used to carry lightweight and inexpensive lidar and gnss inertial sensors the lidar sensor used was the velodyne vlp 16 the vlp 16 has 16 independent infrared lasers that rotate 360 along the horizontal axis and are evenly spaced from 15 to 15 along the vertical axis the sensor was configured to only collect the strongest return per laser pulse resulting in approximately 300 000 laser shots per second lidar distance observations were georeferenced using the uas trajectory and attitude observed with the applanix apx 15 imu gps the apx 15 uses a high performance gnss receiver that achieves a positional accuracy of 2 5 cm following post processing post processing was accomplished using the pospac uas software package and a nearby continuously operating reference station global navigation satellite systems gnss base station micro electromechanical systems mems sensors are also used by the apx 15 to capture uas attitude with uncertainties of 0 025 degree roll and pitch and 0 08 degree true heading the apx 15 collects positional and attitude observations at a rate of 200 hz enabling the high frequency lidar observations to be accurately georeferenced uas flights were conducted at an altitude of 81 m this altitude was selected to achieve maximum swath width 150 m while remaining in the operational range limits of the vlp 16 lidar sensor a lawn mower flight plan with a targeted swath overlap of 40 was used on the wy2019 survey and the respective baseline in an effort to achieve a denser point cloud a crossed flight plan with a sensor swath overlap of 40 between parallel flight lines was used for the wy2020 survey and the respective baseline fig 1 similar point densities were achieved between the two flights a flight speed of 7 m s was used for both flights point clouds were filtered to remove all non ground laser returns using a progressive morphological filter as part of the r package lidr classified lidar returns were then averaged over a one meter grid to create digital elevation models dems for the bare earth and snow surfaces snow depth maps were constructed by simply subtracting the snow on dem from the bare earth dem in our previous study which validated the lidar snow depth with in situ magnaprobe snow depth measurements the lidar snow depth measurements had mean absolute differences mad and root mean squared difference rmsd values of 0 96 cm and 1 22 cm respectively in the open field and the mad and rmsd values were 9 6 cm and 10 5 cm respectively in the forest in wy2019 jacobs et al 2021 due to the relatively large differences in the forest an independent study was conducted to compare difference in snow depth measurements between the magnaprobe and a federal snow tube sampler the magnaprobe consistently overestimated snow depth measurements as compared to the federal sampler likely due to smaller diameter of the magnaprobe instrument magnaprobe 1 27 cm vs federal sampler 4 13 cm that was able to penetrate the unfrozen soil and leaf litter under the snow the lidar snow depth map in wy2020 had mad and rmsd of 1 6 cm and 2 0 cm respectively in the open field and mad and rmsd of 3 0 cm and 3 9 cm respectively in the forest under conditions of frozen soils the improved agreement between the magnaprobe and the lidar for the second campaign likely reflects the frozen forest soils and is a better indicator of typical lidar performance in the forest for this study we consider the lidar measurements to provide reliable measures of snow depth variations across the study area as needed to characterize the spatial variability of ephemeral shallow snowpack structure 3 2 physical variables topographic and soil variables were investigated as potential physical drivers of field scale snow depth spatial heterogeneity variables included in this study were inter pixel standard deviation of lidar returns std aspect slope roughness topographic compound index tci plant functional type shadow hours saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and soil organic matter fig 2 mapped at a one meter scale all physical variables are derived from our uas observations except the two soil variables the soil variables saturated hydraulic conductivity and organic matter of the soil at depth of 0 5 cm were obtained from probabilistic remapping of ssurgo polaris soil property maps at 30 m spatial resolution chaney et al 2016 chaney et al 2019 to avoid additional errors from a spatial downscaling process the soil maps were disaggregated to 1 m2 resolution without applying any interpolation techniques the percent slope and aspect were calculated using horn s method horn 1981 surface roughness was calculated as the largest intra cell difference of a central pixel and its eight surrounding cells std is the standard deviation of the lidar returns within each pixel and is a measure of the small scale surface roughness topographic compound index tci also known as or topographic wetness index is used to estimate the surface water that might accumulate across a landscape sørensen et al 2006 howey et al 2016 this metric is computed as a tan b the cumulative upslope region a that drains through a specific point along a contour path b total shading hours represents the number of hours from 7 am to 5 pm that a pixel was in the shade on the survey date and was calculated using the unfiltered uas lidar digital terrain model dtm and the incidence angle of the sun on the survey date binary shadow maps shadow or no shadow were made for each hour from 7 am to 5 pm then merged to count the number of hours that a pixel was in the shade to characterize the local variability of snow depth 10 m the local gradient of the snow surfaces and their respective baselines snow off were calculated using image convolution through a 9 9 pixel moving window the horizontal gradient within the moving window was calculated as the difference between the mean pixel values to the left of the center column and the mean pixel values to the right of the center column the vertical gradient within the moving window was calculated as the difference between the mean pixel values above the center row and the mean pixel values below the center row the total local gradient lg was then calculated by summing the gradient components as follows 1 t o t a l lg horizontal g r a d i e n t 2 vertical g r a d i e n t 2 at least 50 of the pixels within each window had to have snow depth data e g percentage of pixels with data to the left of the center column if this condition was not met for any portion of the window used to calculate the gradient components a value of not available na was recorded for the total gradient at this location 3 3 maximum entropy maxent model the concept of maxent originates in information theory jaynes 1957 the principle of the maxent states that the most appropriate distribution to represent a given data set is the one with the largest entropy that satisfies the constraints of prior information about the target distribution phillips et al 2006 the constraints mean that the expected value of each predictor variable should match its empirical mean value for a set of sample points taken from the distribution in spatial modeling maxent as a machine learning approach uses the spatial location of focal features and predictor input variables to extrapolate these features across a landscape where those predictor variables are present baldwin 2009 phillips et al 2006 maxent is theoretically similar to generalized linear models glms and generalized additive models gams for example if the probability of occurrence is modeled by a gam using a logit link function the model form is the same as the log probability of a pixel in maxent with threshold features phillips et al 2006 while the maxent has similarities to existing methods such as glm and gams for spatial distribution modeling important differences exist between the maxent and glm gams leading to different predictions when the probability of occurrence is modeled by glm gams absence data are required in many disciplines survey techniques birds for example or archaeological sites only presence data are able to be recorded with certainity in addition in many regions survey data are limited in their spatial coverage thus background pixels instead of true absence data must be used and the model output is less clear cut ferrier et al 2002 in contrast the maxent can model a probability distribution over the pixels in the study area without absence data in addition because maxent is a generative approach whereas glm gams are discriminative it can often give better prediction results when the amount of training data are relatively small ng and jordan 2002 while applications of maxent have expanded to various disciplines including a range of hydrologic problems singh 1997 fischer et al 2020 westhoff and zehe 2013 rahmati et al 2016 wang and bras 2011 to our knowledge there have been no studies seeking to understand snowpack spatial variability using this approach in this study we used the maxent framework to identify physical variables that control the spatial variations of the snow depth estimated from a uas lidar system in the context of a shallow ephemeral snowpack the important variables identified from the maxent models are considered as a proxy for physical drivers to generate spatial heterogeneity of snowpack because they dominantly contribute to predicting the deep or shallow snow depths there are two types of variable importance values from the maxent model percent contribution and permutation importance the maxent model keeps track of which input variables are contributing to fitting the model while it is being trained in the training process each step increases the gain of the model by modifying the coefficient for a single variable the percent contribution is obtained by converting the gains to percentages at the end of the process the permutation importance is defined as the decrease in a model score when a single feature value is randomly shuffled this procedure breaks the relationship between the input variables and the dependent variable thus the drop in the model score is indicative of how much the model depends on the feature this importance for each input variable is determined by randomly permutatiing the values of the variable among the training points see details in phillips et al 2006 percent contribution results are presented in the body of the paper and permutation importance results are included in the supporting information to check the reliability of the maxent models the area under the receiver operator curve auc is used in this study which indicates the predictive capacity of the model merow et al 2013 auc indicates the probability that a randomly chosen presence point is ranked higher than a randomly chosen absence point 0 to 1 an auc value of 0 5 is the same as a random guess of presence absence the closer an auc value is to 1 the more reliable the predictions from the maxent model a model with an auc over 0 75 is often considered to accurately estimate sample data phillips and dudík 2008 4 results 4 1 relationship among physical variables before conducting the maxent model analysis to identify physical drivers controlling spatial variability of snow depth cross correlation matrices among the physical input variables were calculated for 1 landscape scale i e fields and forest combined 2 fields and 3 forest fig 3 shows the cross correlation matrices with the pearson correlation coefficients r values with different colors for all three areas roughness is strongly correlated with slope r 0 69 0 95 and 0 69 for landscape scale fields and forest respectively while slope and roughness are moderately correlated with the standard deviation of lidar returns std r 0 63 for both in fields they are less strongly correlated r 0 39 and 0 34 in forest areas for the fields there is also a strong correlation r 0 65 between saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and organic matter of soils 4 2 spatial patterns of snow depth the uas lidar based snow depths mapped by subtracting snow off dtms from snow on dtms reveal a shallow snow depth ranging from less than 2 cm to over 21 cm in wy2019 mean 9 4 cm standard deviation 9 7 cm and up to 41 cm in wy2020 mean 26 9 cm standard deviation 15 2 cm fig 4 and table 1 the shallower snow depths lower 30 were 6 4 cm and 24 cm and deeper snow depths higher than 70 for each map were 12 cm and 29 cm in wy2019 and wy2020 respectively despite having different magnitudes of snow depth between the two dates there were similar spatial patterns deeper snow depth values blue existed in the fields and shallower snow depths red in forest fig 4 compared to the forest snowpack the field snow depth had relatively high spatial variability and less coherent patterns in the field the deeper snow is in the northeast areas in wy2019 however in wy2020 the deeper snow occurred in the middle and east areas a shallow and spatially consistent snowpack occurred in forest areas in the deciduous forest type the snow depth was consistently higher than that in coniferous forest especially in the east forest see the plant functional type map in fig 2f the shallowest snowpack was found in coniferous forest type likewise spatially coherent patterns of the local gradients of snow depth are readily discernible between the two uas surveys fig 4c and d lower local gradient values red indicating a relatively consistent snow depth existed in the east fields higher gradients blue were found in the field to forest transitions and roads in the forest areas the lower local gradients generally appeared in coniferous forest high local gradients are consistently found at the forest edge 4 3 physical drivers contributing spatial variability of snow depth to determine the most relevant physical drivers that contribute to the spatial heterogeneity of snow depth the relative importance of the input variables from the maxent model with different thresholds was quantified fig 5 shows the relative contribution of the nine input variables from each maxent run using the shallow and deep snow depth values within thresholds larger percentages indicate those variables that play a greater role in predicting the suitability of shallower or deeper snow depth for shallow snow depths top panels fig 5a c plant functional type is the most important variable in the landscape scale especially in the wy2019 snow depths which were shallower than the snow depths from wy2020 for the snow depths in wy2020 soil organic matter and roughness contribute somewhat e g both are 27 for the lowest 3 quantile of snow depth in the fields soil variables organic matter and ksat and slope are generally important the contribution of soil organic matter to the shallow snow depths in wy2020 is very strong ranging up to 70 in the forest it seems that different variables influence the shallow snowpack for the two study snowpacks while ksat and aspect are clearly important to identify shallow snow depth in wy2019 as compared to other variables there are no dominant variables in wy2020 soil organic matter 21 to 37 and roughness 17 to 23 are somewhat important for extremely shallow snow depths less than 3 to 5 quantiles for deep snow depths bottom panels fig 5d f different variables contribute to snow depth for the two study snowpacks while the organic matter is the dominant control in wy2019 landscape scale roughness and std are more important in wy2020 in the fields ksat and organic matter indicate locations of deep snow in wy2019 but roughness is the most important variable in wy2020 in the forest the variable contributions differ by snowpack for the deepest snow depth 95 to 97 quantiles roughness and std is important but the contributions of ksat and organic matter gradually increase when the threshold for deep snow is decreased in summary plant functional type is an important explanatory variable for mixed vegetation areas especially in predicting the shallow snow depth soil variables organic matter and ksat contribute to both shallow and deep snowpacks roughness and std are also important particularly for the snow depth in wy2020 rather than in wy2019 contrary to expectations shadow hours aspect and tci had limited ability to identify the relatively shallow or deep snow depth in the maxent framework predicted suitability maps of shallower or deeper snow depth can be estimated from the maxent models developed for target ranges based on the training points with input variables the maxent model provides suitable locations with likelihood where the range of snow depth likely exists for example fig 6 includes predicted suitability maps for the locations where the snow depth is less than the 5 quantile and greater than the 95 snow depth quantile for the two snowpacks these maps are the combination of the two maps developed by the maxent models for fields and forest respectively in wy2019 fig 6a locations with high predicted suitability dark red for shallow snowpack correspond to locations with shallow snow depth e g west forest south fields and central fields near ponds see fig 4 in wy2020 fig 6b distributions with high suitability also agreed fairly well with the shallow values from the snow depth map e g southwest fields and east forest for the 95 snow depth quantile predicted maps with high suitability values captured areas where deep snow depth exists fig 6c and d e g northeast fields in wy2019 central fields near the small buildings in wy2020 and east forest in both months in an effort to better discern the effect of soil variables such as ksat and organic matter on the reliability of the maxent model auc values are compared for models that include and exclude the two soil variables fig 7 the auc values from the maxent models for the shallowest 3 to 5 and deepest snow depths 95 to 97 quantiles are higher than the moderate snow depths 10 to 30 and 70 to 95 for both shallow and deep snow depths the maxent models with soil variables have higher auc values than the maxent models without soil variables this tendency is more apparent in the field than the forest for fields with shallow snow depth fig 7a auc values with soil variables range from 0 86 to 0 92 for the 3 to 5 snow depth quantiles while the values without soil variables range from 0 76 to 0 83 for fields with a deep snowpack fig 7b there is a more modest influence the auc values with soil variables for the 95 to 97 quantiles range from 0 86 to 0 93 while the values without soil variables are range from 0 79 to 0 87 4 4 localized variability of snow depth the relative contributions of the static variables on the snow depth local gradients were computed in the maxent framework for locations having lower less than 3 to 30 and higher local gradients greater than 7 to 97 fig 8 for this analysis the static variable included the nine input variables previously used as well as the local gradient mapped during the baseline snow off flight variables with larger percentages indicate that the input variables play a greater role in predicting the local gradients and typically improving the maxent s reliability for low local gradients of snow depth implying locally homogeneous snowpack conditions within 10 m top panels plant functional type was the most important variable 32 49 for landscape scale especially in the shallower snow depth map from wy2019 fig 8a roughness and the baseline local gradient were of secondary importance in wy2019 and wy2020 respectively roughness contributed 24 and baseline local gradient contributed 23 for the less than 3 quantile of local gradients in the fields there were clear differences in important variables between the two snowpacks fig 8b while soil variables organic matter and ksat and roughness were important for wy2019 the baseline s local gradient was the strongest contributor for wy2020 in the forest there were no dominant variables except for the baseline s local gradient for wy2019 fig 8c aspect shadow hours std and tci did not play a role in the location of low local gradients for the overall site nor for the field and forest areas for high local gradients of snow depth bottom panels of fig 8 roughness and the baseline local gradient are important for identifying landscape scale transitions for the wy2019 snowpack the contributing percentage of the baseline s local gradient was around 70 for the extremely high local gradients 95 to 97 quantiles the contribution of the baseline local gradient decreased with decreasing thresholds and roughness s contribution increased indicating a transition between the two highly correlated variables fig 8d in fields the baseline local gradient was the dominant control and contributed up to 80 fig 8e organic matter was also somewhat important up to 20 to 34 for the highest local gradient of snow depth higher than 95 quantiles in the forest while there were no dominant variables as compared to fields or landscape scale for wy2019 ksat and baseline s local gradient were important 49 and 36 respectively fig 8f the contribution of roughness gradually increases with decreasing the quantiles particularly from 70 to 85 quantiles in summary plant functional type is valuable for predicting the low local gradients of the snowpack at the landscape scale within a single plant functional type the baseline s local gradient and roughness control the locations of both the low and high local gradients of snow depth soil variables also contribute modestly to identifying spatial variability in the localized snowpack contrary to our expectations shadow hours aspect and tci had marginal contributions for localized snowpack variations at the 10 m scale using the maxent framework in contrast with predicted suitability maps of snow depth the two predicted suitability maps of high local gradients have relatively similar spatial patterns for the two snowpacks except for the west forest fig 9 because the baseline s local gradient and roughness were the dominant controls needed to predict the local gradients of snowpack the spatial distributions of baseline s local gradient and roughness are reflected in the predicted maps compare to the input variable maps in fig 2 5 discussion 5 1 physical drivers comparison with previous findings static features such as topography and vegetation rather than local meteorology and precipitation patterns typically control snow distribution at the local scale there are numerous studies which attempt to characterize spatial snow structures and to identify physical characteristics affecting the spatial characteristics of the snowpack blöschl and kirnbauer 1992 investigated the relationship between spatial snow patterns and terrain attributes e g elevation and slope in the austrian alps they found no dominant relationship to terrain parameters with spatial snow depth lapena and martz 1996 found that spatial structures of snow depth are related to sheltering by topographic obstacles indicating that drifting is a critical process in the prairie environment mott et al 2011 mentioned that the driving force for the drifting processes is the air flow near the surface layer which is partially shaped by the local terrain our results have similar findings in that there were clear differences in snow depth within the fields e g east versus west fields and transitional areas between fields and forest currier and lundquist 2018 also found large differences in snow depth for the forest edge classifications in the western united states soil properties are considered to be a potential feature that can affect spatial variability of snowpack yet few studies have investigated how important soil properties are to inform the spatial structure of snow depth as compared to other terrain characteristics shook et al 1993 investigated area frequency relationships of snow and soil patches at different stages during the melting season in prairie and alpine environments they found that snow and soil patches are fractals and their size distribution is predictable implying that soil properties may potentially influence such behavior redding and devito 2011 showed differences in the timing of snow disappearance between two sites with different soil types they found that mean snowmelt rates at sites with sand soils were quicker than those at sites with loam soils however they could not conduct significance tests due to the limited measurements from the loam soils our findings suggest that soil properties organic matter and hydraulic conductivity can be more important than shadow hours aspect std and for modeling the spatial distribution of snow depth which is probably because soil properties especially soil organic matter impact soil thermal conductivity abu hamdeh and reeder 2000 the thermal conductivity of soil is highly dependent on soil density mineral type grain size and moisture content farouki 1981 penner 1970 parikh et al 1979 in frozen soils the thermal conductivity is more sensitive to soil type than non frozen soils because the thermal conductivity of ice is more than four times larger than that of liquid water penner 1970 recently zhu et al 2019 found that soil organic matter was a dominant factor controlling the variability of thermal diffusivity at 200 field sites in the high latitude regions our results suggest that spatial differences in soil properties may lead to a spatial discrepancy in heat transfer between snowpack and soil surface resulting in an enhanced spatial variability of snow depth even at local scales with large spatial variability of soil temperature e g less than 10 m spatial correlation in fields mohanty et al 1995 and frequent patchy snow in shallow ephemeral snowpacks the differences in the energy transfer between snow and soil surface across areas with different snow depths may lead to a heterogeneous spatial distribution of surface temperatures future research with supporting data representing the energy transfer is needed to address the role of soil properties in the spatial heterogeneity of snowpack 5 2 maxent framework compared to traditional analysis to our knowledge this study is the first to use the maxent model to understand snow distribution measured using a uas based lidar in the natural science community the maxent model is one of the most popular methods for species distribution and ecological modeling elith et al 2006 merow et al 2013 the maxent framework provides accurate information about the degree of importance among the input variables that dominate the overall contribution to develop the maxent model with model reliability for the snow science and hydrology community this approach can create novel opportunities to identify dominant physical variables and to advance snow and land surface models by leveraging remotely sensed snow observations at multiple scales as a traditional method variogram approaches including fractal analysis have been widely used to understand the spatial scaling patterns of snow depth or swe based on the self similarity of properties over multiple scales deems et al 2006 conducted a variogram analysis of snow depth topography and vegetation topography datasets from three 1 km2 study areas using an airborne based lidar system they found the existence of two different scale areas from the vegetation topography and snow depth data separated by a scale break that ranges between 31 and 56 m for vegetation topography and between 15 and 40 m for snow depth trujillo et al 2007 also attempted to determine whether the spatial distribution of snow depth has scale invariance with the interaction with physical features including vegetation topography and winds they found that a scale break of snow depth was controlled by the scaling characteristics of vegetation height when wind redistribution of snow was minimal and canopy interception was dominant using fractal analysis schirmer and lehning 2011 investigated seasonal and spatial changes in the scaling behavior of snow depth they found that the scale break gradually increases throughout the snow accumulation season indicating that roughness of the terrain surface buried by snow may control the scaling behavior even though the variogram type analyses have provided explicit information to characterize the spatial structure of snowpack limited information is available to determine the relative importance among various physical characteristics related to the formation of the spatial structure of snow depth deems et al 2006 speculated that the length of the scale break might be due to the terrain relief and that the physical process change found by the breaks in the variograms of the vegetation topography potentially influences the scaling patterns of snow depth in trujillo et al 2007 s results none of the breaks in the slope of the log log plots between snow depth and the corresponding fields of topography and vegetation topography were present while the break in the scaling behavior was controlled by the vegetation characteristics e g canopy height canopy covered area and distances between trees thus it is expected that the maxent framework with spatially distributed snowpack data supplements the existing approaches by providing various information about dominant predictor variables along with spatially predicted suitability maps in the context of a statistical approach to identify dominant features a brief discussion about differences between the maxent and existing popular methods such as the principal component analysis pca is warranted the pca is a widely used approach for reducing the dimensionality of exploratory data sets to compute the pcs and interpret them from the original data sets particularly this method is useful when the variables within the data set are highly correlated however the pcs are the linear combination of the original variables which may not be as readable and interpretable as the original features because snowpack responses to meteorological and land characteristics tend to be complex and sometimes have nonlinear behaviors anderton 2000 anderton et al 2004 a pca might not be successful in addressing the features also the ordinary pca method is not suitable to handle categorical variables because it is hard to find a suitable way to represent distances between variable categories and individuals in the factorial space maxent offers several advantages regarding these limitations maxent can utilize both continuous and categorical data sets and incorporate interactions between different variables it can also provide individual contributions of correlated explanatory variables on the response variable allowing each variable to be interpreted separately 5 3 uas lidar snow depth sampling uas based lidar has been recently utilized for snow depth mapping harder et al 2020 jacobs et al 2021 providing an opportunity to eliminate many of the drawbacks that arise from airborne laser scanning als and terrestrial laser scanning tls systems deems et al 2013 fey et al 2019 hojatimalekshah et al 2021 prokop 2008 obscuration from clouds found in als systems will rarely be an issue because uas lidar surveys are generally conducted at an altitude below 120 m although spatial coverage is typically greatly reduced in uas missions relative to other als platforms harpold et al 2014 kirchner et al 2014 the aerial perspective and the large sensor swath overlap facilitated by appropriate mission planning and post processing provides reduced uncertainties in elevation from those that can result from high off nadir viewing angles and occlusion in other als platforms in the same vein flight parameters can be readily adjusted to achieve equally dense point clouds over open and forested areas improving ground finding and resulting in better characterization of vegetation and terrain mapping for this study flight speeds were held constant over both fields and forests which produced lower return density over the forested part of our study site there is some evidence that vegetation reduces return density due to scattering and absorption liu et al 2020 jacobs et al 2021 so reduced flight speeds over vegetation to account for the reduction in returns could improve terrain characterization in these settings 5 4 limitations while this study employed a well validated machine learning approach in a novel setting identifying the primary terrain predictors of fine scale distribution of snow depth there are potential limitations to providing generalizable information due to limited experiments and data availability the dominant predictors might depend on the timing of the survey dates e g snow accumulation vs melt periods physical factors controlling the amount of absorbed sunlight such as shadow hours aspect and tci may not be dominant in the early snow season because shortwave fluxes would have a cumulative effect on snow physical properties pomeroy and brun 2001 it is possible that spatial differences in absorbed solar energy have little control over snow depth variability because this analysis was performed early in the winter season and shortly after snowfall to fully address this possibility a similar analysis with a times series which tracks thesnowpack evolution from the start of the accumulation season through the end of the ablation season is needed in addition to high resolution snow depth maps from a uas based lidar albedo maps from a uas based visible and or infrared sensor would be beneficial to improve the maxent analysis by offering an accurate calculation of the absorbed radiative fluxes levy et al 2018 wang et al 2020 due to the limited availability of soil data we used the polaris soil data with relatively courser spatial resolution 30 m assuming that the soil data can represent spatial variability of the soil characteristics within the 830 000 m2 study area they were used as predictor variables in the maxent framework and found as important variables however the courser spatial resolution could limit the confidence in the role of the soil variables in the maxent general evaluation of the polaris data against in situ measurements provides r2 values of 0 42 chaney et al 2019 additional validation against sample measurements in the study area may enhance the reliability of the maxent model also future research including supporting data such as soil and snow temperature and or snowmelt maps is also needed to fully address the role of spatially distributed soil properties in determining the spatial heterogeneity of energy transfer between the soil and the snowpack while the current results correspond to relatively flat terrain with low relief and a shallow snowpack there is a possibility that the maxent framework for different plant functional types climate zones and or snow classes could generate different results because previous studies indicate that snow depth patterns are largely affected by terrain characteristics and snow regimes anderton et al 2004 clark et al 2011 currier and lundquist 2018 thus as more high resolution snow depth data sets in different environments become available it would be valuable to use the maxent framework to better understand the spatial variability of snow depth lastly the inclusion of relevant meteorological variables e g solar radiation and wind speed direction in the maxent is expected to provide a more robust determination of the dominant drivers among both static and dynamic variables application of the maxent framework in a wide range of environments could potentially refine the parameterization of snowpack evolution in land surface models and down scaling of remotely sensed snow products 6 conclusion understanding the spatial variability of snow is valuable for hydrologists and ecologists seeking to predict hydrological processes species distributions land atmosphere interactions however identifying dominant physical drivers controlling the spatial structure of snow depth has been challenged due to the lack of high resolution snowpack and physical variables with high vertical accuracy as well as limitations in traditional approaches to overcome this we first employ the maxent framework with 1 m spatial snow and terrain maps from a uas based lidar system to identify physical variables controlling field scale spatial structures of shallow ephemeral snow depth over open terrain and forests we found that among the nine terrain plant functional type and soil variables plant functional type and roughness had an important contribution in the maxent framework as needed to predict spatial locations having either deeper or shallower snow depth across the landscape soil organic matter and saturated hydraulic conductivity were revealed as important controls on snow depth spatial variations for both fields and forest suggesting spatial variations in the soil variables under the snowpack can control thermal transfer between soil and snowpack along with the near surface atmosphere despite the difference in controls and locations of the relatively shallow and deep snowpacks the transition zones between areas with similar snow depths as identified using local gradients were consistent for both dates and well characterized by the underlying local gradients of baseline flights without snow it is expected that the results provide insight into snow and land surface models by aiding in the parameterization at the sub grid scale and helping to support the down scaling of

4220,understanding the spatial variability of the snowpack is valuable for hydrologists and ecologists seeking to predict hydrological processes in a cold region snow distribution is a function of interactions among static variables such as terrain vegetation and soil properties and dynamic meteorological variables such as solar radiation wind speed and direction and soil moisture however identifying the dominant physical drivers responsible for spatial patterns of the snowpack particularly for ephemeral shallow snowpacks has been challenging due to the lack of the high resolution snowpack and physical variables with high vertical accuracy as well as inherent limitations in traditional approaches this study uses an unpiloted aerial system uas lidar based snow depth and static variables 1 m spatial resolution to analyze field scale spatial structures of snow depth and apply the maximum entropy maxent model to identify primary controls over open terrain and forests at the university of new hampshire thompson farm research observatory new hampshire united states we found that among nine topographic and soil variables plant functional type and terrain roughness contribute up to 80 and 76 of relative importance in the maxent framework to predict locations of deeper or shallower snowpacks respectively across a mixed temperate forested and field landscape soil variables such as organic matter and saturated hydraulic conductivity were also important controls up to 70 and 81 on snow depth spatial variations for both open and forested landscapes suggesting spatial variations in soil variables under snow can control thermal transfer among soil snowpack and surface atmosphere this work contributes to improving land surface and snow models by informing parameterization of the sub grid scale snow depths down scaling remotely sensed snow products and understanding field scale snow states keywords spatial variability of snowpack remote sensing

musselman et al 2008 and reduced sublimation roth and nolin 2017 many western u s studies have identified elevation and temperature as primary factors explaining differences in forested versus open snowpack accumulation and duration lundquist et al 2013 roth and nolin 2017 for soil snow interactions previous work indicates that the spatial distribution of snowpack and melt timing controlled spatial patterns in soil moisture and temperature shook et al 1993 mott et al 2013 however there is limited research regarding if and how soil property spatial variations contribute to snow distribution during the accumulation and ablation periods traditional manual ground sampling methods have been used to characterize snow depth spatial variability using statistical indicators probability distributions and fractal methods using traditional point measurements with a limited sample size requires a balance between the sampling spatial extent and sample density this impacts the

physical controls including vegetation and topography that are relatively consistent from year to year i e time stable grayson et al 2002 pflug and lundquist 2020 revuelto et al 2014 because these snowpack patterns repeat on an annual basis high resolution snow depth datasets in combination with increasingly sophisticated and ubiquitous terrain vegetation and soil property datasets are well suited to improve characterization of the role of fixed physical controls via data intensive methods e g generalized linear or additive models ensembles of regression trees such as random forests or

peters et al 2007 one such spatial modeling technique that has not been used to study snow depth patterns is the maximum entropy maxent model the maxent in combination with high resolution remote sensing techniques has the potential to characterize the role of multiple physical variables simultaneously on snow depth spatial variability as well as their relative importance maxent is a machine learning approach that uses the spatial location of focal features and predictor variables to extrapolate these features across a landscape where those predictor variables are present baldwin 2009 phillips et al 2004 phillips et al 2006 phillips and dudík 2008 in the ecological science community the maxent model has been successfully utilized for species distribution modeling with numerous

station during two consecutive winter seasons this study compares two lidar derived snow depth products that represent the distribution of snow depth at a spatial resolution of one meter snow surface elevations were collected on january 23rd 2019 hereafter termed water year wy 2019 and december 4th 2019 wy2020 the respective bare earth baseline elevations were collected following snowmelt on april 11th 2019 and march 18th 2020 the total area surveyed was approximately 0 11 km2 of which 0 7 km2 was open field and 0 4 km2 was mixed deciduous dormant and coniferous forest snowpacks for both dates were formed by heavy and wet snowfall total precipitation from the initial snowfall event to the date when the uas survey was conducted was 27 mm and 45 mm respectively january 19th to 23rd 2019 for wy2019 december 1st to 4th 2019 for wy2020 for both events the wind speed during snowfall and prior to the uas lidar surveys were minimal averaging approximately 2 5 m s see the windrose diagrams in fig s2 based on a directional semivariogram analysis there were no clear relationships between the wind speed and direction the parameters of the associated semivariogram and the deposition and redistribution of snow for either event a heavy lift quadcopter manufactured by uav america was used to carry lightweight and inexpensive lidar and gnss inertial sensors the lidar sensor used was the velodyne vlp 16 the vlp 16 has 16 independent infrared lasers that rotate 360 along the horizontal axis and are evenly spaced from 15 to 15 along the vertical axis the sensor was configured to only collect the strongest return per laser pulse resulting in approximately 300 000 laser shots per second lidar distance observations were georeferenced using the uas trajectory and attitude observed with the applanix apx 15 imu gps the apx 15 uses a high performance gnss receiver that achieves a positional accuracy of 2 5 cm following post processing post processing was accomplished using the pospac uas software package and a nearby continuously operating reference station global navigation satellite systems gnss base station micro electromechanical systems mems sensors are also used by the apx 15 to capture uas attitude with uncertainties of 0 025 degree roll and pitch and 0 08 degree true heading the apx 15 collects positional and attitude observations at a rate of 200 hz enabling the high frequency lidar observations to be accurately georeferenced uas flights were conducted at an altitude of 81 m this altitude was selected to achieve maximum swath width 150 m while remaining in the operational range limits of the vlp 16 lidar sensor a lawn mower flight plan with a targeted swath overlap of 40 was used on the wy2019 survey and the respective baseline in an effort to achieve a denser point cloud a crossed flight plan with a sensor swath overlap of 40 between parallel flight lines was used for the wy2020 survey and the respective baseline fig 1 similar point densities were achieved between the two flights a flight speed of 7 m s was used for both flights point clouds were filtered to remove all non ground laser returns using a progressive morphological filter as part of the r package lidr classified lidar returns were then averaged over a one meter grid to create digital elevation models dems for the bare earth and snow surfaces snow depth maps were constructed by simply subtracting the snow on dem from the bare earth dem in our previous study which validated the lidar snow depth with in situ magnaprobe snow depth measurements the lidar snow depth measurements had mean absolute differences mad and root mean squared difference rmsd values of 0 96 cm and 1 22 cm respectively in the open field and the mad and rmsd values were 9 6 cm and 10 5 cm respectively in the forest in wy2019 jacobs et al 2021 due to the relatively large differences in the forest an independent study was conducted to compare difference in snow depth measurements between the magnaprobe and a federal snow tube sampler the magnaprobe consistently overestimated snow depth measurements as compared to the federal sampler likely due to smaller diameter of the magnaprobe instrument magnaprobe 1 27 cm vs federal sampler 4 13 cm that was able to penetrate the unfrozen soil and leaf litter under the snow the lidar snow depth map in wy2020 had mad and rmsd of 1 6 cm and 2 0 cm respectively in the open field and mad and rmsd of 3 0 cm and 3 9 cm respectively in the forest under conditions of frozen soils the improved agreement between the magnaprobe and the lidar for the second campaign likely reflects the frozen forest soils and is a better indicator of typical lidar performance in the forest for this study we consider the lidar measurements to provide reliable measures of snow depth variations across the study area as needed to characterize the spatial variability of ephemeral shallow snowpack structure 3 2 physical variables topographic and soil variables were investigated as potential physical drivers of field scale snow depth spatial heterogeneity variables included in this study were inter pixel standard deviation of lidar returns std aspect slope roughness topographic compound index tci plant functional type shadow hours saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and soil organic matter fig 2 mapped at a one meter scale all physical variables are derived from our uas observations except the two soil variables the soil variables saturated hydraulic conductivity and organic matter of the soil at depth of 0 5 cm were obtained from probabilistic remapping of ssurgo polaris soil property maps at 30 m spatial resolution chaney et al 2016 chaney et al 2019 to avoid additional errors from a spatial downscaling process the soil maps were disaggregated to 1 m2 resolution without applying any interpolation techniques the percent slope and aspect were calculated using horn s method horn 1981 surface roughness was calculated as the largest intra cell difference of a central pixel and its eight surrounding cells std is the standard deviation of the lidar returns within each pixel and is a measure of the small scale surface roughness topographic compound index tci also known as or topographic wetness index is used to estimate the surface water that might accumulate across a landscape sørensen et al 2006 howey et al 2016 this metric is computed as a tan b the cumulative upslope region a that drains through a specific point along a contour path b total shading hours represents the number of hours from 7 am to 5 pm that a pixel was in the shade on the survey date and was calculated using the unfiltered uas lidar digital terrain model dtm and the incidence angle of the sun on the survey date binary shadow maps shadow or no shadow were made for each hour from 7 am to 5 pm then merged to count the number of hours that a pixel was in the shade to characterize the local variability of snow depth 10 m the local gradient of the snow surfaces and their respective baselines snow off were calculated using image convolution through a 9 9 pixel moving window the horizontal gradient within the moving window was calculated as the difference between the mean pixel values to the left of the center column and the mean pixel values to the right of the center column the vertical gradient within the moving window was calculated as the difference between the mean pixel values above the center row and the mean pixel values below the center row the total local gradient lg was then calculated by summing the gradient components as follows 1 t o t a l lg horizontal g r a d i e n t 2 vertical g r a d i e n t 2 at least 50 of the pixels within each window had to have snow depth data e g percentage of pixels with data to the left of the center column if this condition was not met for any portion of the window used to calculate the gradient components a value of not available na was recorded for the total gradient at this location 3 3 maximum entropy maxent model the concept of maxent originates in information theory jaynes 1957 the principle of the maxent states that the most appropriate distribution to represent a given data set is the one with the largest entropy that satisfies the constraints of prior information about the target distribution phillips et al 2006 the constraints mean that the expected value of each predictor variable should match its empirical mean value for a set of sample points taken from the distribution in spatial modeling maxent as a machine learning approach uses the spatial location of focal features and predictor input variables to extrapolate these features across a landscape where those predictor variables are present baldwin 2009 phillips et al 2006 maxent is theoretically similar to generalized linear models glms and generalized additive models gams for example if the probability of occurrence is modeled by a gam using a logit link function the model form is the same as the log probability of a pixel in maxent with threshold features phillips et al 2006 while the maxent has similarities to existing methods such as glm and gams for spatial distribution modeling important differences exist between the maxent and glm gams leading to different predictions when the probability of occurrence is modeled by glm gams absence data are required in many disciplines survey techniques birds for example or archaeological sites only presence data are able to be recorded with certainity in addition in many regions survey data are limited in their spatial coverage thus background pixels instead of true absence data must be used and the model output is less clear cut ferrier et al 2002 in contrast the maxent can model a probability distribution over the pixels in the study area without absence data in addition because maxent is a generative approach whereas glm gams are discriminative it can often give better prediction results when the amount of training data are relatively small ng and jordan 2002 while applications of maxent have expanded to various disciplines including a range of hydrologic problems singh 1997 fischer et al 2020 westhoff and zehe 2013 rahmati et al 2016 wang and bras 2011 to our knowledge there have been no studies seeking to understand snowpack spatial variability using this approach in this study we used the maxent framework to identify physical variables that control the spatial variations of the snow depth estimated from a uas lidar system in the context of a shallow ephemeral snowpack the important variables identified from the maxent models are considered as a proxy for physical drivers to generate spatial heterogeneity of snowpack because they dominantly contribute to predicting the deep or shallow snow depths there are two types of variable importance values from the maxent model percent contribution and permutation importance the maxent model keeps track of which input variables are contributing to fitting the model while it is being trained in the training process each step increases the gain of the model by modifying the coefficient for a single variable the percent contribution is obtained by converting the gains to percentages at the end of the process the permutation importance is defined as the decrease in a model score when a single feature value is randomly shuffled this procedure breaks the relationship between the input variables and the dependent variable thus the drop in the model score is indicative of how much the model depends on the feature this importance for each input variable is determined by randomly permutatiing the values of the variable among the training points see details in phillips et al 2006 percent contribution results are presented in the body of the paper and permutation importance results are included in the supporting information to check the reliability of the maxent models the area under the receiver operator curve auc is used in this study which indicates the predictive capacity of the model merow et al 2013 auc indicates the probability that a randomly chosen presence point is ranked higher than a randomly chosen absence point 0 to 1 an auc value of 0 5 is the same as a random guess of presence absence the closer an auc value is to 1 the more reliable the predictions from the maxent model a model with an auc over 0 75 is often considered to accurately estimate sample data phillips and dudík 2008 4 results 4 1 relationship among physical variables before conducting the maxent model analysis to identify physical drivers controlling spatial variability of snow depth cross correlation matrices among the physical input variables were calculated for 1 landscape scale i e fields and forest combined 2 fields and 3 forest fig 3 shows the cross correlation matrices with the pearson correlation coefficients r values with different colors for all three areas roughness is strongly correlated with slope r 0 69 0 95 and 0 69 for landscape scale fields and forest respectively while slope and roughness are moderately correlated with the standard deviation of lidar returns std r 0 63 for both in fields they are less strongly correlated r 0 39 and 0 34 in forest areas for the fields there is also a strong correlation r 0 65 between saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and organic matter of soils 4 2 spatial patterns of snow depth the uas lidar based snow depths mapped by subtracting snow off dtms from snow on dtms reveal a shallow snow depth ranging from less than 2 cm to over 21 cm in wy2019 mean 9 4 cm standard deviation 9 7 cm and up to 41 cm in wy2020 mean 26 9 cm standard deviation 15 2 cm fig 4 and table 1 the shallower snow depths lower 30 were 6 4 cm and 24 cm and deeper snow depths higher than 70 for each map were 12 cm and 29 cm in wy2019 and wy2020 respectively despite having different magnitudes of snow depth between the two dates there were similar spatial patterns deeper snow depth values blue existed in the fields and shallower snow depths red in forest fig 4 compared to the forest snowpack the field snow depth had relatively high spatial variability and less coherent patterns in the field the deeper snow is in the northeast areas in wy2019 however in wy2020 the deeper snow occurred in the middle and east areas a shallow and spatially consistent snowpack occurred in forest areas in the deciduous forest type the snow depth was consistently higher than that in coniferous forest especially in the east forest see the plant functional type map in fig 2f the shallowest snowpack was found in coniferous forest type likewise spatially coherent patterns of the local gradients of snow depth are readily discernible between the two uas surveys fig 4c and d lower local gradient values red indicating a relatively consistent snow depth existed in the east fields higher gradients blue were found in the field to forest transitions and roads in the forest areas the lower local gradients generally appeared in coniferous forest high local gradients are consistently found at the forest edge 4 3 physical drivers contributing spatial variability of snow depth to determine the most relevant physical drivers that contribute to the spatial heterogeneity of snow depth the relative importance of the input variables from the maxent model with different thresholds was quantified fig 5 shows the relative contribution of the nine input variables from each maxent run using the shallow and deep snow depth values within thresholds larger percentages indicate those variables that play a greater role in predicting the suitability of shallower or deeper snow depth for shallow snow depths top panels fig 5a c plant functional type is the most important variable in the landscape scale especially in the wy2019 snow depths which were shallower than the snow depths from wy2020 for the snow depths in wy2020 soil organic matter and roughness contribute somewhat e g both are 27 for the lowest 3 quantile of snow depth in the fields soil variables organic matter and ksat and slope are generally important the contribution of soil organic matter to the shallow snow depths in wy2020 is very strong ranging up to 70 in the forest it seems that different variables influence the shallow snowpack for the two study snowpacks while ksat and aspect are clearly important to identify shallow snow depth in wy2019 as compared to other variables there are no dominant variables in wy2020 soil organic matter 21 to 37 and roughness 17 to 23 are somewhat important for extremely shallow snow depths less than 3 to 5 quantiles for deep snow depths bottom panels fig 5d f different variables contribute to snow depth for the two study snowpacks while the organic matter is the dominant control in wy2019 landscape scale roughness and std are more important in wy2020 in the fields ksat and organic matter indicate locations of deep snow in wy2019 but roughness is the most important variable in wy2020 in the forest the variable contributions differ by snowpack for the deepest snow depth 95 to 97 quantiles roughness and std is important but the contributions of ksat and organic matter gradually increase when the threshold for deep snow is decreased in summary plant functional type is an important explanatory variable for mixed vegetation areas especially in predicting the shallow snow depth soil variables organic matter and ksat contribute to both shallow and deep snowpacks roughness and std are also important particularly for the snow depth in wy2020 rather than in wy2019 contrary to expectations shadow hours aspect and tci had limited ability to identify the relatively shallow or deep snow depth in the maxent framework predicted suitability maps of shallower or deeper snow depth can be estimated from the maxent models developed for target ranges based on the training points with input variables the maxent model provides suitable locations with likelihood where the range of snow depth likely exists for example fig 6 includes predicted suitability maps for the locations where the snow depth is less than the 5 quantile and greater than the 95 snow depth quantile for the two snowpacks these maps are the combination of the two maps developed by the maxent models for fields and forest respectively in wy2019 fig 6a locations with high predicted suitability dark red for shallow snowpack correspond to locations with shallow snow depth e g west forest south fields and central fields near ponds see fig 4 in wy2020 fig 6b distributions with high suitability also agreed fairly well with the shallow values from the snow depth map e g southwest fields and east forest for the 95 snow depth quantile predicted maps with high suitability values captured areas where deep snow depth exists fig 6c and d e g northeast fields in wy2019 central fields near the small buildings in wy2020 and east forest in both months in an effort to better discern the effect of soil variables such as ksat and organic matter on the reliability of the maxent model auc values are compared for models that include and exclude the two soil variables fig 7 the auc values from the maxent models for the shallowest 3 to 5 and deepest snow depths 95 to 97 quantiles are higher than the moderate snow depths 10 to 30 and 70 to 95 for both shallow and deep snow depths the maxent models with soil variables have higher auc values than the maxent models without soil variables this tendency is more apparent in the field than the forest for fields with shallow snow depth fig 7a auc values with soil variables range from 0 86 to 0 92 for the 3 to 5 snow depth quantiles while the values without soil variables range from 0 76 to 0 83 for fields with a deep snowpack fig 7b there is a more modest influence the auc values with soil variables for the 95 to 97 quantiles range from 0 86 to 0 93 while the values without soil variables are range from 0 79 to 0 87 4 4 localized variability of snow depth the relative contributions of the static variables on the snow depth local gradients were computed in the maxent framework for locations having lower less than 3 to 30 and higher local gradients greater than 7 to 97 fig 8 for this analysis the static variable included the nine input variables previously used as well as the local gradient mapped during the baseline snow off flight variables with larger percentages indicate that the input variables play a greater role in predicting the local gradients and typically improving the maxent s reliability for low local gradients of snow depth implying locally homogeneous snowpack conditions within 10 m top panels plant functional type was the most important variable 32 49 for landscape scale especially in the shallower snow depth map from wy2019 fig 8a roughness and the baseline local gradient were of secondary importance in wy2019 and wy2020 respectively roughness contributed 24 and baseline local gradient contributed 23 for the less than 3 quantile of local gradients in the fields there were clear differences in important variables between the two snowpacks fig 8b while soil variables organic matter and ksat and roughness were important for wy2019 the baseline s local gradient was the strongest contributor for wy2020 in the forest there were no dominant variables except for the baseline s local gradient for wy2019 fig 8c aspect shadow hours std and tci did not play a role in the location of low local gradients for the overall site nor for the field and forest areas for high local gradients of snow depth bottom panels of fig 8 roughness and the baseline local gradient are important for identifying landscape scale transitions for the wy2019 snowpack the contributing percentage of the baseline s local gradient was around 70 for the extremely high local gradients 95 to 97 quantiles the contribution of the baseline local gradient decreased with decreasing thresholds and roughness s contribution increased indicating a transition between the two highly correlated variables fig 8d in fields the baseline local gradient was the dominant control and contributed up to 80 fig 8e organic matter was also somewhat important up to 20 to 34 for the highest local gradient of snow depth higher than 95 quantiles in the forest while there were no dominant variables as compared to fields or landscape scale for wy2019 ksat and baseline s local gradient were important 49 and 36 respectively fig 8f the contribution of roughness gradually increases with decreasing the quantiles particularly from 70 to 85 quantiles in summary plant functional type is valuable for predicting the low local gradients of the snowpack at the landscape scale within a single plant functional type the baseline s local gradient and roughness control the locations of both the low and high local gradients of snow depth soil variables also contribute modestly to identifying spatial variability in the localized snowpack contrary to our expectations shadow hours aspect and tci had marginal contributions for localized snowpack variations at the 10 m scale using the maxent framework in contrast with predicted suitability maps of snow depth the two predicted suitability maps of high local gradients have relatively similar spatial patterns for the two snowpacks except for the west forest fig 9 because the baseline s local gradient and roughness were the dominant controls needed to predict the local gradients of snowpack the spatial distributions of baseline s local gradient and roughness are reflected in the predicted maps compare to the input variable maps in fig 2 5 discussion 5 1 physical drivers comparison with previous findings static features such as topography and vegetation rather than local meteorology and precipitation patterns typically control snow distribution at the local scale there are numerous studies which attempt to characterize spatial snow structures and to identify physical characteristics affecting the spatial characteristics of the snowpack blöschl and kirnbauer 1992 investigated the relationship between spatial snow patterns and terrain attributes e g elevation and slope in the austrian alps they found no dominant relationship to terrain parameters with spatial snow depth lapena and martz 1996 found that spatial structures of snow depth are related to sheltering by topographic obstacles indicating that drifting is a critical process in the prairie environment mott et al 2011 mentioned that the driving force for the drifting processes is the air flow near the surface layer which is partially shaped by the local terrain our results have similar findings in that there were clear differences in snow depth within the fields e g east versus west fields and transitional areas between fields and forest currier and lundquist 2018 also found large differences in snow depth for the forest edge classifications in the western united states soil properties are considered to be a potential feature that can affect spatial variability of snowpack yet few studies have investigated how important soil properties are to inform the spatial structure of snow depth as compared to other terrain characteristics shook et al 1993 investigated area frequency relationships of snow and soil patches at different stages during the melting season in prairie and alpine environments they found that snow and soil patches are fractals and their size distribution is predictable implying that soil properties may potentially influence such behavior redding and devito 2011 showed differences in the timing of snow disappearance between two sites with different soil types they found that mean snowmelt rates at sites with sand soils were quicker than those at sites with loam soils however they could not conduct significance tests due to the limited measurements from the loam soils our findings suggest that soil properties organic matter and hydraulic conductivity can be more important than shadow hours aspect std and for modeling the spatial distribution of snow depth which is probably because soil properties especially soil organic matter impact soil thermal conductivity abu hamdeh and reeder 2000 the thermal conductivity of soil is highly dependent on soil density mineral type grain size and moisture content farouki 1981 penner 1970 parikh et al 1979 in frozen soils the thermal conductivity is more sensitive to soil type than non frozen soils because the thermal conductivity of ice is more than four times larger than that of liquid water penner 1970 recently zhu et al 2019 found that soil organic matter was a dominant factor controlling the variability of thermal diffusivity at 200 field sites in the high latitude regions our results suggest that spatial differences in soil properties may lead to a spatial discrepancy in heat transfer between snowpack and soil surface resulting in an enhanced spatial variability of snow depth even at local scales with large spatial variability of soil temperature e g less than 10 m spatial correlation in fields mohanty et al 1995 and frequent patchy snow in shallow ephemeral snowpacks the differences in the energy transfer between snow and soil surface across areas with different snow depths may lead to a heterogeneous spatial distribution of surface temperatures future research with supporting data representing the energy transfer is needed to address the role of soil properties in the spatial heterogeneity of snowpack 5 2 maxent framework compared to traditional analysis to our knowledge this study is the first to use the maxent model to understand snow distribution measured using a uas based lidar in the natural science community the maxent model is one of the most popular methods for species distribution and ecological modeling elith et al 2006 merow et al 2013 the maxent framework provides accurate information about the degree of importance among the input variables that dominate the overall contribution to develop the maxent model with model reliability for the snow science and hydrology community this approach can create novel opportunities to identify dominant physical variables and to advance snow and land surface models by leveraging remotely sensed snow observations at multiple scales as a traditional method variogram approaches including fractal analysis have been widely used to understand the spatial scaling patterns of snow depth or swe based on the self similarity of properties over multiple scales deems et al 2006 conducted a variogram analysis of snow depth topography and vegetation topography datasets from three 1 km2 study areas using an airborne based lidar system they found the existence of two different scale areas from the vegetation topography and snow depth data separated by a scale break that ranges between 31 and 56 m for vegetation topography and between 15 and 40 m for snow depth trujillo et al 2007 also attempted to determine whether the spatial distribution of snow depth has scale invariance with the interaction with physical features including vegetation topography and winds they found that a scale break of snow depth was controlled by the scaling characteristics of vegetation height when wind redistribution of snow was minimal and canopy interception was dominant using fractal analysis schirmer and lehning 2011 investigated seasonal and spatial changes in the scaling behavior of snow depth they found that the scale break gradually increases throughout the snow accumulation season indicating that roughness of the terrain surface buried by snow may control the scaling behavior even though the variogram type analyses have provided explicit information to characterize the spatial structure of snowpack limited information is available to determine the relative importance among various physical characteristics related to the formation of the spatial structure of snow depth deems et al 2006 speculated that the length of the scale break might be due to the terrain relief and that the physical process change found by the breaks in the variograms of the vegetation topography potentially influences the scaling patterns of snow depth in trujillo et al 2007 s results none of the breaks in the slope of the log log plots between snow depth and the corresponding fields of topography and vegetation topography were present while the break in the scaling behavior was controlled by the vegetation characteristics e g canopy height canopy covered area and distances between trees thus it is expected that the maxent framework with spatially distributed snowpack data supplements the existing approaches by providing various information about dominant predictor variables along with spatially predicted suitability maps in the context of a statistical approach to identify dominant features a brief discussion about differences between the maxent and existing popular methods such as the principal component analysis pca is warranted the pca is a widely used approach for reducing the dimensionality of exploratory data sets to compute the pcs and interpret them from the original data sets particularly this method is useful when the variables within the data set are highly correlated however the pcs are the linear combination of the original variables which may not be as readable and interpretable as the original features because snowpack responses to meteorological and land characteristics tend to be complex and sometimes have nonlinear behaviors anderton 2000 anderton et al 2004 a pca might not be successful in addressing the features also the ordinary pca method is not suitable to handle categorical variables because it is hard to find a suitable way to represent distances between variable categories and individuals in the factorial space maxent offers several advantages regarding these limitations maxent can utilize both continuous and categorical data sets and incorporate interactions between different variables it can also provide individual contributions of correlated explanatory variables on the response variable allowing each variable to be interpreted separately 5 3 uas lidar snow depth sampling uas based lidar has been recently utilized for snow depth mapping harder et al 2020 jacobs et al 2021 providing an opportunity to eliminate many of the drawbacks that arise from airborne laser scanning als and terrestrial laser scanning tls systems deems et al 2013 fey et al 2019 hojatimalekshah et al 2021 prokop 2008 obscuration from clouds found in als systems will rarely be an issue because uas lidar surveys are generally conducted at an altitude below 120 m although spatial coverage is typically greatly reduced in uas missions relative to other als platforms harpold et al 2014 kirchner et al 2014 the aerial perspective and the large sensor swath overlap facilitated by appropriate mission planning and post processing provides reduced uncertainties in elevation from those that can result from high off nadir viewing angles and occlusion in other als platforms in the same vein flight parameters can be readily adjusted to achieve equally dense point clouds over open and forested areas improving ground finding and resulting in better characterization of vegetation and terrain mapping for this study flight speeds were held constant over both fields and forests which produced lower return density over the forested part of our study site there is some evidence that vegetation reduces return density due to scattering and absorption liu et al 2020 jacobs et al 2021 so reduced flight speeds over vegetation to account for the reduction in returns could improve terrain characterization in these settings 5 4 limitations while this study employed a well validated machine learning approach in a novel setting identifying the primary terrain predictors of fine scale distribution of snow depth there are potential limitations to providing generalizable information due to limited experiments and data availability the dominant predictors might depend on the timing of the survey dates e g snow accumulation vs melt periods physical factors controlling the amount of absorbed sunlight such as shadow hours aspect and tci may not be dominant in the early snow season because shortwave fluxes would have a cumulative effect on snow physical properties pomeroy and brun 2001 it is possible that spatial differences in absorbed solar energy have little control over snow depth variability because this analysis was performed early in the winter season and shortly after snowfall to fully address this possibility a similar analysis with a times series which tracks thesnowpack evolution from the start of the accumulation season through the end of the ablation season is needed in addition to high resolution snow depth maps from a uas based lidar albedo maps from a uas based visible and or infrared sensor would be beneficial to improve the maxent analysis by offering an accurate calculation of the absorbed radiative fluxes levy et al 2018 wang et al 2020 due to the limited availability of soil data we used the polaris soil data with relatively courser spatial resolution 30 m assuming that the soil data can represent spatial variability of the soil characteristics within the 830 000 m2 study area they were used as predictor variables in the maxent framework and found as important variables however the courser spatial resolution could limit the confidence in the role of the soil variables in the maxent general evaluation of the polaris data against in situ measurements provides r2 values of 0 42 chaney et al 2019 additional validation against sample measurements in the study area may enhance the reliability of the maxent model also future research including supporting data such as soil and snow temperature and or snowmelt maps is also needed to fully address the role of spatially distributed soil properties in determining the spatial heterogeneity of energy transfer between the soil and the snowpack while the current results correspond to relatively flat terrain with low relief and a shallow snowpack there is a possibility that the maxent framework for different plant functional types climate zones and or snow classes could generate different results because previous studies indicate that snow depth patterns are largely affected by terrain characteristics and snow regimes anderton et al 2004 clark et al 2011 currier and lundquist 2018 thus as more high resolution snow depth data sets in different environments become available it would be valuable to use the maxent framework to better understand the spatial variability of snow depth lastly the inclusion of relevant meteorological variables e g solar radiation and wind speed direction in the maxent is expected to provide a more robust determination of the dominant drivers among both static and dynamic variables application of the maxent framework in a wide range of environments could potentially refine the parameterization of snowpack evolution in land surface models and down scaling of remotely sensed snow products 6 conclusion understanding the spatial variability of snow is valuable for hydrologists and ecologists seeking to predict hydrological processes species distributions land atmosphere interactions however identifying dominant physical drivers controlling the spatial structure of snow depth has been challenged due to the lack of high resolution snowpack and physical variables with high vertical accuracy as well as limitations in traditional approaches to overcome this we first employ the maxent framework with 1 m spatial snow and terrain maps from a uas based lidar system to identify physical variables controlling field scale spatial structures of shallow ephemeral snow depth over open terrain and forests we found that among the nine terrain plant functional type and soil variables plant functional type and roughness had an important contribution in the maxent framework as needed to predict spatial locations having either deeper or shallower snow depth across the landscape soil organic matter and saturated hydraulic conductivity were revealed as important controls on snow depth spatial variations for both fields and forest suggesting spatial variations in the soil variables under the snowpack can control thermal transfer between soil and snowpack along with the near surface atmosphere despite the difference in controls and locations of the relatively shallow and deep snowpacks the transition zones between areas with similar snow depths as identified using local gradients were consistent for both dates and well characterized by the underlying local gradients of baseline flights without snow it is expected that the results provide insight into snow and land surface models by aiding in the parameterization at the sub grid scale and helping to support the down scaling of

4221,due to its potentially important role in the global carbon cycle the dissolved carbon of groundwater systems is severely affected by climate change and oasisization in desert inland river basins however the spatial distribution and driving mechanisms of groundwater dissolved carbon are still poorly understood here we use groundwater data from 72 monitoring wells to reveal the spatial variations in the dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations of the shallow groundwater in the tarim river basin an arid region in northwest china due to the unsaturated characteristics of the groundwater recharge the doc concentration of groundwater increased significantly with greater lateral distance from the downstream river rather than the dic concentration of groundwater there was a significant positive linear correlation between doc and dic redundancy analysis showed that groundwater depth gd and evapotranspiration influenced the doc concentration while the dic concentration was greatly affected by the total salinity of groundwater and farmland likewise both doc and dic concentrations were most affected by ca2 further analysis showed that a decrease in the gd will lead to a decrease in the doc concentration dilution effect but it has no obvious influence on the dic concentration high evapotranspiration in the desert region drives an increase in the doc concentration concentration effect and a decrease in the dic concentration our study highlights that average annual evapotranspiration and gd jointly drive the differences in the doc and dic concentration changes in the shallow groundwater of the tarim river basin keywords climate change dissolved inorganic carbon dissolved organic carbon groundwater depth groundwater major ions hydrological processes 1 introduction as the second largest freshwater reservoir on earth groundwater accounts for 30 of the total global freshwater shiklomanov 2000 moreover groundwater can contain high concentrations of dissolved carbon dc which is a source of carbon dioxide in surface water and the atmosphere nydahl et al 2020 therefore dc in groundwater plays a significant role in carbon cycling biogeochemical reactions and ecological functioning schiff et al 1990 li et al 2017 ploum et al 2020 mcdonough et al 2020 dc is easily taken up and processed by microorganisms and hydrophyte due to its water soluble characteristics liu et al 2021 olefeldt et al 2013 and is mainly composed of dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic doc constitutes an important part of the global carbon cycle because this fraction is mobile and biologically active smith et al 2014 dic has also been identified as a major dissolved carbon component in arctic and tibetan plateau permafrost song et al 2019 throckmorton et al 2015 tank et al 2012 song et al 2020 and inland river basins in arid regions li et al 2015 li et al 2017 unlike the biochemical processes of doc the nonbiological accumulation of groundwater dic plays a central role in the regional and global carbon cycles in arid and semi arid areas li et al 2017 studies have shown that the global rate of c lost from inland water systems is 2 1 pg c yr 1 raymond et al 2013 and the global doc and dic transport flux rates from inland water to coastal water systems are 0 45 and 0 40 pg c yr 1 respectively bauer et al 2013 therefore the aquifer carbon pool plays an important role in the global carbon cycle and the carbon sequestration potential from the groundwater of inland river basins is highly significant to carbon sequestration studies based on terrestrial ecosystems cloern et al 2014 hydrology is one of the main drivers of doc and dic dynamics in groundwater ecosystems ejarque et al 2017 voss et al 2015 wen et al 2020 in particular for desert river basins that depend on runoff infiltration to recharge groundwater li et al 2015 hydrologic connectivity between rivers and subterranean aquifers is likely of great importance to dc cycles in shallow groundwater ecosystems for example zarnetske et al 2018 found that 80 of watersheds expressed doc transport limitation demonstrating that the hydrologic transport of doc through the landscape to the stream network is a strong and consistent driver of lateral carbon flux across diverse environmental conditions therefore understanding the spatial distribution of groundwater dc and its hydrologic drivers is important for the better quantification of the role of groundwater dc in the terrestrial carbon budget battin et al 2009 li et al 2015 for example in arid and semiarid regions periodic groundwater recharge and high evapotranspiration have a profound effect on the depth of groundwater and thus regulate the change in the dc concentration in groundwater bernal et al 2018 li et al 2015 in addition the dc dynamics are mostly driven by biological processes in the rainy season whereas they are mainly regulated by the change in groundwater depth gd in the form of bicarbonate in the dry season salimon et al 2013 in tropical catchments studies have identified allochthonous carbon transport to aquatic environments due to rainfall seasonality sanchez murillo et al 2019 osburn et al 2018 dc transport from catchments has attracted great attention over the last two decades due to global concern about the potential influence on the global carbon cycle and climate change mcdonough et al 2020 raymond et al 2013 shumilova et al 2019 this study assesses how the spatial distribution of groundwater dc concentration in a desert inland river basin a relatively closed system is affected by hydrological processes and climate change the below ground environment forms the largest source of freshwater and the organic carbon within these systems plays an important role in the global carbon budget latest research has shown that the global median concentration of doc in groundwater 1 2 mg c l 1 was low compared with surface waters which was controlled by the groundwater age and depth mcdonough et al 2020 meredith et al 2020 recent research has also provided evidence of doc attenuation due to the combined effects of biodegradation and sorption chapelle et al 2016 while some studies have found decreases or no change in the doc concentration skjelkvale et al 2005 worrall et al 2018 other regions have experienced long term increases in doc potentially due to recovery from acid rain or climate induced changes in temperature and hydrological flow evans et al 2012 laudon et al 2012 monteith et al 2007 as climate varies changes in the quantity and location of natural groundwater recharge lead to changes in water table elevation and groundwater discharge and control the exchange of carbon cycling taylor et al 2013 cuthbert et al 2019 for example oni et al 2014 suggests that climate is an important driver of doc dynamics in boreal catchments characterized by networks of streams within forest wetland landscape mosaics in addition the spatial pattern of groundwater chemistry has been studied as an integrated signal of doc variation in a phreatic aquifer hayashi 2004 kiewiet et al 2019 peralta tapia et al 2015 intrusion of river water into the hyporheic corridor stimulates microbial heterotrophic respiration sobczak and findlay 2002 stegen et al 2018 stegen et al 2016 a large part of the doc that was mobilized at a high water table was mineralized to dic during the following months within the groundwater itself deirmendjian et al 2018 causing doc to decrease and dic to increase stegen et al 2018 under natural conditions the dic in river water is dominantly derived from carbonate or silicate dissolution by carbonic acid guo et al 2015 murphy et al 2016 thereby this dic is transported by rivers or groundwater and is thereafter precipitated in the ocean as carbonate minerals jiang 2013 li et al 2008 for example li et al 2015 discovered that dic is washed down into large saline aquifers underneath vast deserts forming a large carbon pool therefore we focus on the relationship between groundwater dc and gd groundwater major ions surface vegetation and other variables to clarify the key factors that influence the concentration of groundwater dc in desert inland river basins arid and semi arid ecosystems are increasingly recognized as important carbon storage sites li et al 2015 in these regions extensive sequestration of dc can occur in the terminal lakes of endorheic basins that do not drain to external bodies of water however the spatial distribution and regulatory mechanism of this dc within groundwater is uncertain our study area the tarim river trunk is located in endorheic basins with arid climates and therefore has a relatively isolated and integrated carbon cycle which makes the region ideal for arid land carbon research as there is no outlet or hydrological connection to the ocean from the tarim endorheic basins the terminal area functions as the ocean for the endorheic basins and concentrates the sedimentary material of the whole basin li et al 2015 therefore knowledge of the dc spatial patterns and cycles in endorheic basins forms the basis of a deeper understanding of the global carbon budgets and their role in the global carbon cycle li et al 2017 here we propose a conceptual model of dc spatial variation driven by hydrology and climate for desert inland river basins see the graphical abstract 1 upstream large runoff and sufficient groundwater replenishment lead to a shallow gd about 2 m accompanied by overflow and backflow groundwater flows frequently in the horizontal direction which may lead to fluctuations in the groundwater dc concentration 2 downstream the flow that has not been interrupted since 2000 by the daxihaizi reservoir was carried out on the downstream ecological water conveyance to ensure restoration of the downstream desert vegetation the lack of groundwater recharge causes the water table to decrease significantly in the lateral direction up to 7 m due to the drop in the depth of groundwater flow in one direction the speed of water flow is slow and may be the cause of the increase in the groundwater dc concentration along the lateral distance we therefore analyzed the spatial patterns and driving mechanisms of the doc and dic concentrations using doc and dic concentration data gd and groundwater major ions from 72 groundwater monitoring wells distributed in the tarim river main stream and vegetation net primary productivity and climate data i e annual mean evapotranspiration me based on this we posed the following scientific questions 1 how do hydrological processes and climatic conditions regulate the spatial variations of doc and dic concentrations in groundwater 2 what is the relationship between the groundwater doc and dic concentration and environmental factors e g major ions 3 is there any difference in the spatial distribution of doc and dic concentrations in the upstream and downstream groundwater 2 study area the tarim river basin 34 20 43 39 n 71 39 93 45 e is located in southern xinjiang china and adjoins the taklamakan desert fig 1 with a total length of 1321 km and area of 1 02 million km2 although the tarim river does not produce its own runoff the average annual runoff is 3 98 1010 m3 and originates mainly from the aksu hotan yarkant and kaidu kongqi rivers via precipitation and meltwater from ice and snow in the alpine regions xu et al 2011 therefore the groundwater dc in the tarim river basin mainly comes from the upstream tributaries and is added to the groundwater through infiltration and lateral movement of the river channel the tarim river basin has a typical continental arid climate with an annual temperature range of 10 6 11 5 c annual rainfall levels of 17 4 42 0 mm and annual evaporation ranging between 2500 and 3000 mm ling et al 2016 the dominant species in the natural vegetation community are populus euphratica and tamarix chinensis the water required for plant growth mainly comes from the water supply in aquifers and the soil the lateral soil distribution along the river has clear banding regularity with successions of meadow soil solonchak and aeolian sandy soil land use types in the study area consist mainly of cropland forest grassland and unused land cropland and forest are generally distributed at areas near the river where water is relatively easy to access areas with scarce water are either grassland or unused land groundwater monitoring wells are placed at areas where the distribution of vegetation is representative and the wells are arranged perpendicular to the river channel at specific intervals figure s1 3 materials and methods 3 1 field monitoring sampling and laboratory analysis the monitoring wells distributed in the upstream and downstream of tarim river were established in 2011 and 2009 with six and five transects respectively fig 1 each transect has six monitoring wells and the lateral distance from the stream bank to each well is 50 150 300 500 750 and 1050 m respectively totaling 72 monitoring wells fig 1 for each transect a multi parameter groundwater data automatic collection and transmission system chengdu wanjiang gangli technology co ltd chengdu china was set up to monitor gd electrical conductivity water temperature soil moisture and soil temperature in addition five single parameter groundwater data automatic collection and transmission systems chengdu wanjiang gangli technology co ltd were set up to monitor gd the monitoring frequency was set to upload data every four hours a peristaltic pump was used for the collection of groundwater samples in late april 2019 samples were collected following standard protocols blanchette et al 2010 major ions dic and doc were filtered at 0 45 μm in addition dic and doc samples were preserved using 20 μl of a concentrated hgcl2 solution samples for major ion analysis were stored in polyethylene vials while dic and doc samples were stored in amber glass vials vials free of preservative agents were rinsed three times with the sampled water before sample collection vials containing a preservative agent were filled to the brim without overflowing all vials were carefully closed and secured using parafilm and stored at 4 c until analyzed the measurement of doc dic and the main ions in the groundwater was completed at the analysis and testing center of the xinjiang institute of ecology and geography chinese academy of sciences urumqi china ion chromatography thermofisher ics 5000 a potentiometric titrator metler g20 plasma emission spectroscopy agilent 735 and a total carbon analyzer oi analytical 1030 were used to analyze and measure these groundwater indicators 3 2 data acquisition and analysis the remote sensing data used in this study include net primary productivity npp of in situ vegetation and farmland and evapotranspiration et et was extracted from the global land surface satellite glass et product which was released by the national earth system science data center national science technology

relates npp directly to the vegetation characteristics and environmental variables or indicators and uses raster surfaces of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi temperature precipitation and solar radiation as the original input data zhang et al 2016 the raster ndvi used in the casa model were extracted from the modis mod13q1 product released by the nasa eos data center https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov which has a pixel size of about 250 m the raster surfaces of temperature and precipitation were interpolated with dem as an independent covariate using observation data from 68 weather stations in xinjiang the raster surfaces of solar radiation were interpolated with data from 120 solar radiation monitoring stations across mainland china the groundwater carbon dynamics in desert inland river basins mainly originate from river recharge we therefore mainly analyzed the relationship between doc and dic concentrations and hydrological climatic and environmental factors based on groundwater data from 72 monitoring wells and remote sensing data extraction using rda we found that the main positive effect on the doc concentration of groundwater came from rr rr ln me ln gd represents the combined effect of evapotranspiration and groundwater depth while the negative effect came from gd we used one way analysis of variance anova and tukey s hsd post hoc tests to compare the differences in doc dic and gd between the upstream and downstream and the lateral distance from the river furthermore redundancy analysis rda was performed to explore the relationships between doc dic and the major ions and environmental variables the relationships between doc dic the major ions environmental variables and the basin characteristics were explored with linear regression analysis the statistical analyses and the plotting of the figures were carried out using the statistical package spss pasw statistics 25 0 ibm corporation armonk ny usa canoco 5 0 microcomputer power ithaca usa and sigmaplot 12 5 systat software inc san jose ca usa 4 results 4 1 spatial pattern of main environmental factors we measured an upstream gd between 1 83 and 2 84 m and a downstream gd between 3 43 and 4 90 m fig 2 a for the upstream and downstream the gd increased as the lateral distance increased within the range of 50 1050 m from the river however the difference of gd was not significant at different distances p 0 05 apart from the gd of the monitoring well at 500 m which was significantly higher than that at 50 m in the upstream fig 2 a at the same lateral distance the gd in the downstream was significantly higher than that in the upstream p 0 05 fig 2 a furthermore with the increase of lateral distance the gd in the downstream increased linearly p 0 01 fig 2 a however the difference in gd was not significant at different distances p 0 05 in addition npp n npp a and me in the upstream of tarim river basin were significantly higher than those in the downstream p 0 01 fig 3 the mean values of npp n of native vegetation and npp a of farmland in the upstream were 9 18 gg c and 6 45 gg c respectively while the mean values of npp n and npp a in the downstream were only 0 65 gg c and 0 gg c similarly compared with the downstream the upstream had a higher annual mean evapotranspiration me of 100 45 mm in the same distance from the river rr it considers the gd and me comprehensively had a significant difference between the upstream and downstream p 0 05 fig 4 b except that the difference at 1050 m away from the river was not significant there was no significant difference in total salt content of groundwater wts and ph value at the same distance from the river in the upstream and downstream p 0 05 fig 4 a and b except for the significant difference at 500 m away from the river p 0 05 the comparison between upstream and downstream showed that the significant difference of groundwater cl and na occurred at 500 m away from the river while the significant difference of groundwater k occurred at 750 m away from the river p 0 05 fig 4 d i and g the other groundwater ions in the upstream and downstream at the same distance from the river had no significant difference p 0 05 fig 4 d e f g h and i the ph value of groundwater at 50 m away from the river in the upstream was significantly higher than that at 500 m away from the river in the upstream p 0 05 fig 4 c the difference was that the k of groundwater at 750 m away from the river in the downstream was significantly lower than that at 1050 m away from the river in the downstream p 0 05 fig 4 g in addition there was no significant difference in groundwater wts ph cl so4 2 ca2 k mg2 na of 6 underground monitoring wells at different distances from the river in the upstream and downstream p 0 05 4 2 spatial variation of doc and dic concentration with the increase in the lateral distance from the river the concentration of doc in the downstream groundwater showed a significant linear increase p 0 01 fig 2 b from 10 24 mg c l 1 to 20 96 mg c l 1 likewise the doc concentrations at 750 m and 1050 m lateral distance were significantly higher compared with that at 50 m lateral distance twice as high respectively p 0 05 fig 2 b conversely there was no significant change in the doc concentration in the upstream groundwater as the lateral distance increased from the river p 0 05 fig 2 b the concentration of doc varied from 6 55 mg c l 1 to 9 07 mg c l 1 at the same lateral distances from the river the doc concentrations in the downstream were significantly higher than those in the upstream p 0 05 fig 2 b except for the doc concentration between the downstream and upstream at 300 m lateral distance from the river based on the linear fitting of the groundwater doc concentration with the same lateral distance of 12 river sections we found that these slopes showed a clear trend an exponential increase to the maximum value owing to the increase in the transverse distance fig 5 figure s2 however we found no linear trend in the dic concentration in the groundwater from the upstream to the downstream with the same lateral distance of the 12 river sections figure s3 in contrast there were no significant differences in the groundwater dic concentrations between the downstream and upstream dic concentrations at the same lateral distances from the river p 0 05 fig 2 c the dic concentrations of the downstream and upstream ranged from 37 41 mg c l 1 to 85 85 mg c l 1 and from 39 46 mg c l 1 to 90 78 mg c l 1 respectively however the groundwater dic concentrations at 50 m lateral distance from the river were significantly lower than those in the upstream except for that at 150 m lateral distance from the river p 0 05 fig 2 c the dic concentrations in the downstream at 750 m and 1050 m lateral distance from the river were significantly higher than that at 50 m distance more than twice as high respectively p 0 05 fig 2 c furthermore significant linear positive correlations were found between the groundwater doc and dic concentrations in the upstream and downstream respectively p 0 01 fig 6 4 3 relationship between dc concentration and main environmental factors the main positive effects on the dic concentration of groundwater were caused by the total salt content of groundwater wts and npp a and negative effects were produced by groundwater ph fig 7 a the major ions in groundwater had a positive effect on the doc and dic concentrations with ca2 producing the greatest effect fig 7 b based on the above rda results we focused on the correlation between the doc and dic concentrations in groundwater and wts ca2 gd and rr our results show significant linear positive correlations between the doc and dic concentrations and wts and ca2 in groundwater p 0 05 fig 8 similarly there were significant linear positive correlations between doc and gd and rr p 0 01 fig 9 a b this further indicates that the fluctuation of groundwater level combined with high annual mean evapotranspiration will affect the change of doc concentration of groundwater more obviously we also found a significant linear correlation between dic and rr p 0 05 but not with gd fig 9 c d 5 discussion 5 1 variation of doc concentration in groundwater under hydrologic and climate driven recent research has suggested that global groundwater doc concentrations vary spatially and are usually lower than the surface water concentrations mcdonough et al 2020 for example a study from a karst aquifer found that the groundwater doc concentrations were always lower than surface water except for individual sample points jin et al 2014 however we found that the average groundwater doc concentration in the desert inland river basin was significantly higher than the surface water concentration similarly the groundwater doc concentration in the upstream and downstream was six and 14 times higher than the global median concentration 1 2 mg c l 1 mcdonough et al 2020 respectively in addition our results were similar to the doc concentration in a shallow coastal aquifer meredith et al 2020 but markedly higher than that in a small permafrost watershed cochand et al 2020 the infiltration of upstream surface runoff saturated the groundwater recharge laterally along the river resulting in no difference in gd and even the mixing of groundwater bodies which contributed to the insignificant difference in the groundwater doc concentration penna et al 2016 and stegen et al 2018 also obtained similar results in riverine ecosystems we found that groundwater recharge could result in a reduced doc concentration due to the source limitation of the doc in the upstream which could indicate a dilution effect basu et al 2011 for example zarnetske et al 2018 found that hydrologic flow and not doc sources determined the doc flux behavior in 80 of watersheds from southwestern deserts to northeastern forests in the conterminous united states mcdonough et al 2020 also found that significantly lower doc concentrations resulted from higher groundwater recharge rates 300 mm year 1 these results support our conceptual model of changes in doc concentrations in upstream groundwater see the graphical abstract the downstream surface water originates mainly from the ecological conveyance water discharged from the daxihaizi reservoir to recharge the groundwater in the riverbank the lateral groundwater recharge along the river is gradually reduced and insufficient in addition to the high evapotranspiration causing an increase in the gd meanwhile the low dissolved oxygen content of groundwater slows the rate of doc decomposition resulting in lasting preservation bertrand and lallierverges 1993 schmidt et al 2011 meredith et al 2020 similarly drying can produce a high doc concentration in an intermittent stream and an increase in the humic like fluorescence signal granados et al 2020 therefore the groundwater doc concentration increases in a desert inland river basin ledesma et al 2015 although our research results are consistent with those of graham et al 2015 they assumed that the physical shear stress on aquifer materials caused by intense abstraction significantly increased the temporary release of doc from the sloughing of biofilms and the release of otherwise bound colloidal and sedimentary organic carbon these results confirm our conceptual model of changes in doc concentrations in downstream groundwater see the graphical abstract another factor contributing to the increase in groundwater doc concentrations of the downstream comes from natural vegetation and cropland cultivation mainly cotton an irrigation return flow in the upstream of the tarim river granados and butturini 2019 according to fig 3 the upstream npp n npp a and me were higher than downstream those and it indicated that the high concentration of doc in the downstream came more from the infiltration of surface vegetation in the upstream through the river in addition the results of pesantez et al 2018 support our conclusion reporting that changes in land cover and land use are the most important predictors of doc concentrations in the high elevation ecosystems of ecuador with minimal influence from precipitation conditions furthermore as oasis agriculture developed in this region li et al 2015 showed that the irrigation of saline land increased the salinity alkalinity of the recharge water delivering more dic into aquifers as a result crop planting and riparian vegetation restoration have enhanced the carbon sink in the desert inland river basin 5 2 influence of main environmental factors on dc concentration in groundwater we also observed a significant positive correlation between doc and ca2 concentration underwater which was caused by the mineralization of doc that consumed do produced co2 and subsequently decreased the ph resulting in calcite dissolution and ca2 production mcdonough et al 2020 therefore a high doc concentration will maintain a high ca2 content in groundwater but the consumption of do produces an anoxic environment which leads to the biodegradation rate of doc harvey et al 2002 however in this study we did not find a clear linear relationship between the doc concentration and the ph value after all desert soil and groundwater are highly alkaline which interferes with the negative correlation between doc and ph underwater mcdonough et al 2020 under the joint influence of groundwater recharge and high evapotranspiration the complex physical and chemical reaction of groundwater also led to a significant positive linear correlation between doc and total salinity granados et al 2020 in contrast to the column experiment tiemeyer et al 2017 found that field concentrations of doc were much higher and were not related to ph but increased with higher electrical conductivity the dic in the groundwater of the tarim river basin comes mainly from river input from the mountains and the seepage of farmland irrigation in the oasis areas rather than annual precipitation in the basin 30 50 mm li et al 2015 along the tarim river basin the dic concentration in groundwater was similar to that in the karst aquifer 42 50 51 2 mg l 1 jin et al 2014 although the variability of the dic concentration in our desert areas was larger 143 however our results were nearly 30 times higher than those of cochand et al 2020 for a small permafrost watershed near umiujaq in canada studies from a groundwater aquifer in finland showed that the dic concentrations were lower than our results which are within the range of 2 4 21 6 mg l 1 jylhä ollila et al 2021 kortelainen and karhu 2006 some studies have shown that doc decomposition in groundwater releases co2 which is involved in the decomposition of silicates e g idealized equation 1 and carbonates e g equation 2 and then produces dic ca2 and mg2 eckard et al 2017 jin et al 2014 li et al 2015 mcdonough et al 2020 this explains why doc and dic have a significant positive linear correlation and why ca2 mg2 doc and dic in groundwater also have a significant positive linear correlation respectively by analyzing the δ13c value of dic it was also shown that the increase in the dic concentration was caused by the weathering of carbonates in deep groundwater as a closed system cochand et al 2020 the two idealized equations given by eckard et al 2017 are as follows 1 casio3 2co2 h2o ca2 2hco3 sio2 2 camg co3 2 2co2 2h2o ca2 mg2 4hco3 overall our findings demonstrate that the hydrological and climatic interaction drives the spatial variation of groundwater dc concentration in desert inland river basins we further reveal that ca2 in groundwater is a key environmental factor affecting the concentration of dc our findings confirm that the hydrology in desert inland river basins plays an important role in driving the carbon cycle furthermore we suggest that groundwater carbon cycle processes in the modern global carbon cycle may have been greatly underestimated and further study of these processes is highly warranted however changes in the doc and dic concentrations can also result from the mixing of multiple sources mineral dissolution precipitation and other abiotic reactions jin et al 2014 because of the number of processes that may change dc concentrations we will use carbon stable isotope tracer technology to quantify the source of the groundwater dc in future work 6 conclusion we confirm that groundwater recharge leads to the decrease of the gd in desert inland river basins resulting in a decrease in the doc concentration rather than the dic concentration furthermore high evapotranspiration significantly affects groundwater doc and dic concentrations indicating that the groundwater dc in the desert is relatively stable in addition there are differences between the upstream and downstream hydrological processes which lead to inconsistencies in the spatial variation of the groundwater dc concentration our study suggests that large runoff from the upstream as well as vegetation restoration and agricultural development may increase dc concentrations in groundwater suggesting that closed groundwater systems in desert inland river basins may be a stable carbon sink data availability the

4221,due to its potentially important role in the global carbon cycle the dissolved carbon of groundwater systems is severely affected by climate change and oasisization in desert inland river basins however the spatial distribution and driving mechanisms of groundwater dissolved carbon are still poorly understood here we use groundwater data from 72 monitoring wells to reveal the spatial variations in the dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations of the shallow groundwater in the tarim river basin an arid region in northwest china due to the unsaturated characteristics of the groundwater recharge the doc concentration of groundwater increased significantly with greater lateral distance from the downstream river rather than the dic concentration of groundwater there was a significant positive linear correlation between doc and dic redundancy analysis showed that groundwater depth gd and evapotranspiration influenced the doc concentration while the dic concentration was greatly affected by the total salinity of groundwater and farmland likewise both doc and dic concentrations were most affected by ca2 further analysis showed that a decrease in the gd will lead to a decrease in the doc concentration dilution effect but it has no obvious influence on the dic concentration high evapotranspiration in the desert region drives an increase in the doc concentration concentration effect and a decrease in the dic concentration our study highlights that average annual evapotranspiration and gd jointly drive the differences in the doc and dic concentration changes in the shallow groundwater of the tarim river basin keywords climate change dissolved inorganic carbon dissolved organic carbon groundwater depth groundwater major ions hydrological processes 1 introduction as the second largest freshwater reservoir on earth groundwater accounts for 30 of the total global freshwater shiklomanov 2000 moreover groundwater can contain high concentrations of dissolved carbon dc which is a source of carbon dioxide in surface water and the atmosphere nydahl et al 2020 therefore dc in groundwater plays a significant role in carbon cycling biogeochemical reactions and ecological functioning schiff et al 1990 li et al 2017 ploum et al 2020 mcdonough et al 2020 dc is easily taken up and processed by microorganisms and hydrophyte due to its water soluble characteristics liu et al 2021 olefeldt et al 2013 and is mainly composed of dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic doc constitutes an important part of the global carbon cycle because this fraction is mobile and biologically active smith et al 2014 dic has also been identified as a major dissolved carbon component in arctic and tibetan plateau permafrost song et al 2019 throckmorton et al 2015 tank et al 2012 song et al 2020 and inland river basins in arid regions li et al 2015 li et al 2017 unlike the biochemical processes of doc the nonbiological accumulation of groundwater dic plays a central role in the regional and global carbon cycles in arid and semi arid areas li et al 2017 studies have shown that the global rate of c lost from inland water systems is 2 1 pg c yr 1 raymond et al 2013 and the global doc and dic transport flux rates from inland water to coastal water systems are 0 45 and 0 40 pg c yr 1 respectively bauer et al 2013 therefore the aquifer carbon pool plays an important role in the global carbon cycle and the carbon sequestration potential from the groundwater of inland river basins is highly significant to carbon sequestration studies based on terrestrial ecosystems cloern et al 2014 hydrology is one of the main drivers of doc and dic dynamics in groundwater ecosystems ejarque et al 2017 voss et al 2015 wen et al 2020 in particular for desert river basins that depend on runoff infiltration to recharge groundwater li et al 2015 hydrologic connectivity between rivers and subterranean aquifers is likely of great importance to dc cycles in shallow groundwater ecosystems for example zarnetske et al 2018 found that 80 of watersheds expressed doc transport limitation demonstrating that the hydrologic transport of doc through the landscape to the stream network is a strong and consistent driver of lateral carbon flux across diverse environmental conditions therefore understanding the spatial distribution of groundwater dc and its hydrologic drivers is important for the better quantification of the role of groundwater dc in the terrestrial carbon budget battin et al 2009 li et al 2015 for example in arid and semiarid regions periodic groundwater recharge and high evapotranspiration have a profound effect on the depth of groundwater and thus regulate the change in the dc concentration in groundwater bernal et al 2018 li et al 2015 in addition the dc dynamics are mostly driven by biological processes in the rainy season whereas they are mainly regulated by the change in groundwater depth gd in the form of bicarbonate in the dry season salimon et al 2013 in tropical catchments studies have identified allochthonous carbon transport to aquatic environments due to rainfall seasonality sanchez murillo et al 2019 osburn et al 2018 dc transport from catchments has attracted great attention over the last two decades due to global concern about the potential influence on the global carbon cycle and climate change mcdonough et al 2020 raymond et al 2013 shumilova et al 2019 this study assesses how the spatial distribution of groundwater dc concentration in a desert inland river basin a relatively closed system is affected by hydrological processes and climate change the below ground environment forms the largest source of freshwater and the organic carbon within these systems plays an important role in the global carbon budget latest research has shown that the global median concentration of doc in groundwater 1 2 mg c l 1 was low compared with surface waters which was controlled by the groundwater age and depth mcdonough et al 2020 meredith et al 2020 recent research has also provided evidence of doc attenuation due to the combined effects of biodegradation and sorption chapelle et al 2016 while some studies have found decreases or no change in the doc concentration skjelkvale et al 2005 worrall et al 2018 other regions have experienced long term increases in doc potentially due to recovery from acid rain or climate induced changes in temperature and hydrological flow evans et al 2012 laudon et al 2012 monteith et al 2007 as climate varies changes in the quantity and location of natural groundwater recharge lead to changes in water table elevation and groundwater discharge and control the exchange of carbon cycling taylor et al 2013 cuthbert et al 2019 for example oni et al 2014 suggests that climate is an important driver of doc dynamics in boreal catchments characterized by networks of streams within forest wetland landscape mosaics in addition the spatial pattern of groundwater chemistry has been studied as an integrated signal of doc variation in a phreatic aquifer hayashi 2004 kiewiet et al 2019 peralta tapia et al 2015 intrusion of river water into the hyporheic corridor stimulates microbial heterotrophic respiration sobczak and findlay 2002 stegen et al 2018 stegen et al 2016 a large part of the doc that was mobilized at a high water table was mineralized to dic during the following months within the groundwater itself deirmendjian et al 2018 causing doc to decrease and dic to increase stegen et al 2018 under natural conditions the dic in river water is dominantly derived from carbonate or silicate dissolution by carbonic acid guo et al 2015 murphy et al 2016 thereby this dic is transported by rivers or groundwater and is thereafter precipitated in the ocean as carbonate minerals jiang 2013 li et al 2008 for example li et al 2015 discovered that dic is washed down into large saline aquifers underneath vast deserts forming a large carbon pool therefore we focus on the relationship between groundwater dc and gd groundwater major ions surface vegetation and other variables to clarify the key factors that influence the concentration of groundwater dc in desert inland river basins arid and semi arid ecosystems are increasingly recognized as important carbon storage sites li et al 2015 in these regions extensive sequestration of dc can occur in the terminal lakes of endorheic basins that do not drain to external bodies of water however the spatial distribution and regulatory mechanism of this dc within groundwater is uncertain our study area the tarim river trunk is located in endorheic basins with arid climates and therefore has a relatively isolated and integrated carbon cycle which makes the region ideal for arid land carbon research as there is no outlet or hydrological connection to the ocean from the tarim endorheic basins the terminal area functions as the ocean for the endorheic basins and concentrates the sedimentary material of the whole basin li et al 2015 therefore knowledge of the dc spatial patterns and cycles in endorheic basins forms the basis of a deeper understanding of the global carbon budgets and their role in the global carbon cycle li et al 2017 here we propose a conceptual model of dc spatial variation driven by hydrology and climate for desert inland river basins see the graphical abstract 1 upstream large runoff and sufficient groundwater replenishment lead to a shallow gd about 2 m accompanied by overflow and backflow groundwater flows frequently in the horizontal direction which may lead to fluctuations in the groundwater dc concentration 2 downstream the flow that has not been interrupted since 2000 by the daxihaizi reservoir was carried out on the downstream ecological water conveyance to ensure restoration of the downstream desert vegetation the lack of groundwater recharge causes the water table to decrease significantly in the lateral direction up to 7 m due to the drop in the depth of groundwater flow in one direction the speed of water flow is slow and may be the cause of the increase in the groundwater dc concentration along the lateral distance we therefore analyzed the spatial patterns and driving mechanisms of the doc and dic concentrations using doc and dic concentration data gd and groundwater major ions from 72 groundwater monitoring wells distributed in the tarim river main stream and vegetation net primary productivity and climate data i e annual mean evapotranspiration me based on this we posed the following scientific questions 1 how do hydrological processes and climatic conditions regulate the spatial variations of doc and dic concentrations in groundwater 2 what is the relationship between the groundwater doc and dic concentration and environmental factors e g major ions 3 is there any difference in the spatial distribution of doc and dic concentrations in the upstream and downstream groundwater 2 study area the tarim river basin 34 20 43 39 n 71 39 93 45 e is located in southern xinjiang china and adjoins the taklamakan desert fig 1 with a total length of 1321 km and area of 1 02 million km2 although the tarim river does not produce its own runoff the average annual runoff is 3 98 1010 m3 and originates mainly from the aksu hotan yarkant and kaidu kongqi rivers via precipitation and meltwater from ice and snow in the alpine regions xu et al 2011 therefore the groundwater dc in the tarim river basin mainly comes from the upstream tributaries and is added to the groundwater through infiltration and lateral movement of the river channel the tarim river basin has a typical continental arid climate with an annual temperature range of 10 6 11 5 c annual rainfall levels of 17 4 42 0 mm and annual evaporation ranging between 2500 and 3000 mm ling et al 2016 the dominant species in the natural vegetation community are populus euphratica and tamarix chinensis the water required for plant growth mainly comes from the water supply in aquifers and the soil the lateral soil distribution along the river has clear banding regularity with successions of meadow soil solonchak and aeolian sandy soil land use types in the study area consist mainly of cropland forest grassland and unused land cropland and forest are generally distributed at areas near the river where water is relatively easy to access areas with scarce water are either grassland or unused land groundwater monitoring wells are placed at areas where the distribution of vegetation is representative and the wells are arranged perpendicular to the river channel at specific intervals figure s1 3 materials and methods 3 1 field monitoring sampling and laboratory analysis the monitoring wells distributed in the upstream and downstream of tarim river were established in 2011 and 2009 with six and five transects respectively fig 1 each transect has six monitoring wells and the lateral distance from the stream bank to each well is 50 150 300 500 750 and 1050 m respectively totaling 72 monitoring wells fig 1 for each transect a multi parameter groundwater data automatic collection and transmission system chengdu wanjiang gangli technology co ltd chengdu china was set up to monitor gd electrical conductivity water temperature soil moisture and soil temperature in addition five single parameter groundwater data automatic collection and transmission systems chengdu wanjiang gangli technology co ltd were set up to monitor gd the monitoring frequency was set to upload data every four hours a peristaltic pump was used for the collection of groundwater samples in late april 2019 samples were collected following standard protocols blanchette et al 2010 major ions dic and doc were filtered at 0 45 μm in addition dic and doc samples were preserved using 20 μl of a concentrated hgcl2 solution samples for major ion analysis were stored in polyethylene vials while dic and doc samples were stored in amber glass vials vials free of preservative agents were rinsed three times with the sampled water before sample collection vials containing a preservative agent were filled to the brim without overflowing all vials were carefully closed and secured using parafilm and stored at 4 c until analyzed the measurement of doc dic and the main ions in the groundwater was completed at the analysis and testing center of the xinjiang institute of ecology and geography chinese academy of sciences urumqi china ion chromatography thermofisher ics 5000 a potentiometric titrator metler g20 plasma emission spectroscopy agilent 735 and a total carbon analyzer oi analytical 1030 were used to analyze and measure these groundwater indicators 3 2 data acquisition and analysis the remote sensing data used in this study include net primary productivity npp of in situ vegetation and farmland and evapotranspiration et et was extracted from the global land surface satellite glass et product which was released by the national earth system science data center national science technology infrastructure of china http www geodata cn this glass et is a yearly product synthesized using data obtained by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis https modis gsfc nasa gov and observation data from 240 flux stations across the globe the glass et product covers the years 2000 2018 with a resolution of 1 km we averaged the data over the past five years 2014 2018 to represent the recent et of the study area the npp of the past five years 2014 2018 was synthesized using the light use efficiency model of carnegie ames stanford approach casa crabtree et al 2009 the casa model

solar radiation as the original input data zhang et al 2016 the raster ndvi used in the casa model were extracted from the modis mod13q1 product released by the nasa eos data center https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov which has a pixel size of about 250 m the raster surfaces of temperature and precipitation were interpolated with dem as an independent covariate using observation data from 68 weather stations in xinjiang the raster surfaces of solar radiation were interpolated with data from 120 solar radiation monitoring stations across mainland china the groundwater carbon dynamics in desert inland river basins mainly originate from river recharge we therefore mainly analyzed the relationship between doc and dic concentrations and hydrological climatic and environmental factors based on groundwater data from 72 monitoring wells and remote sensing data extraction using rda we found that the main positive effect on the doc concentration of groundwater came from rr rr ln me ln gd represents the combined effect of evapotranspiration and groundwater depth while the negative effect came from gd we used one way analysis of variance anova and tukey s hsd post hoc tests to compare the differences in doc dic and gd between the upstream and downstream and the lateral distance from the river furthermore redundancy analysis rda was performed to explore the relationships between doc dic and the major ions and environmental variables the relationships between doc dic the major ions environmental variables and the basin characteristics were explored with linear regression analysis the statistical analyses and the plotting of the figures were carried out using the statistical package spss pasw statistics 25 0 ibm corporation armonk ny usa canoco 5 0 microcomputer power ithaca usa and sigmaplot 12 5 systat software inc san jose ca usa 4 results 4 1 spatial pattern of main environmental factors we measured an upstream gd between 1 83 and 2 84 m and a downstream gd between 3 43 and 4 90 m fig 2 a for the upstream and downstream the gd increased as the lateral distance increased within the range of 50 1050 m from the river however the difference of gd was not significant at different distances p 0 05 apart from the gd of the monitoring well at 500 m which was significantly higher than that at 50 m in the upstream fig 2 a at the same lateral distance the gd in the downstream was significantly higher than that in the upstream p 0 05 fig 2 a furthermore with the increase of lateral distance the gd in the downstream increased linearly p 0 01 fig 2 a however the difference in gd was not significant at different distances p 0 05 in addition npp n npp a and me in the upstream of tarim river basin were significantly higher than those in the downstream p 0 01 fig 3 the mean values of npp n of native vegetation and npp a of farmland in the upstream were 9 18 gg c and 6 45 gg c respectively while the mean values of npp n and npp a in the downstream were only 0 65 gg c and 0 gg c similarly compared with the downstream the upstream had a higher annual mean evapotranspiration me of 100 45 mm in the same distance from the river rr it considers the gd and me comprehensively had a significant difference between the upstream and downstream p 0 05 fig 4 b except that the difference at 1050 m away from the river was not significant there was no significant difference in total salt content of groundwater wts and ph value at the same distance from the river in the upstream and downstream p 0 05 fig 4 a and b except for the significant difference at 500 m away from the river p 0 05 the comparison between upstream and downstream showed that the significant difference of groundwater cl and na occurred at 500 m away from the river while the significant difference of groundwater k occurred at 750 m away from the river p 0 05 fig 4 d i and g the other groundwater ions in the upstream and downstream at the same distance from the river had no significant difference p 0 05 fig 4 d e f g h and i the ph value of groundwater at 50 m away from the river in the upstream was significantly higher than that at 500 m away from the river in the upstream p 0 05 fig 4 c the difference was that the k of groundwater at 750 m away from the river in the downstream was significantly lower than that at 1050 m away from the river in the downstream p 0 05 fig 4 g in addition there was no significant difference in groundwater wts ph cl so4 2 ca2 k mg2 na of 6 underground monitoring wells at different distances from the river in the upstream and downstream p 0 05 4 2 spatial variation of doc and dic concentration with the increase in the lateral distance from the river the concentration of doc in the downstream groundwater showed a significant linear increase p 0 01 fig 2 b from 10 24 mg c l 1 to 20 96 mg c l 1 likewise the doc concentrations at 750 m and 1050 m lateral distance were significantly higher compared with that at 50 m lateral distance twice as high respectively p 0 05 fig 2 b conversely there was no significant change in the doc concentration in the upstream groundwater as the lateral distance increased from the river p 0 05 fig 2 b the concentration of doc varied from 6 55 mg c l 1 to 9 07 mg c l 1 at the same lateral distances from the river the doc concentrations in the downstream were significantly higher than those in the upstream p 0 05 fig 2 b except for the doc concentration between the downstream and upstream at 300 m lateral distance from the river based on the linear fitting of the groundwater doc concentration with the same lateral distance of 12 river sections we found that these slopes showed a clear trend an exponential increase to the maximum value owing to the increase in the transverse distance fig 5 figure s2 however we found no linear trend in the dic concentration in the groundwater from the upstream to the downstream with the same lateral distance of the 12 river sections figure s3 in contrast there were no significant differences in the groundwater dic concentrations between the downstream and upstream dic concentrations at the same lateral distances from the river p 0 05 fig 2 c the dic concentrations of the downstream and upstream ranged from 37 41 mg c l 1 to 85 85 mg c l 1 and from 39 46 mg c l 1 to 90 78 mg c l 1 respectively however the groundwater dic concentrations at 50 m lateral distance from the river were significantly lower than those in the upstream except for that at 150 m lateral distance from the river p 0 05 fig 2 c the dic concentrations in the downstream at 750 m and 1050 m lateral distance from the river were significantly higher than that at 50 m distance more than twice as high respectively p 0 05 fig 2 c furthermore significant linear positive correlations were found between the groundwater doc and dic concentrations in the upstream and downstream respectively p 0 01 fig 6 4 3 relationship between dc concentration and main environmental factors the main positive effects on the dic concentration of groundwater were caused by the total salt content of groundwater wts and npp a and negative effects were produced by groundwater ph fig 7 a the major ions in groundwater had a positive effect on the doc and dic concentrations with ca2 producing the greatest effect fig 7 b based on the above rda results we focused on the correlation between the doc and dic concentrations in groundwater and wts ca2 gd and rr our results show significant linear positive correlations between the doc and dic concentrations and wts and ca2 in groundwater p 0 05 fig 8 similarly there were significant linear positive correlations between doc and gd and rr p 0 01 fig 9 a b this further indicates that the fluctuation of groundwater level combined with high annual mean evapotranspiration will affect the change of doc concentration of groundwater more obviously we also found a significant linear correlation between dic and rr p 0 05 but not with gd fig 9 c d 5 discussion 5 1 variation of doc concentration in groundwater under hydrologic and climate driven recent research has suggested that global groundwater doc concentrations vary spatially and are usually lower than the surface water concentrations mcdonough et al 2020 for example a study from a karst aquifer found that the groundwater doc concentrations were always lower than surface water except for individual sample points jin et al 2014 however we found that the average groundwater doc concentration in the desert inland river basin was significantly higher than the surface water concentration similarly the groundwater doc concentration in the upstream and downstream was six and 14 times higher than the global median concentration 1 2 mg c l 1 mcdonough et al 2020 respectively in addition our results were similar to the doc concentration in a shallow coastal aquifer meredith et al 2020 but markedly higher than that in a small permafrost watershed cochand et al 2020 the infiltration of upstream surface runoff saturated the groundwater recharge laterally along the river resulting in no difference in gd and even the mixing of groundwater bodies which contributed to the insignificant difference in the groundwater doc concentration penna et al 2016 and stegen et al 2018 also obtained similar results in riverine ecosystems we found that groundwater recharge could result in a reduced doc concentration due to the source limitation of the doc in the upstream which could indicate a dilution effect basu et al 2011 for example zarnetske et al 2018 found that hydrologic flow and not doc sources determined the doc flux behavior in 80 of watersheds from southwestern deserts to northeastern forests in the conterminous united states mcdonough et al 2020 also found that significantly lower doc concentrations resulted from higher groundwater recharge rates 300 mm year 1 these results support our conceptual model of changes in doc concentrations in upstream groundwater see the graphical abstract the downstream surface water originates mainly from the ecological conveyance water discharged from the daxihaizi reservoir to recharge the groundwater in the riverbank the lateral groundwater recharge along the river is gradually reduced and insufficient in addition to the high evapotranspiration causing an increase in the gd meanwhile the low dissolved oxygen content of groundwater slows the rate of doc decomposition resulting in lasting preservation bertrand and lallierverges 1993 schmidt et al 2011 meredith et al 2020 similarly drying can produce a high doc concentration in an intermittent stream and an increase in the humic like fluorescence signal granados et al 2020 therefore the groundwater doc concentration increases in a desert inland river basin ledesma et al 2015 although our research results are consistent with those of graham et al 2015 they assumed that the physical shear stress on aquifer materials caused by intense abstraction significantly increased the temporary release of doc from the sloughing of biofilms and the release of otherwise bound colloidal and sedimentary organic carbon these results confirm our conceptual model of changes in doc concentrations in downstream groundwater see the graphical abstract another factor contributing to the increase in groundwater doc concentrations of the downstream comes from natural vegetation and cropland cultivation mainly cotton an irrigation return flow in the upstream of the tarim river granados and butturini 2019 according to fig 3 the upstream npp n npp a and me were higher than downstream those and it indicated that the high concentration of doc in the downstream came more from the infiltration of surface vegetation in the upstream through the river in addition the results of pesantez et al 2018 support our conclusion reporting that changes in land cover and land use are the most important predictors of doc concentrations in the high elevation ecosystems of ecuador with minimal influence from precipitation conditions furthermore as oasis agriculture developed in this region li et al 2015 showed that the irrigation of saline land increased the salinity alkalinity of the recharge water delivering more dic into aquifers as a result crop planting and riparian vegetation restoration have enhanced the carbon sink in the desert inland river basin 5 2 influence of main environmental factors on dc concentration in groundwater we also observed a significant positive correlation between doc and ca2 concentration underwater which was caused by the mineralization of doc that consumed do produced co2 and subsequently decreased the ph resulting in calcite dissolution and ca2 production mcdonough et al 2020 therefore a high doc concentration will maintain a high ca2 content in groundwater but the consumption of do produces an anoxic environment which leads to the biodegradation rate of doc harvey et al 2002 however in this study we did not find a clear linear relationship between the doc concentration and the ph value after all desert soil and groundwater are highly alkaline which interferes with the negative correlation between doc and ph underwater mcdonough et al 2020 under the joint influence of groundwater recharge and high evapotranspiration the complex physical and chemical reaction of groundwater also led to a significant positive linear correlation between doc and total salinity granados et al 2020 in contrast to the column experiment tiemeyer et al 2017 found that field concentrations of doc were much higher and were not related to ph but increased with higher electrical conductivity the dic in the groundwater of the tarim river basin comes mainly from river input from the mountains and the seepage of farmland irrigation in the oasis areas rather than annual precipitation in the basin 30 50 mm li et al 2015 along the tarim river basin the dic concentration in groundwater was similar to that in the karst aquifer 42 50 51 2 mg l 1 jin et al 2014 although the variability of the dic concentration in our desert areas was larger 143 however our results were nearly 30 times higher than those of cochand et al 2020 for a small permafrost watershed near umiujaq in canada studies from a groundwater aquifer in finland showed that the dic concentrations were lower than our results which are within the range of 2 4 21 6 mg l 1 jylhä ollila et al 2021 kortelainen and karhu 2006 some studies have shown that doc decomposition in groundwater releases co2 which is involved in the decomposition of silicates e g idealized equation 1 and carbonates e g equation 2 and then produces dic ca2 and mg2 eckard et al 2017 jin et al 2014 li et al 2015 mcdonough et al 2020 this explains why doc and dic have a significant positive linear correlation and why ca2 mg2 doc and dic in groundwater also have a significant positive linear correlation respectively by analyzing the δ13c value of dic it was also shown that the increase in the dic concentration was caused by the weathering of carbonates in deep groundwater as a closed system cochand et al 2020 the two idealized equations given by eckard et al 2017 are as follows 1 casio3 2co2 h2o ca2 2hco3 sio2 2 camg co3 2 2co2 2h2o ca2 mg2 4hco3 overall our findings demonstrate that the hydrological and climatic interaction drives the spatial variation of groundwater dc concentration in desert inland river basins we further reveal that ca2 in groundwater is a key environmental factor affecting the concentration of dc our findings confirm that the hydrology in desert inland river basins plays an important role in driving the carbon cycle furthermore we suggest that groundwater carbon cycle processes in the modern global carbon cycle may have been greatly underestimated and further study of these processes is highly warranted however changes in the doc and dic concentrations can also result from the mixing of multiple sources mineral dissolution precipitation and other abiotic reactions jin et al 2014 because of the number of processes that may change dc concentrations we will use carbon stable isotope tracer technology to quantify the source of the groundwater dc in future work 6 conclusion we confirm that groundwater recharge leads to the decrease of the gd in desert inland river basins resulting in a decrease in the doc concentration rather than the dic concentration furthermore high evapotranspiration significantly affects groundwater doc and dic concentrations indicating that the groundwater dc in the desert is relatively stable in addition there are differences between the upstream and downstream hydrological processes which lead to inconsistencies in the spatial variation of the groundwater dc concentration our study suggests that large runoff from the upstream as well as vegetation restoration and agricultural development may increase dc concentrations in groundwater suggesting that closed groundwater systems in desert inland river basins may be a stable carbon sink data availability the

4222,due to the devastating impact of compound dry and hot events cdhes reliable early warming information is particularly important for reducing their potential damages previous studies on the evaluation and prediction of cdhes are commonly conducted by defining the compound event as a binary variable i e occurrence or not which is simple to use but lacks information on the severity level of these events the prediction of multiple categories or different severity classes or levels of cdhes which could be useful for operational decision making is still lacking this study employs the ordinal regression model to predict different categories of cdhes during july august in northeast china nec based on preceding el niño southern oscillation or enso for the period from 1952 to 2012 correlation analysis and composite analysis show that preceding la niña is closely related to cdhes over northeast china and can be used to predict cdhes several months in advance the performance of the probabilistic prediction of cdhes for 1 month to 6 month lead time is assessed using the leave one out cross validation loocv results show that the proposed method outperforms the reference prediction i e climatology for predicting different categories of cdhes of august in northeast china with limited prediction skills in july the cdhe during 1975 is used as a case study to demonstrate the application of the proposed model for categorical prediction this study could be useful to provide early warning information of cdhes for decision making to mitigate their negative impacts keywords drought compound event prediction dry and hot northeast china 1 introduction northeast china nec is an important crop production region of china knownas bread basket li et al 2020a li et al 2018 zhou et al 2020b crop growth during summer in this region is sensitive to precipitation and temperature anomalies such as droughts and heatwaves guo et al 2017 wang et al 2020 during the past half century a decreasing trend of precipitation and increased temperature is shown over northeast china leading to the increased likelihoods of extreme droughts and heatwaves li et al 2020a liang et al 2011 more importantly droughts and hot extremes may occur concurrently or consecutively with amplified negative impacts which are commonly termed as compound dry and hot events or extremes cdhes leonard 2014 ribeiro et al 2020 zscheischler 2020 and exhibit a consistent increase in a variety of regions including northeast china wu et al 2019 zhou and liu 2018 due to the amplified impacts of compound dry and hot events on agriculture and the potential increase in the future in northeast china it is important to predict cdhes in a timely manner to aid agricultural planning and management northeast china is located in the east asian monsoon region and summer monsoon anomalies in east asia directly affect the regional climate el niño southern oscillation enso is a major cause of global climate variability and influences east asian monsoon which may lead to climate related hazards such as droughts and heatwaves in east asia including china sun and wang 2006 sun et al 2015 wei et al 2020 zhou et al 2020a previous studies investigated the relationship between enso and summer precipitation over northeast china lu et al 2015 shuai et al 2016 sohn et al 2012 wu et al 2003 which is associated with the east asian summer monsoon easm induced by sea surface temperature sst anomalies in the pacific ocean or tropical indian ocean li et al 2014 wen et al 2019 wu et al 2012 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the el niño events development in the preceding period could lead to enhanced easm and abundant rainfall in summer over northeast china while the antecedent la niña events tend to induce drought events over this area ouyang et al 2014 sun et al 2017 for example deng et al 2019 showed that drought conditions in northeast china become more severe due to impacts from la niña events in addition enso is also recognized as an important factor influencing the summer temperature of northeast china wei et al 2020 wu et al 2010 previous studies have shown that summer temperatures over northeast china are lower than the multi year average during el niño years whereas summers are hotter than normal conditions during la niña years wu et al 2021 these studies highlight that the antecedent enso condition with its mature phase often in boreal winter is an important precursor of inter annual variations of summer droughts and hot extremes in northeast china with the frequent concurrence of droughts and hot extremes in recent decades across the globe increased attention has been given to the physical mechanism and prediction of cdhes a variety of studies have identified the connection between large scale circulation patterns such as enso and cdhes chen et al 2019 mukherjee et al 2020 wu et al 2021 for example in northeast china previous studies have shown that enso is an important contributing factor to cdhes wu et al 2021 mukherjee et al 2020 assessed the impact of major modes of natural climate variability on the occurrence of compound drought and heatwaves at the global scale based on the poisson generalized linear model progress in understanding the impact of large scale circulation patterns has inspired studies on the prediction of cdhes for example hao et al 2019 conducted the prediction of the cdhes based on large scale circulation patterns such as north atlantic oscillation nao and pacific decadal oscillation pdo over global land areas multiple drought categories or severity levels have been commonly used to aid decision making for operational management of natural hazards such as droughts steinemann et al 2015 svoboda et al 2002 a variety of studies have been devoted to the prediction of multiple categories or classes of drought bonaccorso et al 2015 moreira et al 2008 van de vyver and van den bergh 2018 for example moreira et al 2008 employed the loglinear model for the prediction of 4 drought categories based on the standard precipitation index spi bonaccorso et al 2015 proposed a probabilistic model for the prediction of transition probabilities of multiple drought categories or classes based on spi using nao as the predictor apart from the prediction of drought categories defined from single drought indices the drought categories can be defined based on a variety of variables or indicators to incorporate a wide range of impacts for example the u s drought monitor or usdm incorporated a large number of climatic and hydrologic indicators and inputs from local experts to define different drought categories which has been widely used to trigger drought responses svoboda et al 2002 although the diverse impact of chdes on a variety of sectors have been recognized zscheischler et al 2020 and different categories or classes of the concurrence of dry and hot conditions have been developed christian et al 2019 feng et al 2020 suitable prediction of multiple categories of cdhes that could aid the decision making is still lacking the objective of this study is to develop a statistical approach for the prediction of multiple categories of cdhes during the late summer months july and august from 1952 to 2012 in northeast china based on enso we first evaluate the relationship between enso and multiple categories of cdhes and construct the ordinal regression method for the categorical prediction the prediction performance of different lead time is then evaluated based on the leave one out cross validation followed by the case study of cdhes in august 1975 2 data monthly precipitation and temperature data at 0 25 spatial resolution from 1952 to 2012 are used in this study to define compound dry and hot events these data for northeast china defined as the region 38 55 n and 115 135 e as shown in fig 1 are obtained from the institute of geographical sciences and natural resources research based on 756 meteorological administration stations of china zhang et al 2014 the monthly niño 3 4 sea surface temperature nino3 4 averaged sst from 5 s 5 n and 170 w 120 w which is used to identify the enso is obtained from the global climate observing system gcos working group on surface pressure wg sp available online at https www esrl noaa gov psd gcos wgsp timeseries nino34 we use 0 5 c as the threshold of nino3 4 to define el niño 0 5 c and la niña 0 5 c events wei et al 2020 the precipitation during july august account for around 80 of summer precipitation in this area affected by the east asian summer monsoon sun et al 2017 and thus we focus on july and august in this study 3 method 3 1 multiple categories of compound dry and hot events a variety of studies on cdhes are based on the concurrence of low precipitation and high temperature e g combination of different percentiles of precipitation and temperature beniston 2009 kirono et al 2017 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 in these studies cdhes are commonly defined as a binary variable i e occurrence or not based on which the variation and prediction of cdhes have been evaluated however defining cdhes as the occurrence or non occurrence in previous studies lacks information on the severity level of compound events in recent decades the classification of concurrent dry and hot conditions into multiple categories 2 has also been explored christian et al 2019 feng et al 2020 following similar concepts we classify different severity levels of cdhes into three categories c including non occurrence c0 moderate cdhes c1 and extreme cdhes c2 the categories of cdhes are defined based on different thresholds of precipitation p and temperature t specifically the 3 categories of cdhes can be defined as as illustrated in fig s1 1 c c 0 p p 0 o r t t 0 c 1 o t h e r w i s e c 2 p p 1 a n d t t 1 in this study two groups of percentile based thresholds of p and t are used including p 0 t 0 p 50 t 50 and p 1 t 1 p 20 t 80 to define different categories the percentiles are computed using the base period from 1961 to 1990 which is recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo 1990 these thresholds are selected mainly to extract relatively sufficient sample sizes to facilitate statistical modeling and to represent the compound event or their impacts of particular interest in this study for example p 0 t 0 p 30 t 70 may not result in enough data to fit the model these are some subjectivity regarding the selection of thresholds here and other ways may be explored in future studies e g based on the impact 3 2 ordinal regression model the ordinal regression model is employed to predict the three categories of cdhes namely c0 c1 and c2 based on nino3 4 the category of cdhes is defined as the response variable y the ordinal regression model can be used to establish the relationship between y and the predictor x which is defined as follows agresti 2018 hao et al 2016 2 l γ j α j β x j 1 2 where α j is the intercept dependent on the category j β is the regression coefficients associated with the prediction x e g nino3 4 l γ j is the link function here the logit link function is used which is defined as 3 logit γ j log γ j 1 γ j where γ j is the cumulative probability of the occurrence of each category p y j the predicted probability of each category j can be estimated as p y j p y j p y j 1 3 3 leave one out cross validation we use the leave one out cross validation loocv to evaluate the model prediction performance wilks 2011 the data with the total length of period n 61 years is divided into two groups namely the training data with length n 1 and testing data in each period we use the n 1 periods of observed categories to train the ordinal regression model and predict the left out category this results in a total of n predicted values finally we evaluate the performance of the model based on the prediction and observations of n 61 periods the rank probability score rps is a measure of the probabilistic prediction and is defined as wilks 2011 4 rps 1 m 1 i 1 m j 1 i y j j 1 i o j 2 j 1 2 m where m is the number of categories m 3 j is the category of cdhes yj is the predicted probability of category j oj is the observed probability of category j 0 for non occurrences and 1 for occurrences the prediction skill is evaluated based on the reference prediction which is defined as the climatology frequency of chdes the rank probability skill score rpss is defined as wilks 2011 4 rpss 1 rpsm rpsr where rpsm and rpsr indicate the average of rps for the prediction of n periods based on the proposed model and reference prediction respectively the rpss ranges from to 1 with positive rpss values indicating better prediction than the reference prediction 4 results 4 1 enso impacts on compound dry and hot events to illustrate the enso impact on dry and hot events we first compute the spearman rank correlation coefficients between precipitation temperature of july august and antecedent nino3 4 with 1 6 month lag time during 1952 2012 over northeast china as shown in fig 2 respectively in july significant positive nino3 4 precipitation correlations are shown in central areas and negative nino3 4 temperature correlations are shown in large regions in the northern area in august large regions show significant positive nino3 4 precipitation correlations and significant negative nino3 4 temperature correlations specifically about 7 9 5 3 24 4 43 8 28 3 and 23 4 32 3 19 4 31 1 51 0 60 0 and 36 8 of northeast china show significant positive correlations between precipitation negative correlations between temperature in august and antecedent nino3 4 for 1 month to 6 month lags respectively the high correlation between nino3 4 and precipitation temperature for long lag time is overall consistent with previous studies ji et al 2019 wu et al 2003 zhao et al 2019 these results imply low nino3 4 values or la niña are closely related to droughts and hot extremes over northeast china particularly in august following wu et al 2021 we use the composite analysis to assess the influence of antecedent enso on occurrences of compound dry and hot events in northeast china during july and august using the t test for the significance test at a 0 05 significance level fig 3 shows the difference in the summation of occurrences of cdhes including c1 and c2 for july and august corresponding to the lowest 20 values ol and the highest 20 values oh of nino3 4 with different lag time the difference is computed as ol oh the regions with positive negative composite differences indicate that occurrences of cdhes are induced by low high nino3 4 values in july impacts of enso on cdhes are shown mainly in central regions in august larger regions show strong impacts of enso on compound dry and hot events for example significant and positive differences are shown in 5 6 10 3 17 7 25 5 28 5 and 26 6 of the whole area for the 1 month to 6 month lags respectively results in figs 2 and 3 show that there are strong impacts of antecedent enso on precipitation temperature or compound dry and hot events for long lag time for example in august fig 3 large regions in the northern area still show significant composite differences between cdhes and nino3 4 for 4 month or 5 month lags this is likely related to the delayed response of the atmosphere to ocean changes specifically lagged effects of several months exist in the response of east asian monsoon anomalies to enso or the interannual variability of tropical ocean which is likely related to the impact of indian ocean in maintaining influences of enso lee et al 2011 wang et al 2000 wang et al 2001 this possibly explains the strong and lagged correlations between summer precipitation or climate and antecedent winter nino3 4 in northeast china which is partly shown in previous studies li et al 2011 zhao et al 2019 these results highlight the impact of enso on cdhes of different lags which may provide useful information for prediction purposes 4 2 responses of multiple categories to enso to highlight the response of multiple categories of cdhes to la niña and non la niña phases we compute the frequency of cdhes the ratio of different categories in la niña and non la niña periods in july and august over northeast china corresponding to antecedent nino3 4 index for 1 month to 6 month lags as shown in the boxplots in fig 4 overall these results present similar patterns of high likelihoods of cdhes corresponding to la niña in antecedent periods except for lag 1 and lag 2 of july the frequency of c1 and c2 during la niña is higher than that during non la niña conditions for example in august the median value of the frequency of c1 with antecedent la niña and non la niña of 4 month lags i e in april are 0 32 and 0 24 these results indicate c1 and c2 categories of cdhes are more likely to occur with leading la niña in antecedent periods 4 3 prediction performance the results in previous sections confirm enso s impact on cdhes in northeast china with prolonged time lag effects to illustrate the proposed method for predicting cdhes we first compare the observed cdhes categories in august and nino3 4 of april 4 month lead time from 1952 to 2012 for one single grid 121 625 e 49 375 n which is shown in fig 5 from fig 5 a there are close relationships between cdhes in august and nino3 4 in april which is consistent with results in sections 4 1 and 4 2 for example during the years 1955 1974 1989 1999 2008 and 2011 with strong la niña events c1 and c2 categories are observed based on the fitted model in equation 2 the relationship between the probability of each category and nino3 4 is shown in fig 5 b the probability of c1 or c2 categories is high with lower nino3 4 values and drops with increased nino3 4 these results indicate higher likelihoods of cdhes with decreased nino3 4 values i e during la niña for this grid which is consistent with findings in previous sections for the three categories with different probabilities with summation equal to one we select the one with the highest probability as the predicted category we then assess the prediction skill of the model of different lead time using the loocv based on the full period from 1952 to 2012 here both the initial category of cdhes and nino3 4 in antecedent periods are used as predictors for predicting the cdhes in july and august for 1 mont to 6 month lead time the spatial distribution of rpss of different lead time in july and august is shown in fig 6 for july limited regions show positive rpss values see fig 6 a f which indicates that skillful prediction can only be achieved in small regions specifically the area proportions with positive rpss for the 1 month to 6 month lead time are 26 7 8 5 7 4 13 4 20 9 and 15 1 respectively however rpss is positive in much larger regions in august the area proportions with positive rpss for the 1 month to 6 month lead time are 44 7 37 2 45 9 61 5 60 8 and 51 6 respectively see fig 6 g l the distinct difference in the prediction performance of july and august could be due to the advance and retreat of monsoon and rain bands during late summer in northeast china specifically the east asian summer monsoon which is likely preceded with sea surface temperature anomalies in the pacific or enso in the previous winter sun et al 2017 starts to extend gradually toward north and northeast china in early july and reaches the northernmost part of northeast china in early august then retreats southward shen et al 2011 xu et al 2017 this could affect the relationship between precipitation temperature and enso in northeast china during different periods of the summer season and finally contribute to different prediction performances in july and august these results also show the importance of enso for the long lead prediction for example the area percentage with positive rpss values for 4 5 months lead time is higher than that of 1 3 months lead time these prediction results are partly consistent with previous studies showing that asia summer monsoon precipitation is more predictable after the mature phase of enso i e winter or spring season enso significantly affects subsequent summer precipitation sohn et al 2012 sun et al 2017 overall these results indicate that enso can provide skillful prediction of cdhes over northeast china with better performance in august 4 4 case study of cdhes in 1975 we select the compound dry and hot event in august 1975 over northeast china as a case study to demonstrate the application of the proposed model severe drought events occurred in northeast china during august 1975 which is accompanied by high temperature anomalies yue et al 2018 leading to compound dry and hot events as shown in fig 7 a fig 7 b shows nino3 4 values from january to august in 1975 which indicates cdhes in august 1975 are preceded by strong la niña event especially from may to july or antecedent 1 3 months we use the data from 1952 to 1974 and 1976 2012 for the parameter estimation and then employ the fitted model to predict the chde in august 1975 the total probability of c1 and c2 based on 1 month to 6 month lead prediction for august 1975 is shown in fig 7 c the predicted probabilities of cdhes are higher in heilongjiang and inner mongolia provinces which is consistent with the region with cdhes in observations the cdhes over large regions in jilin and liaoning provinces i e southern areas were not predicted well which is likely due to the limited areas with significant impacts of enso from the composite analysis see fig 3 by comparing the probabilities of c0 c1 and c2 we use the category with the highest probability as the predicted severity of cdhes as shown in fig 7 d cdhe categories in some regions are underestimated or overestimated comparing the predicted probability of c1 and c2 for different lead time fig s2 some regions present similar probabilities of c1 and c2 in which the proposed model cannot distinguish the two categories partly due to limited sample sizes which may lead to the aforementioned bias overall the 1 to 3 month lead model provides relatively good prediction results for the cdhes severity in large regions of northeast china for the 4 6 months lead prediction a limited signal of cdhes is predicted though significant impacts are shown in fig 3 which is possibly due to the emergence of a strong signal of la niña from may i e the la niña signal is not strong from february to april corresponding to the 4 6 months lead prediction the prediction of cdhes for other years with strong la niña events is also assessed which shows potential usefulness of the proposed method for predicting compound events results for 1999 are shown in fig s3 5 discussions this study shows the potential capacity of predicting multiple categories of cdhes based on antecedent

factors of different times scales could also be evaluated and employed as predictors to further improve the prediction rashid et al 2020 in addition the impact of enso on precipitation temperature in northeast china may change under global warming han et al 2017 wu et al 2010 as such improved prediction incorporating nonstationary properties in the statistical relationship is needed hao et al 2018 meng et al 2019 at last the proposed model relies on the strong signal of enso to improve the prediction skill for both enso and non enso periods dynamical forecast from different forecast systems such as north american multi model ensemble gao et al 2014 ma et al 2015 slater et al 2017 xu et al 2018 yuan and wood 2013 can be assessed to improve the prediction performance 6 conclusion the statistical prediction of different categories of compound dry and hot events cdhes including non occurrence c0 moderate severity level c1 and extreme severity level c2 during july and august in northeast china based on enso is investigated in this study close relationships between cdhes and antecedent enso are found in northeast china particularly in august based on climate data and nino3 4 for the period 1952 2012 the ordinal regression model is employed to model the relationship between enso and multiple categories of cdhes which is then used for the probabilistic prediction of cdhes based on the leave one out cross validation loocv the prediction performance of different categories of cdhes for 1 month to 6 month lead time is evaluated results show skillful prediction can be achieved for a large portion of regions over northeast china particularly in august the case study of predicting the cdhes during 1975 shows useful early warning information for several months ahead

4222,due to the devastating impact of compound dry and hot events cdhes reliable early warming information is particularly important for reducing their potential damages previous studies on the evaluation and prediction of cdhes are commonly conducted by defining the compound event as a binary variable i e occurrence or not which is simple to use but lacks information on the severity level of these events the prediction of multiple categories or different severity classes or levels of cdhes which could be useful for operational decision making is still lacking this study employs the ordinal regression model to predict different categories of cdhes during july august in northeast china nec based on preceding el niño southern oscillation or enso for the period from 1952 to 2012 correlation analysis and composite analysis show that preceding la niña is closely related to cdhes over northeast china and can be used to predict cdhes several months in advance the performance of the probabilistic prediction of cdhes for 1 month to 6 month lead time is assessed using the leave one out cross validation loocv results show that the proposed method outperforms the reference prediction i e climatology for predicting different categories of cdhes of august in northeast china with limited prediction skills in july the cdhe during 1975 is used as a case study to demonstrate the application of the proposed model for categorical prediction this study could be useful to provide early warning information of cdhes for decision making to mitigate their negative impacts keywords drought compound event prediction dry and hot northeast china 1 introduction northeast china nec is an important crop production region of china knownas bread basket li et al 2020a li et al 2018 zhou et al 2020b crop growth during summer in this region is sensitive to precipitation and temperature anomalies such as droughts and heatwaves guo et al 2017 wang et al 2020 during the past half century a decreasing trend of precipitation and increased temperature is shown over northeast china leading to the increased likelihoods of extreme droughts and heatwaves li et al 2020a liang et al 2011 more importantly droughts and hot extremes may occur concurrently or consecutively with amplified negative impacts which are commonly termed as compound dry and hot events or extremes cdhes leonard 2014 ribeiro et al 2020 zscheischler 2020 and exhibit a consistent increase in a variety of regions including northeast china wu et al 2019 zhou and liu 2018 due to the amplified impacts of compound dry and hot events on agriculture and the potential increase in the future in northeast china it is important to predict cdhes in a timely manner to aid agricultural planning and management northeast china is located in the east asian monsoon region and summer monsoon anomalies in east asia directly affect the regional climate el niño southern oscillation enso is a major cause of global climate variability and influences east asian monsoon which may lead to climate related hazards such as droughts and heatwaves in east asia including china sun and wang 2006 sun et al 2015 wei et al 2020 zhou et al 2020a previous studies investigated the relationship between enso and summer precipitation over northeast china lu et al 2015 shuai et al 2016 sohn et al 2012 wu et al 2003 which is associated with the east asian summer monsoon easm induced by sea surface temperature sst anomalies in the pacific ocean or tropical indian ocean li et al 2014 wen et al 2019 wu et al 2012 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the el niño events development in the preceding period could lead to enhanced easm and abundant rainfall in summer over northeast china while the antecedent la niña events tend to induce drought events over this area ouyang et al 2014 sun et al 2017 for example deng et al 2019 showed that drought conditions in northeast china become more severe due to impacts from la niña events in addition enso is also recognized as an important factor influencing the summer temperature of northeast china wei et al 2020 wu et al 2010 previous studies have shown that summer temperatures over northeast china are lower than the multi year average during el niño years whereas summers are hotter than normal conditions during la niña years wu et al 2021 these studies highlight that the antecedent enso condition with its mature phase often in boreal winter is an important precursor of inter annual variations of summer droughts and hot extremes in northeast china with the frequent concurrence of droughts and hot extremes in recent decades across the globe increased attention has been given to the physical mechanism and prediction of cdhes a variety of studies have identified the connection between large scale circulation patterns such as enso and cdhes chen et al 2019 mukherjee et al 2020 wu et al 2021 for example in northeast china previous studies have shown that enso is an important contributing factor to cdhes wu et al 2021 mukherjee et al 2020 assessed the impact of major modes of natural climate variability on the occurrence of compound drought and heatwaves at the global scale based on the poisson generalized linear model progress in understanding the impact of large scale circulation patterns has inspired studies on the prediction of cdhes for example hao et al 2019 conducted the prediction of the cdhes based on large scale circulation patterns such as north atlantic oscillation nao and pacific decadal oscillation pdo over global land areas multiple drought categories or severity levels have been commonly used to aid decision making for operational management of natural hazards such as droughts steinemann et al 2015 svoboda et al 2002 a variety of studies have been devoted to the prediction of multiple categories or classes of drought bonaccorso et al 2015 moreira et al 2008 van de vyver and van den bergh 2018 for example moreira et al 2008 employed the loglinear model for the prediction of 4 drought categories based on the standard precipitation index spi bonaccorso et al 2015 proposed a probabilistic model for the prediction of transition probabilities of multiple drought categories or classes based on spi using nao as the predictor apart from the prediction of drought categories defined from single drought indices the drought categories can be defined based on a variety of variables or indicators to incorporate a wide range of impacts for example the u s drought monitor or usdm incorporated a large number of climatic and hydrologic indicators and inputs from local experts to define different drought categories which has been widely used to trigger drought responses svoboda et al 2002 although the diverse impact of chdes on a variety of sectors have been recognized zscheischler et al 2020 and different categories or classes of the concurrence of dry and hot conditions have been developed christian et al 2019 feng et al 2020 suitable prediction of multiple categories of cdhes that could aid the decision making is still lacking the objective of this study is to develop a statistical approach for the prediction of multiple categories of cdhes during the late summer months july and august from 1952 to 2012 in northeast china based on enso we first evaluate the relationship between enso and multiple categories of cdhes and construct the ordinal regression method for the categorical prediction the prediction performance of different lead time is then evaluated based on the leave one out cross validation followed by the case study of cdhes in august 1975 2 data monthly precipitation and temperature data at 0 25 spatial resolution from 1952 to 2012 are used in this study to define compound dry and hot events these data for northeast china defined as the region 38 55 n and 115 135 e as shown in fig 1 are obtained from the institute of geographical sciences and natural resources research based on 756 meteorological administration stations of china zhang et al 2014 the monthly niño 3 4 sea surface temperature nino3 4 averaged sst from 5 s 5 n and 170 w 120 w which is used to identify the enso is obtained from the global climate observing system gcos working group on surface pressure wg sp available online at https www esrl noaa gov psd gcos wgsp timeseries nino34 we use 0 5 c as the threshold of nino3 4 to define el niño 0 5 c and la niña 0 5 c events wei et al 2020 the precipitation during july august account for around 80 of summer precipitation in this area affected by the east asian summer monsoon sun et al 2017 and thus we focus on july and august in this study 3 method 3 1 multiple categories of compound dry and hot events a variety of studies on cdhes are based on the concurrence of low precipitation and high temperature e g combination of different percentiles of precipitation and temperature beniston 2009 kirono et al 2017 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 in these studies cdhes are commonly defined as a binary variable i e occurrence or not based on which the variation and prediction of cdhes have been evaluated however defining cdhes as the occurrence or non occurrence in previous studies lacks information on the severity level of compound events in recent decades the classification of concurrent dry and hot conditions into multiple categories 2 has also been explored christian et al 2019 feng et al 2020 following similar concepts we classify different severity levels of cdhes into three categories c including non occurrence c0 moderate cdhes c1 and extreme cdhes c2 the categories of cdhes are defined based on different thresholds of precipitation p and temperature t specifically the 3 categories of cdhes can be defined as as illustrated in fig s1 1 c c 0 p p 0 o r t t 0 c 1 o t h e r w i s e c 2 p p 1 a n d t t 1 in this study two groups of percentile based thresholds of p and t are used including p 0 t 0 p 50 t 50 and p 1 t 1 p 20 t 80 to define different categories the percentiles are computed using the base period from 1961 to 1990 which is recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo 1990 these thresholds are selected mainly to extract relatively sufficient sample sizes to facilitate statistical modeling and to represent the compound event or their impacts of particular interest in this study for example p 0 t 0 p 30 t 70 may not result in enough data to fit the model these are some subjectivity regarding the selection of thresholds here and other ways may be explored in future studies e g based on the impact 3 2 ordinal regression model the ordinal regression model is employed to predict the three categories of cdhes namely c0 c1 and c2 based on nino3 4 the category of cdhes is defined as the response variable y the ordinal regression model can be used to establish the relationship between y and the predictor x which is defined as follows agresti 2018 hao et al 2016 2 l γ j α j β x j 1 2 where α j is the intercept dependent on the category j β is the regression coefficients associated with the prediction x e g nino3 4 l γ j is the link function here the logit link function is used which is defined as 3 logit γ j log γ j 1 γ j where γ j is the cumulative probability of the occurrence of each category p y j the predicted probability of each category j can be estimated as p y j p y j p y j 1 3 3 leave one out cross validation we use the leave one out cross validation loocv to evaluate the model prediction performance wilks 2011 the data with the total length of period n 61 years is divided into two groups namely the training data with length n 1 and testing data in each period we use the n 1 periods of observed categories to train the ordinal regression model and predict the left out category this results in a total of n predicted values finally we evaluate the performance of the model based on the prediction and observations of n 61 periods the rank probability score rps is a measure of the probabilistic prediction and is defined as wilks 2011 4 rps 1 m 1 i 1 m j 1 i y j j 1 i o j 2 j 1 2 m where m is the number of categories m 3 j is the category of cdhes yj is the predicted probability of category j oj is the observed probability of category j 0 for non occurrences and 1 for occurrences the prediction skill is evaluated based on the reference prediction which is defined as the climatology frequency of chdes the rank probability skill score rpss is defined as wilks 2011 4 rpss 1 rpsm rpsr where rpsm and rpsr indicate the average of rps for the prediction of n periods based on the proposed model and reference prediction respectively the rpss ranges from to 1 with positive rpss values indicating better prediction than the reference prediction 4 results 4 1 enso impacts on compound dry and hot events to illustrate the enso impact on dry and hot events we first compute the spearman rank correlation coefficients between precipitation temperature of july august and antecedent nino3 4 with 1 6 month lag time during 1952 2012 over northeast china as shown in fig 2 respectively in july significant positive nino3 4 precipitation correlations are shown in central areas and negative nino3 4 temperature correlations are shown in large regions in the northern area in august large regions show significant positive nino3 4 precipitation correlations and significant negative nino3 4 temperature correlations specifically about 7 9 5 3 24 4 43 8 28 3 and 23 4 32 3 19 4 31 1 51 0 60 0 and 36 8 of northeast china show significant positive correlations between precipitation negative correlations between temperature in august and antecedent nino3 4 for 1 month to 6 month lags respectively the high correlation between nino3 4 and precipitation temperature for long lag time is overall consistent with previous studies ji et al 2019 wu et al 2003 zhao et al 2019 these results imply low nino3 4 values or la niña are closely related to droughts and hot extremes over northeast china particularly in august following wu et al 2021 we use the composite analysis to assess the influence of antecedent enso on occurrences of compound dry and hot events in northeast china during july and august using the t test for the significance test at a 0 05 significance level fig 3 shows the difference in the summation of occurrences of cdhes including c1 and c2 for july and august corresponding to the lowest 20 values ol and the highest 20 values oh of nino3 4 with different lag time the difference is computed as ol oh the regions with positive negative composite differences indicate that occurrences of cdhes are induced by low high nino3 4 values in july impacts of enso on cdhes are shown mainly in central regions in august larger regions show strong impacts of enso on compound dry and hot events for example significant and positive differences are shown in 5 6 10 3 17 7 25 5 28 5 and 26 6 of the whole area for the 1 month to 6 month lags respectively results in figs 2 and 3 show that there are strong impacts of antecedent enso on precipitation temperature or compound dry and hot events for long lag time for example in august fig 3 large regions in the northern area still show significant composite differences between cdhes and nino3 4 for 4 month or 5 month lags this is likely related to the delayed response of the atmosphere to ocean changes specifically lagged effects of several months exist in the response of east asian monsoon anomalies to enso or the interannual variability of tropical ocean which is likely related to the impact of indian ocean in maintaining influences of enso lee et al 2011 wang et al 2000 wang et al 2001 this possibly explains the strong and lagged correlations between summer precipitation or climate and antecedent winter nino3 4 in northeast china which is partly shown in previous studies li et al 2011 zhao et al 2019 these results highlight the impact of enso on cdhes of different lags which may provide useful information for prediction purposes 4 2 responses of multiple categories to enso to highlight the response of multiple categories of cdhes to la niña and non la niña phases we compute the frequency of cdhes the ratio of different categories in la niña and non la niña periods in july and august over northeast china corresponding to antecedent nino3 4 index for 1 month to 6 month lags as shown in the boxplots in fig 4 overall these results present similar patterns of high likelihoods of cdhes corresponding to la niña in antecedent periods except for lag 1 and lag 2 of july the frequency of c1 and c2 during la niña is higher than that during non la niña conditions for example in august the median value of the frequency of c1 with antecedent la niña and non la niña of 4 month lags i e in april are 0 32 and 0 24 these results indicate c1 and c2 categories of cdhes are more likely to occur with leading la niña in antecedent periods 4 3 prediction performance the results in previous sections confirm enso s impact on cdhes in northeast china with prolonged time lag effects to illustrate the proposed method for predicting cdhes we first compare the observed cdhes categories in august and nino3 4 of april 4 month lead time from 1952 to 2012 for one single grid 121 625 e 49 375 n which is shown in fig 5 from fig 5 a there are close relationships between cdhes in august and nino3 4 in april which is consistent with results in sections 4 1 and 4 2 for example during the years 1955 1974 1989 1999 2008 and 2011 with strong la niña events c1 and c2 categories are observed based on the fitted model in equation 2 the relationship between the probability of each category and nino3 4 is shown in fig 5 b the probability of c1 or c2 categories is high with lower nino3 4 values and drops with increased nino3 4 these results indicate higher likelihoods of cdhes with decreased nino3 4 values i e during la niña for this grid which is consistent with findings in previous sections for the three categories with different probabilities with summation equal to one we select the one with the highest

proportions with positive rpss for the 1 month to 6 month lead time are 26 7 8 5 7 4 13 4 20 9 and 15 1 respectively however rpss is positive in much larger regions in august the area proportions with positive rpss for the 1 month to 6 month lead time are 44 7 37 2 45 9 61 5 60 8 and 51 6 respectively see fig 6 g l the distinct difference in the prediction performance of july and august could be due to the advance and retreat of monsoon and rain bands during late summer in northeast china specifically the east asian summer monsoon which is likely preceded with sea surface temperature anomalies in the pacific or enso in the previous winter sun et al 2017 starts to extend gradually toward north and northeast china in early july and reaches the northernmost part of northeast china in

for the period 1952 2012 the ordinal regression model is employed to model the relationship between enso and multiple categories of cdhes which is then used for the probabilistic prediction of cdhes based on the leave one out cross validation loocv the prediction performance of different categories of cdhes for 1 month to 6 month lead time is evaluated results show skillful prediction can be achieved for a large portion of regions over northeast china particularly in august the case study of predicting the cdhes during 1975 shows useful early warning information for several months ahead

4223,forecasting change in sediment transport using global climate model ensembles is under developed in the hydrology community due to a lack of knowledge regarding the variance structure of predictions we investigate the uncertainty of forecast sediment transport from sources including global climate model realizations global climate model ensemble design forecasted hydrologic inputs and hydrologic modeling parameterizations we then forecast sediment transport for the gently rolling watershed in kentucky usa contrary to past research forecasting hydrology with global climate models hydrologic model parameterization was the most significant source of variance impacting forecasted sediment transport variables forecast of sediment transport responses shows the propagation of uncertainty from the hydrologic model parameterization was over two times greater than the uncertainty from the selected global climate model realizations this result emphasizes researchers focused on forecasting sediment transport with global climate models may need to give as much or more consideration to their water sediment linkages as climate water sediment linkages hydrologic inputs from climate change including forecast precipitation temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed impacted sediment transport considering changes in precipitation and temperature alone under predicts streamflow and sediment transport by 49 and 35 respectively compared to including all meteorological variables inputs variance introduced across the three different global climate model ensembles was a relatively small source of variance impacting forecasted streamflow or sediment yield the results suggest a quantitative effort by the researcher to design the global climate model ensemble by considering representativeness historical performance and independency will lead to robust results ensemble average forecasts forecast streamflow and sediment yield to increase by 19 and 14 respectively for the lowland watershed the sediment transport forecasts reflect the shear limited landscape of the watershed and the transport limited conditions in the stream channel keywords

projecting the change in future climate global climate model gcm ensembles provide an approach to input climate variables to hydrologic modeling for forecasting sediment transport gcm forecasts physically account for changing climate variables and these variables are useful in sediment transport models for predicting sediment loadings that could disrupt ecosystems or fill reservoirs robust forecasts will allow watershed managers to avert problems before they occur with these applications in mind we advance sediment transport research by investigating gcm projections through water and sediment models the variance structure associated with the simulations and sediment processes and their connectivity in a basin recently a number of hydrology research studies couple gcm projections with sediment transport modeling see table 1 bussi et al 2016 used climate scenarios by changing precipitation and temperature to predict sediment loads in the river thames catchment united kingdom gould et al 2016 used climate scenarios and their precipitation and temperature results to study runoff erosion in northern rocky mountains united states shrestha et al 2016 shrestha et al 2018 used precipitation and temperature from multiple gcms multiple emission scenarios and sets of model parameters to investigate sediment load predictions and reservoir sedimentation in the mekong river basin laos wallace et al 2017 used multiple gcms results of precipitation temperature and solar radiation to project sediment transport rates at three spatial scales in indiana united states yu et al 2017 used climate scenarios from three gcms to project sediment discharge due to changing precipitation and temperature in the upper yellow river basin china giri et al 2019 applied multipole gcms to project impacts of climate and land use change on the sediment production in neshanic river watershed new jersey usa loiselle et al 2020 used two climate scenarios to study the change in sediment and total organic carbon in elbow river watershed in alberta canada mukundan et al 2020 applied multiple gcm projections to study the impact of climate on nutrient and sediment loadings in the new york city water supply watershed united states wang et al 2020 applied gcm projections to study climate change impacts on the riverbed wetland topography and ecology in yarlung zangbo brahmaputra river china the recent studies predict sediment flux in a changing climate throughout the world and advance the technology of model coupling however sources of variance impacting projected sediment transport has been understudied despite the fact that the variance structure can be conceptualized see fig 1 table 1 reviews sources of variance when projecting sediment transport with gcms and these sources of variance include gcm model realizations gcm ensemble selection hydrology inputs and hydrologic model parameterization only gcm model realization has been widely considered in previous studies and other variance sources were rarely investigated all previous studies consider the source of variance termed gcm model realizations meaning multiple gcms with one or more downscaling methods and emission scenarios were input to show sets of sediment modeling results the realization of gcm and its climate modeling factors e g gcm type and model version emission scenario downscaling method and bias correction technique are well reported to impact hydrologic predictions due to underlying structure and assumptions of individual gcms as well as dynamic or statistical methods when post processing gcm results tu 2009 sheshukov et al 2011 harding et al 2012 chen et al 2013 al mukhtar et al 2014 neupane and kumar 2015 al aamery et al 2016 al aamery et al 2018 for this reason gcm model realization is considered a prominent source of variance impacting sediment transport predictions the set of gcm realizations chosen to include in gcm ensembles is the source of variance termed gcm ensemble selection many choices of gcms are available but gcms may be highly correlated with one another or poorly suited for the basin studied gcm ensemble selection procedures have been developed by climate scientists for choosing a set of gcms as a function of model historical performance future climate uncertainty and model independency mendlik and gobiet 2016 lee and kim 2017 pechlivanidis et al 2018 gcm ensemble selection has not been investigated previously to our knowledge as a source of variance in sediment transport forecasts see column 4 table 1 hydrologic variables that change in a future climate that are output from gcms and input to hydrology models is the source of variance termed hydrology inputs gcm projections suggest precipitation temperature relative humidity net radiation and wind speed all may change substantially in the future mcvicar et al 2012 wild 2009 willett et al 2008 al aamery et al 2018 however many previous studies only consider precipitation and temperature inputs to sediment transport models because these variables are assumed the main drivers for changing future hydrology al aamery et al 2016 mejia et al 2012 chien et al 2013 brekke et al 2013 changes in relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed might also shift future sediment transport and these sources of variance have not been considered previously to our knowledge see column five table 1 the set of parameters chosen or calibrated in hydrologic models is the source of variance termed hydrologic model parameterization parameterization of a hydrology model is well recognized as a source of variance impacting streamflow and sediment transport e g moriasi et al 2007 however the importance of hydrologic model parameterization has been marginalized to some degree when forecasting streamflow with gcms niraula et al 2015 al aamery et al 2018 only a few studies consider this source of variance previously see column six table 1 this paper provides methods and results for decomposing the variance from the four mentioned sources to gain understanding of their relative importance on sediment transport predictions knowledge of the most sensitive linkages in projections can provide insight to where river managers should invest their resources when making forecasts knowledge of the variance structure can also provide the most important areas of future research collaboration between climate researchers and hydrologic researchers another contribution of this paper is gcm projection through a sediment transport model formulated with sediment connectivity theory seven previous studies used the semi distributed modified universal soil loss equation musle embedded in the soil water assessment tool swat to predict sediment transport with gcms and three previous studies used distributed sediment transport models see column seven tab 1 no previous studies to our knowledge used sediment connectivity based models with gcms sediment connectivity is defined as an emergent system property reflecting the continuity and magnitude of sediment linkages within geomorphologic compartments during a given time period heckmann et al 2018 given the increase in availability of high resolution geospatial data the ability to simulate explicit sediment pathways with sediment connectivity approaches has become increasingly plausible and has been shown to improve understanding and simulation of sediment processes e g vigiak et al 2012 heckmann et al 2018 mahoney et al 2020a mahoney et al 2020b wu et al 2020 an attractive feature of the sediment connectivity approach is explicitly representing these pathways which is underdeveloped in semi distributed and fully distributed sediment models mahoney et al 2020a several features of sediment connectivity modeling make it a potentially advantageous approach for coupling with gcms first mahoney et al 2018 found sediment connectivity modeling overcomes spatial limitations of semi distributed conceptual models such as musle by grounding the model in physical equations and estimating sediment transport at the raster cell scale second connectivity simulations first predict the spatial domain most likely contributing sediment to the river and in turn provide reduced computational complexity of fully distributed sediment prediction mahoney et al 2018 third several researchers have shown sediment connectivity models can highlight hotspots of sediment production which ultimately improves decision making when analyzing sediment forecasts e g vigiak et al 2012 heckmann et al 2018 mahoney et al 2018 husic et al 2020 fourth sediment connectivity captures the morphometry of the basin because parameters associated with watersheds shape size and gradient are spatially explicit in connectivity formula dikpal et al 2017 mahajan and sivakumar 2018 sediment connectivity modeling allows prediction of the sediment processes occurring in a basin under changing climate conditions the potential controlling sediment transport process are many see fig 2 including soil erosion and transport across the landscape erosion of bed and bank sediment in the stream corridor redistribution and sediment deposition throughout the basin and sediment flux leaving the watershed the relative importance of these processes reflects the system s net behavior as shear transport or source limited and the aggrading or degrading condition of the river network questions remain as to a system s net behavior and in turn response under future climates for example gcm projections suggest wet temperate regions of the world will experience higher rain and snowfall higher humidity more cloud cover and lower wind speed over the next century melillo et al 2014 mcvicar et al 2012 wild 2009 willett et al 2008 al aamery et al 2016 these climate changes are suggested to in turn shift the hydrologic cycle to produce higher runoff and higher streamflow in wet temperate watersheds al aamery et al 2018 however this net impact on a system s behavior as shear transport or source limited remains under discussed in the hydrology community the objectives of this study were to i investigate the uncertainty structure of sediment transport fluxes impacted by numerous sources of variance when projecting with gcms ii investigate forecasted changes in specific soil erosion and sediment transport processes found from sediment connectivity modeling and iii provide results of a net climate change impact on a system s behavior as shear transport or source limited for a basin located in a wet temperate region 2 study site and materials the upper south elkhorn watershed fig 3 located in the kentucky river basin kentucky usa has been selected for this study the watershed area is 61 7 km2 the average slope is 5 3 and the elevation ranges from 255 m to 324 m asl urban lands dominate the watershed land use with 47 followed by agricultural lands with 38 4 and forest with 14 6 the watershed is characterized as mild sloped with gently rolling hills the soil is mainly silt loam the floodplains are long and flat and the stream channel is bedrock controlled with fluvial deposits throughout russo and fox 2012 mahoney et al 2018 upland erosion is mainly a contribution of rill and ephemeral gully erosion and in stream sediment transport includes bank erosion bed erosion and sediment deposition the karst development in this watershed is minimal immature and therefore fluvial processes dominate the system mahoney et al 2018 the total annual precipitation and average daily temperature in the watershed are 1120 mm and 13 04 c respectively the relative humidity ranges from 61 4 to 85 2 the solar radiation is 16 75 w m2 and the average wind speed is 4 1 m s 1 we have extensive experience in this watershed over the past 15 years including collecting data and numerical modeling development and application russo and fox 2012 mahoney et al 2018 mahoney et al 2019 al aamery et al 2016 materials used in this study include publicly available gcm results and previously developed hydrologic and sediment transport models we used gcm results from different projects different gcms different downscaling methods and different emission scenarios surface and stream hydrology was modeled using the soil water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 the upper land erosion was modeled using the lateral watershed connectivity model developed by mahoney et al 2018 the sediment transport in the stream corridor was modeled using the numerical modeling developed by russo and fox 2012 coupled with swat and the upland connectivity model by mahoney et al 2019 3 methods an overview of the method is shown in fig 4 our approach was to permeate the model selection criterions to select representative subsets of gcms then we used swat to simulate the hydrologic conditions of the watershed where we extracted the results of streamflow surface runoff depth and daily curve number swat extracted results have been used in our process based connectivity and instream sediment transport models surface runoff and daily curve number results are inputs to the upland connectivity based model that produces sediment results to the stream channel then the instream sediment model simulate the sediment processes in the stream corridor and calculate sediment yield intermediate steps include bias correction of climate data and variance estimation the steps follow in the next sub sections and the set of equations used in modelling is presented in the appendix detailed steps of evaluation are presented in the online supplementary material 3 1 select ensembles of gcms model selection is the design of a subset of climate scenarios from the original set of gcm covering a large set of model types project versions emission scenarios and downscaling methods mendlik and gobiet 2016 pechlivanidis et al 2018 lee and kim 2017 in this study a full list of all gcms used is shown in table a in the supplementary information file we used gcm results from the coupled model intercomparison project phase three cmip3 and phase five cmip5 the north american climate change assessment program narccap and the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex projects with varying emission scenarios two downscaling methods i e statistical and dynamic were used in total we used 57 scenarios for the hindcast period 1981 2000 and 131 scenarios for the forecast period 2046 2065 our design of different gcm ensembles considered model representativeness acceptable historical performance independency and clustering of downscaling methods feenstra et al 1998 salathé et al 2007 evans et al 2014 vano et al 2015 lee and kim 2017 representativeness is an indication of the coverage of future uncertainty by considering to some worthwhile extent the low and high ends of the results we adopted the approach presented by salathé et al 2007 to select gcms from scenarios spanning future uncertainty estimated with annual precipitation and temperature changes historical performance or validity is a measure of how well the model regenerates observations we adopted the approach of recent studies bishop and abramowitz 2013 using the covariance matrix to measure historical performance because climate models are in many circumstances sharing structures and emission parameterizations there is a broad notion they may not provide independent results evans et al 2014 we adopted the covariance measure approach to rank models independency bishop and abramowitz 2013 clustering refers to equally balancing one or more design factors we considered clustering as a function of downscaling due to the pronounced differences between the methods and their perceived importance in gcm ensembles warner 2011 al aamery et al 2016 chirivella osma et al 2016 jang and kavvas 2015 qiao et al 2014 we created and tested three ensemble designs design 1 clustered based on downscaling method where we split the data into two parts the first part is from the dynamically downscaling while the second part is from the statistical downscaling design 1 applied the quantitative methods for representativeness historical performance and independency designs 2 and 3 did not cluster while design 2 applied methods for representativeness historical performance and independency design 3 used methods of representativeness and historical performance only we carried out the ensemble design and its evaluation by carrying out cluster analyses for design 1 calculating the model weights to assess historical performance and independency and evaluating the design using the entropy measure we used k mean clustering and applied the davies bouldin criterion to find the optimum number of clusters with a package in matlab 2017b software davies bouldin 1979 wu 2012 cannon et al 2015 we ranked the gcms using the model weights bishop and abramowitz 2013 then we evaluated representativeness with the maximum entropy me measure lee and kim 2017 3 2 perform bias correction we performed bias correction using quantile mapping methods given their ability to outperform other methods for the gcm problem gudmundsson et al 2012 teutschbein and seibert 2012 chen et al 2013 mapping methods use the characteristics of the whole probability distributions of hindcast forecast and observation data to correct the biases in the forecasted period both parametric and non parametric mapping approaches were argued for their superiority in some cases boe et al 2007 cannon et al 2015 switanek et al 2017 therefore we applied and evaluated both parametric and non parametric approaches for our study including scaled distribution mapping sdm quantile mapping qm and quantile delta mapping qdm we carried out the parametric sdm method by performing seven steps including setting a threshold fitting the probability function calculating of scaling factor calculating the recurrence interval adjusting the recurrence interval calculating initial results and calculating of final results by placing the bias corrected values in their original location in the time series switancek et al 2017 we tested the goodness of fit via the chi square test for every dataset individually and selected the best distribution from several distributions tested we used distribution fitter algorithm through matlab 2017b for probability fittings the probability distributions examined for each selected climate realization include birnbaum saunders burr exponential extreme value gamma generalized extreme value inverse gaussian log logistic logistic lognormal nakagami normal rayleigh rician t location scale and weibul in general we found gamma and weibull distributions fit well modeled and observed precipitation however not all modeled data were well fitted by any of the above distributions we carried out non parametric qm and qdm following the steps in boe et al 2007 and cannon et al 2015 respectively since some values of future scenarios may exceed the values of the corresponding variable in the hindcast simulation a constant correction is applied by adopting the last quantile correction boe et al 2007 deque 2007 the qdm method adopts the relative change in quantiles between the historical and future periods a threshold value from the hindcast data was selected to correct the number of rainy days between the simulation and observation data cannon et al 2015 although the whole distribution has been corrected for each data set we tested the bias correction methods performance with respect to their ability to correct the mean value of precipitation and then the maximum value extreme condition of precipitation we have made our choice of the best method based on the method performance in both mean and extreme values note extreme conditions only included in the study in this particular instance and the results of the study in all other instances were based on the mean values of precipitation see table 2 3 3 execute hydrology and sediment transport modeling we modeled with the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 the upland sediment connectivity and erosion model mahoney et al 2018 and the in stream sediment transport model russo and fox 2012 and methods followed from our previous modeling setups and evaluation in the south elkhorn watershed russo and fox 2012 ford and fox 2014 al aamery et al 2016 2018 mahoney et al 2018 2019 we performed one calibration period over 2006 2010 then we did two validation periods the first one over 2011 2013 and the second one over 1983 1992 although the historical period extends over 1981 2000 but we were limited by the availability of continuous flow observations i e over 1983 1992 the period 2004 2005 was considered as a warming up period for the hydrological model swat we used this scheme of model calibration and validation periods because of the availability of climate results and the availability of sediment observations that we were collecting over the past 15 years in the study site system see fox et al 2010 russo and fox 2012 ford and fox 2014 mahoney et al 2019 calibration data for streamflow was available at usgs 03 289 000 gaging station the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm through swat cup was used to execute calibration sensitivity and uncertainty analyses abbaspour et al 2007 abbaspour 2008 300 simulations were considered for each set of simulations the initial parameter ranges were adjusted several times before reaching a relatively large number of accepted simulations to address the uncertainty space sediment connectivity model for upland erosion we applied a probability based sediment connectivity model coupled with physically based erosion equations to quantify actively eroding upland surfaces and sediment flux connected to the stream corridor the model was developed by mahoney et al 2018 for a gently rolling system which coincides with the system considered in this study several processes theorized to control sediment transport in the gently rolling system are formulated in the model including sediment supply hydraulic and non hydraulic detachment upstream and downstream transport and the presence of buffers which impede lateral sediment transport fryirs et al 2007 fryirs 2013 each process is formulated as an individual probability for spatial units within the watershed the likelihood of each process occurring within a spatial unit is calculated using intersecting probabilities and spatial units in which each process is likely to occur are considered to be connected as 1 p c p s p d h d n h p t h t n h 1 p b where p c is the probability of connectivity p s is the probability of sediment supply p d h is the probability of hydrologic detachment of sediment p d nh is the probability of non hydrologic detachment of sediment p t h is the probability of hydrologic transport of sediment p t nh is the probability of non hydrologic transport of sediment and p b is the probability that a buffer impeding sediment transport is located within a spatial unit each process is parameterized using threshold based boolean equation where a probability of zero or one is used to represent that a process likely occurs within a geospatial cell cells that are predicted to be connected e g p c 1 are coupled with physically based erosion formulae and the erosion on the active contributing area is integrated across the catchment to predict sediment yield entering the stream network inputs to the model include high resolution geospatial data results of surface flow and soil moisture from external hydrologic modelling field observations and erosion formulae an ensemble of field reconnaissance remote sensing sediment concentration samples and turbidity sensor data was used to evaluate the model and increased confidence in the model results modeling framework and formulation as well as detailed presentation for the model in this system can be found in mahoney et al 2018 when calculating upland sediment connectivity we found a computational constraint when extending the probability estimates for each 1 5 m cell of the 62 km2 watershed to over a million days needed for gcm ensemble modeling of hydrology to overcome the constraint an artificial neural network ann was used to estimate the number of connected cells as a function of overland surface flow depth and the daily curve number we used the multilayer perceptron structure through the spss software ibm corporation 2012 with one input layer one hidden layer with randomly generated nodes and one output layer for the response the hyperbolic tangent function was used for the input and output layers we randomly generated portioning swinging around 70 for training 10 for testing and 20 for validating the model the sediment transport in the stream corridor was modeled using the numerical modeling developed by russo and fox 2012 and improved upon by ford and fox 2014 and mahoney et al 2019 the instream sediment transport model s inputs are the flow variables the physical characteristics of the stream channel and the upland sediment simulated by the upland sediment connectivity model the volumetric flow rate is calculated by swat and the stream channel characteristics are mentioned in mahoney et al 2019 the model considers the sediment storage budget in the streambed and the surficial fine grained lamina sfgl layer the model also considers the simulation of sediment transport deposition erosion and exchange factor in the stream for all suspended sediment see section 4 2 in mahoney et al 2019 the erosion and deposition are considered mutually exclusive in a single time step however an equilibrium exchange factor is included to account for additional erosion and deposition of bed and water column sediment sediment model calibration and validation were carried out using sediment data collected with teledyne isco automated pump samplers at two locations in the watershed to collect storm event measurements when sediment transport occurs mahoney et al 2019 formulation of the sediment model equations is provided in mahoney et al 2019 and presented in the appexdix 3 4 test how hydrologic inputs from climate change impact sediment transport we tested how hydrologic inputs from climate change simulation including precipitation temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed impact sediment transport variables and streamflow by constructing different combinations of input variables and comparing their results we used the best performing gcm ensemble bias correction method and hydrologic parameters when assessing how the hydrologic inputs may control sediment forecasts precipitation and temperature results were available for all gcm realizations the change in relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed due to climate change was input following the results of al aamery et al 2018 which was developed following the method of others mcvicar et al 2012 wild 2009 willett et al 2008 we tend to be pessimistic in the prediction of windspeed surface solar radiation and relative humidity based on the mcvicar et al 2012 study we have used the percent change of wind speed as 17 for the future period in the study region the surface solar radiation was observed to a decadal variation wild 2009 for the future period 2048 2065 considered in this study we have assumed a 15 in the surface solar radiation for the relative humidity willett et al 2008 suggests an increase in the relative humidity for the northern hemisphere due to climate change we assumed the change for the future period in the relative humidity for the study site to be 0 5 a decrease in wind speed and net radiation and an increase in relative humidity could decrease watershed losses through evapotranspiration and in turn increase streamflow we carried out seven combinations of the hydrologic inputs combination 1 includes climate change from hindcast to forecast pairs for all hydrologic inputs combination 2 has only precipitation and temperature and keeps other inputs constant from hindcast to forecast pairs combinations 3 4 5 6 and 7 isolates changes of one hydrologic input at a time to see their relative impact on the response variables 3 5 quantify the variance structure for sediment transport we quantify the variance structure for forecasting sediment transport with gcms including the sources of variance associated with the stages of modelling see fig 1 gcm model realizations includes variance from emission scenarios i e spatial report on emission scenarios sres and representative concentration pathways rcps gcm choice such as canadian global climate model cgcm3 and the national center for atmospheric research community climate model ccsm3 version within a climate modeling phase project i e cmip3 or cmip5 and the downscaling method i e dynamical or statistical downscaling gcm ensemble selection includes selecting subsets from the whole set of climate realization that satisfy three criterions representativeness validity and independency hydrology inputs includes method used the set of meteorological variables included in the hydrology model hydrological model parameterization includes different sets of parameterizations that all provide acceptable streamflow simulation in this manner swat cup through sufi 2 algorithm was set for 13 parameters to calibrate the swat model for the period 2006 2010 see table 5 swat cup results in acceptable range for each parameter r2 0 6 we have selected 25 sets from the resultant ranges to study the uncertainty raised from the swat mode parameterizations to predict streamflow and sediment transport processes variance of factors is considered independently as well as cumulatively through the simulations in addition combined impact of the factors is considered through selection of ensemble sets and model interactions propagation of uncertainty for gcm realization and hydrologic model parameterization is estimated together assuming the factors can be treated as independent random variables following the method of moore and kirkland 2007 4 results and discussion 4 1 select ensembles of gcms results of the model selection method provided three gcm ensemble designs with different sets of gcms across statistical downscaling and dynamic downscaling projects see table 2 and fig 5 and tables a b c and d and figures a and b in supplementary material design 2 showed the best choice for a gcm ensemble due to its highest value of the maximum entropy measure while still considering model representativeness historical performance and independency results shown in table 2 tend to marginalize the importance of balancing gcm ensembles with equal representation of statistical and dynamic downscaling design 1 clustered gcms so some of the realizations would be associated with statistical downscaling and some would be associated with dynamic downscaling design 1 resulted in the lowest maximum entropy measure researchers have suggested the importance of including gcms downscaled with both statistical and dynamic approaches however the ensemble design results for design 1 somewhat marginalize this idea the best performing ensemble design 2 has only 4 dynamic downscaled gcms out of 15 total gcms and the second best performing ensemble design 3 has only 1 dynamic downscaled gcm out of 15 total gcms results shown in table 2 also tend to marginalize the importance of balancing gcm ensembles across project type none of the results from the design selection method showed a balance of projects for example the results of design 3 that considered representativeness and historical performance showed 11 gcms from cmip5 3 gcms from cmip3 with only one gcm from narccap and none from cordex the ensemble design results highlight the potential for model dependency across projects and the importance of carrying out careful design selection procedures 4 2 perform bias correction model evaluation of the bias correction approaches showed that one approach i e qdm qm or sdm did dominate as best performing approach and each one shows the best results for some gcm realizations however after further inspection of the results we chose the qdm approach as the most appropriate choice for this study for the following reasons first the qdm showed the best performance in the extreme bias correction environment and we considered the extremes of precipitation to have high potential to impact the analysis of sediment transport second the sdm approach required a representative probability distribution function to fit the data due to its parametric nature for some realizations the fitting procedure did not succeed even with testing many different probability density functions for this reason the application of the qdm approach was more practical third the qdm still showed good performance in the mean matrix even when it was not the best performing one as a further discussion an inspection of results indicated for some gcm realizations the sdm and qm methods poorly simulated the differences in extremes between the hindcast and forecast periods see table 3 as mentioned the gamma distribution failed to represent some data sets e g the miroc3 2 medres1 model of cmip3 project for the a1b scenario further investigation of error propagation for this realization showed there was a 50 increase in the maximum value of precipitation when comparing the hindcast and the raw forecast data while sdm showed 5 decrease and qm showed 9 decrease which reflects the deficiency in these methods the sdm and the qm methods underestimated the extreme of precipitation data as another example we further inspected extreme by applying the three methods to the gfdl model of cmip3 project a1b scenario for precipitation the gamma distribution succeeded in representing the modeled data in this realization but qdm outperformed the sdm and qm methods forecast and hindcast model results showed a 38 of increase in maximum precipitation sdm qm and qdm shows 2 9 and 38 respectively even when successfully fit the gamma distribution the parametric approach showed poor performance at its limits in this modeling results recent results have suggested the superiority of the sdm approach however as with any parametric method the prediction is contingent on the ability to fit the data to a known distribution across its means and extremes 4 3 execute hydrology and sediment transport modeling hydrologic and sediment model performance was found adequate for the analyses swat succeeded in simulating the hydrologic condition of the upper south elkhorn watershed see table 4 all statistical matrices considered in the streamflow comparison have provided acceptable values according to moriasi et al 2007 for a daily time step model the acceptable values of the matrices were obtained over the calibration period 2006 2010 and the two validation periods 2011 2013 and 1983 1992 our results agree with past studies that have proven the ability of swat to simulate the hydrologic conditions for this region e g palanisamy and workman 2015 al aamery et al 2016 al aamery et al 2018 mahoney et al 2018 after three executions of the sufi2 algorithm through swat cup each with 300 simulations we reached the acceptable range shown in table 5 for each parameter the acceptable ranges have provided 300 acceptable runs where r2 0 6 which we accept as a reasonable solution space for the hydrological model parameterizations considering maximum and minimum values for each parameter in the acceptable parameter ranges produces 25 sets of parameters that all have acceptable evaluation the sensitivity analysis shows that five of the thirteen parameters were sensitive to the objective function r2 computations the sensitive parameters are according to their importance channel manning roughness ch cn2 groundwater delay time gw delay plant available water content sol awc scs curve number for moisture condition ii cn2 and surface runoff lag coefficient surlag the sensitivity of the cn2 is playing an important role in impacting the number of connected cells in the sediment connectivity model the ann reflected well the upland connectivity component table 6 shows the ann performance for the number of connected cells for each bin for the period 2006 2010 training testing and validating portions of the data have all shown a roughly equal and minimum error of less than 5 which reflects the strong performance for this task ibm corporation 2012 the results also showed the daily surface flowrate has a significantly larger weight than the daily curve number when approximating connected cells in this basin the success of the in stream sediment transport model was also adequate and consistent with mahoney et al 2019 results 4 4 test how hydrologic inputs from climate change impact sediment transport results of testing hydrologic inputs from climate change showed the importance of including all of the variables see table 7 for the analyses we only included the best performing ensemble selection i e design 2 and best performing bias correction method i e qdm the seven combinations show the importance of assessing the climate change impact on precipitation temperature relative humidity and wind speed on streamflow and sediment transport fluxes when using gcm forecasting table 7 the influence of relative humidity changes was minimal i e less than 1 impact on changing the responses the result is particularly noteworthy when comparing combination 1 when all hydrologic variables are changed versus combination 2 when only precipitation and temperature are changed the mean changes in forecasted streamflow are 19 0 and 9 6 for combination 1 and 2 and the mean changes in forecasted sediment discharge are 13 6 and 8 8 for combination 1 and 2 respectively other sediment transport fluxes show similar differences between the two combinations many hydrologic forecasting studies only include precipitation and temperature changes when propagating gcm results through hydrologic models e g fatichi et al 2014 chen et al 2013 mejia 2012 al aamery et al 2016 bussi et al 2016 sherstha et al 2018 giri et al 2019 loiselle et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the results here highlight the importance of considering all hydrologic variables expected to be impacted by climate change the influence of hydrologic variables is shown in table 7 and the offsetting behavior of the variables is evident gcm forecasted changes in precipitation relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed cause increases in streamflow and sediment transport fluxes for this study system in contrast forecasted temperature changes cause a decrease in the variables when allowing the precipitation to be changed 7 42 while keeping all other meteorological variables constants from the observation period the change in streamflow will be 17 25 fig 6 a shows the annual cycle of streamflow change for this scenario in this case the water inputs to the watershed is increased and the watershed outflow must be increased to meet the water budget mass balance of the hydrology equations when allowing only the relative humidity to change by 0 5 willet et al 2008 the streamflow is changing by 0 29 fig 6 c shows the results humidity increase is reversely impacting the losses from the watershed according to penmann montieth equation see neitsch et al 2011 it is obvious that the increase is minimal in our system already humid system and the reason is attributed to the small projected change in humidity the solar radiation is projected to decrease by 12 w m2 in the study region wild 2009 we applied a percent decrease of about 15 for all the data such decrease will cause an increase in streamflow by 4 2 fig 6 d explains the results solar radiation has a direct relationship with the evaporation according to penman monteith equation accordingly water losses from the watershed is decreasing as the solar radiation is projected to increase and the associated water flow exiting the system is increased the literature indicated that wind speed is projected to decrease in the middle of the century the amount of decrease is 0 5 m s in the study area mcvicar et al 2012 we applied a percent decrease of 17 to all generated daily value to examine the sensitivity of the wind speed on the flow results al aamery et al 2018 the results shows 2 54 increase in streamflow see fig 6 e similarly to solar radiation the wind speed decrease is lowering system losses and the flow is increased as a result if only the temperature is allowed to change 2 58 c the change in streamflow will be 8 19 the annual cycle of streamflow in this scenario is shown in fig 6 b here the water loss through evaporation would be increasing as a results of increasing the temperature despite the individual impact of some variables being small the combined impact of the change in relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed on the watershed hydrology and sedimentation shifts water and sediment flux by 49 19 9 6 19 and 35 13 6 8 8 13 6 respectively see fig 6 f g and table 7 4 5 quantify the variance structure for sediment transport the forecasted streamflow and sediment transport variance is somewhat impacted by all uncertainty sources considered table 8 gcm realization and hydrologic inputs dominate streamflow variance and gcm realization hydrologic inputs and hydrologic model parameterization dominate forecasted sediment yield variance the influence of gcm realizations on forecasted sediment yield variance was not surprising many previous studies showed gcm type and the emission scenario of the gcm are essential sources of uncertainty when forecasting hydrology with gcms brekke et al 2013 ahn et al 2016 al aamery et al 2016 al aamery et al 2018 hoan et al 2018 the reason is due to the parameterizations and internal structure of the different gcms and the objective by which the emission scenarios are constructed brekke et al 2013 uncertainty from the gcms propagates through the streamflow model and then through the sediment transport model adding variance to the forecasted sediment yield therefore gcm choice and type are important sources of uncertainty for both forecasted streamflow and sediment transport hydrologic input source was an intermediate source of variance and the influence of hydrologic inputs as a source of variance to forecasted sediment yield was somewhat surprising this is especially true considering most previous studies in the peer reviewed literature consider the impact of only precipitation and temperature changes from gcms the uncertainty in table 8 reflects calculations from table 7 results when considering precipitation and temperature changes only compared to climate changes from precipitation temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed and we discussed these results in section 4 4 for comparison results show the choice of the hydrologic inputs is an intermediate source of variance for both forecasted streamflow and sediment transport and this variance source should be more closely considered in future work most surprising result to our group was the influence of hydrologic model parameterization as a source of variance to forecasted sediment yield this uncertainty source produced a sediment yield ensemble uncertainty over two times greater than the uncertainty from gcm type and emission scenario this is notable considering hydrologic model parameterization was the smallest source of uncertainty for streamflow further the high uncertainty for sediment transport was found for all sediment fluxes considered in modeling see fig 7 including forecasted upland erosion flux bed and bank erosion flux deposition and sediment exchange as well as sediment yield we investigated further the watershed modeling variance from the ensemble of hydrologic model parameterizations by inspecting variation across the ensemble at sub catchment fluxes and stream reach fluxes at single time steps we found the greatest amount of flux variation from realization to realization occurring at the linkage between the swat output and the upland sediment connectivity model for landscape erosion at this linkage variance propagated from swat could adjust the active areas in which sediment pathways are connected leading to substantially increased or decreased upland erosion flux hydrologic model parameterization as a relatively small source of variance for forecasted streamflow is found here nevertheless in forecasted sediment yield variance propagations result in the largest variance source arising from hydrologic parameterization the results emphasize hydrology researchers focused on forecasting sediment transport may need to give as much consideration to their water sediment linkages as climate water sediment linkages represented in their models variance introduced across the three different gcm ensembles was a relatively small source of variance impacting forecasted streamflow or sediment yield see table 8 to this point we highlight that all three model selection methods were quantitative in their designs we find the choice of quantitative model selection criteria shows some convergence of forecasted change in precipitation streamflow and sediment fluxes precipitation increases for forecasts relative to current conditions were 6 7 and 10 increases for model selection design 1 2 and 3 respectively see table 9 forecasted streamflow increases were 21 20 and 28 increases relative to current conditions for model selection design 1 2 and 3 forecasted sediment yield increases were 9 14 and 14 increases for design 1 2 and 3 respectively these differences between designs are non zero but are small relative to differences between some individual realizations at the same time we point out the model selection design methods were quantitative and considered each gcms representativeness historical performance and independency albeit design 3 did not consider independency the results suggest a quantitative effort by the researcher towards a model selection design considering representativeness historical performance and independency will lead to a robust ensemble for hydrologic modeling qualitative model selection procedures are becoming more common in the hydrology applications of gcm results our work supports this effort to arrive at a more robust solution space further discussion of uncertainty propagation from hydrologic parameterization and gcm realization is carried out in the context of the broader literature the importance of uncertainty from hydrologic parametrization on streamflow forecasting in gcm studies remains an open topic and a number of studies marginalize the importance of hydrologic parametrization on streamflow while other studies show the importance of hydrologic parameterization on specific hydrologic variables e g soil moisture in the context of gcm projection no studies to our knowledge report that the uncertainty from hydrological parameterization is greater than that from gcm realizations when projecting streamflow niraula et al 2015 used calibrated and un calibrated swat models and showed that the choice of hydrologic parameter sets had almost no impact on the net change in hydrologic response of the basin al aamery et al 2018 used swat modelling and showed that variance of forecasted streamflow from hydrologic parameterization was two orders of magnitude smaller than variance introduced from gcm realization thompson et al 2013 studied the uncertainty raised from the hydrological model to simulate streamflow by using three hydrological models mike she slurp and mac pdm 09 and two sets of gcm scenarios were applied the uncertainty introduced from the hydrological model was evidenced but smaller than the uncertainty associated with the gcm choice her et al 2019 showed that the uncertainty originated from the gcm choice is greater than the uncertainty from multi parameter ensemble of hydrological modeling when simulating the impact of climate change on streamflow therefore their study suggested that more emphasis for the choice of the gcm should be considered her et al 2019 also showed that the prediction of soil moisture and the groundwater stage had the greatest uncertainty associated with the hydrological parameterization bae et al 2011 used three semi distributed hydrologic models with different formula for evapotranspiration and 39 gcms to assess the climate change impact on runoff their results indicated that the choice of the hydrologic model and can induce a major uncertainty in the same climate scenario for runoff predictions these results agree with the present study because we showed that uncertainty from hydrologic parameterization had nearly equal impact on surface runoff as uncertainty from gcm realizations and uncertainty from hydrologic parameterization was larger than that of uncertainty from gcm realizations when considering variations of the daily curve number in swat figs 8 and 9 taken together this study s results and the literature review suggests uncertainty from gcms dominates over uncertainty from hydrologic parameterization when only streamflow is considered but uncertainty from hydrologic parameterization can be as important as gcm choice when hydrologic responses such as soil moisture runoff and groundwater stage no studies to our knowledge report the uncertainty from hydrologic parameterization and gcm realization on sediment transport forecasting in this study the uncertainty raised from the hydrological model parameterizations was larger than that associated with gcm uncertainty when assessing the relative error of sediment transport response variables figs 7 and 8 the reason is attributed to the specific hydrologic responses in swat that impact upland erosion and sediment transport as mentioned uncertainty from hydrologic parameterization had an equal impact and greater impact than gcms when considering surface runoff and daily curve number in swat respectively the interaction of surface runoff depth and soil moisture conditions impacting the daily curve number were shown to have the greatest influence on predicting geospatial cells in modelling as connected or disconnected in terms of sediment transport connectivity mahoney et al 2018 for this reason the sediment connectivity modelling was sensitive to the surface runoff simulations and showed greater uncertainty of results attributed to the hydrologic parameterization as compared to gcm realization figs 8 and 9 taken together the results of this study her et al 2019 and bae et al 2011 suggest that hydrologic parameterization could become a more important source of uncertainty than gcm realization when projecting surface runoff and soil moisture conditions and in turn sediment transport variables we assessed the combined impact of gcm realization and hydrologic model parameterization on uncertainty propagation through the water and sediment transport modelling fig 9 in general the net increase in uncertainty of responses is shown from gcm modelling of precipitation to hydrologic modelling of water variables to sediment transport modelling of sediment connectivity and sediment flux results uncertainty of responses is greatest for predicting the sediment connectivity of geospatial cells with approximately 100 m2 drainage area the uncertainty of the sediment connectivity occurs due to the interaction of surface runoff depth and soil moisture variance from hydrologic parameterization this uncertainty propagates through the sediment transport modelling to produce greater error associated with hydrologic parameterization as compared to gcm realization when projecting sediment transport coupling sediment connectivity modelling within watershed erosion and sediment transport model forecasts remains an emerging area of sediment transport mahoney et al 2018 mahoney et al 2020b mahoney et al 2021 the propagation of uncertainty analyses illustrates the importance in considerations of connectivity and its variance when the modelling framework is used with gcm ensembles 4 6 forecast of sediment transport for the lowland watershed the forecast of sediment transport via gcms for the lowland watershed studied in general predict increases in sediment fluxes based on ensemble averaging see fig 8 the annual sediment flux increases are in agreement with annual increases in streamflow forecasted streamflow and sediment yield are predicted to increase by approximately 19 and 14 respectively on annual average see table 8 design 2 and fig 8 we qualify the ensemble averages and uncertainty in table 8 sediment forecast considers the best performing models in evaluation including model selection design 2 qdm bias correction method and the hydrologic model simulation with the best evaluation metrics forecast monthly changes created from ensemble averaging also show a similar correlation see fig 10 forecast precipitation streamflow and sediment yield all show increases in similar months of the year regarding intermediate sediment fluxes the forecasted 17 increase in upland soil erosion flux is closest to the forecasted 14 increase in sediment yield see table 8 and fig 8 while sediment deposition and exchange show increases as well although smaller than sediment flux with mean increases of 7 and 5 the behavior of sediment transport at the watershed scale during climate change forecasting reflects the shear transport or source limitations of the landscape and stream channel when considering multi year simulations the dominant source of sediment to the watershed outlet is upland surface erosion for the south elkhorn creek watershed occurring in rills and gullies mahoney et al 2018 mahoney et al 2019 for this reason the watershed behavior becomes shear limited in multi year simulations this is true for the nearly two decade hindcast and two decade forecast periods forecasted increase in water flux across the uplands produces increases in rill depth and gully depth across the channels of the uplands increased rill and gully depths increase excess shear and resulted in greater upland erosion flux we further investigated intermediate upland fluxes for our ensemble design 2 and we found annual increases of upland runoff depth equal to 16 7 15 3 this approximately 17 average increase in runoff corresponds well with the 17 increase in upland sediment flux and the 14 increase in sediment load at the watershed outlet in the south elkhorn creek dampening of the upland sediment flux as a function of in stream sediment transport processes did occur appreciably which again reflects sediment transport limitations of the system the lack of substantial differences between the upland erosion flux and sediment yield at the outlet is attributed to the stream being transport limited russo and fox 2012 the sediment transport carrying capacity of the flow is most often reflected with streampower or some associated derivative thereof and streampower is linearly related to water discharge tc q where tc is transport capacity as streampower bagnold 1966 therefore for the multi year results the increased sediment transport capacity can eventually transport the increased sediment loading from the uplands out of the watershed this is not necessarily true for individual storm events and this result is reflected in the increased deposition and bed water sediment exchange fluxes see fig 8 the stream can become transport limited during high rainfall events due to its low stream gradient and relatively high upland sediment loading can deposit to the bed during these times russo and fox 2012 the deposits are not expected to decrease multi year sediment yields estimates because our previous field and modeling results of this system suggest streamflow from moderate rainfall events is sediment starved and erodes the temporary in stream deposits russo and fox 2012 mahoney et al 2019 we qualify the source limits of the south elkhorn creek were assumed stationary for our present conditions and forecasts it is possible that landuse conversion i e increased area of impervious surfaces could shift source limits from now to the future period however dynamic land cover was not considered in this study and landscape source limits for each 1 5 m upland cell and stream source limits for extent of exposed bedrock stream were static following the estimates in mahoney et al 2019 shear transport or source limitations of the landscape and stream channel and their influence on climate change forecasting of sediment transport were not extensively studied in previous journal articles so we are not able to provide an extensive comparison for previous studies we found in general a dampening of forecasted changes in sediment transport variables relative to streamflow changes for example studies show forecasted percent increases in streamflow are matched with much small percent increases in sediment variables or even zero change or negative changes in sediment variables johnson et al 2015 nerantzaki et al 2015 wagena et al 2016 direct comparison with our sediment flux results is difficult because the previous studies often focus on concentration changes nevertheless dampened sediment transport changes relative to increased streamflow may reflect a shear limited condition for the river network invoking continuity roughness formula and momentum produces a low order dependence of fluid shear stress on streamflow i e τf qc where τf is the fluid shear stress for a wide channel and c is 0 6 and 0 67 for manning s and darch weisbach roughness formula respectively the low order dependence dampens sediment transport as a function of streamflow for the shear limited case future research might further investigate climate change forecasts of sediment transport as a function of the shear transport or source limitations of the landscape and stream channel 5 conclusion the conclusion of this paper is as follows 1 model evaluation results show the gcm model selection procedure based on model representativeness historical performance independency and lack of additional clustering for the downscaling approach provided the best ensemble design model evaluation of bias correction approaches showed quantile delta mapping outperformed scaled distribution mapping and quantile mapping in this study hydrologic and sediment model performance was found adequate for the analyses 2 results of testing hydrologic inputs from climate change on sediment transport and streamflow showed the importance of including forecasted changes in precipitation temperature relative humidity and wind speed the hydrologic inputs had an offsetting effect and considering changes in precipitation and temperature alone under predicts streamflow and sediment transport by 49 and 35 respectively relative to including all meteorological variables inputs the result is noteworthy given many published studies only consider changes in precipitation and temperature when forecasting hydrologic variables 3 the variance of forecasted sediment transport variables as well as streamflow was somewhat impacted by all uncertainty sources considered including gcm realization hydrologic inputs hydrologic model parameterization and gcm model selection procedures table 8 4 variance decomposition in past research and in this paper marginalizes the importance of hydrologic model parameterization relative to gcm realization when only streamflow forecast is considered but show similar levels of importance for hydrologic parameterization and gcm realization when hydrologic variables such as runoff depth and soil moisture are considered forecast of sediment transport responses shows the propagation of uncertainty from hydrologic model parameterization was over two times greater than the uncertainty from gcm type and emission scenario 36 and 15 respectively the results emphasize hydrology researchers focused on forecasting sediment transport with gcms may need to give as much or more consideration to their water sediment linkages as climate water sediment linkages represented in their forecast models 5 variance introduced across the three different gcm ensemble designs was a relatively small source of variance impacting forecasted streamflow or sediment yield 4 and 3 respectively the results suggest a quantitative effort by the researcher towards a model selection design considering representativeness historical performance and independency will lead to a robust ensemble for hydrologic modeling qualitative model selection procedures are beginning to become more common in the hydrology applications of gcm results our work supports this effort to arrive at a more robust solution space 6 for this study ensemble average forecasts of streamflow and sediment yield are predicted to increase by approximately 12 and 14 respectively the behavior of sediment transport at the watershed scale during climate change forecasts reflects the shear limited landscape of the watershed and the transport limited conditions in the stream channel these behaviors result in a one to one dependence for the landscape and stream including change in upland erosion as a function of runoff depth increase and change in in stream sediment transport as a function of streampower future research might further investigate climate change forecasts of

4223,forecasting change in sediment transport using global climate model ensembles is under developed in the hydrology community due to a lack of knowledge regarding the variance structure of predictions we investigate the uncertainty of forecast sediment transport from sources including global climate model realizations global climate model ensemble design forecasted hydrologic inputs and hydrologic modeling parameterizations we then forecast sediment transport for the gently rolling watershed in kentucky usa contrary to past research forecasting hydrology with global climate models hydrologic model parameterization was the most significant source of variance impacting forecasted sediment transport variables forecast of sediment transport responses shows the propagation of uncertainty from the hydrologic model parameterization was over two times greater than the uncertainty from the selected global climate model realizations this result emphasizes researchers focused on forecasting sediment transport with global climate models may need to give as much or more consideration to their water sediment linkages as climate water sediment linkages hydrologic inputs from climate change including forecast precipitation temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed impacted sediment transport considering changes in precipitation and temperature alone under predicts streamflow and sediment transport by 49 and 35 respectively compared to including all meteorological variables inputs variance introduced across the three different global climate model

projecting the change in future climate global climate model gcm ensembles provide an approach to input climate variables to hydrologic modeling for forecasting sediment transport gcm forecasts physically account for changing climate variables and these variables are useful in sediment transport models for predicting sediment loadings that could disrupt ecosystems or fill reservoirs robust forecasts will allow watershed managers to avert problems before they occur with these applications in mind we advance sediment transport research by investigating gcm projections through water and sediment models the variance structure associated with the simulations and sediment processes and their connectivity in a basin recently a number of hydrology research studies couple gcm projections with sediment transport modeling see table 1 bussi et al 2016 used climate scenarios by changing precipitation and temperature to predict sediment loads in the river thames catchment united kingdom gould et al 2016 used climate scenarios and their precipitation and temperature results to study runoff erosion in northern rocky mountains united states shrestha et al 2016 shrestha et al 2018 used precipitation and temperature from multiple gcms multiple emission scenarios and sets of model parameters to investigate sediment load predictions and reservoir sedimentation in the mekong river basin laos wallace et al 2017 used multiple gcms results of precipitation temperature and solar radiation to project sediment transport rates at three spatial scales in indiana united states yu et al 2017 used climate scenarios from three gcms to project sediment discharge due to changing precipitation and temperature in the upper yellow river basin china giri et al 2019 applied multipole gcms to project impacts of climate and land use change on the sediment production in neshanic river watershed new jersey usa loiselle et al 2020 used two climate scenarios to study the change in sediment and total organic carbon in elbow river watershed in alberta canada mukundan et al 2020 applied multiple gcm projections to study the impact of climate on nutrient and sediment loadings in the new york city water supply watershed united states wang et al 2020 applied gcm projections to study climate change impacts on the riverbed wetland topography and ecology in yarlung zangbo brahmaputra river china the recent studies predict sediment flux in a changing climate throughout the world and advance the technology of model coupling however sources of variance impacting projected sediment transport has been understudied despite the fact that the variance structure can be conceptualized see fig 1 table 1 reviews sources of variance when projecting sediment transport with gcms and these sources of variance include gcm model realizations gcm ensemble selection hydrology inputs and hydrologic model parameterization only gcm model realization has been widely considered in previous studies and other variance sources were rarely investigated all previous studies consider the source of variance termed gcm model realizations meaning multiple gcms with one or more downscaling methods and emission scenarios were input to show sets of sediment modeling results the realization of gcm and its climate modeling factors e g gcm type and model version emission scenario downscaling method and bias correction technique are well reported to impact hydrologic predictions due to underlying structure and assumptions of individual gcms as well as dynamic or statistical methods when post processing gcm results tu 2009 sheshukov et al 2011 harding et al 2012 chen et al 2013 al mukhtar et al 2014 neupane and kumar 2015 al aamery et al 2016 al aamery et al 2018 for this reason gcm model realization is considered a prominent source of variance impacting sediment transport predictions the set of gcm realizations chosen to include in gcm ensembles is the source of variance termed gcm ensemble selection many choices of gcms are available but gcms may be highly correlated with one another or poorly suited for the basin studied gcm ensemble selection procedures have been developed by climate scientists for choosing a set of gcms as a function of model historical performance future climate uncertainty and model independency mendlik and gobiet 2016 lee and kim 2017 pechlivanidis et al 2018 gcm ensemble selection has not been investigated previously to our knowledge as a source of variance in sediment transport forecasts see column 4 table 1 hydrologic variables that change in a future climate that are output from gcms and input to hydrology models is the source of variance termed hydrology inputs gcm projections suggest precipitation temperature relative humidity net radiation and wind speed all may change substantially in the future mcvicar et al 2012 wild 2009 willett et al 2008 al aamery et al 2018 however many previous studies only consider precipitation and temperature inputs to sediment transport models because these variables are assumed the main drivers for changing future hydrology al aamery et al 2016 mejia et al 2012 chien et al 2013 brekke et al 2013 changes in relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed might also shift future sediment transport and these sources of variance have not been considered previously to our knowledge see column five table 1 the set of parameters chosen or calibrated in hydrologic models is the source of variance termed hydrologic model parameterization parameterization of a hydrology model is well recognized as a source of variance impacting streamflow and sediment transport e g moriasi et al 2007 however the importance of hydrologic model parameterization has been marginalized to some degree when forecasting streamflow with gcms niraula et al 2015 al aamery et al 2018 only a few studies consider this source of variance previously see column six table 1 this paper provides methods and results for decomposing the variance from the four mentioned sources to gain understanding of their relative importance on sediment transport predictions knowledge of the most sensitive linkages in projections can provide insight to where river managers should invest their resources when making forecasts knowledge of the variance structure can also provide the most important areas of future research collaboration between climate researchers and hydrologic researchers another contribution of this paper is gcm projection through a sediment transport model formulated with sediment connectivity theory seven previous studies used the semi distributed modified universal soil loss equation musle embedded in the soil water assessment tool swat to predict sediment transport with gcms and three previous studies used distributed sediment transport models see column seven tab 1 no previous studies to our knowledge used sediment connectivity based models with gcms sediment connectivity is defined as an emergent system property reflecting the continuity and magnitude of sediment linkages within geomorphologic compartments during a given time period heckmann et al 2018 given the increase in availability of high resolution geospatial data the ability to simulate explicit sediment pathways with sediment connectivity approaches has become increasingly plausible and has been shown to improve understanding and simulation of sediment processes e g vigiak et al 2012 heckmann et al 2018 mahoney et al 2020a mahoney et al 2020b wu et al 2020 an attractive feature of the sediment connectivity approach is explicitly representing these pathways which is underdeveloped in semi distributed and fully distributed sediment models mahoney et al 2020a several features of sediment connectivity modeling make it a potentially advantageous approach for coupling with gcms first mahoney et al 2018 found sediment connectivity modeling overcomes spatial limitations of semi distributed conceptual models such as musle by grounding the model in physical equations and estimating sediment transport at the raster cell scale second connectivity simulations first predict the spatial domain most likely contributing sediment to the river and in turn provide reduced computational complexity of fully distributed sediment prediction mahoney et al 2018 third several researchers have shown sediment connectivity models can highlight hotspots of sediment production which ultimately improves decision making when analyzing sediment forecasts e g vigiak et al 2012 heckmann et al 2018 mahoney et al 2018 husic et al 2020 fourth sediment connectivity captures the morphometry of the basin because parameters associated with watersheds shape size and gradient are spatially explicit in connectivity formula dikpal et al 2017 mahajan and sivakumar 2018 sediment connectivity modeling allows prediction of the sediment processes occurring in a basin under changing climate conditions the potential controlling sediment transport process are many see fig 2 including soil erosion and transport across the landscape erosion of bed and bank sediment in the stream corridor redistribution and sediment deposition throughout the basin and sediment flux leaving the watershed the relative importance of these processes reflects the system s net behavior as shear transport or source limited and the aggrading or degrading condition of the river network questions remain as to a system s net behavior and in turn response under future climates for example gcm projections suggest wet temperate regions of the world will experience higher rain and snowfall higher humidity more cloud cover and lower wind speed over the next century melillo et al 2014 mcvicar et al 2012 wild 2009 willett et al 2008 al aamery et al 2016 these climate changes are suggested to in turn shift the hydrologic cycle to produce higher runoff and higher streamflow in wet temperate watersheds al aamery et al 2018 however this net impact on a system s behavior as shear transport or source limited remains under discussed in the hydrology community the objectives of this study were to i investigate the uncertainty structure of sediment transport fluxes impacted by numerous sources of variance when projecting with gcms ii investigate forecasted changes in specific soil erosion and sediment transport processes found from sediment connectivity modeling and iii provide results of a net climate change impact on a system s behavior as shear transport or source limited for a basin located in a wet temperate region 2 study site and materials the upper south elkhorn watershed fig 3 located in the kentucky river basin kentucky usa has been selected for this study the watershed area is 61 7 km2 the average slope is 5 3 and the elevation ranges from 255 m to 324 m asl urban lands dominate the watershed land use with 47 followed by agricultural lands with 38 4 and forest with 14 6 the watershed is characterized as mild sloped with gently rolling hills the soil is mainly silt loam the floodplains are long and flat and the stream channel is bedrock controlled with fluvial deposits throughout russo and fox 2012 mahoney et al 2018 upland erosion is mainly a contribution of rill and ephemeral gully erosion and in stream sediment transport includes bank erosion bed erosion and sediment deposition the karst development in this watershed is minimal immature and therefore fluvial processes dominate the system mahoney et al 2018 the total annual precipitation and average daily temperature in the watershed are 1120 mm and 13 04 c respectively the relative humidity ranges from 61 4 to 85 2 the solar radiation is 16 75 w m2 and the average wind speed is 4 1 m s 1 we have extensive experience in this watershed over the past 15 years including collecting data and numerical modeling development and application russo and fox 2012 mahoney et al 2018 mahoney et al 2019 al aamery et al 2016 materials used in this study include publicly available gcm results and previously developed hydrologic and sediment transport models we used gcm results from different projects different gcms different downscaling methods and different emission scenarios surface and stream hydrology was modeled using the soil water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 the upper land erosion was modeled using the lateral watershed connectivity model developed by mahoney et al 2018 the sediment transport in the stream corridor was modeled using the numerical modeling developed by russo and fox 2012 coupled with swat and the upland connectivity model by mahoney et al 2019 3 methods an overview of the method is shown in fig 4 our approach was to permeate the model selection criterions to select representative subsets of gcms then we used swat to simulate the hydrologic conditions of the watershed where we extracted the results of streamflow surface runoff depth and daily curve number swat extracted results have been used in our process based connectivity and instream sediment transport models surface runoff and daily curve number results are inputs to the upland connectivity based model that produces sediment results to the stream channel then the instream sediment model simulate the sediment processes in the stream corridor and calculate sediment yield intermediate steps include bias correction of climate data and variance estimation the steps follow in the next sub sections and the set of equations used in modelling is presented in the appendix detailed steps of evaluation are presented in the online supplementary material 3 1 select ensembles of gcms model selection is the design of a subset of climate scenarios from the original set of gcm covering a large set of model types project versions emission scenarios and downscaling methods mendlik and gobiet 2016 pechlivanidis et al 2018 lee and kim 2017 in this study a full list of all gcms used is shown in table a in the supplementary information file we used gcm results from the coupled model intercomparison project phase three cmip3 and phase five cmip5 the north american climate change assessment program narccap and the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex projects with varying emission scenarios two downscaling methods i e statistical and dynamic were used in total we used 57 scenarios for the hindcast period 1981 2000 and 131 scenarios for the forecast period 2046 2065 our design of different gcm ensembles considered model representativeness acceptable historical performance independency and clustering of downscaling methods feenstra et al 1998 salathé et al 2007 evans et al 2014 vano et al 2015 lee and kim 2017 representativeness is an indication of the coverage of future uncertainty by considering to some worthwhile extent the low and high ends of the results we adopted the approach presented by salathé et al 2007 to select gcms from scenarios spanning future uncertainty estimated with annual precipitation and temperature changes historical performance or validity is a measure of how well the model regenerates observations we adopted the approach of recent studies bishop and abramowitz 2013 using the covariance matrix to measure historical performance because climate models are in many circumstances sharing structures and emission parameterizations there is a broad notion they may not provide independent results evans et al 2014 we adopted the covariance measure approach to rank models independency bishop and abramowitz 2013 clustering refers to equally balancing one or more design factors we considered clustering as a function of downscaling due to the pronounced differences between the methods and their perceived importance in gcm ensembles warner 2011 al aamery et al 2016 chirivella osma et al 2016 jang and kavvas 2015 qiao et al 2014 we created and tested three ensemble designs design 1 clustered based on downscaling method where we split the data into two parts the first part is from the dynamically downscaling while the second part is from the statistical downscaling design 1 applied the quantitative methods for representativeness historical performance and independency designs 2 and 3 did not cluster while design 2 applied methods for representativeness historical performance and independency design 3 used methods of representativeness and historical performance only we carried out the ensemble design and its evaluation by carrying out cluster analyses for design 1 calculating the model weights to assess historical performance and independency and evaluating the design using the entropy measure we used k mean clustering and applied the davies bouldin criterion to find the optimum number of clusters with a package in matlab 2017b software davies bouldin 1979 wu 2012 cannon et al 2015 we ranked the gcms using the model weights bishop and abramowitz 2013 then we evaluated representativeness with the maximum entropy me measure lee and kim 2017 3 2 perform bias correction we performed bias correction using quantile mapping methods given their ability to outperform other methods for the gcm problem gudmundsson et al 2012 teutschbein and seibert 2012 chen et al 2013 mapping methods use the characteristics of the whole probability distributions of hindcast forecast and observation data to correct the biases in the forecasted period both parametric and non parametric mapping approaches were argued for their superiority in some cases boe et al 2007 cannon et al 2015 switanek et al 2017 therefore we applied and evaluated both parametric and non parametric approaches for our study including scaled distribution mapping sdm quantile mapping qm and quantile delta mapping qdm we carried out the parametric sdm method by performing seven steps including setting a threshold fitting the probability function calculating of scaling factor calculating the recurrence interval adjusting the recurrence interval calculating initial results and calculating of final results by placing the bias corrected values in their original location in the time series switancek et al 2017 we tested the goodness of fit via the chi square test for every dataset individually and selected the best distribution from several distributions tested we used distribution fitter algorithm through matlab 2017b for probability fittings the probability distributions examined for each selected climate realization include birnbaum saunders burr exponential extreme value gamma generalized extreme value inverse gaussian log logistic logistic lognormal nakagami normal rayleigh rician t location scale and weibul in general we found gamma and weibull distributions fit well modeled and observed precipitation however not all modeled data were well fitted by any of the above distributions we carried out non parametric qm and qdm following the steps in boe et al 2007 and cannon et al 2015 respectively since some values of future scenarios may exceed the values of the corresponding variable in the hindcast simulation a constant correction is applied by adopting the last quantile correction boe et al 2007 deque 2007 the qdm method adopts the relative change in quantiles between the historical and future periods a threshold value from the hindcast data was selected to correct the number of rainy days between the simulation and observation data cannon et al 2015 although the whole distribution has been corrected for each data set we tested the bias correction methods performance with respect to their ability to correct the mean value of precipitation and then the maximum value extreme condition of precipitation we have made our choice of the best method based on the method performance in both mean and extreme values note extreme conditions only included in the study in this particular instance and the results of the study in all other instances were based on the mean values of precipitation see table 2 3 3 execute hydrology and sediment transport modeling we modeled with the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 the upland sediment connectivity and erosion model mahoney et al 2018 and the in stream sediment transport model russo and fox 2012 and methods followed from our previous modeling setups and evaluation in the south elkhorn watershed russo and fox 2012 ford and fox 2014 al aamery et al 2016 2018 mahoney et al 2018 2019 we performed one calibration period over 2006 2010 then we did two validation periods the first one over 2011 2013 and the second one over 1983 1992 although the historical period extends over 1981 2000 but we were limited by the availability of continuous flow observations i e over 1983 1992 the period 2004 2005 was considered as a warming up period for the hydrological model swat we used this scheme of model calibration and validation periods because of the availability of climate results and the availability of sediment observations that we were collecting over the past 15 years in the study site system see fox et al 2010 russo and fox 2012 ford and fox 2014 mahoney et al 2019 calibration data for streamflow was available at usgs 03 289 000 gaging station the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm through swat cup was used to execute calibration sensitivity and uncertainty analyses abbaspour et al 2007 abbaspour 2008 300 simulations were considered for each set of simulations the initial parameter ranges were adjusted several times before reaching a relatively large number of accepted simulations to address the uncertainty space sediment connectivity model for upland erosion we applied a probability based sediment connectivity model coupled with physically based erosion equations to quantify actively eroding upland surfaces and sediment flux connected to the stream corridor the model was developed by mahoney et al 2018 for a gently rolling system which coincides with the system considered in this study several processes theorized to control sediment transport in the gently rolling system are formulated in the model including sediment supply hydraulic and non hydraulic detachment upstream and downstream transport and the presence of buffers which impede lateral sediment transport fryirs et al 2007 fryirs 2013 each process is formulated as an individual probability for spatial units within the watershed the likelihood of each process occurring within a spatial unit is calculated using intersecting probabilities and spatial units in which each process is likely to occur are considered to be connected as 1 p c p s p d h d n h p t h t n h 1 p b where p c is the probability of connectivity p s is the probability of sediment supply p d h is the probability of hydrologic detachment of sediment p d nh is the probability of non hydrologic detachment of sediment p t h is the probability of hydrologic transport of sediment p t nh is the probability of non hydrologic transport of sediment and p b is the probability that a buffer impeding sediment transport is located within a spatial unit each process is parameterized using threshold based boolean equation where a probability of zero or one is used to represent that a process likely occurs within a geospatial cell cells that are predicted to be connected e g p c 1 are coupled with physically based erosion formulae and the erosion on the active contributing area is integrated across the catchment to predict sediment yield entering the stream network inputs to the model include high resolution geospatial data results of surface flow and soil moisture from external hydrologic modelling field observations and erosion formulae an ensemble of field reconnaissance remote sensing sediment concentration samples and turbidity sensor data was used to evaluate the model and increased confidence in the model results modeling framework and formulation as well as detailed presentation for the model in this system can be found in mahoney et al 2018 when calculating upland sediment connectivity we found a computational constraint when extending the probability estimates for each 1 5 m cell of the 62 km2 watershed to over a million days needed for gcm ensemble modeling of hydrology to overcome the constraint an artificial neural network ann was used to estimate the number of connected cells as a function of overland surface flow depth and the daily curve number we used the multilayer perceptron structure through the spss software ibm corporation 2012 with one input layer one hidden layer with randomly generated nodes and one output layer for the response the hyperbolic tangent function was used for the input and output layers we randomly generated portioning swinging around 70 for training 10 for testing and 20 for validating the model the sediment transport in the stream corridor was modeled using the numerical modeling developed by russo and fox 2012 and improved upon by ford and fox 2014 and mahoney et al 2019 the instream sediment transport model s inputs are the flow variables the physical characteristics of the stream channel and the upland sediment simulated by the upland sediment connectivity model the volumetric flow rate is calculated by swat and the stream channel characteristics are mentioned in mahoney et al 2019 the model considers the sediment storage budget in the streambed and the surficial fine grained lamina sfgl layer the model also considers the simulation of sediment transport deposition erosion and exchange factor in the stream for all suspended sediment see section 4 2 in mahoney et al 2019 the erosion and deposition are considered mutually exclusive in a single time step however an equilibrium exchange factor is included to account for additional erosion and deposition of bed and water column sediment sediment model calibration and validation were carried out using sediment data collected with teledyne isco automated pump samplers at two locations in the watershed to collect storm event measurements when sediment transport occurs mahoney et al 2019 formulation of the sediment model equations is provided in mahoney et al 2019 and presented in the appexdix 3 4 test how hydrologic inputs from climate change impact sediment transport we tested how hydrologic inputs from climate change simulation including precipitation temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed impact sediment transport variables and streamflow by constructing different combinations of input variables and comparing their results we used the best performing gcm ensemble bias correction method and hydrologic parameters when assessing how the hydrologic inputs may control sediment forecasts precipitation and temperature results were available for all gcm realizations the change in relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed due to climate change was input following the results of al aamery et al 2018 which was developed following the method of others mcvicar et al 2012 wild 2009 willett et al 2008 we tend to be pessimistic in the prediction of windspeed surface solar radiation and relative humidity based on the mcvicar et al 2012 study we have used the percent change of wind speed as 17 for the future period in the study region the surface solar radiation was observed to a decadal variation wild 2009 for the future period 2048 2065 considered in this study we have assumed a 15 in the surface solar radiation for the relative humidity willett et al 2008 suggests an increase in the relative humidity for the northern hemisphere due to climate change we assumed the change for the future period in the relative humidity for the study site to be 0 5 a decrease in wind speed and net radiation and an increase in relative humidity could decrease watershed losses through evapotranspiration and in turn increase streamflow we carried out seven combinations of the hydrologic inputs combination 1 includes climate change from hindcast to forecast pairs for all hydrologic inputs combination 2 has only precipitation and temperature and keeps other inputs constant from hindcast to forecast pairs combinations 3 4 5 6 and 7 isolates changes of one hydrologic input at a time to see their relative impact on the response variables 3 5 quantify the variance structure for sediment transport we quantify the variance structure for forecasting sediment transport with gcms including the sources of variance associated with the stages of modelling see fig 1 gcm model realizations includes variance from emission scenarios i e spatial report on emission scenarios sres and representative concentration pathways rcps gcm choice such as canadian global climate model cgcm3 and the national center for atmospheric research community climate model ccsm3 version within a climate modeling phase project i e cmip3 or cmip5 and the downscaling method i e dynamical or statistical downscaling gcm ensemble selection includes selecting subsets from the whole set of climate realization that satisfy three criterions representativeness validity and independency hydrology inputs includes method used the set of meteorological variables included in the hydrology model hydrological model parameterization includes different sets of parameterizations that all provide acceptable streamflow simulation in this manner swat cup through sufi 2 algorithm was set for 13 parameters to calibrate the swat model for the period 2006 2010 see table 5 swat cup results in acceptable range for each parameter r2 0 6 we have selected 25 sets from the resultant ranges to study the uncertainty raised from the swat mode parameterizations to predict streamflow and sediment transport processes variance of factors is considered independently as well as cumulatively through the simulations in addition combined impact of the factors is considered through selection of ensemble sets and model interactions propagation of uncertainty for gcm realization and hydrologic model parameterization is estimated together assuming the factors can be treated as independent random variables following the method of moore and kirkland 2007 4 results and discussion 4 1 select ensembles of gcms results of the model selection method provided three gcm ensemble designs with different sets of gcms across statistical downscaling and dynamic downscaling projects see table 2 and fig 5 and tables a b c and d and figures a and b in supplementary material design 2 showed the best choice for a gcm ensemble due to its highest value of the maximum entropy measure while still considering model representativeness historical performance and independency results shown in table 2 tend to marginalize the importance of balancing gcm ensembles with equal representation of statistical and dynamic downscaling design 1 clustered gcms so some of the realizations would be associated with statistical downscaling and some would be associated with dynamic downscaling design 1 resulted in the lowest maximum entropy measure researchers have suggested the importance of including gcms downscaled with both statistical and dynamic approaches however the ensemble design results for design 1 somewhat marginalize this idea the best performing ensemble design 2 has only 4 dynamic downscaled gcms out of 15 total gcms and the second best performing ensemble design 3 has only 1 dynamic downscaled gcm out of 15 total gcms results shown in table 2 also tend to marginalize the importance of balancing gcm ensembles across project type none of the results from the design selection method showed a balance of projects for example the results of design 3 that considered representativeness and historical performance showed 11 gcms from cmip5 3 gcms from cmip3 with only one gcm from narccap and none from cordex the ensemble design results highlight the potential for model dependency across projects and the importance of carrying out careful design selection procedures 4 2 perform bias correction model evaluation of the bias correction approaches showed that one approach i e qdm qm or sdm did dominate as best performing approach and each one shows the best results for some gcm realizations however after further inspection of the results we chose the qdm approach as the most appropriate choice for this study for the following reasons first the qdm showed the best performance in the extreme bias correction environment and we considered the extremes of precipitation to have high potential to impact the analysis of sediment transport second the sdm approach required a representative probability distribution function to fit the data due to its parametric nature for some realizations the fitting procedure did not succeed even with testing many different probability density functions for this reason the application of the qdm approach was more practical third the qdm still showed good performance in the mean matrix even when it was not the best performing one as a further discussion an inspection of results indicated for some gcm realizations the sdm and qm methods poorly simulated the differences in extremes between the hindcast and forecast periods see table 3 as mentioned the gamma distribution failed to represent some data sets e g the miroc3 2 medres1 model of cmip3 project for the a1b scenario further investigation of error propagation for this realization showed there was a 50 increase in the maximum value of precipitation when comparing the hindcast and the raw forecast data while sdm showed 5 decrease and qm showed 9 decrease which reflects the deficiency in these methods the sdm and the qm methods underestimated the extreme of precipitation data as another example we further inspected extreme by applying the three methods to the gfdl model of cmip3 project a1b scenario for precipitation the gamma distribution succeeded in representing the modeled data in this realization but qdm outperformed the sdm and qm methods forecast and hindcast model results showed a 38 of increase in maximum precipitation sdm qm and qdm shows 2 9 and 38 respectively even when successfully fit the gamma distribution the parametric approach showed poor performance at its limits in this modeling results recent results have suggested the superiority of the sdm approach however as with any parametric method the prediction is contingent on the ability to fit the data to a known distribution across its means and extremes 4 3 execute hydrology and sediment transport modeling hydrologic and sediment model performance was found adequate for the analyses swat succeeded in simulating the hydrologic condition of the upper south elkhorn watershed see table 4 all statistical matrices considered in the streamflow comparison have provided acceptable values according to moriasi et al 2007 for a daily time step model the acceptable values of the matrices were obtained over the calibration period 2006 2010 and the two validation periods 2011 2013 and 1983 1992 our results agree with past studies that have proven the ability of swat to simulate the hydrologic conditions for this region e g palanisamy and workman 2015 al aamery et al 2016 al aamery et al 2018 mahoney et al 2018 after three executions of the sufi2 algorithm through swat cup each with 300 simulations we reached the acceptable range shown in table 5 for each parameter the acceptable ranges have provided 300 acceptable runs where r2 0 6 which we accept as a reasonable solution space for the hydrological model parameterizations considering maximum and minimum values for each parameter in the acceptable parameter ranges produces 25 sets of parameters that all have acceptable evaluation the sensitivity analysis shows that five of the thirteen parameters were sensitive to the objective function r2 computations the sensitive parameters are according to their importance channel manning roughness ch cn2 groundwater delay time gw delay plant available water content sol awc scs curve number for moisture condition ii cn2 and surface runoff lag coefficient surlag the sensitivity of the cn2 is playing an important role in impacting the number of connected cells in the sediment connectivity model the ann reflected well the upland connectivity component table 6 shows the ann performance for the number of connected cells for each bin for the period 2006 2010 training testing and validating portions of the data have all shown a roughly equal and minimum error of less than 5 which reflects the strong performance for this task ibm corporation 2012 the results also showed the daily surface flowrate has a significantly larger weight than the daily curve number when approximating connected cells in this basin the success of the in stream sediment transport model was also adequate and consistent with mahoney et al 2019 results 4 4 test how hydrologic inputs from climate change impact sediment transport results of testing hydrologic inputs from climate change showed the importance of including all of the variables see table 7 for the analyses we only included the best performing ensemble selection i e design 2 and best performing bias correction method i e qdm the seven combinations show the importance of assessing the climate change impact on precipitation temperature relative humidity and wind speed on streamflow and sediment transport fluxes when using gcm forecasting table 7 the influence of relative humidity changes was minimal i e less than 1 impact on changing the responses the result is particularly noteworthy when comparing combination 1 when all hydrologic variables are changed versus combination 2 when only precipitation and temperature are changed the mean changes in forecasted streamflow are 19 0 and 9 6 for combination 1 and 2 and the mean changes in forecasted sediment discharge are 13 6 and 8 8 for combination 1 and 2 respectively other sediment transport fluxes show similar differences between the two combinations many hydrologic forecasting studies only include precipitation and temperature changes when propagating gcm results through hydrologic models e g fatichi et al 2014 chen et al 2013 mejia 2012 al aamery et al 2016 bussi et al 2016 sherstha et al 2018 giri et al 2019 loiselle et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the results here highlight the importance of considering all hydrologic variables expected to be impacted by climate change the influence of hydrologic variables is shown in table 7 and the offsetting behavior of the variables is evident gcm forecasted changes in precipitation relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed cause increases in streamflow and sediment transport fluxes for this study system in contrast forecasted temperature changes cause a decrease in the variables when allowing the precipitation to be changed 7 42 while keeping all other meteorological variables constants from the observation period the change in streamflow will be 17 25 fig 6 a shows the annual cycle of streamflow change for this scenario in this case the water inputs to the watershed is increased and the watershed outflow must be increased to meet the water budget mass balance of the hydrology equations when allowing only the relative humidity to change by 0 5 willet et al 2008 the streamflow is changing by 0 29 fig 6 c shows the results humidity increase is reversely impacting the losses from the watershed according to penmann montieth equation see neitsch et al 2011 it is obvious that the increase is minimal in our system already humid system and the reason is attributed to the small projected change in humidity the solar radiation is projected to decrease by 12 w m2 in the study region wild 2009 we applied a percent decrease of about 15 for all the data such decrease will cause an increase in streamflow by 4 2 fig 6 d explains the results solar radiation has a direct relationship with the evaporation according to penman monteith equation accordingly water losses from the watershed is decreasing as the solar radiation is projected to increase and the associated water flow exiting the system is increased the literature indicated that wind speed is projected to decrease in the middle of the century the amount of decrease is 0 5 m s in the study area mcvicar et al 2012 we applied a percent decrease of 17 to all generated daily value to examine the sensitivity of the wind speed on the flow results al aamery et al 2018 the results shows 2 54 increase in streamflow see fig 6 e similarly to solar radiation the wind speed decrease is lowering system losses and the flow is increased as a result if only the temperature is allowed to change 2 58 c the change in streamflow will be 8 19 the annual cycle of streamflow in this scenario is shown in fig 6 b here the water loss through evaporation would be increasing as a results of increasing the temperature despite the individual impact of some variables being small the combined impact of the change in relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed on the watershed hydrology and sedimentation shifts water and sediment flux by 49 19 9 6 19 and 35 13 6 8 8 13 6 respectively see fig 6 f g and table 7 4 5 quantify the variance structure for sediment transport the forecasted streamflow and sediment transport variance is somewhat impacted by all uncertainty sources considered table 8 gcm realization and hydrologic inputs dominate streamflow variance and gcm realization hydrologic inputs and hydrologic model parameterization dominate forecasted sediment yield variance the influence of gcm realizations on forecasted sediment yield variance was not surprising many previous studies showed gcm type and the emission scenario of the gcm are essential sources of uncertainty when forecasting hydrology with gcms brekke et al 2013 ahn et al 2016 al aamery et al 2016 al aamery et al 2018 hoan et al 2018 the reason is due to the parameterizations and internal structure of the different gcms and the objective by which the emission scenarios are constructed brekke et al 2013 uncertainty from the gcms propagates through the streamflow model and then through the sediment transport model adding variance to the forecasted sediment yield therefore gcm choice and type are important sources of uncertainty for both forecasted streamflow and sediment transport hydrologic input source was an intermediate source of variance and the influence of hydrologic inputs as a source of variance to forecasted sediment yield was somewhat surprising this is especially true considering most previous studies in the peer reviewed literature consider the impact of only precipitation and temperature changes from gcms the uncertainty in table 8 reflects calculations from table 7 results when considering precipitation and temperature changes only compared to climate changes from precipitation temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed and we discussed these results in section 4 4 for comparison results show the choice of the hydrologic inputs is an intermediate source of variance for both forecasted streamflow and sediment transport and this variance source should be more closely considered in future work most surprising result to our group was the influence of hydrologic model parameterization as a source of variance to forecasted sediment yield this uncertainty source produced a sediment yield ensemble uncertainty over two times greater than the uncertainty from gcm type and emission scenario this is notable considering hydrologic model parameterization was the smallest source of uncertainty for streamflow further the high uncertainty for sediment transport was found for all sediment fluxes considered in modeling see fig 7 including forecasted upland erosion flux bed and bank erosion flux deposition and sediment exchange as well as sediment yield we investigated further the watershed modeling variance from the ensemble of hydrologic model parameterizations by inspecting variation across the ensemble at sub catchment fluxes and stream reach fluxes at single time steps we found the greatest amount of flux variation from realization to realization occurring at the linkage between the swat output and the upland sediment connectivity model for landscape erosion at this linkage variance propagated from swat could adjust the active areas in which sediment pathways are connected leading to substantially increased or decreased upland erosion flux hydrologic model parameterization as a relatively small source of variance for forecasted streamflow is found here nevertheless in forecasted sediment yield variance propagations result in the largest variance source arising from hydrologic parameterization the results emphasize hydrology researchers focused on forecasting sediment transport may need to give as much consideration to their water sediment linkages as climate water sediment linkages represented in their models variance introduced across the three different gcm ensembles was a relatively small source of variance impacting forecasted streamflow or sediment yield see table 8 to this point we highlight that all three model selection methods were quantitative in their designs we find the choice of quantitative model selection criteria shows some convergence of forecasted change in precipitation streamflow and sediment fluxes precipitation increases for forecasts relative to current conditions were 6 7 and 10 increases for model selection design 1 2 and 3 respectively see table 9 forecasted streamflow increases were 21 20 and 28 increases relative to current conditions for model selection design 1 2 and 3 forecasted sediment yield increases were 9 14 and 14 increases for design 1 2 and 3 respectively these differences between designs are non zero but are small relative to differences between some individual realizations at the same time we point out the model selection design methods were quantitative and considered each gcms representativeness historical performance and independency albeit design 3 did not consider independency the results suggest a quantitative effort by the researcher towards a model selection design considering representativeness historical performance and independency will lead to a robust ensemble for hydrologic modeling qualitative model selection procedures are becoming more common in the hydrology applications of gcm results our work supports this effort to arrive at a more robust solution space further discussion of uncertainty propagation from hydrologic parameterization and gcm realization is carried out in the context of the broader literature the importance of uncertainty from hydrologic parametrization on streamflow forecasting in gcm studies remains an open topic and a number of studies marginalize the importance of hydrologic parametrization on streamflow while other studies show the importance of hydrologic parameterization on specific hydrologic variables e g soil moisture in the context of gcm projection no studies to our knowledge report that the uncertainty from hydrological parameterization is greater than that from gcm realizations when projecting streamflow niraula et al 2015 used calibrated and un calibrated swat models and showed that the choice of hydrologic parameter sets had almost no impact on the net change in hydrologic response of the basin al aamery et al 2018 used swat modelling and showed that variance of forecasted streamflow from hydrologic parameterization was two orders of magnitude smaller than variance introduced from gcm realization thompson et al 2013 studied the uncertainty raised from the hydrological model to simulate streamflow by using three hydrological models mike she slurp and mac pdm 09 and two sets of gcm scenarios were applied the uncertainty introduced from the hydrological model was evidenced but smaller than the uncertainty associated with the gcm choice her et al 2019 showed that the uncertainty originated from the gcm choice is greater than the uncertainty from multi parameter ensemble of hydrological modeling when simulating the impact of climate change on streamflow therefore their study suggested that more emphasis for the choice of the gcm should be considered her et al 2019 also showed that the prediction of soil moisture and the groundwater stage had the greatest uncertainty associated with the hydrological parameterization bae et al 2011 used three semi distributed hydrologic models with different formula for evapotranspiration and 39 gcms to assess the climate change impact on runoff their results indicated that the choice of the hydrologic model and can induce a major uncertainty in the same climate scenario for runoff predictions these results agree with the present study because we showed that uncertainty from hydrologic parameterization had nearly equal impact on surface runoff as uncertainty from gcm realizations and uncertainty from hydrologic parameterization was larger than that of uncertainty from gcm realizations when considering variations of the daily curve number in swat figs 8 and 9 taken together this study s results and the literature review suggests uncertainty from gcms dominates over uncertainty from hydrologic parameterization when only streamflow is considered but uncertainty from hydrologic parameterization can be as important as gcm choice when hydrologic responses such as soil moisture runoff and groundwater stage no studies to our knowledge report the uncertainty from hydrologic parameterization and gcm realization on sediment transport forecasting in this study the uncertainty raised from the hydrological model parameterizations was larger than that associated with gcm uncertainty when assessing the relative error of sediment transport response variables figs 7 and 8 the reason is attributed to the specific hydrologic responses in swat that impact upland erosion and sediment transport as mentioned uncertainty from hydrologic parameterization had an equal impact and greater impact than gcms when considering surface runoff and daily curve number in swat respectively the interaction of surface runoff depth and soil moisture conditions impacting the daily curve number were shown to have the greatest influence on predicting geospatial cells in modelling as connected or disconnected in terms of sediment transport connectivity mahoney et al 2018 for this reason the sediment connectivity modelling was sensitive to the surface runoff simulations and showed greater uncertainty of results attributed to the hydrologic parameterization as compared to gcm realization figs 8 and 9 taken together the results of this study her et al 2019 and bae et al 2011 suggest that hydrologic parameterization could become a more important source of uncertainty than gcm realization when projecting surface runoff and soil moisture conditions and in turn sediment transport variables we assessed the combined impact of gcm realization and hydrologic model parameterization on uncertainty propagation through the water and sediment transport modelling fig 9 in general the net increase in uncertainty of responses is shown from gcm modelling of precipitation to hydrologic modelling of water variables to sediment transport modelling of sediment connectivity and sediment flux results uncertainty of responses is greatest for predicting the sediment connectivity of geospatial cells with approximately 100 m2 drainage area the uncertainty of the sediment connectivity occurs due to the interaction of surface runoff depth and soil moisture variance from hydrologic parameterization this uncertainty propagates through the sediment transport modelling to produce greater error associated with hydrologic parameterization as compared to gcm realization when projecting sediment transport coupling sediment connectivity modelling within watershed erosion and sediment transport model forecasts remains an emerging area of sediment transport mahoney et al 2018 mahoney et al 2020b mahoney et al 2021 the propagation of uncertainty analyses illustrates the importance in considerations of connectivity and its variance when the modelling framework is used with gcm ensembles 4 6 forecast of sediment transport for the lowland watershed the forecast of sediment transport via gcms for the lowland watershed studied in general predict increases in sediment fluxes based on ensemble averaging see fig 8 the annual sediment flux increases are in agreement with annual increases in streamflow forecasted streamflow and sediment yield are predicted to increase by approximately 19 and 14 respectively on annual average see table 8 design 2 and fig 8 we qualify the ensemble averages and uncertainty in table 8 sediment forecast considers the best performing models in evaluation including model selection design 2 qdm bias correction method and the hydrologic model simulation with the best evaluation metrics forecast monthly changes created from ensemble averaging also show a similar correlation see fig 10 forecast precipitation streamflow and sediment yield all show increases in similar months of the year regarding intermediate sediment fluxes the forecasted 17 increase in upland soil erosion flux is closest to the forecasted 14 increase in sediment yield see table 8 and fig 8 while sediment deposition and exchange show increases as well although smaller than sediment flux with mean increases of 7 and 5 the behavior of sediment transport at the watershed scale during climate change forecasting reflects the shear transport or source limitations of the landscape and stream channel when considering multi year simulations the dominant source of sediment to the watershed outlet is upland surface erosion for the south elkhorn creek watershed occurring in rills and gullies mahoney et al 2018 mahoney et al 2019 for this reason the watershed behavior becomes shear limited in multi year simulations this is true for the nearly two decade hindcast and two decade forecast periods forecasted increase in water flux across the uplands produces increases in rill depth and gully depth across the channels of the uplands increased rill and gully depths increase excess shear and resulted in greater upland erosion flux we further investigated intermediate upland fluxes for our ensemble design 2 and we found annual increases of upland runoff depth equal to 16 7 15 3 this approximately 17 average increase in runoff corresponds well with the 17 increase in upland sediment flux and the 14 increase in sediment load at the watershed outlet in the south elkhorn creek dampening of the upland sediment flux as a function of in stream sediment transport processes did occur appreciably which again reflects sediment transport limitations of the system the lack of substantial differences between the upland erosion flux and sediment yield at the outlet is attributed to the stream being transport limited russo and fox 2012 the sediment transport carrying capacity of the flow is most often reflected with streampower or some associated derivative thereof and streampower is linearly related to water discharge tc q where tc is transport capacity as streampower bagnold 1966 therefore for the multi year results the increased sediment transport capacity can eventually transport the increased sediment loading from the uplands out of the watershed this is not necessarily true for individual storm events and this result is reflected in the increased deposition and bed water sediment exchange fluxes see fig 8 the stream can become transport limited during high rainfall events due to its low stream gradient and relatively high upland sediment loading can deposit to the bed during these times russo and fox 2012 the deposits are not expected to decrease multi year sediment yields estimates because our previous field and modeling results of this system suggest streamflow from moderate rainfall events is sediment starved and erodes the temporary in stream deposits russo and fox 2012 mahoney et al 2019 we qualify the source limits of the south elkhorn creek were assumed stationary for our present conditions and forecasts it is possible that landuse conversion i e increased area of impervious surfaces could shift source limits from now to the future period however dynamic land cover was not considered in this study and landscape source limits for each 1 5 m upland cell and stream source limits for extent of exposed bedrock stream were static following the estimates in mahoney et al 2019 shear transport or source limitations of the landscape and stream channel and their influence on climate change forecasting of sediment transport were not extensively studied in previous journal articles so we are not able to provide an extensive comparison for previous studies we found in general a dampening of forecasted changes in sediment transport variables relative to streamflow changes for example studies show forecasted percent increases in streamflow are matched with much small percent increases in sediment variables or even zero change or negative changes in sediment variables johnson et al 2015 nerantzaki et al 2015 wagena et al 2016 direct comparison with our sediment flux results is difficult because the previous studies often focus on concentration changes nevertheless dampened sediment transport changes relative to increased streamflow may reflect a shear limited condition for the river network invoking continuity roughness formula and momentum produces a low order dependence of fluid shear stress on streamflow i e τf qc where τf is the fluid shear stress for a wide channel and c is 0 6 and 0 67 for manning s and darch weisbach roughness formula respectively the low order dependence dampens sediment transport as a function of streamflow for the shear limited case future research might further investigate climate change forecasts of sediment transport as a function of the shear transport or source limitations of the landscape and stream channel 5 conclusion the conclusion of this paper is as follows 1 model evaluation results show the gcm model selection procedure based on model representativeness historical performance independency and lack of additional clustering for the downscaling approach provided the best ensemble design model evaluation of bias correction approaches showed quantile delta mapping outperformed scaled distribution mapping and quantile mapping in this study hydrologic and sediment model performance was found adequate for the analyses 2 results of testing hydrologic inputs from climate change on sediment transport and streamflow showed the importance of including forecasted changes in precipitation temperature relative humidity and wind speed the hydrologic inputs had an offsetting effect and considering changes in precipitation and temperature alone under predicts streamflow and sediment transport by 49 and 35 respectively relative to including all meteorological variables inputs the result is noteworthy given many published studies only consider changes in precipitation and temperature when forecasting hydrologic variables 3 the variance of forecasted sediment transport variables as well as streamflow was somewhat impacted by all uncertainty sources considered including gcm realization hydrologic inputs hydrologic model parameterization and gcm model selection procedures table 8 4 variance decomposition in past research and in this paper marginalizes the importance of hydrologic model parameterization relative to gcm realization when only streamflow forecast is considered but show similar levels of importance for hydrologic parameterization and gcm realization when hydrologic variables such as runoff depth and soil moisture are considered forecast of sediment transport responses shows the propagation of uncertainty from hydrologic model parameterization was over two times greater than the uncertainty from gcm type and emission scenario 36 and 15 respectively the results emphasize hydrology researchers focused on forecasting sediment transport with gcms may need to give as much or more consideration to their water sediment linkages as climate water sediment linkages represented in their forecast models 5 variance introduced across the three different gcm ensemble designs was a relatively small source of variance impacting forecasted streamflow or sediment yield 4 and 3 respectively the results suggest a quantitative effort by the researcher towards a model selection design considering representativeness historical performance and independency will lead to a robust ensemble for hydrologic modeling qualitative model selection procedures are beginning to become more common in the hydrology applications of gcm results our work supports this effort to arrive at a more robust solution space 6 for this study ensemble average forecasts of streamflow and sediment yield are predicted to increase by approximately 12 and 14 respectively the behavior of sediment transport at the watershed scale during climate change forecasts reflects the shear limited landscape of the watershed and the transport limited conditions in the stream channel these behaviors result in a one to one dependence for the landscape and stream including change in upland erosion as a function of runoff depth increase and change in in stream sediment transport as a function of streampower future research might further investigate climate change forecasts of

4224,difficulty remains to represent water propagation impact to construct water balance constraints for the short term cascade reservoirs optimal operation scroo due to the complex water propagation mechanism existing between cascade reservoirs the imprecise representation of water propagation impact hinders the implementation of hydropower generation schemes and leads to operational risks thus a modified scroo model considering water propagation impact was proposed in this study to improve the accuracy of cascade operation specifically water propagation is expressed using the muskingum method in the modified scroo model and characterized by two variables including propagation time related to the magnitude of the upstream reservoir s outflow and flow attenuation related to the propagation time which were identified using the successive approximation method under water balance constraints within the modified scroo model subsequently this research applied the nested progressive optimality algorithm npoa in the model calculation innovatively in which the stage benefit function and nest computation could be improved the modified model and algorithm developed herein were applied and validated on cascade reservoirs along the yalung river in china by comparing it with traditional methods and algorithms the results show that 1 compared to traditional methods considering water propagation within water balance constraints as a dynamic parameter can calculate the inflow of downstream reservoir more accurately and mitigate risks in the actual operation of cascade reservoirs besides the reservoir inflow calculated by traditional methods will lead to different magnitudes of benefit loss and 2 the npoa can significantly reduce dimensionality problems caused by the water propagation impact and greatly improve the actual hydropower generation than that of a traditional optimal algorithm multi stage dynamic programming msdp compared to the msdp the nopa is more applicable in a cascade system with a larger number of reservoirs the modified model and algorithm can significantly improve the effectiveness of cascade reservoir optimal operation schemes and provide more information for decision makers keywords hydropower optimal operation cascade reservoirs water propagation muskingum method successive approximation method nested progressive optimality algorithm 1 introduction the optimal operation of cascade reservoirs has many considerable functions such as power generation flood control and water supply li et al 2018 elie et al 2019 using short term quantitative precipitation forecasts the short term cascade reservoirs optimal operation scroo model can be combined with modern computing techniques and optimization methods to allocate water to effectively manage water resources xu et al 2014 tan et al 2020 pulkit et al 2020 meanwhile in the process of developing optimal operation schemes several problems need to be considered including the uncertainty inherent in streamflow forecasts zhao and zhao 2014 wang et al 2017 the complex hydrologic hydraulic and electric connections among cascade hydropower stations ji et al 2018 chen et al 2014 and the reasonableness of optimal algorithm which can ensure the superiority of the solution results and the calculation time meeting the requirements of practical application jiang et al 2019 feng et al 2020 among the potential sources of risks the simplification of water balance constraints may lead to the imprecise construction of the scroo models particularly consideration of water propagation within water balance constraints for the scroo model is a challenging but necessary component to assess generally water propagation between reservoirs refers to the outflow of water from an upstream reservoir and its movement into a downstream reservoir after traveling through a natural channel ji et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the accurate characterization of water propagation makes the construction of a scroo model more accurate reducing the risk of loss in the actual operation of cascade reservoirs zhang et al 2017 however the characterization of water propagation effect within water balance constraints is complicated due to the complex water propagation mechanism existing between cascade reservoirs ts and ad 2012 tong et al 2013 ge et al 2018 at present two typical approaches are normally used to handle water propagation in the construction of a scroo model the first approach mainly focuses on the propagation time and ignores water flow attenuation in the formulation of scheduling problems in hydropower generation some studies fix the propagation time as a constant to simplify the influence of water propagation hsu and wei 2007 zhong et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 under such assumptions the outflow from an upstream reservoir directly flows into the downstream reservoir after a constant propagation time without considering the dynamic nature of water propagation through time or space however han et al 2013 and ge et al 2014 argued that propagation time could be described as a function of the magnitude of the upstream reservoir s outflow they then constructed a mathematical step function that related the propagation time to the outflow from an upstream reservoir which can reduce the difficulty of solving operation model ge et al 2014 nevertheless such approximations could not fit all the regions along a river especially where streamflow routing does not follow a simple relationship between the outflow of upstream reservoir and propagation time the second approach predominantly focuses on flow attenuation along the channel while the propagation time was fixed as a constant within the flow attenuation model ts and ad 2012 and diniz and souza 2014 for example divided the outflow of upstream reservoirs into different portions and these portions reach the downstream reservoirs at different times and results show the importance of taking the flow attenuation within the water balance constraints into account for the brazilian hydropower system zhang et al 2016 and ji et al 2017 used the muskingum method to handle the effect of flow attenuation caused by streamflow routing behavior which was then incorporated into the construction of scroo models for yalung cascade hydropower stations furthermore zhang et al 2019 regarded the relationship between the upstream outflow and downstream inflow as a problem that could be solved using an artificial neural network of flow attenuation those previous studies have proved that the flow attenuation impact always varies according to the outflow of upstream reservoirs and the operating condition of the river channel therefore it can be concluded that it is unreasonable to suppose the flow attenuation effect unchanged in the scroo model taking the effect of water propagation into consideration water balance constraints become complicated decisions concerning the release of water from upstream reservoirs at a specific time will not only affect decisions concerning the discharge of water from downstream reservoirs at that time but affect later decisions about the management of downstream flows put differently the normal scroo model is unable to satisfy the principle of optimality bellman 1966 the traditional dynamic programming dp which is one of the methods used to effectively solve the scroo problem where the effects of water propagation can be ignored is not applicable hence ji et al 2017 proposed the use of multi stage dynamic programming msdp this approach has been theoretically proven to exhibit the global convergence needed to solve the problem but issues related to dimensionality become problematic which means the computation time increases exponentially with the growing quantity of reservoirs chu et al 2014 ji et al 2018 some studies have alternatively employed linear programming to solve this problem but the linearization of some constraints in the model reduces the feasibility of using such schemes tong et al 2013 ge et al 2014 when using heuristic algorithms to solve this problem the stability and reliability of the algorithms cannot be guaranteed han et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 therefore there is a very practical and urgent need to find a reliable algorithm that can balance the performance of hydropower generation schemes and the time needed for model solving stated thus there is a very practical and urgent need to construct a reasonable scroo model considering water propagation and develop a reliable algorithm for the effective model calculation thus the objectives of this paper are 1 develop a modified scroo model which makes the representation of water balance constraints more precise and reduce the actual operation risk 2 propose an effective algorithm to derive the optimal operation schemes from the modified scroo model and reach the balance on both the reliability of hydropower generation schemes and the computation time specifically the impact of water propagation on the proposed modified scroo model in this study is quantified by two components including propagation time and flow attenuation the dynamic simultaneous effects of both components on the results of a scroo model are investigated subsequently a nested progressive optimality algorithm npoa is proposed to derive the operation schemes in which the stage benefit function was improved and nest computation was combined the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the construction of the modified scroo model considering water propagation as a dynamic process and the use of an improved npoa for model solving then the newly developed model and algorithm are applied to a case study in section 3 and the performance of the modified model and the new proposed algorithm is analyzed in section 4 finally section 5 provides a summary of the paper s conclusions 2 methodology 2 1 dynamic handling of water propagation impact with propagation time and flow attenuation when there exists a natural channel between cascade reservoirs the outflow from the upstream reservoir is affected over a period of time by the natural channel before it enters the downstream reservoir the description of this between reservoir flow is called water propagation and this impact can be expressed as 1 w i t ψ i 1 o i 1 1 o i 1 2 o i 1 t where w i t is the inflow to reservoir i during period t which is from the outflow of an upstream reservoir i 1 o i 1 t is the total discharge of reservoir i 1 during period t ψ i 1 is the relationship between the outflow of reservoir i 1 and the inflow to the reservoir i the key to characterizing the water propagation is to find a proper ψ i 1 which makes the w i t close to reality but this ψ i 1 is difficult to be obtained because ψ i 1 is changeable along with the variations of outflow from the upstream reservoir given these considerations the ψ i 1 is characterized by two dynamic variables in this study using the muskingum method the muskingum method which represents a linear mathematical approach is a simple form of the saint venant equations that are widely applied in water resources management reggiani and price 2013 barbetta et al 2017 when the i 1th reservoir outflow sequence o i 1 1 o i 1 2 o i 1 t is known the inflow sequence w i 1 w i 2 w i t to the downstream reservoir can be calculated by eq 2 adopting the muskingum method 2 w i t j t d t p t j i 1 o i 1 j where p t j i 1 is the ratio of the outflow from the i 1th reservoir during period t j that enters the ith reservoir during period t and d is the largest time interval number that affects the inflow of ith reservoir in period t the elaborate calculation of p t j i 1 has been given in previous studies birkhead and james 2002 barbetta et al 2017 the value of p t j i 1 is affected by k and x k is the storage time constant for the river reach which possesses a value based on the time reasonably needed for the water to propagate along the river reach and is a weighting factor varying between 0 and 0 5 by using the muskingum method to describe water propagation between cascading reservoirs the effect of water propagation on the modified scroo model can be considered from two aspects propagation time which is equal to k and flow attenuation which is related to k and x a detailed description of the analysis is provided below 2 1 1 propagation time between reservoirs the inflow to a downstream reservoir i during period t as determined using eq 2 is influenced by the outflow from the upstream reservoirs i 1 during the period extending from t d to time t the amount of water released from the upstream reservoir i 1 to a cascade will be split into several parts which will arrive at the downstream reservoir i at different periods and will consist of different proportions of the total upstream outflow the ratio of the outflow from the upstream reservoir i 1 during period t r r 0 1 d that enters the downstream reservoir during period t is p r from eq 2 p k δ t is the biggest value of p r r 0 1 d which demonstrates that the inflow to the downstream reservoir i during period t is mainly affected by the outflow from the upstream reservoir during the period t k δ t therefore the majority of outflow from reservoir i 1 arrives at reservoir i after experiencing a propagation time k as shown in fig 1 the time of the smallest outflow a from the upstream reservoir i 1 that arrives at the inflow a1 to the downstream reservoir is τ 1 the time of the largest outflow b from the upstream reservoir that arrives at the inflow b1 to the downstream reservoir i is τ 2 if flow attenuation is not considered and the cross sectional area of river channel is constant then the relationship between propagation time and the magnitude of the upstream reservoir s outflow can be expressed by eq 3 han et al 2013 ge et al 2018 and the result for when τ 1 τ 2 is deduced 3 τ 1 3600 a δ l x 1 x 2 u where τ is the propagation time a is the cross sectional area of the discharge δ l x 1 x 2 is the distance between the discharge section x 1 and the discharge section x 2 and u is the flow rate 2 1 2 flow attenuation between reservoirs in fig 1 when the smallest outflow o a from the upstream reservoir i 1 arrives at the downstream reservoir i after a time duration of τ 1 the inflow to the downstream reservoir w i t τ 1 can be deduced as follows 4 w i t τ 1 r t 1 τ 1 h a t 1 τ 1 p t 1 τ 1 r o r given that o a min o t 1 τ 1 h a o t 1 τ 1 the result o a w i t τ 1 can be determined fig 1 similarly when the biggest outflow o b from the upstream reservoir arrives at the downstream reservoir after a time duration of τ 2 the inflow to the downstream reservoir w i t τ 2 is smaller than o b the above results are influenced by the effect of flow attenuation hence the behavior of flow attenuation can be described such that when the smaller outflow from the upstream reservoir turns into the downstream reservoir flow rate will increase when the larger outflow from the upstream reservoir enters the downstream reservoir it will decrease the effect of flow attenuation thus depends on the value of p r r 0 1 h and when propagation time k is determined the value of p r is affected by weighting factor x 2 1 3 formulation of water balance constraints in the modified scroo model from the above analysis the effect of water propagation was divided into two components if the average outflow from the upstream reservoir during the entire operational period the duration of an operation scheme is known the propagation time τ and the value of p r can be determined by doing so ψ i 1 can be expressed by eq 5 and eq 6 5 τ i 1 φ i 1 t 1 t o i 1 t t 6 w i t γ i 1 τ i 1 o i 1 1 o i 1 2 o i 1 t j t τ i 1 r 1 i 1 t τ i 1 r 2 i 1 p t τ i 1 j i 1 o i 1 j where φ i 1 is a function of the relationship between the average outflow from the upstream reservoir i 1 during the entire operational period and the propagation time this function is often described as a step function γ i 1 τ i 1 represents the flow attenuation model related to τ i 1 r 1 i 1 is the period before the period t τ i 1 that is affected by the outflow from the reservoir i 1 during period t r 2 i 1 is the period after the period t τ i 1 that is affected by the outflow from the reservoir i 1during the period t r r 1 i 1 r 2 i 1 1 is the total period effected by the outflow from the upstream reservoir during period t p t τ i 1 j i 1 is the fraction of the outflow o i 1 j that enters the downstream reservoir during period t furthermore using the dynamic representation of the water propagation impact with two dynamic variables the water balance constraints for the modified scroo model can be expressed as eq 5 and eqs 7 9 7 v i t v i t 1 i i t o i t δ t 8 i i t s i t w i t 9 o i t q i t q i t where v i t is the water capacity of a reservoir i at the end of period t δ t is the duration of an operation period s i t is the inflow to a reservoir i during the period t from the zone between reservoirs q i t is the generating water flow from reservoir i used to produce power during the period t and q i t is the abandoned discharge from a reservoir i during the period t modified scroo model considering water propagation impact in a dynamic way 2 1 4 objective function during the process of developing the modified scroo model the optimal goals of the operation policy are chosen for various assumptions the maximization of total hydropower production was chosen as the optimal goal in this study thus the objective function can be written as wang et al 2017 10 maxe i 1 rn t 1 t b i v i t 1 i i t o i t i 1 rn t 1 t b i v i t 1 v

water head for reservoir i in period t 2 1 5 constraint requirements 1 water balance constraints imposed on the system are expressed with eq 5 and eqs 7 9 2 capacity constraints inherent in the system include 12 v min i v i t v max i where v min i and v max i are the minimum and maximum storage volume of the reservoir i at the end of period t respectively 3 the outflow constraints are 13 o min i o i t o max i 14 q i t q max i where o min i and o max i are the minimum and maximum outflow of reservoir i during the period t respectively q max i is the maximum generating water flow of reservoir i during the period t 4 the output constraints are 15 n min i n i t n max i where n min i and n max i are the minimum and maximum output from the hydropower station for reservoir i during the period t respectively 5 the boundary constraints are defined as 16 z i 0 z i ini z i t z i term where z i ini and z i term are the water levels of a reservoir at the beginning and end of the entire operational cycle respectively 6 the net water head equation constraint 17 h i t 1 2 z i t 1 z i t z i t h i t loss where z i t is the forebay level of reservoir i at the end of period t z i t is the average tailrace level of reservoir i during period t h i t loss is the head loss of reservoir i during period t 7 the reservoir forebay level and storage constraint 18 z i t s s r i v i t where ss r i v i t

of reservoir i 9 the water head loss equation constraint 20 h i t loss s h q i q i t where sh q i q i t is the head loss curve of a reservoir i 10 the expected output equation constraint 21 n max i e o i h i t where e o i h i t is the expected output curve of hydropower from reservoir i 11 there is also a non negative constraint 22 x t 0 this constraint specifies that all of the above variables must be non negative 2 2 model solving to derive the optimal solution accurately model development was subdivided into two parts the first part was aimed at determining the propagation time τ i 1 and the flow attenuation model γ i 1 τ i 1 using the successive approximation method subsequently the npoa was used to derive the operation schemes 2 2 1 determining the propagation time and flow attenuation model using the successive approximation method given that outflow from an upstream reservoir is a dynamic variable in the optimization calculation we cannot determine the propagation time or the flow attenuation model before the optimization calculation hence herein the propagation time and flow attenuation model are considered optimization variables that were initialized before the model was solved that is using the successive approximation method sam the two variables were changed during the process of model solving steps used during the calculation are described below whereas a flowchart illustrating the linkages between these steps is shown in fig 2 step 1 determine the initial values for the propagation time τ 1 τ 1 1 τ 2 1 τ rn 1 1 and flow attenuation model γ 1 γ 1 τ 1 1 γ 2 τ 1 1 γ rn 1 τ 1 1 and initialize the iterations m 1 where τ i m is the propagation time between reservoir i and reservoir i 1 during iteration m and γ i τ i m is the flow attenuation model between reservoir i and reservoir i 1 related to τ i m step 2 according to the specified τ m and γ τ m use the optimal algorithm to derive the outflow q i m q i 1 m q i 2 m q i t m from every reservoir in the cascade q i t m is the outflow from a reservoir during the period t for the iteration m step 3 redetermine the propagation time τ m 1 and flow attenuation model γ τ m 1 using eq 5 and eq 6 step 4 if τ m 1 τ m 0 save the calculation results as output otherwise change iteration to m m 1 and return to step 2 2 2 2 model solving based on npoa progressive optimality algorithm poa is an improved dp that simplifies this complicated multi stage decision into a two stage decision problem significantly mitigating the dimensionality issue however the traditional poa has not been able to handle the scroo problem when considering water propagation ji et al 2017 ji et al 2018 hence an improved poa named npoa is proposed in this study to solve the scroo problem when affected by water propagation the proposed npoa is generated in two aspects including the improvement of stage benefit function and the combination of nest computation improvement of the stage benefit function a water propagation in traditional poa yellow part the outflow from the upstream reservoir during the period t will affect the inflow to the downstream reservoir at the same period t b water propagation in npoa yellow part the outflow from the upstream reservoir during the period t will affect the inflow to the downstream reservoir during period t τ i 1 green part the outflow from upstream reservoir during the period t will affect the inflow to the downstream reservoir around the period t τ i 1 as shown in fig 3 a in traditional poa the propagation time and flow attenuation are neglected in this case we only need to allocate cascade inflow between the two periods to maximize the total benefit of the two periods taking the state variables v t v 1 t v 2 t v rn t as decision variables the stage benefit function of poa can be expressed by eq 23 23 g 1 v t i 1 rn g i 1 v i t 24 g i 1 v i t b i v i t 1 v i t b i v i t v i t 1 where g 1 v t is the total hydropower generation at stage t when the decision variable is v t g i 1 v i t is the hydropower generation in reservoir i during period t v i t 1 is the optimal decision during the previous iteration v i t 1 is the optimal decision during the current iteration as shown in the yellow part of fig 3 b when propagation time is considered the inflow to reservoir i during period t τ i 1 is mainly derived from the outflow from reservoir i during period t the state variables v i 1 t and v i t τ i 1 should be combined to calculate the total stage benefit g i 1 v i t g i 1 1 v i 1 t τ i accordingly the state variable during period t is v t v 1 t v 2 t τ 1 v rn t j 1 n 1 τ j and the stage benefit function can be expressed as 25 g 2 v t i 1 rn g i 1 v i t j 1 i 1 τ j as shown in the green part of fig 3 b the outflow from reservoir i 1 during the period t not only affects the inflow to the reservoir i during the period t τ i 1 but also affects the inflow to reservoir i around the period t τ i 1 therefore this study considered the r 1 i 1 r 2 i 1 period benefits related to the outflow from reservoir i during period t and period t 1 and replaced g 2 v t with g 3 v t 26 g 3 v t g 2 v t i 2 rn j t τ i 1 r 1 i 1 t 1 b i v i j 1 v i j i 2 rn j t 2 t τ i 1 r 2 i 1 1 b i v i j 1 v i j combination of nest computation as shown in fig 4 the inflow to reservoir i during the current operation cycle is affected by the outflow from reservoir i 1 in the current operation cycle and that in the previous operation cycle in terms of reservoir i the inflow from period 1 to τ i 1 1 is mainly affected by the outflow from reservoir i 1 in the previous operation cycle and the inflow from period τ i to t is mainly affected by the outflow from reservoir i 1 in the current operation cycle while performing the calculation for different periods we can adjust the v i t τ i 1 1 t t from period τ i to t but not the v i t 0 t τ i 1 1 from period 1 to τ i 1 1 therefore the total benefit b i 1 of reservoir i from period 1 to τ i 1 1 is constant and the total benefit b i 2 of reservoir i from period τ i to t is increased during the optimal calculation process however b i 1 and b i 2 are affected by the v i t 0 t τ i among the existing improvements the influence of changing the decision variables v i t 0 t τ i on b i 1 and b i 2 is not considered therefore the total benefit b i 1 b i 2 is not optimal to alleviate this problem the nest calculation was added to reallocate the inflow i i t 1 t t among reservoirs i to rn during period 1 to t this is if τ i 1 0 the poa using g 3 v t is adopted to adjust the decision variables of reservoir i to rn once more a detailed description of the npoa calculation is shown below step 1 determine the initial decision schemes the water propagation time and the flow attenuation model we adopt the actual operation schemes of the previous operation cycle as the initial decision schemes hence the initial operation scheme is v 0 v 1 0 v 2 0 v rn 0 where v i 0 v i 0 0 v i 1 0 v i t 0 the initial decision variable is q 0 q 1 0 q 2 0 q rn 0 where q i 0 q i 1 0 q i 2 0 q i t 0 according to eqs 5 and 6 the propagation time is τ τ 1 τ 2 τ rn 1 and the flow attenuation model is γ γ 1 γ 2 γ rn 1 τ 0 0 is assumed additionally the initial total benefit of the cascade is previousbenefit pb with eq 10 step 2 initialize the iteration k 1 reservoir number i 1 and period number t 1

backbone power source of the west to east power transmission project which is located in southwestern china in sichuan province fig 5 the dry season in yalung river basin is from december to march the flood season is from june to september and the transition season is april may october and november the rainfall is abundant throughout the year and the area of the basin is sparsely inhabited thus the main purpose of this cascade hydropower system is to maximize the total hydropower generation the cascade system is composed of the jinxi jindong and guandi hydropower stations and outflow from the jinxi reservoir flows directly into jindong reservoir so the effect of water propagation can be ignored water propagation along with the yalung river cascade hydropower system mainly occurs between the jindong reservoir and the guandi reservoir therefore for the convenience of research only the jindong and guandi reservoirs were used in this analysis the inter zone inflow from the jiulong river was also considered the main parameters for the reservoirs are shown in table 1 the historical data are hourly outflow data from jindong reservoirs and hourly inflow data from guandi reservoirs from 2014 to 2018 the data used in this study are provided by yalung river basin hydropower enterprise the algorithms were realized in microsoft visual studio 2010 3 2 results and discussion 3 2 1 the results of handling water propagation impact with water balance constraints in different ways in this section the dynamic water propagation effect will be discussed in the yalung river cascade hydropower stations in detail the water balance constraints were developed under dynamic water propagation besides the water propagation only considering either propagation time or flow attenuation within water balance constraints was also calculated and analyzed for comparison the difference between them was compared under different variance of outflow sequence and the operation risk caused by the traditional methods will be analyzed to compare the effect of considering water propagation in different ways the historical data of outflow from the jindong reservoir and inflow to the guandi reservoir is used to construct different ways further three indexes including mean absolute error mae mean relative error mre and root mean square error rmse see eqs 28 30 are used to evaluate the accuracy of different ways firstly eq 5 is applied to calculate the relationship between propagation time and the level of the upstream reservoir s outflow as shown in table 2 the outflow of jindong reservoir is divided into two levels by minimizing the root mean squared error 28 rmse 1 m t 1 m i t i t 2 29 mare 1 m t 1 m i t i t i t 100 30 mae 1 m t 1 m i t i t where m is the number of periods i t is the inflow obtained by different methods i t is the observed inflow furthermore based on eq 5 the weighting factor within the muskingum method was calculated using the least squares method subsequently the ratio of jindong reservoir outflow reaches guandi reservoir in different delay times is shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the difference in outflow s level results in different portions of inflow distribution in different periods besides the number of periods during which inflow to the guandi reservoir was affected by the outflow from the jindong reservoir differed when the propagation time is equal to 1 h the inflow to the guandi reservoir during the current period was affected by the outflow from the jindong reservoir during that period and the five periods before that period when the propagation time is equal to 2 h inflow to guandi reservoir during the current period was affected by the outflow from the upstream reservoir during that period and the six periods before that period meanwhile the delay time for the biggest ratio is equal to the corresponding propagation time based on table 2 and fig 6 considering propagation time or flow attenuation changing with outflow level are expressed in table 4 where i t is the inflow of guandi reservoir at period t o t is the outflow of jindong reservoir at period t based on table 3 the simulated results of only considering either propagation time or flow attenuation dynamically in 2018 are presented in table 4 and three indexes are used to evaluate the performance of different ways the closer the rmse mre and mae values are to 0 the smaller the difference between the simulated results and actual inflow it can be seen that the simulated results are different among different conditions compared to level 1 the simulated results of level 2 under two ways are more accurate based on the above analysis it can be known that the flow within level 2 is smaller than flow within level 1 which leads to the distinction of mae and mre under two levels besides under level 1 considering flow attenuation dynamically is significantly inferior to considering propagation time dynamically however under level 2 the three indexes of two ways are closer hence compared to considering water delay time dynamically considering flow attenuation dynamically seems more reasonable in terms of three indexes under two levels furthermore to analyze the importance of handling water propagation dynamically the dynamic water propagation effect in different assumptions was compared to see the difference between them method 1 presents the actual dynamic processes under level 2 and considers the propagation time and flow attenuation simultaneously changed along with the outflow of the upstream reservoir while the assumption which only takes the propagation time dynamically into consideration and ignores the effects of flow attenuation was defined as method 2 conversely the assumption which considers the propagation time and flow attenuation both but unchanged under level 2 was defined as method 3 to compare the impact of different ways in handling the water balance constraints we calculated the inflow of the guandi reservoir the results illustrate the discrepancy among the calculated inflow of three methods and the calculated inflow of guandi reservoir from period 450 to period 650 obtained by different methods as shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the difference between the inflow calculated by different methods is little when the flow sequence is little fluctuant during the continuous periods for example inflow from period 450 to period 490 while when the inflow sequence is large fluctuant during the continuous periods for example inflow from period 560 to period 600 the difference of inflow among three models is obvious besides from fig 7 the difference between various inflow sequences calculated by different methods mainly reflects in the arrival time and the value of flow rate thus when the inflow sequence is large fluctuant the difference among three methods can be illustrated as follow 1 the arrival time of the valley and peak in the inflow sequence calculated by method 2 is the same as that of method 1 but the valley of method 2 is lower that of method 1 and the peak of method 2 is higher than that of method 1 therefore it can be concluded that only considering propagation time within water balance constraints will neglect the effect of flow attenuation and cause the flow rate deviation 2 the arrival time of the valley and peak in the inflow sequence calculated by method 3 is before that of method 1 the valley of method 3 is lower than that of method 1 but higher than that of method 2 and the peak of method 3 is higher than that of method 1 but lower than that of method 2 therefore considering the flow attenuation unchanged may cause the deviation both in arrive time and flow rate furthermore to analyzing the effect of flow fluctuant on the performance of different methods the relationship between variance of outflow sequence which is used to represent flow fluctuant and three indexes are shown in fig 8 fig 8 shows that when the outflow sequence with a lower variance the difference of three indexes between two methods is slight demonstrating that the calculated inflow obtained by method 2 and method 3 is not obvious however when the variance of outflow sequence is larger than 100000 the difference of three indexes between two methods is significant it indicates that considering the water propagation effect dynamic both in propagation time and flow attenuation is more imperative in the large fluctuant inflow sequence furthermore we investigated the impact of different methods on the actual operation risks 30 dispatching experiments were conducted to illustrate the necessity of dynamically considering the water propagation effect according to the actual discharge released from the upstream reservoir the length of each of the 30 operation cycles was 24 h and the length of each scheduling period was 1 h the four indexes of outflow sequence including maximum minimum mean and variance are given in table 5 the output error which represents the actual operation risk of benefit loss was calculated the output error was defined as 31 n e m t n m t actual n m t plan where n e m t is output error in period t of the m th dispatching experiment n m t actual is actual output calculated by inflow with method 1 in period t of the m th dispatching experiment n m t plan is planed output calculated by the optimal operation which is the inflow calculated with method 2 or method 3 in period t of the m th dispatching experiment the total output error and relative output error of m th dispatching experiment were defined as 32 tn e m t 1 t n e m t 33 rn e m t n e m t 1 t n m t plan 100 where tn e m is the total output error in the m th dispatching experiment rn e m is the relative output error in the m th dispatching experiment t is the number of scheduling periods the total output error of different methods in different inflow sequences was shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 a when the variance of outflow sequence is smaller than 10000 the difference of total output error between method 2 and method 3 is slight the average total output error of method 2 and method 3 are 4 12 104 kw and 4 03 104 kw respectively besides it can be seen in fig 9 b that the relative error of method 2 and method 3 are 0 097 and 0 096 respectively meanwhile the two indices of two methods under each scenario are smaller than 0 these results indicate that method 2 which only focuses on propagation time within water balance constraints will lead to more reduction of power generation than considering flow attenuation unchanged when the inflow sequence is little fluctuant as shown in fig 9 a when the variance of outflow sequence is larger than 10000 the difference of total output error between the two methods is more obvious the average total output error of method 2 and method 3 are 3 60 104 kw and 10 89 104 kw respectively besides it can be seen in fig 9 b that the relative error of method 2 and method 3 are 0 092 and 0 243 respectively the two indices of method 2 under each scenario are lower than 0 however the two indices of method 3 may be larger or smaller than 0 therefore it is necessary to select a suitable flow propagation model according to the actual discharge of the upstream reservoir to make an optimal operation scheme to ensure the feasibility of the derived scheme 3 2 2 the results of derived operation schemes with npoa in this section the msdp and npoa are both used for the development of optimal operation schemes and the advantages and disadvantages of the two algorithms can be compared the utilized operation cycle was set at 1 day whereas 1 h was the scheduling period june 1 2014 was randomly selected as an example to conduct the scheduling calculation the inflow of each period of the cascade and the early outflow from the jindong reservoir during the scheduling period are shown in table 6 and table 7 the actual operation scheme of the previous day was adopted as the initial trajectory in the npoa algorithm and used to determine the initial flow propagation model using the iterative calculation described earlier the initial value of the τ was determined to be 2 h and corresponding γ 2 was selected using the msdp algorithm to develop the optimal operation scheme the storage volumes for the two reservoirs were dispersed into 15 points which can satisfy the demand for computer storage with an increase in the number associated with a calculation period the dimensionality of the msdp approach will increase and become more problematic ji et al 2017 showed that when the associated period is 3 h the msdp is more applicable hence during this analysis the calculation initially used a period of 3 h besides according to the method proposed by ji et al 2017 the optimal operation schemes determined by msdp were corrected in the process of error correction the inflow to guandi reservoir was recalculated in which the associated periods were increased to 7 h and the output of guandi reservoir was recalculated based on the corrected inflow the corrected results are shown in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 it can be seen that when the associated period was reduced from 7 h to 3 h the calculated and corrected output of jindong reservoir were similar but the corrected output of the guandi reservoir was higher than the calculated output in order to investigate the reasons the calculated inflow based on msdp and the corrected inflow is given in fig 11 it can be seen in fig 11 that the actual inflow during each period is larger than the calculated inflow using the msdp algorithm resulting in the deviation between the calculated output and actual output therefore we can conclude that diminishing the associated period will lead to a large reduction in the inflow of downstream reservoir and may cause that the total power generation of cascade reservoir is not a optimal solution for npoa the storage volume of the jindong reservoir was discretized as 60 points and that of guandi reservoir was discretized as 90 points the associated period was 6 the operation time of each program is shown in table 8 by analyzing the operation time of the two algorithms the calculation time of the improved npoa algorithm is 12 69 s while that of the msdp algorithm is 2083 12 s which is about 152 times longer than that of the npoa algorithm it is also worth noting that the number of discrete points in npoa is much more than that of msdp which means that the feasible region of npoa is larger than that of msdp owing to the time required to run the msdp algorithm increases exponentially when the feasible region is increased the msdp is hard to find a trade off between the computation time and quality solution when it comes to a cascade system with more than two reservoirs the npoa seems to be more effective in reducing the dimensionality problem caused by water propagation impact fig 12 comparison of water levels within the cascade reservoirs determined using the multi stage dynamic and nested progressive optimality algorithms figs 12 and 13 compares the results from the msdp algorithm and the results from the npoa algorithm it can be seen in fig 12 that the npoa algorithm can more effectively improve the average water level during the operation cycle of jindong reservoir and increased the water level of guandi reservoir earlier to effectively increase power generation due to the number of associated period in npoa is more than that in msdp furthermore as shown in fig 13 the improvement of the average water level increases the total power generation of jindong hydropower and has a tiny effect on the total power generation of guandi hydropower thus the total power generation of cascade reservoirs with the npoa algorithm was higher than that with the msdp algorithm the total power generation by all hydropower stations is shown in table 9 after error correction the generating capacity of the cascade reservoirs under the msdp algorithm was 726 2 104 kw h higher than that calculated by the msdp algorithm the total power generation by the guandi hydropower station based on the proposed npoa algorithm was similar to that of the msdp algorithm but the total power generation by the jindong hydropower station was 141 73 104 kw h higher than that of the msdp algorithm the total power generation by the cascade hydropower stations based on the npoa algorithm was 138 10 104 kw h higher than that based on the msdp algorithm based on the analysis above we can conclude that reducing the associated period is not conducive to deriving the optimal schemes and therefore the npoa can ensure a quality solution while significantly reducing the dimensionality problem caused by water propagation impact 4 conclusions water propagation between cascade reservoirs produces difficulties in the modeling and solution of the short term optimal operation for power generation there are currently few methods that simultaneously consider the dynamic change in the propagation time of water between reservoirs and flow attenuation in the optimization process in this paper propagation time and flow attenuation during water flow propagation were both considered as optimization variables to form the modified scroo model besides an improved npoa algorithm was proposed to address the limitations of traditional algorithms dealing with the after effect problem associated with water propagation inherent in the solution of modified scroo model the conclusions and contributions can be summarized as follows the fact that propagation time and flow attenuation models differ with the magnitude of an upstream reservoir s outflow has been theoretically demonstrated to improve the accuracy and feasibility of the solution the effect of the propagation time and flow attenuation models on water propagation were treated as variables and solved using the successive approximation method the results show that only considering propagation or taking flow attenuation unchanged within water balance constraints will cause the deviation of downstream reservoir s inflow and this deviation will further lead to the actual operation risk of benefit loss besides the reduction of power generation caused by different methods in handling water propagation impact will lead to different magnitudes of benefit loss when the inflow sequence is different in order to balance the accuracy and timeliness of derived optimal operation schemes of cascade reservoirs an improved nested progressive optimality algorithm was proposed in this study for the calculation of the modified scroo model the results show that compared with the multi stage dynamic programming algorithm the developed nested progressive optimality algorithm can greatly improve the actual power generation because it considers the impact of the outflow from upstream reservoirs during every period on the discharge decision of downstream reservoirs meanwhile the dimensionality problems caused by the effect of water propagation effect was significantly reduced when a cascade system with more than two reservoirs the operation time of msdp becomes more serious and cannot be adopted but the operation time of nopa is considerably smaller than that of msdp thus the nopa is more applicable in a cascade system with a larger number of reservoirs in this paper the dynamic change of water propagation between cascade reservoirs is considered and the npoa is proposed to solve the modified scroo model however the muskingum method is the simplest form of the saint venant equations thus for further research more accurate methods of water propagation solving could be discussed and explored to characterize the inflow to downstream reservoirs in a cascade besides the optimization that was performed herein is based on the need to maximize power generation given the available water however in many instances reservoir water levels are not only managed to optimize power generation but to ensure that ecological flows are maintained that there is sufficient water for irrigation and to maintain adequate recreational opportunities in addition to several other factors therefore these constraints should be incorporated into this proposed approach in the future declaration of competing interest

4224,difficulty remains to represent water propagation impact to construct water balance constraints for the short term cascade reservoirs optimal operation scroo due to the complex water propagation mechanism existing between cascade reservoirs the imprecise representation of water propagation impact hinders the implementation of hydropower generation schemes and leads to operational risks thus a modified scroo model considering water propagation impact was proposed in this study to improve the accuracy of cascade operation specifically water propagation is expressed using the muskingum method in the modified scroo model and characterized by two variables including propagation time related to the magnitude of the upstream reservoir s outflow and flow attenuation related to the propagation time which were identified using the successive approximation method under water balance constraints within the modified scroo model subsequently this research applied the nested progressive optimality algorithm npoa in the model calculation innovatively in which the stage benefit function and nest computation could be improved the modified model and algorithm developed herein were applied and validated on cascade reservoirs along the yalung river in china by comparing it with traditional methods and algorithms the results show that 1 compared to traditional methods considering water propagation within water balance constraints as a dynamic parameter can calculate the inflow of downstream reservoir more accurately and mitigate risks in the actual operation of cascade reservoirs besides the reservoir inflow calculated by traditional methods will lead to different magnitudes of benefit loss and 2 the npoa can significantly reduce dimensionality problems caused by the water propagation impact and greatly improve the actual hydropower generation than that of a traditional optimal algorithm multi stage dynamic programming msdp compared to the msdp the nopa is more applicable in a cascade system with a larger number of reservoirs the modified model and algorithm can significantly improve the effectiveness of cascade reservoir optimal operation schemes and provide more information for decision makers keywords hydropower optimal operation cascade reservoirs water propagation muskingum method successive approximation method nested progressive optimality algorithm 1 introduction the optimal operation of cascade reservoirs has many considerable functions such as power generation flood control and water supply li et al 2018 elie et al 2019 using short term quantitative precipitation forecasts the short term cascade reservoirs optimal operation scroo model can be combined with modern computing techniques and optimization methods to allocate water to effectively manage water resources xu et al 2014 tan et al 2020 pulkit et al 2020 meanwhile in the process of developing optimal operation schemes several problems need to be considered including the uncertainty inherent in streamflow forecasts zhao and zhao 2014 wang et al 2017 the complex hydrologic hydraulic and electric connections among cascade hydropower stations ji et al 2018 chen et al 2014 and the reasonableness of optimal algorithm which can ensure the superiority of the solution results and the calculation time meeting the requirements of practical application jiang et al 2019 feng et al 2020 among the potential sources of risks the simplification of water balance constraints may lead to the imprecise construction of the scroo models particularly consideration of water propagation within water balance constraints for the scroo model is a challenging but necessary component to assess generally water propagation between reservoirs refers to the outflow of water from an upstream reservoir and its movement into a downstream reservoir after traveling through a natural channel ji et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the accurate characterization of water propagation makes the construction of a scroo model more accurate reducing the risk of loss in the actual operation of cascade reservoirs zhang et al 2017 however the characterization of water propagation effect within water balance constraints is complicated due to the complex water propagation mechanism existing between cascade reservoirs ts and ad 2012 tong et al 2013 ge et al 2018 at present two typical approaches are normally used to handle water propagation in the construction of a scroo model the first approach mainly focuses on the propagation time and ignores water flow attenuation in the formulation of scheduling problems in hydropower generation some studies fix the propagation time as a constant to simplify the influence of water propagation hsu and wei 2007 zhong et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 under such assumptions the outflow from an upstream reservoir directly flows into the downstream reservoir after a constant propagation time without considering the dynamic nature of water propagation through time or space however han et al 2013 and ge et al 2014 argued that propagation time could be described as a function of the magnitude of the upstream reservoir s outflow they then constructed a mathematical step function that related the propagation time to the outflow from an upstream reservoir which can reduce the difficulty of solving operation model ge et al 2014 nevertheless such approximations could not fit all the regions along a river especially where streamflow routing does not follow a simple relationship between the outflow of upstream reservoir and propagation time the second approach predominantly focuses on flow attenuation along the channel while the propagation time was fixed as a constant within the flow attenuation model ts and ad 2012 and diniz and souza 2014 for example divided the outflow of upstream reservoirs into different portions and these portions reach the downstream reservoirs at different times and results show the importance of taking the flow attenuation within the water balance constraints into account for the brazilian hydropower system zhang et al 2016 and ji et al 2017 used the muskingum method to handle the effect of flow attenuation caused by streamflow routing behavior which was then incorporated into the construction of scroo models for yalung cascade hydropower stations furthermore zhang et al 2019 regarded the relationship between the upstream outflow and downstream inflow as a problem that could be solved using an artificial neural network of flow attenuation those previous studies have proved that the flow attenuation impact always varies according to the outflow of upstream reservoirs and the operating condition of the river channel therefore it can be concluded that it is unreasonable to suppose the flow attenuation effect unchanged in the scroo model taking the effect of water propagation into consideration water balance constraints become complicated decisions concerning the release of water from upstream reservoirs at a specific time will not only affect decisions concerning the discharge of water from downstream reservoirs at that time but affect later decisions about the management of downstream flows put differently the normal scroo model is unable to satisfy the principle of optimality bellman 1966 the traditional dynamic programming dp which is one of the methods used to effectively solve the scroo problem where the effects of water propagation can be ignored is not applicable hence ji et al 2017 proposed the use of multi stage dynamic programming msdp this approach has been theoretically proven to exhibit the global convergence needed to solve the problem but issues related to dimensionality become problematic which means the computation time increases exponentially with the growing quantity of reservoirs chu et al 2014 ji et al 2018 some studies have alternatively employed linear programming to solve this problem but the linearization of some constraints in the model reduces the feasibility of using such schemes tong et al 2013 ge et al 2014 when using heuristic algorithms to solve this problem the stability and reliability of the algorithms cannot be guaranteed han et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 therefore there is a very practical and urgent need to find a reliable algorithm that can balance the performance of hydropower generation schemes and the time needed for model solving stated thus there is a very practical and urgent need to construct a reasonable scroo model considering water propagation and develop a reliable algorithm for the effective model calculation thus the objectives of this paper are 1 develop a modified scroo model which makes the representation of water balance constraints more precise and reduce the actual operation risk 2 propose an effective algorithm to derive the optimal operation schemes from the modified scroo model and reach the balance on both the reliability of hydropower generation schemes and the computation time specifically the impact of water propagation on the proposed modified scroo model in this study is quantified by two components including propagation time and flow attenuation the dynamic simultaneous effects of both components on the results of a scroo model are investigated subsequently a nested progressive optimality algorithm npoa is proposed to derive the operation schemes in which the stage benefit function was improved and nest computation was combined the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the construction of the modified scroo model considering water propagation as a dynamic process and the use of an improved npoa for model solving then the newly developed model and algorithm are applied to a case study in section 3 and the performance of the modified model and the new proposed algorithm is analyzed in section 4 finally section 5 provides a summary of the paper s conclusions 2 methodology 2 1 dynamic handling of water propagation impact with propagation time and flow attenuation when there exists a natural channel between cascade reservoirs the outflow from the upstream reservoir is affected over a period of time by the natural channel before it enters the downstream reservoir the description of this between reservoir flow is called water propagation and this impact can be expressed as 1 w i t ψ i 1 o i 1 1 o i 1 2 o i 1 t where w i t is the inflow to reservoir i during period t which is from the outflow of an upstream reservoir i 1 o i 1 t is the total discharge of reservoir i 1 during period t ψ i 1 is the relationship between the outflow of reservoir i 1 and the inflow to the reservoir i the key to characterizing the water propagation is to find a proper ψ i 1 which makes the w i t close to reality but this ψ i 1 is difficult to be obtained because ψ i 1 is changeable along with the variations of outflow from the upstream reservoir given these considerations the ψ i 1 is characterized by two dynamic variables in this study using the muskingum method the muskingum method which represents a linear mathematical approach is a simple form of the saint venant equations that are widely applied in water resources management reggiani and price 2013 barbetta et al 2017 when the i 1th reservoir outflow sequence o i 1 1 o i 1 2 o i 1 t is known the inflow sequence w i 1 w i 2 w i t to the downstream reservoir can be calculated by eq 2 adopting the muskingum method 2 w i t j t d t p t j i 1 o i 1 j where p t j i 1 is the ratio of the outflow from the i 1th reservoir during period t j that enters the ith reservoir during period t and d is the largest time interval number that affects the inflow of ith reservoir in period t the elaborate calculation of p t j i 1 has been given in previous studies birkhead and james 2002 barbetta et al 2017 the value of p t j i 1 is affected by k and x k is the storage time constant for the river reach which possesses a value based on the time reasonably needed for the water to propagate along the river reach and is a weighting factor varying between 0 and 0 5 by using the muskingum method to describe water propagation between cascading reservoirs the effect of water propagation on the modified scroo model can be considered from two aspects propagation time which is equal to k and flow attenuation which is related to k and x a detailed description of the analysis is provided below 2 1 1 propagation time between reservoirs the inflow to a downstream reservoir i during period t as determined using eq 2 is influenced by the outflow from the upstream reservoirs i 1 during the period extending from t d to time t the amount of water released from the upstream reservoir i 1 to a cascade will be split into several parts which will arrive at the downstream reservoir i at different periods and will consist of different proportions of the total upstream outflow the ratio of the outflow from the upstream reservoir i 1 during period t r r 0 1 d that enters the downstream reservoir during period t is p r from eq 2 p k δ t is the biggest value of p r r 0 1 d which demonstrates that the inflow to the downstream reservoir i during period t is mainly affected by the outflow from the upstream reservoir during the period t k δ t therefore the majority of outflow from reservoir i 1 arrives at reservoir i after experiencing a propagation time k as shown in fig 1 the time of the smallest outflow a from the upstream reservoir i 1 that arrives at the inflow a1 to the downstream reservoir is τ 1 the time of the largest outflow b from the upstream reservoir that arrives at the inflow b1 to the downstream reservoir i is τ 2 if flow attenuation is not considered and the cross sectional area of river channel is constant then the relationship between propagation time and the magnitude of the upstream reservoir s outflow can be expressed by eq 3 han et al 2013 ge et al 2018 and the result for when τ 1 τ 2 is deduced 3 τ 1 3600 a δ l x 1 x 2 u where τ is the propagation time a is the cross sectional area of the discharge δ l x 1 x 2 is the distance between the discharge section x 1 and the discharge section x 2 and u is the flow rate 2 1 2 flow attenuation between reservoirs in fig 1 when the smallest outflow o a from the upstream reservoir i 1 arrives at the downstream reservoir i after a time duration of τ 1 the inflow to the downstream reservoir w i t τ 1 can be deduced as follows 4 w i t τ 1 r t 1 τ 1 h a t 1 τ 1 p t 1 τ 1 r o r given that o a min o t 1 τ 1 h a o t 1 τ 1 the result o a w i t τ 1 can be determined fig 1 similarly when the biggest outflow o b from the upstream reservoir arrives at the downstream reservoir after a time duration of τ 2 the inflow to the downstream reservoir w i t τ 2 is smaller than o b the above results are influenced by the effect of flow attenuation hence the behavior of flow attenuation can be described such that when the smaller outflow from the upstream reservoir turns into the downstream reservoir flow rate will increase when the larger outflow from the upstream reservoir enters the downstream reservoir it will decrease the effect of flow attenuation thus depends on the value of p r r 0 1 h and when propagation time k is determined the value of p r is affected by weighting factor x 2 1 3 formulation of water balance constraints in the modified scroo model from the above analysis the effect of water propagation was divided into two components if the average outflow from the upstream reservoir during the entire operational period the duration of an operation scheme is known the propagation time τ and the value of p r can be determined by doing so ψ i 1 can be expressed by eq 5 and eq 6 5 τ i 1 φ i 1 t 1 t o i 1 t t 6 w i t γ i 1 τ i 1 o i 1 1 o i 1 2 o i 1 t j t τ i 1 r 1 i 1 t τ i 1 r 2 i 1 p t τ i 1 j i 1 o i 1 j where φ i 1 is a function of the relationship between the average outflow from the upstream reservoir i 1 during the entire operational period and the propagation time this function is often described as a step function γ i 1 τ i 1 represents the flow attenuation model related to τ i 1 r 1 i 1 is the period before the period t τ i 1 that is affected by the outflow from the reservoir i 1 during period t r 2 i 1 is the period after the period t τ i 1 that is affected by the outflow from the reservoir i 1during the period t r r 1 i 1 r 2 i 1 1 is the total period effected by the outflow from the upstream reservoir during period t p t τ i 1 j i 1 is the fraction of the outflow o i 1 j that enters the downstream reservoir during period t furthermore using the dynamic representation of the water propagation impact with two dynamic variables the water balance constraints for the modified scroo model can be expressed as eq 5 and eqs 7 9 7 v i t v i t 1 i i t o i t δ t 8 i i t s i t w i t 9 o i t q i t q i t where v i t is the water capacity of a reservoir i at the end of period t δ t is the duration of an operation period s i t is the inflow to a reservoir i during the period t from the zone between reservoirs q i t is the generating water flow from reservoir i used to produce power during the period t and q i t is the abandoned discharge from a reservoir i during the period t modified scroo model considering water propagation impact in a dynamic way 2 1 4 objective function during the process of developing the modified scroo model the optimal goals of the operation policy are chosen for various assumptions the maximization of total hydropower production was chosen as the optimal goal in this study thus the objective function can be written as wang et al 2017 10 maxe i 1 rn t 1 t b i v i t 1 i i t o i t i 1 rn t 1 t b i v i t 1 v

t is the number of periods b i v i t 1 i i t o i t is the utility function of reservoir i which also can be defined as b i v i t 1 v i t k i is the output coefficient of reservoir i h i t is the net water head for reservoir i in period t 2 1 5 constraint requirements 1 water balance constraints imposed on the system are expressed with eq 5 and eqs 7 9 2 capacity constraints inherent in the system include 12 v min i v i t v max i where v min i and v max i are the minimum and maximum storage volume of the reservoir i at the end of period t respectively 3 the outflow constraints are 13 o min i o i t o max i 14 q i t q max i where o min i and o max i are the minimum and maximum outflow of reservoir i during the period t respectively q max i is the maximum generating water flow of reservoir i during the period t 4 the output constraints are 15 n min i n i t n max i where n min i and n max i are the minimum and maximum output from the hydropower station for reservoir i during the period t respectively 5 the boundary constraints are defined as 16 z i 0 z i ini z i t z i term where z i ini and z i term are the water levels of a reservoir at the beginning and end of the entire operational cycle respectively 6 the net water head equation constraint 17 h i t 1 2 z i t 1 z i t z i t h i t loss where z i t is the forebay level of reservoir i at the end of period t z i t is the average tailrace level of reservoir i during period t h i t loss is the head loss of reservoir i during period t 7 the reservoir forebay level and storage constraint 18 z i t s s r i v i t where ss r i v i t

of reservoir i 9 the water head loss equation constraint 20 h i t loss s h q i q i t where sh q i q i t is the head loss curve of a reservoir i 10 the expected output equation constraint 21 n max i e o i h i t where e o i h i t is the expected output curve of hydropower from reservoir i 11 there is also a non negative constraint 22 x t 0 this constraint specifies that all of the above variables must be non negative 2 2 model solving to derive the optimal solution accurately model development was subdivided into two parts the first part was aimed at determining the propagation time τ i 1 and the flow attenuation model γ i 1 τ i 1 using the successive approximation method subsequently the npoa was used to derive the operation schemes 2 2 1 determining the propagation time and flow attenuation model using the successive approximation method given that outflow from an upstream reservoir is a dynamic variable in the optimization calculation we cannot determine the propagation time or the flow attenuation model before the optimization calculation hence herein the propagation time and flow attenuation model are considered optimization variables that were initialized before the model was solved that is using the successive approximation method sam the two variables were changed during the process of model solving steps used during the calculation are described below whereas a flowchart illustrating the linkages between these steps is shown in fig 2 step 1 determine the initial values for the propagation time τ 1 τ 1 1 τ 2 1 τ rn 1 1 and flow attenuation model γ 1 γ 1 τ 1 1 γ 2 τ 1 1 γ rn 1 τ 1 1 and initialize the iterations m 1 where τ i m is the propagation time between reservoir i and reservoir i 1 during iteration m and γ i τ i m is the flow attenuation model between reservoir i and reservoir i 1 related to τ i m step 2 according to the specified τ m and γ τ m use the optimal algorithm to derive the outflow q i m q i 1 m q i 2 m q i t m from every reservoir in the cascade q i t m is the outflow from a reservoir during the period t for the iteration m step 3 redetermine the propagation time τ m 1 and flow attenuation model γ τ m 1 using eq 5 and eq 6 step 4 if τ m 1 τ m 0 save the calculation results as output otherwise change iteration to m m 1 and return to step 2 2 2 2 model solving based on npoa progressive optimality algorithm poa is an improved dp that simplifies this complicated multi stage decision into a two stage decision problem significantly mitigating the dimensionality issue however the traditional poa has not been able to handle the scroo problem when considering water propagation ji et al 2017 ji et al 2018 hence an improved poa named npoa is proposed in this study to solve the scroo problem when affected by water propagation the proposed npoa is generated in two aspects including the improvement of stage benefit function and the combination of nest computation improvement of the stage benefit function a water propagation in traditional poa yellow part the outflow from the upstream reservoir during the period t will affect the inflow to the downstream reservoir at the same period t b water propagation in npoa yellow part the outflow from the upstream reservoir during the period t will affect the inflow to the downstream reservoir during period t τ i 1 green part the outflow from upstream reservoir during the period t will affect the inflow to the downstream reservoir around the period t τ i 1 as shown in fig 3 a in traditional poa the propagation time and flow attenuation are neglected in this case we only need to allocate cascade inflow between the two periods to maximize the total benefit of the two periods taking the state variables v t v 1 t v 2 t v rn t as decision variables the stage benefit function of poa can be expressed by eq 23 23 g 1 v t i 1 rn g i 1 v i t 24 g i 1 v i t b i v i t 1 v i t b i v i t v i t 1 where g 1 v t is the total hydropower generation at stage t when the decision variable is v t g i 1 v i t is the hydropower generation in reservoir i during period t v i t 1 is the optimal decision during the previous iteration v i t 1 is the optimal decision during the current iteration as shown in the yellow part of fig 3 b when propagation time is considered the inflow to reservoir i during period t τ i 1 is mainly derived from the outflow from reservoir i during period t the state variables v i 1 t and v i t τ i 1 should be combined to calculate the total stage benefit g i 1 v i t g i 1 1 v i 1 t τ i accordingly the state variable during period t is v t v 1 t v 2 t τ 1 v rn t j 1 n 1 τ j and the stage benefit function can be expressed as 25 g 2 v t i 1 rn g i 1 v i t j 1 i 1 τ j as shown in the green part of fig 3 b the outflow from reservoir i 1 during the period t not only affects the inflow to the reservoir i during the period t τ i 1 but also affects the inflow to reservoir i around the period t τ i 1 therefore this study considered the r 1 i 1 r 2 i 1 period benefits related to the outflow from reservoir i during period t and period t 1 and replaced g 2 v t with g 3 v t 26 g 3 v t g 2 v t i 2 rn j t τ i 1 r 1 i 1 t 1 b i v i j 1 v i j i 2 rn j t 2 t τ i 1 r 2 i 1 1 b i v i j 1 v i j combination of nest computation as shown in fig 4 the inflow to reservoir i during the current operation cycle is affected by the outflow from reservoir i 1 in the current operation cycle and that in the previous operation cycle in terms of reservoir i the inflow from period 1 to τ i 1 1 is mainly affected by the outflow from reservoir i 1 in the previous operation cycle and the inflow from period τ i to t is mainly affected by the outflow from reservoir i 1 in the current operation cycle while performing the calculation for different periods we can adjust the v i t τ i 1 1 t t from period τ i to t but not the v i t 0 t τ i 1 1 from period 1 to τ i 1 1 therefore the total benefit b i 1 of reservoir i from period 1 to τ i 1 1 is constant and the total benefit b i 2 of reservoir i from period τ i to t is increased during the optimal calculation process however b i 1 and b i 2 are affected by the v i t 0 t τ i among the existing improvements the influence of changing the decision variables v i t 0 t τ i on b i 1 and b i 2 is not considered therefore the total benefit b i 1 b i 2 is not optimal to alleviate this problem the nest calculation was added to reallocate the inflow i i t 1 t t among reservoirs i to rn during period 1 to t this is if τ i 1 0 the poa using g 3 v t is adopted to adjust the decision variables of reservoir i to rn once more a detailed description of the npoa calculation is shown below step 1 determine the initial decision schemes the water propagation time and the flow attenuation model we adopt the actual operation schemes of the previous operation cycle as the initial decision schemes hence the initial operation scheme is v 0 v 1 0 v 2 0 v rn 0 where v i 0 v i 0 0 v i 1 0 v i t 0 the initial decision variable is q 0 q 1 0 q 2 0 q rn 0 where q i 0 q i 1 0 q i 2 0 q i t 0 according to eqs 5 and 6 the propagation time is τ τ 1 τ 2 τ rn 1 and the flow attenuation model is γ γ 1 γ 2 γ rn 1 τ 0 0 is assumed additionally the initial total benefit of the cascade is previousbenefit pb with eq 10 step 2 initialize the iteration k 1 reservoir number i 1 and period number t 1 discretize the storage volumes in the reservoirs between v min i and v max i into m points return to step 3 step 3 the calculation for reservoir i during period t first determine the longest

backbone power source of the west to east power transmission project which is located in southwestern china in sichuan province fig 5 the dry season in yalung river basin is from december to march the flood season is from june to september and the transition season is april may october and november the rainfall is abundant throughout the year and the area of the basin is sparsely inhabited thus the main purpose of this cascade hydropower system is to maximize the total hydropower generation the cascade system is composed of the jinxi jindong and guandi hydropower stations and outflow from the jinxi reservoir flows directly into jindong reservoir so the effect of water propagation can be ignored water propagation along with the yalung river cascade hydropower system mainly occurs between the jindong reservoir and the guandi reservoir therefore for the convenience of research only the jindong and guandi reservoirs were used in this analysis the inter zone inflow from the jiulong river was also considered the main parameters for the reservoirs are shown in table 1 the historical data are hourly outflow data from jindong reservoirs and hourly inflow data from guandi reservoirs from 2014 to 2018 the data used in this study are provided by yalung river basin hydropower enterprise the algorithms were realized in microsoft visual studio 2010 3 2 results and discussion 3 2 1 the results of handling water propagation impact with water balance constraints in different ways in this section the dynamic water propagation effect will be discussed in the yalung river cascade hydropower stations in detail the water balance constraints were developed under dynamic water propagation besides the water propagation only considering either propagation time or flow attenuation within water balance constraints was also calculated and analyzed for comparison the difference between them was compared under different variance of outflow sequence and the operation risk caused by the traditional methods will be analyzed to compare the effect of considering water propagation in different ways the historical data of outflow from the jindong reservoir and inflow to the guandi reservoir is used to construct different ways further three indexes including mean absolute error mae mean relative error mre and root mean square error rmse see eqs 28 30 are used to evaluate the accuracy of different ways firstly eq 5 is applied to calculate the relationship between propagation time and the level of the upstream reservoir s outflow as shown in table 2 the outflow of jindong reservoir is divided into two levels by minimizing the root mean squared error 28 rmse 1 m t 1 m i t i t 2 29 mare 1 m t 1 m i t i t i t 100 30 mae 1 m t 1 m i t i t where m is the number of periods i t is the inflow obtained by different methods i t is the observed inflow furthermore based on eq 5 the weighting factor within the muskingum method was calculated using the least squares method subsequently the ratio of jindong reservoir outflow reaches guandi reservoir in different delay times is shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the difference in outflow s level results in different portions of inflow distribution in different periods besides the number of periods during which inflow to the guandi reservoir was affected by the outflow from the jindong reservoir differed when the propagation time is equal to 1 h the inflow to the guandi reservoir during the current period was affected by the outflow from the jindong reservoir during that period and the five periods before that period when the propagation time is equal to 2 h inflow to guandi reservoir during the current period was affected by the outflow from the upstream reservoir during that period and the six periods before that period meanwhile the delay time for the biggest ratio is equal to the corresponding propagation time based on table 2 and fig 6 considering propagation time or flow attenuation changing with outflow level are expressed in table 4 where i t is the inflow of guandi reservoir at period t o t is the outflow of jindong reservoir at period t based on table 3 the simulated results of only considering either propagation time or flow attenuation dynamically in 2018 are presented in table 4 and three indexes are used to evaluate the performance of different ways the closer the rmse mre and mae values are to 0 the smaller the difference between the simulated results and actual inflow it can be seen that the simulated results are different among different conditions compared to level 1 the simulated results of level 2 under two ways are more accurate based on the above analysis it can be known that the flow within level 2 is smaller than flow within level 1 which leads to the distinction of mae and mre under two levels besides under level 1 considering flow attenuation dynamically is significantly inferior to considering propagation time dynamically however under level 2 the three indexes of two ways are closer hence compared to considering water delay time dynamically considering flow attenuation dynamically seems more reasonable in terms of three indexes under two levels furthermore to analyze the importance of handling water propagation dynamically the dynamic water propagation effect in different assumptions was compared to see the difference between them method 1 presents the actual dynamic processes under level 2 and considers the propagation time and flow attenuation simultaneously changed along with the outflow of the upstream reservoir while the assumption which only takes the propagation time dynamically into consideration and ignores the effects of flow attenuation was defined as method 2 conversely the assumption which considers the propagation time and flow attenuation both but unchanged under level 2 was defined as method 3 to compare the impact of different ways in handling the water balance constraints we calculated the inflow of the guandi reservoir the results illustrate the discrepancy among the calculated inflow of three methods and the calculated inflow of guandi reservoir from period 450 to period 650 obtained by different methods as shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the difference between the inflow calculated by different methods is little when the flow sequence is little fluctuant during the continuous periods for example inflow from period 450 to period 490 while when the inflow sequence is large fluctuant during the continuous periods for example inflow from period 560 to period 600 the difference of inflow among three models is obvious besides from fig 7 the difference between various inflow sequences calculated by different methods mainly reflects in the arrival time and the value of flow rate thus when the inflow sequence is large fluctuant the difference among three methods can be illustrated as follow 1 the arrival time of the valley and peak in the inflow sequence calculated by method 2 is the same as that of method 1 but the valley of method 2 is lower that of method 1 and the peak of method 2 is higher than that of method 1 therefore it can be concluded that only considering propagation time within water balance constraints will neglect the effect of flow attenuation and cause the flow rate deviation 2 the arrival time of the valley and peak in the inflow sequence calculated by method 3 is before that of method 1 the valley of method 3 is lower than that of method 1 but higher than that of method 2 and the peak of method 3 is higher than that of method 1 but lower than that of method 2 therefore considering the flow attenuation unchanged may cause the deviation both in arrive time and flow rate furthermore to analyzing the effect of flow fluctuant on the performance of different methods the relationship between variance of outflow sequence which is used to represent flow fluctuant and three indexes are shown in fig 8 fig 8 shows that when the outflow sequence with a lower variance the difference of three indexes between two methods is slight demonstrating that the calculated inflow obtained by method 2 and method 3 is not obvious however when the variance of outflow sequence is larger than 100000 the difference of three indexes between two methods is significant it indicates that considering the water propagation effect dynamic both in propagation time and flow attenuation is more imperative in the large fluctuant inflow sequence furthermore we investigated the impact of different methods on the actual operation risks 30 dispatching experiments were conducted to illustrate the necessity of dynamically considering the water propagation effect according to the actual discharge released from the upstream reservoir the length of each of the 30 operation cycles was 24 h and the length of each scheduling period was 1 h the four indexes of outflow sequence including maximum minimum mean and variance are given in table 5 the output error which represents the actual operation risk of benefit loss was calculated the output error was defined as 31 n e m t n m t actual n m t plan where n e m t is output error in period t of the m th dispatching experiment n m t actual is actual output calculated by inflow with method 1 in period t of the m th dispatching experiment n m t plan is planed output calculated by the optimal operation which is the inflow calculated with method 2 or method 3 in period t of the m th dispatching experiment the total output error and relative output error of m th dispatching experiment were defined as 32 tn e m t 1 t n e m t 33 rn e m t n e m t 1 t n m t plan 100 where tn e m is the total output error in the m th dispatching experiment rn e m is the relative output error in the m th dispatching experiment t is the number of scheduling periods the total output error of different methods in different inflow sequences was shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 a when the variance of outflow sequence is smaller than 10000 the difference of total output error between method 2 and method 3 is slight the average total output error of method 2 and method 3 are 4 12 104 kw and 4 03 104 kw respectively besides it can be seen in fig 9 b that the relative error of method 2 and method 3 are 0 097 and 0 096 respectively meanwhile the two indices of two methods under each scenario are smaller than 0 these results indicate that method 2 which only focuses on propagation time within water balance constraints will lead to more reduction of power generation than considering flow attenuation unchanged when the inflow sequence is little fluctuant as shown in fig 9 a when the variance of outflow sequence is larger than 10000 the difference of total output error between the two methods is more obvious the average total output error of method 2 and method 3 are 3 60 104 kw and 10 89 104 kw respectively besides it can be seen in fig 9 b that the relative error of method 2 and method 3 are 0 092 and 0 243 respectively the two indices of method 2 under each scenario are lower than 0 however the two indices of method 3 may be larger or smaller than 0 therefore it is necessary to select a suitable flow propagation model according to the actual discharge of the upstream reservoir to make an optimal operation scheme to ensure the feasibility of the derived scheme 3 2 2 the results of derived operation schemes with npoa in this section the msdp and npoa are both used for the development of optimal operation schemes and the advantages and disadvantages of the two algorithms can be compared the utilized operation cycle was set at 1 day whereas 1 h was the scheduling period june 1 2014 was randomly selected as an example to conduct the scheduling calculation the inflow of each period of the cascade and the early outflow from the jindong reservoir during the scheduling period are shown in table 6 and table 7 the actual operation scheme of the previous day was adopted as the initial trajectory in the npoa algorithm and used to determine the initial flow propagation model using the iterative calculation described earlier the initial value of the τ was determined to be 2 h and corresponding γ 2 was selected using the msdp algorithm to develop the optimal operation scheme the storage volumes for the two reservoirs were dispersed into 15 points which can satisfy the demand for computer storage with an increase in the number associated with a calculation period the dimensionality of the msdp approach will increase and become more problematic ji et al 2017 showed that when the associated period is 3 h the msdp is more applicable hence during this analysis the calculation initially used a period of 3 h besides according to the method proposed by ji et al 2017 the optimal operation schemes determined by msdp were corrected in the process of error correction the inflow to guandi reservoir was recalculated in which the associated periods were increased to 7 h and the output of guandi reservoir was recalculated based on the corrected inflow the corrected results are shown in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 it can be seen that when the associated period was reduced from 7 h to 3 h the calculated and corrected output of jindong reservoir were similar but the corrected output of the guandi reservoir was higher than the calculated output in order to investigate the reasons the calculated inflow based on msdp and the corrected inflow is given in fig 11 it can be seen in fig 11 that the actual inflow during each period is larger than the calculated inflow using the msdp algorithm resulting in the deviation between the calculated output and actual output therefore we can conclude that diminishing the associated period will lead to a large reduction in the inflow of downstream reservoir and may cause that the total power generation of cascade reservoir is not a optimal solution for npoa the storage volume of the jindong reservoir was discretized as 60 points and that of guandi reservoir was discretized as 90 points the associated period was 6 the operation time of each program is shown in table 8 by analyzing the operation time of the two algorithms the calculation time of the improved npoa algorithm is 12 69 s while that of the msdp algorithm is 2083 12 s which is about 152 times longer than that of the npoa algorithm it is also worth noting that the number of discrete points in npoa is much more than that of msdp which means that the feasible region of npoa is larger than that of msdp owing to the time required to run the msdp algorithm increases exponentially when the feasible region is increased the msdp is hard to find a trade off between the computation time and quality solution when it comes to a cascade system with more than two reservoirs the npoa seems to be more effective in reducing the dimensionality problem caused by water propagation impact fig 12 comparison of water levels within the cascade reservoirs determined using the multi stage dynamic and nested progressive optimality algorithms figs 12 and 13 compares the results from the msdp algorithm and the results from the npoa algorithm it can be seen in fig 12 that the npoa algorithm can more effectively improve the average water level during the operation cycle of jindong reservoir and increased the water level of guandi reservoir earlier to effectively increase power generation due to the number of associated period in npoa is more than that in msdp furthermore as shown in fig 13 the improvement of the average water level increases the total power generation of jindong hydropower and has a tiny effect on the total power generation of guandi hydropower thus the total power generation of cascade reservoirs with the npoa algorithm was higher than that with the msdp algorithm the total power generation by all hydropower stations is shown in table 9 after error correction the generating capacity of the cascade reservoirs under the msdp algorithm was 726 2 104 kw h higher than that calculated by the msdp algorithm the total power generation by the guandi hydropower station based on the proposed npoa algorithm was similar to that of the msdp algorithm but the total power generation by the jindong hydropower station was 141 73 104 kw h higher than that of the msdp algorithm the total power generation by the cascade hydropower stations based on the npoa algorithm was 138 10 104 kw h higher than that based on the msdp algorithm based on the analysis above we can conclude that reducing the associated period is not conducive to deriving the optimal schemes and therefore the npoa can ensure a quality solution while significantly reducing the dimensionality problem caused by water propagation impact 4 conclusions water propagation between cascade reservoirs produces difficulties in the modeling and solution of the short term optimal operation for power generation there are currently few methods that simultaneously consider the dynamic change in the propagation time of water between reservoirs and flow attenuation in the optimization process in this paper propagation time and flow attenuation during water flow propagation were both considered as optimization variables to form the modified scroo model besides an improved npoa algorithm was proposed to address the limitations of traditional algorithms dealing with the after effect problem associated with water propagation inherent in the solution of modified scroo model the conclusions and contributions can be summarized as follows the fact that propagation time and flow attenuation models differ with the magnitude of an upstream reservoir s outflow has been theoretically demonstrated to improve the accuracy and feasibility of the solution the effect of the propagation time and flow attenuation models on water propagation were treated as variables and solved using the successive approximation method the results show that only considering propagation or taking flow attenuation unchanged within water balance constraints will cause the deviation of downstream reservoir s inflow and this deviation will further lead to the actual operation risk of benefit loss besides the reduction of power generation caused by different methods in handling water propagation impact will lead to different magnitudes of benefit loss when the inflow sequence is different in order to balance the accuracy and timeliness of derived optimal operation schemes of cascade reservoirs an improved nested progressive optimality algorithm was proposed in this study for the calculation of the modified scroo model the results show that compared with the multi stage dynamic programming algorithm the developed nested progressive optimality algorithm can greatly improve the actual power generation because it considers the impact of the outflow from upstream reservoirs during every period on the discharge decision of downstream reservoirs meanwhile the dimensionality problems caused by the effect of water propagation effect was significantly reduced when a cascade system with more than two reservoirs the operation time of msdp becomes more serious and cannot be adopted but the operation time of nopa is considerably smaller than that of msdp thus the nopa is more applicable in a cascade system with a larger number of reservoirs in this paper the dynamic change of water propagation between cascade reservoirs is considered and the npoa is proposed to solve the modified scroo model however the muskingum method is the simplest form of the saint venant equations thus for further research more accurate methods of water propagation solving could be discussed and explored to characterize the inflow to downstream reservoirs in a cascade besides the optimization that was performed herein is based on the need to maximize power generation given the available water however in many instances reservoir water levels are not only managed to optimize power generation but to ensure that ecological flows are maintained that there is sufficient water for irrigation and to maintain adequate recreational opportunities in addition to several other factors therefore these constraints should be incorporated into this proposed approach in the future declaration of competing interest
