18290,a novel solar salinity energy nexus was developed by combining a photocatalytic fuel cell pfc and a reverse electrodialysis red the hybrid cell called a prc can effectively transfer the solar energy and salinity gradient energy which is regenerated by low grade industrial waste heat to electrical energy coupled with enhanced pollutant rhodamine b rhb degradation and h2o2 production energy environment win win will be realized the open circuit voltage of the prc was the sum of those of the pfc and the red and the red stack made the larger contribution to the electricity production of prc the bias voltage generated from the red stack accelerated the separation of photo induced holes and electrons on the three dimensional tio2 array photoanode which enhanced rhb degradation and h2o2 production the flow rate and concentration of the working fluids ammonium bicarbonate and the reaction conditions in the electrode chambers had substantial effects on the prc performance under the optimal condition the peak power density and energy efficiency of prc reached 1500 mw m 2 and 4 21 respectively the performance of prc on electricity production is better than photocatalytic electrolytic cell driven by desalination pfcd but not good as microbial reverse electrodialysis electrolysis cell mrec graphical abstract image 1 keywords reverse electrodialysis photocatalysis pollutants degradation h2o2 production electricity production 1 introduction in the 21st century the global energy and environmental crises are growing due to rapid industrialization currently sewage discharge has reached 4260 billion tons per year and pollutes 55 000 billion cubic meters of water per year accounting for more than 14 of global runoff traditional wastewater treatment methods require large amounts of energy which mainly comes from non renewable energy resources however sewage contains tremendous potential energy which is approximately 10 times higher than the energy required for sewage treatment therefore how to extract energy from wastewater and simultaneous remove pollutants has been studied by many researchers zhang et al 2009 min and logan 2004 in the traditional wastewater remediation the organic pollutants are oxidized to co2 and small molecular organic compounds with releasing electrons in the most processes the electrons are not collected for electricity as far as we know photocatalytic fuel cell pfc and its derived processes and microbial fuel cell mfc and its derived processes can harvest electrical energy from the oxidation of organic pollutants although mfc has been fully developed it is not suitable for some toxic and refractory sewage due to its bioanode stein et al 2012 also it needs start up time before operation and recovery time after operation liu et al 2011a comparably there are no such drawbacks in pfc the chemical energy in wastewater can be converted into electrical energy with organic compounds from wastewater oxidized by pfc liu et al 2011b however the power generation by pfc is still limited due to the recombination of photo induced electrons and holes seger and kamat 2009 to address this problem many studies have pointed out that only the application of low voltages may promote the separation of photo induced electrons and holes lin et al 2009 wang et al 2009 li et al 2000 red is a promising green technology that transfers salinity gradient energy to electrical energy veerman et al 2009 at first the red was developed to extract the huge energy between sea water and river water on some coastal areas recently red system using thermolytic solutions was developed which greatly expanded its application field luo et al 2012 however there are still many problems on red that limit its application one important drawback is that it needs a large amount of membranes to generate a power density enough to be merged into the grid however the membrane cost is still high for commercial application vermaas et al 2011 so effective utilization of electrical energy from red is an important development direction by using organic pollutant oxygen to replace fe2 fe3 or fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 as redox a new green technology that combines a pfc and a red prc was proposed in this study in the anode chamber organic pollutant was degraded by photo induced holes generated by the photoanode under solar irradiation and some strong oxidative free radicals mainly oh by the reaction of h2o and photo induced holes the separation of the photo induced electrons and holes is enhanced via a bias voltage generated by a red stack which promotes the transfer of photo induced electrons via an external circuit to the cathode thus the pollutant degradation is enhanced the photo induced electrons can then be captured in the cathode chamber by o2 to generate h2o2 accordingly the prc system can simultaneously perform electricity production wastewater degradation and h2o2 production based on this idea the new technology prc was developed successfully and its working principle was proposed the prc performance for electricity generation pollutant oxidation and h2o2 production was evaluated systematically by comparisons with pfc and red the factors influencing the prc including the flow rate and salinity of ammonium bicarbonate solution pollutant concentration anions ph and electrolyte concentration in the electrode chambers were investigated by this process the chemical energy can be extracted from organic wastewater and simultaneously organic wastewater was purified without non renewable energy consumption energy environment win win will be realized 2 methods 2 1 fabrication of the photoanode a titanium mesh 2 7 cm nominal aperture 0 19 mm wire diameter 0 25 mm open area 20 purity 99 9 was first degreased ultrasonically in an acetone and ethanol solution for 10 min respectively the titanium mesh was then mechanically polished with different sandpapers mesh 200 400 600 and 1000 to a mirror like surface followed by rinsing with deionized water and drying at room temperature the mesh was then immersed in a mixed solution hf hno3 h2so4 1 4 5 for 1 min electrochemical anodization was performed in a two electrode configuration using a pt electrode as the counter electrode and the titanium mesh as the working electrode the electrolyte contained 0 3 wt nh4f 3 deionized water and 97 glycol the anodization was carried out at 40 v for 1 h by a direct current power supply finally the tio2 electrode was annealed at 450 c for 2 h 2 2 reactor design and operation prc the prc consisted of two chambers and a membrane stack the anode chamber and cathode chamber were both 3 cm long and 3 cm in diameter a quartz window with a diameter of 3 cm was placed in the anode chamber to allow the transmission of uv light the tio2 ti mesh was folded twice and woven onto a titanium wire to form a three dimensional electrode the air cathode was constructed via the rolling press method using a carbon black and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe emulsion a 300 w xenon lamp pls sxe300 300uv perfectlight was installed 10 cm away from the reactor a am1 5 filter was used to simulate the nature sunlight and a cut off filter to regulate the output spectrum the light wavelength is 300 1200 nm rhodamine b 10 mg l 1 was chosen as the simulated pollutant the electrolytes in the anode chamber and cathode chamber were both 0 05 mol l 1 na2so4 the ph of the cathode solution was adjusted to 3 0 0 2 by 0 1 mol l 1 h2so4 the membrane stack included cation exchange membranes cems and anion exchange membranes aems the working principle of the membrane stack is illustrated in fig 1 positive ions in a high concentration solution hc diffused through the cems to a low concentration solution lc and the negative ions in the hc diffused through the aems to the lc on the other side therefore an ion current in the stack formed which produced a potential on both sides of the stack the ion current was converted to an external output current by the redox reaction at the electrodes all of the experiments were performed with a commercial 20 pair membrane red stack tian wei membrane technology co ltd china with an effective area of 7 cm2 diameter 3 cm per membrane the parameters of the membranes are shown in table s1 the membranes were separated by silica gel gaskets at distances of 0 75 mm which created 20 hc solution compartments and 20 lc solution compartments polyethylene nets were inserted into the silica gel gaskets to evenly distribute the water in the compartments two proton exchange membranes nafion 117 were used in contact with cathodic and anodic compartments respectively to prevent passage of ammonium from red solution to electrode chambers pfc the chambers were the same with those of the prc system the anode chamber and cathode chamber were separated by a membrane nafion 117 the electrodes and electrolyte in the pfc were as same as those in the prc red the chambers were the same as those of the prc system both the cathode and the anode were composed of ti ru2o ir2o and had a diameter of 2 6 cm the electrode compartments contained a mixed solution of 0 025 mol l 1 potassium ferricyanide and 0 025 mol l 1 potassium ferrocyanide this electrolyte was recycled between the anode chamber and cathode chamber by a pump at a rate of 60 ml min 1 the composition and operation of the membrane stack was as same as that in the prc rhodamine b was determined using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer hach dr600 at 552 nm and h2o2 was determined using the same ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer an appropriate amount of h2o2 was drawn from the cathode and diluted to 5 ml in a 1 cm cuvette then 0 75 ml of phthalic acid 0 1 mol l 1 and 0 75 ml of 0 4 mol l 1 ki 0 06 mol l 1 naoh 10 4 mol l 1 molybdate were added to the cuvette after 2 min of reaction the concentration was determined at λ 352 nm the concentration of the ammonium bicarbonate solution was determined by a second order relationship between the ammonium bicarbonate solution concentration and the solution conductivity the conductivity of the ammonium bicarbonate solution was determined by a conductivity meter leici ddsj 308a quenching experiment 0 5 mmol l 1 tert butanol ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt edta 2na and potassium dichromate were respectively added in the anode chamber to capture oh photo induced holes and electrons respectively the electricity generation performance of the prc was evaluated based on the output current internal resistance output power

1 shows the working principle of the prc system constructed with a three dimensional tio2 photoanode a carbon black air cathode and a red stack installed between the electrode chambers the prc system used solar energy and waste heat energy as the driving force the pollutant rhb in the wastewater was oxidized in the anode chamber and h2o2 was produced in the cathode chamber in addition electrical energy was generated in an external circuit the working fluids ammonium bicarbonate solutions of the red stack can be regenerated through the distillation column driven by waste heat to restore the original salinity gradient the specific process is as follows in the anode chamber photo induced electrons and holes were produced by tio2 nanotubes under solar illumination eq 11 the pollutants including intermediate products were immediately oxidized by photo induced holes on the surfaces of the tio2 nanotubes eq 12 simultaneously several radicals such as oh and o2 were produced and further oxidized the pollutants h2o was oxidized to oh by the photo induced holes eq 13 and the photo induced electrons were captured by the oxidizing substance o2 in the water to generate superoxide radicals o2 eq 14 then o2 reacted with h2o to generate hydrogen superoxide radicals ho2 eq 15 ho2 is an unstable substance which immediately reacted with h2o and the photo induced electrons to generate hydrogen peroxide h2o2 eq 16 h2o2 favoured pollutants degradation because it reacted with o2 or the photo induced electrons to produce hydroxyl radicals oh eq 17 and 18 therefore the pollutants can be oxidized by the photo induced holes eq 12 and the radicals eqs 19 and 20 in addition some of the photo induced electrons and holes recombine and release the thermal energy eq 21 to reduce this recombination the bias voltage generated from the red stack was applied to the photo electrodes which thus led to the separation of the photo induced holes and electrons therefore the degradation of rhb was enhanced in the cathode chamber the transferred electrons from the photoanode were captured by air that permeated from the air cathode to generate h2o2 eq 22 h2o2 is unstable and easy to decompose to h2o and o2 eq 23 enrique brillas and llosa 1995 or ho2 eq 24 ho2 can further decompose to o2 and h eq 25 chen et al 2003 in addition air that permeates from the air cathode can be reduced to h2o when the current density is sufficiently strong martínez huitle and brillas 2009 zarei et al 2009 eq 26 h2o2 competed with o2 for electrons to produce oh and oh eqs 22 and 28 or h2o eq 27 to verify the working principle of prc quenching experiments were carried out in the anode chamber by adding tert butanol edta 2na and potassium dichromate into the anode chamber respectively oh photo induced holes and electrons were captured the rhb removal was the least when adding edta 2na in the anode chamber followed by the addition of tert butanol and potassium dichromate so the main active species for rhb oxidation was photo induced holes when an electron consuming sacrificial agent potassium dichromate was added to the anode chamber there was no current in the external circuit and no h2o2 production in the cathode chamber the result demonstrated that the photo induced electrons is the electronic source of the external circuit and h2o2 production 3 2 evaluation of the prc 3 2 1 comparison of the prc with the pfc and red as shown in table 1 the combined prc process exhibited relatively good electric properties the electric properties the short circuit current isc peak power density pmax energy conversion efficiency η and internal resistance r except open circuit voltage voc of prc is worse than that of red but much better than that of pfc the voc of the prc was the sum of those of the pfc and the red the contributions of the red stack and the electrode reaction to the total power output of the prc were 62 4 and 37 6 respectively calculated by eqs 5 and 6 indicating that the red stack dominated the electricity production the internal resistance of the prc was almost two times that of the red which results in the electric properties except open circuit voltage of prc is worse than that of red the reason may be as follow one of the important influence factors on chemical reaction rate at anode and cathode in cells is the concentration of the redoxs which is one of the main influence factors on internal resistance the concentration of o2 rhb redox in cathode chamber anode chamber of prc is 0 26 mmol l 1 the saturation value of dissolved oxygen at 25 c 0 021 mmol l 1 respectively which is far lower than 25 mmol l 1 25 mmol l 1 of fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 in cathode chamber anode chamber in red respectively so the internal resistance of prc is higher than that of red which resulted in the electric properties except open circuit voltage of prc is worse than that of red although the electricity production property of the prc is not as good as that of the red the advantages of pollutants removal and h2o2 production are substantial the electric properties of the pfc were far worse than those of the red and the prc due to the rapid recombination of photo induced electrons and holes nearly no reaction occurred in the cathode chamber of the pfc after the pfc was combined with red the bias voltage generated from the red stack accelerated the separation of photo induced holes and electrons on the photoanode which enhanced the reaction in the cathode chamber we also have tested the performance of prc using ibuprofen 10 mg l 1 as model pollutant the ibuprofen removal reached 51 2 after 1 h and reached 92 4 after 3 h the ibuprofen removal is much lower than rhb after 1 h under the same condition the h2o2 production is 48 6 mg l 1 and the average output current is 1 9 ma after 1 h the h2o2 production and output current with ibuprofen as model pollutant is almost the same with that with rhb as model pollutant the result indicates the prc can be used for the degradation of some toxic and refractory pollutants the rhb removal and h2o2 production by the prc was substantially higher than that by the pfc under the same external resistance fig 2 a when the reaction time was 20 min the rhb removal by the prc was approximately 30 higher than that by the pfc under the same external resistance the rhb removals were all greater than 90 after 60 min the h2o2 concentrations in the cathode chamber of the prc were 40 30 55 89 mg l 1 whereas little h2o2 was produced by the pfc the rhb removals by the prc and the pfc both decreased slightly with increasing external resistance which is probably because the external resistance inhibited the transformation of photo induced electrons fig 2 b shows that the output current of the prc decreased slightly with the degradation time because the concentration of the electron donor rhb decreased fig 2 a and b show that h2o2 production increased with increasing output current this occurred because the number of electrons provided in a unit time increased with increasing current which was beneficial for h2o2 production on the surface of the cathode li et al 2017 the rhb removal h2o2 production average output current and total electric charge by the prc decreased slightly with increasing external resistance but the power density increased with increasing external resistance especially the power density was 7 10 times higher at r 100 ω than that at r 10 ω when the external resistance increased further to 200 ω the power density only increased from 1 20 w m 2 100 ω to 1 51 w m 2 to make full use of the prc the energy output of the system should be as high as possible as long as the performance of the prc is not significantly reduced therefore 100 ω was chosen as the optimum external resistance 3 2 2 fed batch experiment of the prc the results of the fed batch experiment are shown in fig 3 the anode potential cathode potential and red stack voltage all decreased with rhb degradation in every period fig 3 a the output voltage which is equal to the difference between the cathode potential and anode potential remained stable the h2o2 production increased from 55 59 mg l 1 at 1 h to 114 60 mg l 1 at 2 h and then remained stable fig 3 b this phenomenon may have occurred because the h2o2 production was initially greater than the sum of the self decomposition and the reduction of h2o2 on the cathode and they then reached a balance during the h2o2 production process nam et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 therefore the changes in the electrical parameters in every batch were almost the same and the h2o2 production reached a balance indicating that the prc system ran stably these results show that although the electric properties of the prc was worse than that of the red with fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 revealed in 3 2 1 the prc could oxidize pollutants and generate h2o2 some of the energy was used to promote the separation of photo induced holes and electrons and h2o2 production the h2o2 concentration produced by the prc was higher than that produced by some microbial electrolysis cells that could also oxidize pollutants and produce h2o2 without external power and an o2 supply nan li et al 2016 3 3 effect of ammonium bicarbonate solution in red 3 3 1 effect of the flow rate the effect of the flow rate of the ammonium bicarbonate solution on the prc is illustrated in fig 4 the rhb removal was affected little by the flow rate of the ammonium bicarbonate solution fig 4 a the h2o2 production fig 4 a output current fig 4 b power density fig 4 c and open circuit voltage fig 4 d all increased with increasing flow rate of the ammonium bicarbonate solution however the internal resistance decreased as the flow rate of the ammonium bicarbonate solution increased the output current under different velocities decreased slightly with the reaction time due to the rhb consumption which was consistent with the results in section 3 2 when the flow rate of the ammonium bicarbonate solution increased the concentration polarization decreased which led to the ammonium bicarbonate concentration gradient on the sides of the membrane being close to that of the bulk solution hc 1 8 mol l 1 lc 0 01 mol l 1 in addition the salinity gradient energy input calculated by eq 10 fig 4 e and its consumption which equals to salinity gradient energy input minus salinity gradient energy output both increased with increasing flow rate of the ammonium bicarbonate solution as a result the internal resistance decreased and the electricity and h2o2 production increased with increasing flow rate of the ammonium bicarbonate solution zhu et al 2015 but the energy efficiency decreased with increasing flow rate of the ammonium bicarbonate solution fig 4 f therefore 5 ml min 1 was chosen as the optimum flow rate for the next experiments 3 3 2 effect of salinity the effect of the salinity ratio sr with a fixed hc solution 1 8 mol l 1 on the prc is shown in fig 5 a b the rhb removal fig 5 a initially increased and then remained stable with increasing sr the h2o2 production fig 5 a and power density of prc fig 5 b both increased initially with increasing sr and then reached their maximum at sr 100 the h2o2 production and power density subsequently both decreased when the sr further increased to 180 therefore the optimal sr is 100 the contributions of the electrode reactions and the red stack to the electricity output of the prc system were quantified calculated by eq 5 and 6 and the results are plotted in fig 5 c the red stack contributed greater electricity output than the electrode reactions when sr 50 180 the red stack dominated producing approximately 58 69 of the electricity output the effect of the electrode reactions on electricity production increased substantially which indicates that the red stack could effectively enhance the electrode reactions the energy efficiency of prc under different sr ranged from 3 5 to 4 5 fig 5 d when sr 100 the energy efficiency was maximum thus 100 was chosen as the optimal sr for the next experiments the effects of the hc and lc concentrations with the optimal sr sr 100 on the prc are shown in fig 6 a h the highest hc of the ammonium bicarbonate solution was 1 8 mol l 1 because its saturated solubility is 2 0 mol l 1 at 20 c the rhb removal h2o2 production red stack voltage peak power density and input and output salinity gradient energy all increased with increasing salinity concentration however the internal resistance decreased with increasing salinity concentration fig 6 b the salinity of the ammonium bicarbonate solution had an obvious effect on the prc when the hc was fixed at 1 8 mol l 1 the salinity gradient energy increased with decreasing lc as a result the rhb removal h2o2 production fig 5 a and power density fig 5 b all increased with increasing sr however when the sr was increased further to 180 the low ionic concentration of lc caused the internal resistance increasing which caused a decrease in the prc performance when the sr was fixed at 100 the salinity gradient energy input and its consumption both increased with increasing salinity therefore the driving force on the electrode reactions increased in addition the red resistance is obviously influenced by the lc due to its low conductivity post et al 2007 ramon et al 2011 increasing the lc is helpful for decreasing the red resistance fig 6 f accordingly the rhb removal h2o2 production and electricity production all increased with increasing hc and lc concentrations the introduction of the red stack contributed to substantial changes in the cathode potential and anode potential fig 6 g the change in the cathode potential was much greater than that of the anode potential which indicated that the introduction of red promoted the cathode reaction more the improvement of the cathode reaction was the main reason for the improvement in the prc performance the effects of the hc and lc concentrations on the efficiencies of prc were evaluated and the results are illustrated in fig 6 e and h the energy efficiency decreased first and then increased to maximum at hc lc 1 8 0 018 the rcat and ce both increased with increasing salinity concentrations accordingly hc lc 1 8 0 018 was adopted for the next experiments 3 4 effect of the reaction conditions in the electrode chambers 3 4 1 effect of the initial rhb concentration and other anions in anode chamber the effect of the initial rhb concentration on the prc is shown in fig 7 a c the rhb removal efficiency decreased with increasing rhb concentration fig 7 a but the amount of rhb removed increased the rhb removal obeys a pseudo first order reaction model and the reaction rate constant decreased with an increase in the initial rhb concentration fig 7 b the output current fig 7 c and h2o2 production were slightly affected by the initial rhb concentration with an increase in the initial rhb concentration increased turbidity reduced the incident light and therefore reduced the reaction rate whereas the odds of collision of the rhb molecules and reactive species increased with increasing rhb concentration and thus increased the rhb removal amount fig 7 d e clearly shows that the anions cl no3 hco3 and h2po4 inhibited rhb removal but had little effect on the h2o2 production and average output current the rhb removal efficiency under different anion addition conditions followed the order so4 2 cl no3 hco3 h2po4 so4 2 is very stable and cannot react with photo induced holes h and photo induced electrons therefore it has a minor effect on rhb removal however the other anions are scavengers of photo induced holes or electrons which led to the decrease in rhb removal cl is not only a scavenger of photo induced holes but also a scavenger of oh a series of reactions could occur when cl was adsorbed on the photoanode eq 29 33 in supporting information si the formed chloride radical has nearly the same oxidation potential 2 41 v as h 2 39 v but cl reacts with oh and h and forms hocl whose oxidation capacity is lower than those of oh and h no3 is a scavenger of photo induced electrons that traps electrons to produce no2 eq 34 in si 3 4 in addition no2 traps holes eq 35 in si and the active position on the anode will be occupied hco3 is a scavenger of oh and its addition is unfavourable for rhb removal eq 36 in si h2po4 is a scavenger of h and the formed h2po4 hpo4 and po4 2 are all less reactive than h for rhb degradation eq 37 in si 3 4 2 effect of ph and electrolyte concentrations in the chambers the effect of ph on the prc is shown in fig 8 a d the rhb removal increased slightly with increasing ph in the anode chamber but there was little effect on h2o2 production and average output current for titanium oxide nanotube arrays tnas the point of zero charge pzc is approximately 6 5 chen et al 2012 under alkaline conditions the zeta potential of tnas is negative pinhedo et al 2005 and rhb is a cationic dye the coulombic force between tnas titanium oxide nanotube arrays and rhb would enhance the absorption of rhb on the photoanode under acidic conditions the surface of tnas is positive which inhibits the adsorption of rhb because of electrostatic repulsion in addition small molecular organic acid was produced during rhb degradation which also inhibited rhb degradation the ph in the cathode chamber had little effect on rhb removal the h2o2 production decreased slightly with increasing ph in the cathode chamber because h2o2 decomposes more easily under alkaline conditions eqs 24 and 25 than under acid conditions therefore the prc system can be used effectively over a wide ph range as shown in fig 8 e h the electrolyte concentrations na2so4 in the anode chamber and cathode chamber both had substantial effects on the prc performance the rhb removal h2o2 production and average output current all decreased with decreasing na2so4 concentrations in the anode chamber and cathode chamber when the na2so4 concentrations increased from 0 05 mol l 1 to 0 25 mol l 1 the rhb removal h2o2 production and average output current only increased slightly consequently 0 05 mol l 1 na2so4 was chosen as the optimal electrolyte concentration the resistance of the prc increased with decreasing na2so4 concentration which is the reason that the performance of the prc decreased when the electrolyte concentration decreased the effect of the na2so4 concentration in the anode chamber on the prc performance was greater than that in the cathode chamber because the ph ph 3 in the cathode chamber was adjusted by h2so4 in advance which increased the actual electrolyte concentration in the cathode chamber 3 5 improvement in the future although gratifying initial results have been achieved there are still some obstacles need to overcome 1 although the spectral range of illumination of simulated sunlight is similar to real sunlight the light intensity and stability of simulated sunlight is much higher than that of the real sunlight it is necessary to take measure to improve the current response of photoelectrodes and ensure the illumination stability under real sunlight and we also believe photocatalysis will be able to directly utilize the real sunlight with more and more explorations on photocatalysis with real sunlight chen et al 2015 wu et al 2018 booshehri et al 2017 additionally titanium dioxide electrode was chosen in this study because of good oxidation ability and stability but it only responds to ultraviolet light the develop and use of photo electrodes with an expanding light response range ultraviolet visible and even near infrared light response may offer a more efficient use of sunlight the relative studies have been payed more attention by researchers in the world so the performance will be further improved 2 the obstacle of application is the expensive ion exchange membrane in the present state with the fast development of red the membrane performance has been improved and its cost certainly will be decreased especially there are already some reports on the scale up operation of red tedesco et al 2015 2016 2017 therefore we believe the ion exchange membrane will be employed on a large scale in the near future 3 in this combined technology a lot of waste heat 50 100 c need to be consumed for the regeneration of nh4hco3 solution in fact there are almost one third of the energy consumed as thermal losses to the atmosphere directly or to cooling system in industrial processes lin et al 2014 the heat contained in the cooling system is usually difficult to be recycled due to its very low temperature for example in internal combustion engines the heat contained in cooling water can not always find use due to its low temperature typically around 90 c peris et al 2013 according to report only a few of technologies are able to recycle the energy from very low temperature level 100 c tamburini et al 2017 however they are studied only in the lab not in practice so the very low temperature waste heat 100 c from cooling water streams in a variety of industrial processes which is called as low grade waste heat is difficult to be used presently prc is used to convert the low grade waste heat to electric power using nh4hco3 as working fluids which is economical in the future the use of the low grade waste heat in prc or other technologies should be optimized to further decrease the thermal losses in the industry 4 the addition of na2so4 in this study is to simulate wastewater in some wastewater most of them contain some ions like na mg2 ca2 so4 2 cl and so on which will be used as electrolyte in the prc system besides decreasing the space of electrodes in prc may decrease the resistance which may reduce the addition amount of na2so4 so if actual wastewater is used for the optimized prc no or little addition of na2so4 may be adopted 4 conclusions a new hybrid cell prc was developed by integrating a pfc and red the prc used solar energy and low grade industrial waste heat as the driving force to generate electrical energy pollutants rhb in the wastewater were oxidized in the anode chamber and h2o2 was produced in the cathode chamber after integration the rhb removal by the prc at 30 min was 30 higher than that by the pfc because the bias voltage generated from the red accelerated the separation of photo induced holes and electrons higher open circuit voltage was observed in the prc than in the pfc and the red the maximum h2o2 production of the prc was 114 58 mg l 1 after 2 h in a fed batch experiment and the peak power density reached 1500 mw m 2 the flow rate and concentrations of the working fluids ammonium bicarbonate solution and the reaction conditions in the chambers both affected the prc performance increases of the flow rate and concentration of ammonium bicarbonate effectively increased the energy input and decreased the internal resistance which improved the prc performance the maximum energy efficiency of 4 21 was achieved under optimal operation condition the energy efficiency of prc is much lower than that around 25 of mrc more study need to be done to improve the energy efficiency of the prc system the rhb removal obeyed first order reaction model the removal efficiency decreased with increasing rhb concentration but the rhb removal amount increased the anions cl no3 hco3 and h2po4 in the anode chamber inhibited rhb removal because they are scavengers of h oh or electrons the variation of the ph from 3 to 11 only slightly affected the performance of the prc whereas the increase of the electrolyte na2so4 concentrations in the two chambers greatly enhanced the prc

18290,a novel solar salinity energy nexus was developed by combining a photocatalytic fuel cell pfc and a reverse electrodialysis red the hybrid cell called a prc can effectively transfer the solar energy and salinity gradient energy which is regenerated by low grade industrial waste heat to electrical energy coupled with enhanced pollutant rhodamine b rhb degradation and h2o2 production energy environment win win will be realized the open circuit voltage of the prc was the sum of those of the pfc and the red and the red stack made the larger contribution to the electricity production of prc the bias voltage generated from the red stack accelerated the separation of photo induced holes and electrons on the three dimensional tio2 array photoanode which enhanced rhb degradation and h2o2 production the flow rate and concentration of the working fluids ammonium bicarbonate and the reaction conditions in the electrode chambers had substantial effects on the prc performance under the optimal condition the peak power density and energy efficiency of prc reached 1500 mw m 2 and 4 21 respectively the performance of prc on electricity production is better than photocatalytic electrolytic cell driven by desalination pfcd but not good as microbial reverse electrodialysis electrolysis cell mrec graphical abstract image 1 keywords reverse electrodialysis photocatalysis pollutants degradation h2o2 production electricity production 1 introduction in the 21st century the global energy and environmental crises are growing due to rapid industrialization currently sewage discharge has reached 4260 billion tons per year and pollutes 55 000 billion cubic meters of water per year accounting for more than 14 of global runoff traditional wastewater treatment methods require large amounts of energy which mainly comes from non renewable energy resources however sewage contains tremendous potential energy which is approximately 10 times higher than the energy required for sewage treatment therefore how to extract energy from wastewater and simultaneous remove pollutants has been studied by many researchers zhang et al 2009 min and logan 2004 in the traditional wastewater remediation the organic pollutants are oxidized to co2 and small molecular organic compounds with releasing electrons in the most processes the electrons are not collected for electricity as far as we know photocatalytic fuel cell pfc and its derived processes and microbial fuel cell mfc and its derived processes can harvest electrical energy from the oxidation of organic pollutants although mfc has been fully developed it is not suitable for some toxic and refractory sewage due to its bioanode stein et al 2012 also it needs start up time before operation and recovery time after operation liu et al 2011a comparably there are no such drawbacks in pfc the chemical energy in wastewater can be converted into electrical energy with organic compounds from wastewater oxidized by pfc liu et al 2011b however the power generation by pfc is still limited due to the recombination of photo induced electrons and holes seger and kamat 2009 to address this problem many studies have pointed out that only the application of low voltages may promote the separation of photo induced electrons and holes lin et al 2009 wang et al 2009 li et al 2000 red is a promising green technology that transfers salinity gradient energy to electrical energy veerman et al 2009 at first the red was developed to extract the huge energy between sea water and river water on some coastal areas recently red system using thermolytic solutions was developed which greatly expanded its application field luo et al 2012 however there are still many problems on red that limit its application one important drawback is that it needs a large amount of membranes to generate a power density enough to be merged into the grid however the membrane cost is still high for commercial application vermaas et al 2011 so effective utilization of electrical energy from red is an important development direction by using organic pollutant oxygen to replace fe2 fe3 or fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 as redox a new green technology that combines a pfc and a red prc was proposed in this study in the anode chamber organic pollutant was degraded by photo induced holes generated by the photoanode under solar irradiation and some strong oxidative free radicals mainly oh by the reaction of h2o and photo induced holes the separation of the photo induced electrons and holes is enhanced via a bias voltage generated by a red stack which promotes the transfer of photo induced electrons via an external circuit to the cathode thus the pollutant degradation is enhanced the photo induced electrons can then be captured in the cathode chamber by o2 to generate h2o2 accordingly the prc system can simultaneously perform electricity production wastewater degradation and h2o2 production based on this idea the new technology prc was developed successfully and its working principle was proposed the prc performance for electricity generation pollutant oxidation and h2o2 production was evaluated systematically by comparisons with pfc and red the factors influencing the prc including the flow rate and salinity of ammonium bicarbonate solution pollutant concentration anions ph and electrolyte concentration in the electrode chambers were investigated by this process the chemical energy can be extracted from organic wastewater and simultaneously organic wastewater was purified without non renewable energy consumption energy environment win win will be realized 2 methods 2 1 fabrication of the photoanode a titanium mesh 2 7 cm nominal aperture 0 19 mm wire diameter 0 25 mm open area 20 purity 99 9 was first degreased ultrasonically in an acetone and ethanol solution for 10 min respectively the titanium mesh was then mechanically polished with different sandpapers mesh 200 400 600 and 1000 to a mirror like surface followed by rinsing with deionized water and drying at room temperature the mesh was then immersed in a mixed solution hf hno3 h2so4 1 4 5 for 1 min electrochemical anodization was performed in a two electrode configuration using a pt electrode as the counter electrode and the titanium mesh as the working electrode the electrolyte contained 0 3 wt nh4f 3 deionized water and 97 glycol the anodization was carried out at 40 v for 1 h by a direct current power supply finally the tio2 electrode was annealed at 450 c for 2 h 2 2 reactor design and operation prc the prc consisted of two chambers and a membrane stack the anode chamber and cathode chamber were both 3 cm long and 3 cm in diameter a quartz window with a diameter of 3 cm was placed in the anode chamber to allow the transmission of uv light the tio2 ti mesh was folded twice and woven onto a titanium wire to form a three dimensional electrode the air cathode was constructed via the rolling press method using a carbon black and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe emulsion a 300 w xenon lamp pls sxe300 300uv perfectlight was installed 10 cm away from the reactor a am1 5 filter was used to simulate the nature sunlight and a cut off filter to regulate the output spectrum the light wavelength is 300 1200 nm rhodamine b 10 mg l 1 was chosen as the simulated pollutant the electrolytes in the anode chamber and cathode chamber were both 0 05 mol l 1 na2so4 the ph of the cathode solution was adjusted to 3 0 0 2 by 0 1 mol l 1 h2so4 the membrane stack included cation exchange membranes cems and anion exchange membranes aems the working principle of the membrane stack is illustrated in fig 1 positive ions in a high concentration solution hc diffused through the cems to a low concentration solution lc and the negative ions in the hc diffused through the aems to the lc on the other side therefore an ion current in the stack formed which produced a potential on both sides of the stack the ion current was converted to an external output current by the redox reaction at the electrodes all of the experiments were performed with a commercial 20 pair membrane red stack tian wei membrane technology co ltd china with an effective area of 7 cm2 diameter 3 cm per membrane the parameters of the membranes are shown in table s1 the membranes were separated by silica gel gaskets at distances of 0 75 mm which created 20 hc solution compartments and 20 lc solution compartments polyethylene nets were inserted into the silica gel gaskets to evenly distribute the water in the compartments two proton exchange membranes nafion 117 were used in contact with cathodic and anodic compartments respectively to prevent passage of ammonium from red solution to electrode chambers pfc the chambers were the same with those of the prc system the anode chamber and cathode chamber were separated by a membrane nafion 117 the electrodes and electrolyte in the pfc were as same as those in the prc red the chambers were the same as those of the prc system both the cathode and the anode were composed of ti ru2o ir2o and had a diameter of 2 6 cm the electrode compartments contained a mixed solution of 0 025 mol l 1 potassium ferricyanide and 0 025 mol l 1 potassium ferrocyanide this electrolyte was recycled between the anode chamber and cathode chamber by a pump at a rate of 60 ml min 1 the composition and operation of the membrane stack was as same as that in the prc rhodamine b was determined using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer hach dr600 at 552 nm and h2o2 was determined using the same ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer an appropriate amount of h2o2 was drawn from the cathode and diluted to 5 ml in a 1 cm cuvette then 0 75 ml of phthalic acid 0 1 mol l 1 and 0 75 ml of 0 4 mol l 1 ki 0 06 mol l 1 naoh 10 4 mol l 1 molybdate were added to the cuvette after 2 min of reaction the concentration was determined at λ 352 nm the concentration of the ammonium bicarbonate solution was determined by a second order relationship between the ammonium bicarbonate solution concentration and the solution conductivity the conductivity of the ammonium bicarbonate solution was determined by a conductivity meter leici ddsj 308a quenching experiment 0 5 mmol l 1 tert butanol ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt edta 2na and potassium dichromate were respectively added in the anode chamber to capture oh photo induced holes and electrons respectively the electricity generation performance of the prc was evaluated based on the output current internal resistance output power

1 shows the working principle of the prc system constructed with a three dimensional tio2 photoanode a carbon black air cathode and a red stack installed between the electrode chambers the prc system used solar energy and waste heat energy as the driving force the pollutant rhb in the wastewater was oxidized in the anode chamber and h2o2 was produced in the cathode chamber in addition electrical energy was generated in an external circuit the working fluids ammonium bicarbonate solutions of the red stack can be regenerated through the distillation column driven by waste heat to restore the original salinity gradient the specific process is as follows in the anode chamber photo induced electrons and holes were produced by tio2 nanotubes under solar illumination eq 11 the pollutants including intermediate products were immediately oxidized by photo induced holes on the surfaces of the tio2 nanotubes eq 12 simultaneously several radicals such as oh and o2 were produced and further oxidized the pollutants h2o was oxidized to oh by the photo induced holes eq 13 and the photo induced electrons were captured by the oxidizing substance o2 in the water to generate superoxide radicals o2 eq 14 then o2 reacted with h2o to generate hydrogen superoxide radicals ho2 eq 15 ho2 is an unstable substance which immediately reacted with h2o and the photo induced electrons to generate hydrogen peroxide h2o2 eq 16 h2o2 favoured pollutants degradation because it reacted with o2 or the photo induced electrons to produce hydroxyl radicals oh eq 17 and 18 therefore the pollutants can be oxidized by the photo induced holes eq 12 and the radicals eqs 19 and 20 in addition some of the photo induced electrons and holes recombine and release the thermal energy eq 21 to reduce this recombination the bias voltage generated from the red stack was applied to the photo electrodes which thus led to the separation of the photo induced holes and electrons therefore the degradation of rhb was enhanced in the cathode chamber the transferred electrons from the photoanode were captured by air that permeated from the air cathode to generate h2o2 eq 22 h2o2 is unstable and easy to decompose to h2o and o2 eq 23 enrique brillas and llosa 1995 or ho2 eq 24 ho2 can further decompose to o2 and h eq 25 chen et al 2003 in addition air that permeates from the air cathode can be reduced to h2o when the current density is sufficiently strong martínez huitle and brillas 2009 zarei et al 2009 eq 26 h2o2 competed with o2 for electrons to produce oh and oh eqs 22 and 28 or h2o eq 27 to verify the working principle of prc quenching experiments were carried out in the anode chamber by adding tert butanol edta 2na and potassium dichromate into the anode chamber respectively oh photo induced holes and electrons were captured the rhb removal was the least when adding edta 2na in the anode chamber followed by the addition of tert butanol and potassium dichromate so the main active species for rhb oxidation was photo induced holes when an electron consuming sacrificial agent potassium dichromate was added to the anode chamber there was no current in the external circuit and no h2o2 production in the cathode chamber the result demonstrated that the photo induced electrons is the electronic source of the external circuit and h2o2 production 3 2 evaluation of the prc 3 2 1 comparison of the prc with the pfc and red as shown in table 1 the combined prc process exhibited relatively good electric properties the electric properties the short circuit current isc peak power density pmax energy conversion efficiency η and internal resistance r except open circuit voltage voc of prc is worse than that of red but much better than that of pfc the voc of the prc was the sum of those of the pfc and the red the contributions of the red stack and the electrode reaction to the total power output of the prc were 62 4 and 37 6 respectively calculated by eqs 5 and 6 indicating that the red stack dominated the electricity production the internal resistance of the prc was almost two times that of the red which results in the electric properties except open circuit voltage of prc is worse than that of red the reason may be as follow one of the important influence factors on chemical reaction rate at anode and cathode in cells is the concentration of the redoxs which is one of the main influence factors on internal resistance the concentration of o2 rhb redox in cathode chamber anode chamber of prc is 0 26 mmol l 1 the saturation value of dissolved oxygen at 25 c 0 021 mmol l 1 respectively which is far lower than 25 mmol l 1 25 mmol l 1 of fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 in cathode chamber anode chamber in red respectively so the internal resistance of prc is higher than that of red which resulted in the electric properties except open circuit voltage of prc is worse than that of red although the electricity production property of the prc is not as good as that of the red the advantages of pollutants removal and h2o2 production are substantial the electric properties of the pfc were far worse than those of the red and the prc due to the rapid recombination of photo induced electrons and holes nearly no reaction occurred in the cathode chamber of the pfc after the pfc was combined with red the bias voltage generated from the red stack accelerated the separation of photo induced holes and electrons on the photoanode which enhanced the reaction in the cathode chamber we also have tested the performance of prc using ibuprofen 10 mg l 1 as model pollutant the ibuprofen removal reached 51 2 after 1 h and reached 92 4 after 3 h the ibuprofen removal is much lower than rhb after 1 h under the same condition the h2o2 production is 48 6 mg l 1 and the average output current is 1 9 ma after 1 h the h2o2 production and output current with ibuprofen as model pollutant is almost the same with that with rhb as model pollutant the result indicates the prc can be used for the degradation of some toxic and refractory pollutants the rhb removal and h2o2 production by the prc was substantially higher than that by the pfc under the same external resistance fig 2 a when the reaction time was 20 min the rhb removal by the prc was approximately 30 higher than that by the pfc under the same external resistance the rhb removals were all greater than 90 after 60 min the h2o2 concentrations in the cathode chamber of the prc were 40 30 55 89 mg l 1 whereas little h2o2 was produced by the pfc the rhb removals by the prc and the pfc both decreased slightly with increasing external resistance which is probably because the external resistance inhibited the transformation of photo induced electrons fig 2 b shows that the output current of the prc decreased slightly with the degradation time because the concentration of the electron donor rhb decreased fig 2 a and b show that h2o2 production increased with increasing output current this occurred because the number of electrons provided in a unit time increased with increasing current which was beneficial for h2o2 production on the surface of the cathode li et al 2017 the rhb removal h2o2 production average output current and total electric charge by the prc decreased slightly with increasing external resistance but the power density increased with increasing external resistance especially the power density was 7 10 times higher at r 100 ω than that at r 10 ω when the external resistance increased further to 200 ω the power density only increased from 1 20 w m 2 100 ω to 1 51 w m 2 to make full use of the prc the energy output of the system should be as high as possible as long as the performance of the prc is not significantly reduced therefore 100 ω was chosen as the optimum external resistance 3 2 2 fed batch experiment of the prc the results of the fed batch experiment are shown in fig 3 the anode potential cathode potential and red stack voltage all decreased with rhb degradation in every period fig 3 a the output voltage which is equal to the difference between the cathode potential and anode potential remained stable the h2o2 production increased from 55 59 mg l 1 at 1 h to 114 60 mg l 1 at 2 h and then remained stable fig 3 b this phenomenon may have occurred because the h2o2 production was initially greater than the sum of the self decomposition and the reduction of h2o2 on the cathode and they then reached a balance during the h2o2 production process nam et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 therefore the changes in the electrical parameters in every batch were almost the same and the h2o2 production reached a balance indicating that the prc system ran stably these results show that although the electric properties of the prc was worse than that of the red with fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 revealed in 3 2 1 the prc could oxidize pollutants and generate h2o2 some of the energy was used to promote the separation of photo induced holes and electrons and h2o2 production the h2o2 concentration produced by the prc was higher than that produced by some microbial electrolysis cells that could also oxidize pollutants and produce h2o2 without external power and an o2 supply nan li et al 2016 3 3 effect of ammonium bicarbonate solution in red 3 3 1 effect of the flow rate the effect of the flow rate of the ammonium bicarbonate solution on the prc is illustrated in fig 4 the rhb removal was affected little by the flow rate of the ammonium bicarbonate solution fig 4 a the h2o2 production fig 4 a output current fig 4 b power density fig 4 c and open circuit voltage fig 4 d all increased with increasing flow rate of the ammonium bicarbonate solution however the internal resistance decreased as the flow rate of the ammonium bicarbonate solution increased the output current under different velocities decreased slightly with the reaction time due to the rhb consumption which was consistent with the results in section 3 2 when the flow rate of the ammonium bicarbonate solution increased the concentration polarization decreased which led to the ammonium bicarbonate concentration gradient on the sides of the membrane being close to that of the bulk solution hc 1 8 mol l 1 lc 0 01 mol l 1 in addition the salinity gradient energy input calculated by eq 10 fig 4 e and its consumption which equals to salinity gradient energy input minus salinity gradient energy output both increased with increasing flow rate of the ammonium bicarbonate solution as a result the internal resistance decreased and the electricity and h2o2 production increased with increasing flow rate of the ammonium bicarbonate solution zhu et al 2015 but the energy efficiency decreased with increasing flow rate of the ammonium bicarbonate solution fig 4 f therefore 5 ml min 1 was chosen as the optimum flow rate for the next experiments 3 3 2 effect of salinity the effect of the salinity ratio sr with a fixed hc solution 1 8 mol l 1 on the prc is shown in fig 5 a b the rhb removal fig 5 a initially increased and then remained stable with increasing sr the h2o2 production fig 5 a and power density of prc fig 5 b both increased initially with increasing sr and then reached their maximum at sr 100 the h2o2 production and power density subsequently both decreased when the sr further increased to 180 therefore the optimal sr is 100 the contributions of the electrode reactions and the red stack to the electricity output of the prc system were quantified calculated by eq 5 and 6 and the results are plotted in fig 5 c the red stack contributed greater electricity output than the electrode reactions when sr 50 180 the red stack dominated producing approximately 58 69 of the electricity output the effect of the electrode reactions on electricity production increased substantially which indicates that the red stack could effectively enhance the electrode reactions the energy efficiency of prc under different sr ranged from 3 5 to 4 5 fig 5 d when sr 100 the energy efficiency was maximum thus 100 was chosen as the optimal sr for the next experiments the effects of the hc and lc concentrations with the optimal sr sr 100 on the prc are shown in fig 6 a h the highest hc of the ammonium bicarbonate solution was 1 8 mol l 1 because its saturated solubility is 2 0 mol l 1 at 20 c the rhb removal h2o2 production red stack voltage peak power density and input and output salinity gradient energy all increased with increasing salinity concentration however the internal resistance decreased with increasing salinity concentration fig 6 b the salinity of the ammonium bicarbonate solution had an obvious effect on the prc when the hc was fixed at 1 8 mol l 1 the salinity gradient energy increased with decreasing lc as a result the rhb removal h2o2 production fig 5 a and power density fig 5 b all increased with increasing sr however when the sr was increased further to 180 the low ionic concentration of lc caused the internal resistance increasing which caused a decrease in the prc performance when the sr was fixed at 100 the salinity gradient energy input and its consumption both increased with increasing salinity therefore the driving force on the electrode reactions increased in addition the red resistance is obviously influenced by the lc due to its low conductivity post et al 2007 ramon et al 2011 increasing the lc is helpful for decreasing the red resistance fig 6 f accordingly the rhb removal h2o2 production and electricity production all increased with increasing hc and lc concentrations the introduction of the red stack contributed to substantial changes in the cathode potential and anode potential fig 6 g the change in the cathode potential was much greater than that of the anode potential which indicated that the introduction of red promoted the cathode reaction more the improvement of the cathode reaction was the main reason for the improvement in the prc performance the effects of the hc and lc concentrations on the efficiencies of prc were evaluated and the results are illustrated in fig 6 e and h the energy efficiency decreased first and then increased to maximum at hc lc 1 8 0 018 the rcat and ce both increased with increasing salinity concentrations accordingly hc lc 1 8 0 018 was adopted for the next experiments 3 4 effect of the reaction conditions in the electrode chambers 3 4 1 effect of the initial rhb concentration and other anions in anode chamber the effect of the initial rhb concentration on the prc is shown in fig 7 a c the rhb removal efficiency decreased with increasing rhb concentration fig 7 a but the amount of rhb removed increased the rhb removal obeys a pseudo first order reaction model and the reaction rate constant decreased with an increase in the initial rhb concentration fig 7 b the output current fig 7 c and h2o2 production were slightly affected by the initial rhb concentration with an increase in the initial rhb concentration increased turbidity reduced the incident light and therefore reduced the reaction rate whereas the odds of collision of the rhb molecules and reactive species increased with increasing rhb concentration and thus increased the rhb removal amount fig 7 d e clearly shows that the anions cl no3 hco3 and h2po4 inhibited rhb removal but had little effect on the h2o2 production and average output current the rhb removal efficiency under different anion addition conditions followed the order so4 2 cl no3 hco3 h2po4 so4 2 is very stable and cannot react with photo induced holes h and photo induced electrons therefore it has a minor effect on rhb removal however the other anions are scavengers of photo induced holes or electrons which led to the decrease in rhb removal cl is not only a scavenger of photo induced holes but also a scavenger of oh a series of reactions could occur when cl was adsorbed on the photoanode eq 29 33 in supporting information si the formed chloride radical has nearly the same oxidation potential 2 41 v as h 2 39 v but cl reacts with oh and h and forms hocl whose oxidation capacity is lower than those of oh and h no3 is a scavenger of photo induced electrons that traps electrons to produce no2 eq 34 in si 3 4 in addition no2 traps holes eq 35 in si and the active position on the anode will be occupied hco3 is a scavenger of oh and its addition is unfavourable for rhb removal eq 36 in si h2po4 is a scavenger of h and the formed h2po4 hpo4 and po4 2 are all less reactive than h for rhb degradation eq 37 in si 3 4 2 effect of ph and electrolyte concentrations in the chambers the effect of ph on the prc is shown in fig 8 a d the rhb removal increased slightly with increasing ph in the anode chamber but there was little effect on h2o2 production and average output current for titanium oxide nanotube arrays tnas the point of zero charge pzc is approximately 6 5 chen et al 2012 under alkaline conditions the zeta potential of tnas is negative pinhedo et al 2005 and rhb is a cationic dye the coulombic force between tnas titanium oxide nanotube arrays and rhb would enhance the absorption of rhb on the photoanode under acidic conditions the surface of tnas is positive which inhibits the adsorption of rhb because of electrostatic repulsion in addition small molecular organic acid was produced during rhb degradation which also inhibited rhb degradation the ph in the cathode chamber had little effect on rhb removal the h2o2 production decreased slightly with increasing ph in the cathode chamber because h2o2 decomposes more easily under alkaline conditions eqs 24 and 25 than under acid conditions therefore the prc system can be used effectively over a wide ph range as shown in fig 8 e h the electrolyte concentrations na2so4 in the anode chamber and cathode chamber both had substantial effects on the prc performance the rhb removal h2o2 production and average output current all decreased with decreasing na2so4 concentrations in the anode chamber and cathode chamber when the na2so4 concentrations increased from 0 05 mol l 1 to 0 25 mol l 1 the rhb removal h2o2 production and average output current only increased slightly consequently 0 05 mol l 1 na2so4 was chosen as the optimal electrolyte concentration the resistance of the prc increased with decreasing na2so4 concentration which is the reason that the performance of the prc decreased when the electrolyte concentration decreased the effect of the na2so4 concentration in the anode chamber on the prc performance was greater than that in the cathode chamber because the ph ph 3 in the cathode chamber was adjusted by h2so4 in advance which increased the actual electrolyte concentration in the cathode chamber 3 5 improvement in the future although gratifying initial results have been achieved there are still some obstacles need to overcome 1 although the spectral range of illumination of simulated sunlight is similar to real sunlight the light intensity and stability of simulated sunlight is much higher than that of the real sunlight it is necessary to take measure to improve the current response of photoelectrodes and ensure the illumination stability under real sunlight and we also believe photocatalysis will be able to directly utilize the real sunlight with more and more explorations on photocatalysis with real sunlight chen et al 2015 wu et al 2018 booshehri et al 2017 additionally titanium dioxide electrode was chosen in this study because of good oxidation ability and stability but it only responds to ultraviolet light the develop and use of photo electrodes with an expanding light response range ultraviolet visible and even near infrared light response may offer a more efficient use of sunlight the relative studies have been payed more attention by researchers in the world so the performance will be further improved 2 the obstacle of application is the expensive ion exchange membrane in the present state with the fast development of red the membrane performance has been improved and its cost certainly will be decreased especially there are already some reports on the scale up operation of red tedesco et al 2015 2016 2017 therefore we believe the ion exchange membrane will be employed on a large scale in the near future 3 in this combined technology a lot of waste heat 50 100 c need to be consumed for the regeneration of nh4hco3 solution in fact there are almost one third of the energy consumed as thermal losses to the atmosphere directly or to cooling system in industrial processes lin et al 2014 the heat contained in the cooling system is usually difficult to be recycled due to its very low temperature for example in internal combustion engines the heat contained in cooling water can not always find use due to its low temperature typically around 90 c peris et al 2013 according to report only a few of technologies are able to recycle the energy from very low temperature level 100 c tamburini et al 2017 however they are studied only in the lab not in practice so the very low temperature waste heat 100 c from cooling water streams in a variety of industrial processes which is called as low grade waste heat is difficult to be used presently prc is used to convert the low grade waste heat to electric power using nh4hco3 as working fluids which is economical in the future the use of the low grade waste heat in prc or other technologies should be optimized to further decrease the thermal losses in the industry 4 the addition of na2so4 in this study is to simulate wastewater in some wastewater most of them contain some ions like na mg2 ca2 so4 2 cl and so on which will be used as electrolyte in the prc system besides decreasing the space of electrodes in prc may decrease the resistance which may reduce the addition amount of na2so4 so if actual wastewater is used for the optimized prc no or little addition of na2so4 may be adopted 4 conclusions a new hybrid cell prc was developed by integrating a pfc and red the prc used solar energy and low grade industrial waste heat as the driving force to generate electrical energy pollutants rhb in the wastewater were oxidized in the anode chamber and h2o2 was produced in the cathode chamber after integration the rhb removal by the prc at 30 min was 30 higher than that by the pfc because the bias voltage generated from the red accelerated the separation of photo induced holes and electrons higher open circuit voltage was observed in the prc than in the pfc and the red the maximum h2o2 production of the prc was 114 58 mg l 1 after 2 h in a fed batch experiment and the peak power density reached 1500 mw m 2 the flow rate and concentrations of the working fluids ammonium bicarbonate solution and the reaction conditions in the chambers both affected the prc performance increases of the flow rate and concentration of ammonium bicarbonate effectively increased the energy input and decreased the internal resistance which improved the prc performance the maximum energy efficiency of 4 21 was achieved under optimal operation condition the energy efficiency of prc is much lower than that around 25 of mrc more study need to be done to improve the energy efficiency of the prc system the rhb removal obeyed first order reaction model the removal efficiency decreased with increasing rhb concentration but the rhb removal amount increased the anions cl no3 hco3 and h2po4 in the anode chamber inhibited rhb removal because they are scavengers of h oh or electrons the variation of the ph from 3 to 11 only slightly affected the performance of the prc whereas the increase of the electrolyte na2so4 concentrations in the two chambers greatly enhanced the prc

18291,pervious pavements are one of the most used construction techniques among the sustainable urban drainage systems suds the objective of this article is to analyse the energy life cycle and the life cycle cost of stormwater harvesting systems using pervious pavements models in order to compare and evaluate the differences and verify what influences the profitability and sustainability the method proposed started with the definition of pervious pavement models based on literature review the main characteristic of the models analysed was the use of porous asphalt with different underlying layers i e thickness and material the hydrological hydraulic design of the pavements was also assessed the potential for potable water savings due to harvesting stormwater from a parking lot was estimated for a public building in florianópolis southern brazil the models were compared to identify what most influences the potable water savings the profitability and the sustainability of the systems the maximum potable water savings found were 42 it was also observed that the overall consumption of the building has been decreasing over the years and the yearly rainfall has increased which leads to a higher potential in the current water consumption pattern none of the systems evaluated was profitable or presented sustainability evaluated herein as negative energy balance however it was verified that if analysed comparatively with non pervious pavement it was profitable to use stormwater harvested from the pervious pavement thus it can be concluded that stormwater harvesting systems in combination with pervious pavements are promising serving as suds and saving money for users it is also noticeable that the use of porous asphalt is not recommended when aiming for systems with low embedded energy graphical abstract water consumption data rainfall data and potential for potable water savings by harvesting stormwater from a parking lot of a public building in florianópolis brazil image 1 keywords pervious pavements life cycle assessment embedded energy rainwater harvesting sustainability potable water savings 1 introduction to minimise problems caused by the waterproofing of urban surfaces construction techniques classified as sustainable urban drainage systems suds have been increasingly proposed against the usual urban drainage the waterproofing of urban surfaces produces discontinuities in the hydrological cycle sometimes overloading the urban drainage systems as drainage systems become inefficient to drain stormwater floods and user discomfort are generated tucci 2005 suds then introduce a concept of sustainable drainage by treating water locally which reduces the possibility of overloading stormwater distribution networks poleto and tassi 2012 one of the techniques contemplated in suds is the use of pervious pavements to harvest stormwater and reduce water flow to the public drainage system the use of pervious pavements aims to reduce the amount of stormwater runoff through infiltration in the pavement some benefits arise from the use of pervious pavements such as the filtration of heavy metals legret et al 1996 oil retention pratt et al 1999 decrease in the amount of stormwater runoff araújo et al 2000 meurer filho 2001 decrease in traffic noise bernucci et al 2007 knabben 2012 decrease in water spray from tires and improvement in road visibility bernucci et al 2007 the design of pervious pavements has already been widely studied and there are numerous manuals guidelines deq virginia 2011 napa 2008 fhwa 2015 ciria 2015 and examples of existing cases in brazil there are some studies of pervious pavement models with the definitions of the pervious layers their thicknesses and characteristics acioli 2005 pinto 2011 hammes et al 2018 another benefit that can be obtained with the application of pervious pavements is the harvesting of stormwater for use in buildings hammes et al 2018 kandhal and mishra 2014 gomez ullate et al 2011 the water collected by the pervious pavements is redirected for use in non potable purposes such as flushing toilets and cleaning outside areas thus reducing the amount of potable water that would be consumed in the building such use aligns the concept of suds with the fight against global water scarcity by saving potable water some studies on quality hammes et al 2018 antunes et al 2016 thives et al 2018 and quantity hammes et al 2018 thives et al 2018 indicate that stormwater infiltrated in pervious pavements can be used for non potable purposes in buildings according to the united nations environment program unep 2002 about one third of the world s population lived in countries where water availability was lower than water consumption in 2002 unep also estimates that before 2027 two thirds of the world s population will be in the same conditions of water availability thus the use of alternatives such as rainwater harvesting becomes fundamental currently several countries are carrying out studies on the use of rainwater as an alternative to water scarcity including studies of potable water savings potential ghisi et al 2005 liuzzo et al 2016 hammes et al 2018 public policies to encourage rainwater use lee et al 2017 ward et al 2012 life cycle assessment of rainwater harvesting systems anand and apul 2010 vialle et al 2015 among more specific studies ghisi et al 2005 for example studied the potential for potable water savings by collecting rainwater from roofs in the state of santa catarina brazil the water availability in the state will be less than 2000 m³ in the year 2100 which is considered a low availability according to unep 2002 thus they evaluated the potential for potable water savings in 62 cities in santa catarina the average potential for potable water savings was 69 ranging from 34 to 92 studies can also be found on the sustainability of rainwater harvesting systems mainly related to embedded energy marinoski et al 2012 for example carried out a study to analyse the environmental feasibility of rainwater harvesting systems and greywater reuse systems for non potable uses for the rainwater harvesting system the energy benefit was 1587 8 mj which corresponded to 12 85 of the total embedded energy in the rainwater harvesting system for the comparison of sustainability between systems the life cycle assessment lca can be mentioned which is a tool capable of providing key information in sustainability helping the improvement of products and services through this methodology all impacts and inputs pertinent to the life cycle of innovations are verified in order to ensure that the implementation is beneficial to the environment and users variations such as life cycle energy assessment and life cycle cost assessment appear as a simplified option for the methodology in which only inputs and processes that involve energy and money respectively are considered according to fay et al 2000 the life cycle energy assessment lcea is a derivation of the lca created with the specific objective of analysing the energy belonging to the construction maintenance and end of life of a given system lcea has been widely used in civil construction projects to improve them energetically and make them more sustainable and economical fay et al 2000 tavares 2006 its popularity has grown strongly with the increased focus given to the conservation of natural resources and concern for ecological aspects life cycle cost assessment lcca is an analysis similar to lcea but with focus on money related activities despite the benefits provided by the installation of pervious pavements and their capacity to harvest stormwater the application of stormwater harvesting systems through pervious pavements is still not widely spread in brazil as a result studies that analyse the sustainability and profitability of stormwater harvesting systems through pervious pavements are increasingly required in order to assist their improvement 2 objective the objective of this work is to analyse the energy life cycle and the life cycle cost of stormwater harvesting systems in order to compare and evaluate the differences and verify what influences the profitability and sustainability of different types of pavement 3 methodology three different pervious pavement models were used in this work they were assessed in terms of embodied energy and economic benefits the site used for the evaluation of the system is a parking lot of a public building of the federal university of santa catarina ufsc the different pavement models were obtained through a literature review of brazilian works in the same field of study 3 1 definition of models to be compared the three models used were defined based on three brazilian studies acioli 2005 pinto 2011 and hammes et al 2018 these studies were selected because they are studies in the area of pervious pavement that design pervious pavement models with porous asphalt concrete also they have the main parameters that this study required for the simulation and subsequent lcea and lcca some modifications were made to some of the characteristics in order to be possible to understand how the differences between the models impact on the sustainability and profitability of the systems table 1 shows the main characteristics of the pervious pavement models taken from the studies in addition to the use of each of the characteristics 3 2 potential for potable water savings the simulations performed to achieve the potential for potable water savings were performed using the computer programme netuno 4 ghisi and cordova 2014 simulations were performed considering daily rainfall for the year 2017 and also for a long term rainfall time series the rainfall data were provided by the santa catarina agricultural research and rural extension company epagri sc including data between january 01 2003 and december 31 2017 the area of pervious pavement was estimated as 1500 m2 and it was determined that the total area of influence which directs water to the pervious pavement was 1700 m2 water consumption in the building was obtained from the department of architecture and engineering projects daep 2017 of ufsc the non potable water demand was obtained from botelho 2008 who estimated the water end uses in the same building that we are using as a case study 3 3 sizing of aggregate reservoir course the hydrological hydraulic design of the pavement was performed using two methods the method proposed by hammes et al 2018 and the envelope curve the goal of performing the design using both methods is to confirm the thicknesses obtained it was necessary to obtain the intensity duration frequency idf curve and talbot equations for florianópolis in order to estimate the maximum average rainfall intensity eq 1 shows the idf equation for the idf equation the following parameters as proposed by back 2013 for florianópolis were used k 1168 46 m 0 237 d 9 12 and n 0 703 in both methods the thickness was assessed for return periods equal to 2 5 and 10 years for the talbot curve which is similar to the idf no parameters were found for florianópolis thus it was necessary to make a curve adjustment to find which parameters when inserted in the talbot curve generate the smallest difference for the idf equation the parameters differ according to the return period chosen thus for each return period a different talbot curve was generated eq 2 shows the equation of the talbot curve as an example the following parameters were obtained and used for a return period equal to 5 years in the talbot curve a 4858 b 0 168 and c 18 82 1 i k t m t d n where k m n and d are variables according to the place of research non dimensional t is the return period years i is the maximum average rainfall intensity mm h t is the duration of rainfall minutes 2 i a t b t c where a b and c are variables according to the place of research non dimensional t is the return period years i is the maximum average rainfall intensity mm h t is the duration of rainfall minutes the method proposed by hammes et al 2018 is shown in eq 3 adapted from araújo et al 2000 the specific output flow through the drains qs was considered constant and can be obtained using eq 4 by dividing the input flow by the effective drainage area of the pavement an area in which there is pervious pavement the specific output flow could be obtained hammes et al 2018 3 h t r i q s η where h is the reservoir course thickness mm i is the maximum average design rainfall intensity mm h t is the design rainfall duration h r is the ratio between the drained area pervious pavement and impermeable areas which contribute to surface runoff and the pervious pavement area dimensionless q s is the specific output flow mm h η is the reservoir course porosity 4 q s i t a t 1000 t e a p where q s is the specific output flow m h i is the maximum average design rainfall intensity mm h t is the design rainfall duration h at is the total area that directs water to the pervious pavement m2 ap is the pervious pavement area m2 t e is the depletion period hours the second method tested was the envelope curve as proposed by silveira 2003 according to silveira 2003 the envelope curve method is a classic method that uses the simplified water balance and can be adapted for the pre design of pervious pavements the method consists of deriving the difference between the input volume and the output volume to find the maximization of the function eq 5 was used to estimate the maximum thickness of the water layer found in the reservoir layer instead of using the idf data the method uses the talbot curve coefficients eq 6 shows how to obtain the thickness of the reservoir layer from the maximum depth of water in the layer 5 v m á x a 60 β t b 2 c 60 q s 2 6 h v m á x η where v max is the design volume mm a b and c are coefficients from the talbot curve of the site dimensionless t is the return period of the enterprise years h is the necessary thickness of the reservoir course mm q s is the specific output flow mm h β is a coefficient used in the calculation of the envelope curve regarding the drained area and the pervious pavement area dimensionless η is the porosity of the reservoir layer the method used for calculating the specific output flow was the same one as used by hammes et al 2018 the only difference in the final value of the specific output flow was the use of a safety factor as stated by acioli 2005 in her research which takes into account the flood risks in case of inability to store stormwater the safety factor was considered herein as 1 5 considering no significant damage by an overflow in the parking lot the final specific output flow for the envelope curve method was obtained by dividing qs from eq 4 by the safety factor it was also necessary to increase the thickness of the reservoir course to give a slope to the bottom drains the largest dimension found in the direction of flow was 77 m between the furthest edge of the parking lot and the drain outlet to the lower reservoir the inclination was taken as 0 5 so as not to generate accentuated thicknesses the inclination thickness was obtained according to eq 7 7 h i l 2 where h is the thickness to be added mm i is the slope of the drains m m l is the longest length from the drainage outlet point to an edge of the pavement mm the final thickness for the lcea and lcca was chosen considering a return period equal to 5 years and rounded down 3 4 life cycle energy assessment the life cycle energy assessment as well as the life cycle cost assessment took into account the phases of construction and maintenance of the system the choice to leave out the options after the end of the lifespan of the system was made due to the numerous construction possibilities restoration or recycling for example it was also considered that it would not bring a significant difference in terms of energy or terms of cost in the final comparison between the models the following values were considered in the lcea initial embedded energy initial transport energy of the materials recurring embedded energy operating energy due to the motor pumps energy benefits of water savings 3 4 1 embedded energy the embedded energy is the energy belonging to the materials used in the initial production of the system it was calculated as shown in eq 8 it follows the same model as other similar studies that evaluated the embedded energy of construction systems tavares

3 recurrent embedded energy recurrent embedded energy is the energy belonging to the materials used in the system that need to be replaced because they have a shorter lifespan than the stipulated

years 3 4 4 energy for pumping water the usage phase comprises all the energy required to keep the system in full operation there is the energy consumption for the operation of pumps and the energy embedded in the chlorine used for water treatment since water quality was not assessed only the energy consumption for pumping water was calculated eq 11 was used to calculate the monthly energy consumption for pumping water similarly to marinoski 2010 11 e p u m p s 23 0 7355 3 6 p o t t f c where e pumps is the monthly energy consumption for pumping water mj pot is the power of the pumps installed hp t is the time of use of the pumps per day h day fc is the conversion factor from secondary to primary energy dimensionless the constant 23 is related to the number of days that the pump is on in one month the number 0 7355 is used to convert the energy from horsepower hp to kilowatt kw the number 3 6 is used in eqs 11 and 12 to convert from kilowatt hour kwh to megajoule mj the conversion factor from secondary to primary energy was obtained through a review of studies in the area cursino 2011 and was considered as 1 5 3 4 5 energy savings due to potable water savings during the life cycle of the system there will be the benefit of reducing the amount of water treated by the local water utility this benefit was calculated according to eq 12 similar to the methodology addressed by marinoski et al 2012 12 e b h y d r o 3 6 i e c w a t e r d a a l c s p s a v i n g s 100 f c where eb hydro is the energy savings due to the decrease in the amount of treated water by

treated water it corresponds to the energy necessary for all facilities which directly or indirectly demand energy in order to supply potable water it includes distribution water harvesting administrative facilities and any additional energy need in the water utility the coefficient used is based on florianópolis data from 2003 to 2015 obtained via snis 2017 the final energy balance can be obtained by summing all the energies considered and the energy savings due to potable water savings eq 13 shows the energy required for the construction and maintenance of the stormwater harvesting system through pervious pavements 13 e f i n a l e e j e t r a n s j e e r e p u m p s e b h y d r o where e final is the final energy balance ee j is the embedded energy of the subsystem j e transj

the implementation and maintenance and the economic benefit of decreasing the potable water consumption were obtained the costs considered in lcca were initial costs purchase of materials maintenance and labour costs pumps costs benefit from potable water savings 3 5 1 initial costs the initial costs are the sum of the labour costs and the costs of all materials used the costs were obtained through sicro 2018 sicro 2 2016 and sinapi 2018 which are government data used to assist in the budgeting of public works costs not included in these spreadsheets were obtained through research on the internet the objective was to detail as much as possible the stormwater harvesting systems including the components of the water system and the components of the pervious pavement 3 5 2 maintenance and labour costs labour costs were estimated through budget research on similar projects some government data sicro and sicro 2 of basic service costs were also checked the analysis was similar to that performed by marinoski 2010 maintenance costs were also estimated through government data on basic service costs for the pavement the costs of cleaning were estimated as for the water system maintenance labour costs due to the replacement of devices with a lifespan shorter than that of the system were also considered 3 5 3 cost of water pumping to calculate the costs of water pumping we obtained the fee that ufsc pays for each mj provided using data provided by the department of architecture and engineering projects daep of ufsc it was possible to estimate an average fee paid for each kwh delivered which was then converted to each mj delivered the monthly cost of water pumping was obtained using eq 14 14 c p u m p s e p u m p s f e l e t where c pumps is the monthly cost of

rate of return irr and the discounted payback the minimum attractiveness rate of return marr was set at the basic interest rate of brazil s economy selic rate in december 2017 at 7 4 per year the selic rate varied considerably in 2017 making it difficult to obtain a fixed reference value 4 results and discussion this section presents the results obtained i e the potential for potable water savings thicknesses of the reservoir layer for the different methods energy life cycle assessment and life cycle cost assessment 4 1 potential for potable water savings it was necessary to obtain data on potable water consumption and daily rainfall in order to simulate the potential for potable water savings the first flush was considered zero since stormwater is meant to be harvested from the pavement the catchment area pervious pavement plus the impermeable area that directs water to the pavement was considered to be 1700 m2 the water end uses were considered those of botelho 2008 who estimated the water demand for non potable uses as 69 of the total water demand botelho 2008 studied the water end uses in the same building that we are using as a case study the results showed that the major water consumption was in toilets corresponding to 62 the urinals corresponded to 7 washbasins corresponded to 28 and drinking fountains to 3 by adding the percentage from urinals and toilets 69 of the water demand was estimated to be non potable 4 1 1 potable water consumption fig 1 shows the minimum average and maximum monthly water consumption from 2011 to 2017 one can see there is a variation of water consumption in the vacation period and the school period from the data provided by daep the values necessary to simulate the potable water savings were extracted average monthly water consumption was used for the analysis over 2011 2017 for 2017 the measurements of water consumption over that year were used table 2 shows the data extracted from water bills in 2017 4 1 2 rainfall data daily rainfall data over january 2003 to september 2012 were assessed from the information centre for environmental resources and hydrometeorology of santa catarina ciram rainfall data for 2017 was also assessed fig 2 shows the monthly rainfall data from january 2003 to september 2012 fig 3 shows the data used for the year 2017 for input in netuno 4 computer programme rainfall was taken on a daily basis 4 1 3 potable water savings considering rainfall over 2017 fig 4 shows the potential for potable water savings as a function of the rainwater tank capacity for the three models considering rainfall over 2017 for all three models evaluated the ideal tank capacity was 20 000 l the potential for potable water savings found for each of the models was hammes model 42 09 savings pinto model 42 88 savings acioli model 43 57 savings such a difference in the potential for potable water savings is due to the available water coefficient which is different for each model 4 1 4 potable water savings considering a long term rainfall time series the results obtained considering a long term rainfall time series were slightly lower than those considering rainfall over 2017 the average potential for potable water savings was approximately 38 fig 5 shows the potential for potable water savings due to the use of stormwater in the building for the three models for all three models evaluated the ideal tank capacity was again 20 000 l 4 1 5 reservoir course thickness the thicknesses obtained using the hammes et al 2018 method are shown in table 3 it can be seen that the thickness of the models with lower porosity is much greater than those with higher porosity this occurs because the method correlates the thickness and the porosity with inverse proportion it is also notable the variation caused by the difference in the return period used longer return periods generated more conservative thicknesses the thicknesses calculated using the envelope curve were very similar to those obtained using the hammes et al 2018 method especially if the safety coefficient parameter that acioli 2005 indicated is not taken into account the results obtained without the use of the safety coefficient were very similar to those obtained using the hammes et al 2018 method table 4 shows the thicknesses obtained with the safety coefficient using the envelope curve method silveira 2003 the final reservoir course thicknesses defined for use in lcea and lcca with the increase of the inclination thickness are shown in table 5 they were chosen considering the return period equal to 5 years and rounded down the values obtained using the envelope curve method silveira 2003 were rounded down using the return period equal to 5 years this choice took into account that the thicknesses obtained using this method were all higher than those obtained using the hammes et al 2018 method because there was a safety coefficient the literature review which indicated a return period equal to 5 years as sufficient for the type of reservoir was also taken into account fig 6 shows as an example one of the final profiles obtained demonstrating the presence of the inclination in the model 4 2 life cycle energy assessment to carry out the lcea and later the lcca the system was divided into two subsystems the pavement subsystem containing all pavement layers and the hydraulic subsystem with the necessary components for pumping and using stormwater the pavement subsystem differs in the three models as there are differences between the types and thicknesses of the layers the hydraulic subsystem was the same for all models since the results of potential for potable water savings were very similar and there was no need for different pumps reservoirs or pipes table 6 shows the main data used in each layer and model based on such values it was possible to obtain the embedded energy of the pavement subsystem called epav the transport energy took into account two distances 3 5 km from the nearest building material store and 12 km from the nearest quarry transport energy of the pavement subsystem was called etranspav weights and quantities shown in table 6 were used for the hydraulic subsystem the pipes and the hydraulic pump were sized the capacities of the upper and lower reservoirs were taken from the results obtained from netuno 4 the fittings and components were estimated as being one third of the weight of the pipes table 7 shows the data used to calculate the embedded energy of the hydraulic subsystem ehyd and transport energy of the hydraulic subsystem etranshyd the operational energy of the systems includes the energy used to replace the materials and the energy required for the operation of the water pump it was estimated that there would be a replacement of the pumps and fittings and components every ten years i e half the life cycle of the system this estimate took into account the lifespan of the pumps usually ten years the result was 930 mj the energy required for the operation of the water pump considered the power of the chosen pump the time in a day that it would be on and the number of days of service in addition to the factor of conversion of secondary energy to primary energy the time in which the pump is on is a function of the water consumption in the building the energy consumption for the operation of the water pump over the life cycle of the system was 23 68 gj for the 2017 data and 25 49 gj for the long term time series data the energy benefit of water treatment was then quantified the value found for the energy benefit varied according to the model and the rainfall data used this occurs because it takes into account the potential for potable water savings which varied among the rainfall data and models table 8 summarizes all data used for the lcea table 9 shows the final energy balance for each of the stages analysed the main difference between the systems was the embodied energy and transport energy in the pavement subsystem even though the energy benefit from potable water savings was variable no significant differences were found as the potential for potable water savings were very similar in all subsystems energy for pumping was also variable according to the water consumption data used i e 2017 versus long term time series data almost 2 gj difference as for the hydraulic components all systems had the same values as no differences in components were obtained in fittings pumps drains and tanks 4 3 life cycle cost assessment table 10 shows the initial costs for the hammes model as an example the initial costs of the acioli and pinto models followed the same trend it is worth mentioning that the three models evaluated in this study were researched for different purposes by their authors being compared in this study only to understand what influences the final costs of pervious pavements the acioli model had an initial cost equal to r 139 271 58 the main differences for the hammes model were the additional 2 cm of porous asphalt the absence of a chocker course using an extra layer of geotextile and the difference of the reservoir course thickness the pinto model had an initial cost equal to r 150 812 65 the main differences from the hammes model were the use of bituminous macadam in the chocker course the use of grit as the last layer and the difference of the reservoir layer thickness even with the grit it was decided to keep the waterproofing material in the model the labour costs for the initial installation of the hydraulic subsystem were estimated through research into existing budgets for similar projects the costs were estimated at r 80 00 per day for each plumber and r 50 00 per day for each assistant the labour cost was r 4500 00 for the pavement subsystem it was considered that the initial costs included the installation the maintenance cost of the pavement subsystem was difficult to obtain considering the land cleaning value of sicro 2 2016 as a reference an estimated value of r 0 25 per square meter was obtained the annual cost of cleaning the pavement was r 1125 00 in year 10 of the analysis it was considered the cost of replacing the components that had a life cycle shorter than the system the costs of two water pumps one float level and one solenoid valve were considered labour costs were estimated as r 180 00 the pumping costs were calculated by multiplying the total amount of energy consumed during the life cycle of the system by the average rate ufsc pays to the energy utility the tariff used was r 0 60 per kwh for 2017 the cost was r 131 63 while for the long term time series it was r 142 00 per year the economic benefit of the decrease in water consumption in the building was then assessed as the water supply tariffs vary according to the amount of water supplied and vary during the months of the year a logarithmic regression was extrapolated to make it possible to calculate the new potable water supply tariff regarding the potable water savings table 11 shows the benefits of each model for the two rainfall data scenarios the models and scenarios were then economically analysed table 12 shows the results obtained for npv and irr the marr used was 7 4 per year due to the high initial cost that all models presented they were not economically feasible all the analyses made in the study corroborate for the conception that the pervious asphalt model is promising as a stormwater harvesting system but has high initial costs compromising the economic feasibility of the project such costs are mainly linked to the thickness of the reservoir layer the plastic components used and the porous asphalt such costs are also high in asphalt paving projects without the purpose of collecting rainwater thus a second analysis was carried out in which it was verified whether it is worth investing the additional costs to build a pervious pavement instead of a non pervious pavement in other words to compare a pervious model to a non pervious model the costs of the non pervious model can be subtracted the analysis was carried out as if both pavements pervious and non pervious were analysed before the construction of the parking lot in a design approach the non pervious pavement was designed regarding only the traffic in the parking lot containing only the pavement layers and the pervious pavement was designed regarding the hydrological hydraulic containing the pervious pavement layers geotextiles waterproofing and hydraulic components the thicknesses of the non pervious pavement for a parking lot have taken into account a pre sizing according to brazil national department of transport infrastructure standards dnit no traffic or subgrade data were obtained so that only an estimate of the thicknesses was made table 13 shows the thicknesses of non pervious asphalt pavement for the site and the relative cost of the layers by making the comparative economic analysis i e reducing the initial costs of the non pervious pavement model the systems would be economically feasible table 14 shows the npv irr and discounted payback for all models and data 5 conclusions it can be concluded that the use of pervious pavements in parking lots for stormwater harvesting is promising literature review shows many benefits for users and the hydrologic cycle pervious pavements can be able to attenuate the effects of waterproofing urban surfaces also stormwater can be harvested and used for non potable uses reducing potable water costs and stormwater runoff in the current state of the urban drainage systems local suds can be helpful to mitigate floods costs and energy consumption to manufacture the pavement are very high right now hindering economic benefits and making it impossible to have a positive energy balance it is recommended to verify the profitability and sustainability of systems similar to those studied in this research by replacing the coating with pervious concrete pavers in order to try to obtain better results it was also observed that the implementation of a stormwater harvesting system would allow for potential for potable water savings of at least 37 0 this would bring a reduction in potable water expenses of up to r 200 000 00 over the entire system lifespan there was also no major difference in the potable water savings using higher available water coefficients this shows that even if the pavement loses some water to evaporation or absorption from the aggregates potable water savings higher than 37 0 would be achieved for available water coefficients ranging from 0 80 to 0 95 if water available is closer to 80 of total rainfall which is more common it can lead to results very similar to those due to higher available water coefficients the systems were not economically feasible due to the high initial cost of the pervious pavement regarding the reservoir layer the plastic components used and the porous asphalt however by analysing the implementation of the stormwater harvesting system as an alternative to the non pervious pavement profitability was obtained therefore if analysed since the initial design stage choosing to construct a pervious pavement to harvest stormwater instead of a usual non pervious pavement could be economically feasible it was observed that when considering rainfall over only 2017 the results were better than those for the long term time series due to the decrease in water consumption and the increase in rainfall pattern both patterns helped the system to obtain greater potable water savings potential the main conclusion is that stormwater harvesting systems using pervious pavements can be profitable for this it is necessary to be rigorous in the definition of pervious layers preferring granular layers to plastic components to save money besides it is recommended a reasonable control of the compaction of the reservoir layer so that it has the porosity designed to store stormwater temporarily as for sustainability it was observed that the system saves more energy than it consumes over the life cycle however due to the high embedded energy in the system mainly related to bituminous granular and plastic materials it is impossible to ensure a negative energy balance at the end of the life cycle further research on the field regarding other types of coating and models of layers is recommended to design more energy friendly pervious pavements it was observed that the pavement subsystem energy and costs were higher than any of the hydraulic components which indicates that to obtain profitability the pervious pavement has to be focused on cost reduction and on lcea

18291,pervious pavements are one of the most used construction techniques among the sustainable urban drainage systems suds the objective of this article is to analyse the energy life cycle and the life cycle cost of stormwater harvesting systems using pervious pavements models in order to compare and evaluate the differences and verify what influences the profitability and sustainability the method proposed started with the definition of pervious pavement models based on literature review the main characteristic of the models analysed was the use of porous asphalt with different underlying layers i e thickness and material the hydrological hydraulic design of the pavements was also assessed the potential for potable water savings due to harvesting stormwater from a parking lot was estimated for a public building in florianópolis southern brazil the models were compared to identify what most influences the potable water savings the profitability and the sustainability of the systems the maximum potable water savings found were 42 it was also observed that the overall consumption of the building has been decreasing over the years and the yearly rainfall has increased which leads to a higher potential in the current water consumption pattern none of the systems evaluated was profitable or presented sustainability evaluated herein as negative energy balance however it was verified that if analysed comparatively with non pervious pavement it was profitable to use stormwater harvested from the pervious pavement thus it can be concluded that stormwater harvesting systems in combination with pervious pavements are promising serving as suds and saving money for users it is also noticeable that the use of porous asphalt is not recommended when aiming for systems with low embedded energy graphical abstract water consumption data rainfall data and potential for potable water savings by harvesting stormwater from a parking lot of a public building in florianópolis brazil image 1 keywords pervious pavements life cycle assessment embedded energy rainwater harvesting sustainability potable water savings 1 introduction to minimise problems caused by the waterproofing of urban surfaces construction techniques classified as sustainable urban drainage systems suds have been increasingly proposed against the usual urban drainage the waterproofing of urban surfaces produces discontinuities in the hydrological cycle sometimes overloading the urban drainage systems as drainage systems become inefficient to drain stormwater floods and user discomfort are generated tucci 2005 suds then introduce a concept of sustainable drainage by treating water locally which reduces the possibility of overloading stormwater distribution networks poleto and tassi 2012 one of the techniques contemplated in suds is the use of pervious pavements to harvest stormwater and reduce water flow to the public drainage system the use of pervious pavements aims to reduce the amount of stormwater runoff through infiltration in the pavement some benefits arise from the use of pervious pavements such as the filtration of heavy metals legret et al 1996 oil retention pratt et al 1999 decrease in the amount of stormwater runoff araújo et al 2000 meurer filho 2001 decrease in traffic noise bernucci et al 2007 knabben 2012 decrease in water spray from tires and improvement in road visibility bernucci et al 2007 the design of pervious pavements has already been widely studied and there are numerous manuals guidelines deq virginia 2011 napa 2008 fhwa 2015 ciria 2015 and examples of existing cases in brazil there are some studies of pervious pavement models with the definitions of the pervious layers their thicknesses and characteristics acioli 2005 pinto 2011 hammes et al 2018 another benefit that can be obtained with the application of pervious pavements is the harvesting of stormwater for use in buildings hammes et al 2018 kandhal and mishra 2014 gomez ullate et al 2011 the water collected by the pervious pavements is redirected for use in non potable purposes such as flushing toilets and cleaning outside areas thus reducing the amount of potable water that would be consumed in the building such use aligns the concept of suds with the fight against global water scarcity by saving potable water some studies on quality hammes et al 2018 antunes et al 2016 thives et al 2018 and quantity hammes et al 2018 thives et al 2018 indicate that stormwater infiltrated in pervious pavements can be used for non potable purposes in buildings according to the united nations environment program unep 2002 about one third of the world s population lived in countries where water availability was lower than water consumption in 2002 unep also estimates that before 2027 two thirds of the world s population will be in the same conditions of water availability thus the use of alternatives such as rainwater harvesting becomes fundamental currently several countries are carrying out studies on the use of rainwater as an alternative to water scarcity including studies of potable water savings potential ghisi et al 2005 liuzzo et al 2016 hammes et al 2018 public policies to encourage rainwater use lee et al 2017 ward et al 2012 life cycle assessment of rainwater harvesting systems anand and apul 2010 vialle et al 2015 among more specific studies ghisi et al 2005 for example studied the potential for potable water savings by collecting rainwater from roofs in the state of santa catarina brazil the water availability in the state will be less than 2000 m³ in the year 2100 which is considered a low availability according to unep 2002 thus they evaluated the potential for potable water savings in 62 cities in santa catarina the average potential for potable water savings was 69 ranging from 34 to 92 studies can also be found on the sustainability of rainwater harvesting systems mainly related to embedded energy marinoski et al 2012 for example carried out a study to analyse the environmental feasibility of rainwater harvesting systems and greywater reuse systems for non potable uses for the rainwater harvesting system the energy benefit was 1587 8 mj which corresponded to 12 85 of the total embedded energy in the rainwater harvesting system for the comparison of sustainability between systems the life cycle assessment lca can be mentioned which is a tool capable of providing key information in sustainability helping the improvement of products and services through this methodology all impacts and inputs pertinent to the life cycle of innovations are verified in order to ensure that the implementation is beneficial to the environment and users variations such as life cycle energy assessment and life cycle cost assessment appear as a simplified option for the methodology in which only inputs and processes that involve energy and money respectively are considered according to fay et al 2000 the life cycle energy assessment lcea is a derivation of the lca created with the specific objective of analysing the energy belonging to the construction maintenance and end of life of a given system lcea has been widely used in civil construction projects to improve them energetically and make them more sustainable and economical fay et al 2000 tavares 2006 its popularity has grown strongly with the increased focus given to the conservation of natural resources and concern for ecological aspects life cycle cost assessment lcca is an analysis similar to lcea but with focus on money related activities despite the benefits provided by the installation of pervious pavements and their capacity to harvest stormwater the application of stormwater harvesting systems through pervious pavements is still not widely spread in brazil as a result studies that analyse the sustainability and profitability of stormwater harvesting systems through pervious pavements are increasingly required in order to assist their improvement 2 objective the objective of this work is to analyse the energy life cycle and the life cycle cost of stormwater harvesting systems in order to compare and evaluate the differences and verify what influences the profitability and sustainability of different types of pavement 3 methodology three different pervious pavement models were used in this work they were assessed in terms of embodied energy and economic benefits the site used for the evaluation of the system is a parking lot of a public building of the federal university of santa catarina ufsc the different pavement models were obtained through a literature review of brazilian works in the same field of study 3 1 definition of models to be compared the three models used were defined based on three brazilian studies acioli 2005 pinto 2011 and hammes et al 2018 these studies were selected because they are studies in the area of pervious pavement that design pervious pavement models with porous asphalt concrete also they have the main parameters that this study required for the simulation and subsequent lcea and lcca some modifications were made to some of the characteristics in order to be possible to understand how the differences between the models impact on the sustainability and profitability of the systems table 1 shows the main characteristics of the pervious pavement models taken from the studies in addition to the use of each of the characteristics 3 2 potential for potable water savings the simulations performed to achieve the potential for potable water savings were performed using the computer programme netuno 4 ghisi and cordova 2014 simulations were performed considering daily rainfall for the year 2017 and also for a long term rainfall time series the rainfall data were provided by the santa catarina agricultural research and rural extension company epagri sc including data between january 01 2003 and december 31 2017 the area of pervious pavement was estimated as 1500 m2 and it was determined that the total area of influence which directs water to the pervious pavement was 1700 m2 water consumption in the building was obtained from the department of architecture and engineering projects daep 2017 of ufsc the non potable water demand was obtained from botelho 2008 who estimated the water end uses in the same building that we are using as a case study 3 3 sizing of aggregate reservoir course the hydrological hydraulic design of the pavement was performed using two methods the method proposed by hammes et al 2018 and the envelope curve the goal of performing the design using both methods is to confirm the thicknesses obtained it was necessary to obtain the intensity duration frequency idf curve and talbot equations for florianópolis in order to estimate the maximum average rainfall intensity eq 1 shows the idf equation for the idf equation the following parameters as proposed by back 2013 for florianópolis were used k 1168 46 m 0 237 d 9 12 and n 0 703 in both methods the thickness was assessed for return periods equal to 2 5 and 10 years for the talbot curve which is similar to the idf no parameters were found for florianópolis thus it was necessary to make a curve adjustment to find which parameters when inserted in the talbot curve generate the smallest difference for the idf equation the parameters differ according to the return period chosen thus for each return period a different talbot curve was generated eq 2 shows the equation of the talbot curve as an example the following parameters were obtained and used for a return period equal to 5 years in the talbot curve a 4858 b 0 168 and c 18 82 1 i k t m t d n where k m n and d are variables according to the place of research non dimensional t is the return period years i is the maximum average rainfall intensity mm h t is the duration of rainfall minutes 2 i a t b t c where a b and c are variables according to the place of research non dimensional t is the return period years i is the maximum average rainfall intensity mm h t is the duration of rainfall minutes the method proposed by hammes et al 2018 is shown in eq 3 adapted from araújo et al 2000 the specific output flow through the drains qs was considered constant and can be obtained using eq 4 by dividing the input flow by the effective drainage area of the pavement an area in which there is pervious pavement the specific output flow could be obtained hammes et al 2018 3 h t r i q s η where h is the reservoir course thickness mm i is the maximum average design rainfall intensity mm h t is the design rainfall duration h r is the ratio between the drained area pervious pavement and impermeable areas which contribute to surface runoff and the pervious pavement area dimensionless q s is the specific output flow mm h η is the reservoir course porosity 4 q s i t a t 1000 t e a p where q s is the specific output flow m h i is the maximum average design rainfall intensity mm h t is the design rainfall duration h at is the total area that directs water to the pervious pavement m2 ap is the pervious pavement area m2 t e is the depletion period hours the second method tested was the envelope curve as proposed by silveira 2003 according to silveira 2003 the envelope curve method is a classic method that uses the simplified water balance and can be adapted for the pre design of pervious pavements the method consists of deriving the difference between the input volume and the output volume to find the maximization of the function eq 5 was used to estimate the maximum thickness of the water layer found in the reservoir layer instead of using the idf data the method uses the talbot curve coefficients eq 6 shows how to obtain the thickness of the reservoir layer from the maximum depth of water in the layer 5 v m á x a 60 β t b 2 c 60 q s 2 6 h v m á x η where v max is the design volume mm a b and c are coefficients from the talbot curve of the site dimensionless t is the return period of the enterprise years h is the necessary thickness of the reservoir course mm q s is the specific output flow mm h β is a coefficient used in the calculation of the envelope curve regarding the drained area and the pervious pavement area dimensionless η is the porosity of the reservoir layer the method used for calculating the specific output flow was the same one as used by hammes et al 2018 the only difference in the final value of the specific output flow was the use of a safety factor as stated by acioli 2005 in her research which takes into account the flood risks in case of inability to store stormwater the safety factor was considered herein as 1 5 considering no significant damage by an overflow in the parking lot the final specific output flow for the envelope curve method was obtained by dividing qs from eq 4 by the safety factor it was also necessary to increase the thickness of the reservoir course to give a slope to the bottom drains the largest dimension found in the direction of flow was 77 m between the furthest edge of the parking lot and the drain outlet to the lower reservoir the inclination was taken as 0 5 so as not to generate accentuated thicknesses the inclination thickness was obtained according to eq 7 7 h i l 2 where h is the thickness to be added mm i is the slope of the drains m m l is the longest length from the drainage outlet point to an edge of the pavement mm the final thickness for the lcea and lcca was chosen considering a return period equal to 5 years and rounded down 3 4 life cycle energy assessment the life cycle energy assessment as well as the life cycle cost assessment took into account the phases of construction and maintenance of the system the choice to leave out the options after the end of the lifespan of the system was made due to the numerous construction possibilities restoration or recycling for example it was also considered that it would not bring a significant difference in terms of energy or terms of cost in the final comparison between the models the following values were considered in the lcea initial embedded energy initial transport energy of the materials recurring embedded energy operating energy due to the motor pumps energy benefits of water savings 3 4 1 embedded energy the embedded energy is the energy belonging to the materials used in the initial production of the system it was calculated as shown in eq 8 it follows the same model as other similar studies that evaluated the embedded energy of construction systems tavares

3 recurrent embedded energy recurrent embedded energy is the energy belonging to the materials used in the system that need to be replaced because they have a shorter lifespan than the stipulated

embedded in the chlorine used for water treatment since water quality was not assessed only the energy consumption for pumping water was calculated eq 11 was used to calculate the monthly energy

installed hp t is the time of use of the pumps per day h day fc is the conversion factor from secondary to primary energy dimensionless the constant 23 is related to the number of days that the pump is on in one month the number 0 7355 is used to convert the energy from horsepower hp to kilowatt kw the number 3 6 is used in eqs 11 and 12 to convert from kilowatt hour kwh to megajoule mj the conversion factor from secondary to primary energy was obtained through a review of studies in the area cursino 2011 and was considered as 1 5 3 4 5 energy savings due to potable water savings during the life cycle of the system there will be the benefit of reducing the amount of water treated by the local water utility this benefit was calculated according to eq 12 similar to the methodology

administrative facilities and any additional energy need in the water utility the coefficient used is based on florianópolis data from 2003 to 2015 obtained via snis 2017 the final energy balance can be obtained by summing all the energies considered and the energy savings due to potable water savings eq 13 shows the energy required for the construction and maintenance of the stormwater harvesting

the implementation and maintenance and the economic benefit of decreasing the potable water consumption were obtained the costs considered in lcca were initial costs purchase of materials maintenance and labour costs pumps costs benefit from potable water savings 3 5 1 initial costs the initial costs are the sum of the labour costs and the costs of all materials used the costs were obtained through sicro 2018 sicro 2 2016 and sinapi 2018 which are government data used to assist in the budgeting of public works costs not included in these spreadsheets were obtained through research on the internet the objective was to detail as much as possible the stormwater harvesting systems including the components of the water system and the components of the pervious pavement 3 5 2 maintenance and labour costs labour costs were estimated through budget research on similar projects some government data sicro and sicro 2 of basic service costs were also checked the analysis was similar to that performed by marinoski 2010 maintenance costs were also estimated through government data on basic service costs for the pavement the costs of cleaning were estimated as for the water system maintenance labour costs due to the replacement of devices with a lifespan shorter than that of the system were also considered 3 5 3 cost of water pumping to calculate the costs of water pumping we obtained the fee that ufsc pays for each mj provided using data provided by the department of architecture and engineering projects daep of ufsc it was possible to estimate an average fee paid for each kwh delivered which was then converted to each mj delivered the monthly cost of water pumping was obtained using eq 14 14 c p u m p s e p u m p s f e l e t where c pumps is the monthly cost of

rate of return irr and the discounted payback the minimum attractiveness rate of return marr was set at the basic interest rate of brazil s economy selic rate in december 2017 at 7 4 per year the selic rate varied considerably in 2017 making it difficult to obtain a fixed reference value 4 results and discussion this section presents the results obtained i e the potential for potable water savings thicknesses of the reservoir layer for the different methods energy life cycle assessment and life cycle cost assessment 4 1 potential for potable water savings it was necessary to obtain data on potable water consumption and daily rainfall in order to simulate the potential for potable water savings the first flush was considered zero since stormwater is meant to be harvested from the pavement the catchment area pervious pavement plus the impermeable area that directs water to the pavement was considered to be 1700 m2 the water end uses were considered those of botelho 2008 who estimated the water demand for non potable uses as 69 of the total water demand botelho 2008 studied the water end uses in the same building that we are using as a case study the results showed that the major water consumption was in toilets corresponding to 62 the urinals corresponded to 7 washbasins corresponded to 28 and drinking fountains to 3 by adding the percentage from urinals and toilets 69 of the water demand was estimated to be non potable 4 1 1 potable water consumption fig 1 shows the minimum average and maximum monthly water consumption from 2011 to 2017 one can see there is a variation of water consumption in the vacation period and the school period from the data provided by daep the values necessary to simulate the potable water savings were extracted average monthly water consumption was used for the analysis over 2011 2017 for 2017 the measurements of water consumption over that year were used table 2 shows the data extracted from water bills in 2017 4 1 2 rainfall data daily rainfall data over january 2003 to september 2012 were assessed from the information centre for environmental resources and hydrometeorology of santa catarina ciram rainfall data for 2017 was also assessed fig 2 shows the monthly rainfall data from january 2003 to september 2012 fig 3 shows the data used for the year 2017 for input in netuno 4 computer programme rainfall was taken on a daily basis 4 1 3 potable water savings considering rainfall over 2017 fig 4 shows the potential for potable water savings as a function of the rainwater tank capacity for the three models considering rainfall over 2017 for all three models evaluated the ideal tank capacity was 20 000 l the potential for potable water savings found for each of the models was hammes model 42 09 savings pinto model 42 88 savings acioli model 43 57 savings such a difference in the potential for potable water savings is due to the available water coefficient which is different for each model 4 1 4 potable water savings considering a long term rainfall time series the results obtained considering a long term rainfall time series were slightly lower than those considering rainfall over 2017 the average potential for potable water savings was approximately 38 fig 5 shows the potential for potable water savings due to the use of stormwater in the building for the three models for all three models evaluated the ideal tank capacity was again 20 000 l 4 1 5 reservoir course thickness the thicknesses obtained using the hammes et al 2018 method are shown in table 3 it can be seen that the thickness of the models with lower porosity is much greater than those with higher porosity this occurs because the method correlates the thickness and the porosity with inverse proportion it is also notable the variation caused by the difference in the return period used longer return periods generated more conservative thicknesses the thicknesses calculated using the envelope curve were very similar to those obtained using the hammes et al 2018 method especially if the safety coefficient parameter that acioli 2005 indicated is not taken into account the results obtained without the use of the safety coefficient were very similar to those obtained using the hammes et al 2018 method table 4 shows the thicknesses obtained with the safety coefficient using the envelope curve method silveira 2003 the final reservoir course thicknesses defined for use in lcea and lcca with the increase of the inclination thickness are shown in table 5 they were chosen considering the return period equal to 5 years and rounded down the values obtained using the envelope curve method silveira 2003 were rounded down using the return period equal to 5 years this choice took into account that the thicknesses obtained using this method were all higher than those obtained using the hammes et al 2018 method because there was a safety coefficient the literature review which indicated a return period equal to 5 years as sufficient for the type of reservoir was also taken into account fig 6 shows as an example one of the final profiles obtained demonstrating the presence of the inclination in the model 4 2 life cycle energy assessment to carry out the lcea and later the lcca the system was divided into two subsystems the pavement subsystem containing all pavement layers and the hydraulic subsystem with the necessary components for pumping and using stormwater the pavement subsystem differs in the three models as there are differences between the types and thicknesses of the layers the hydraulic subsystem was the same for all models since the results of potential for potable water savings were very similar and there was no need for different pumps reservoirs or pipes table 6 shows the main data used in each layer and model based on such values it was possible to obtain the embedded energy of the pavement subsystem called epav the transport energy took into account two distances 3 5 km from the nearest building material store and 12 km from the nearest quarry transport energy of the pavement subsystem was called etranspav weights and quantities shown in table 6 were used for the hydraulic subsystem the pipes and the hydraulic pump were sized the capacities of the upper and lower reservoirs were taken from the results obtained from netuno 4 the fittings and components were estimated as being one third of the weight of the pipes table 7 shows the data used to calculate the embedded energy of the hydraulic subsystem ehyd and transport energy of the hydraulic subsystem etranshyd the operational energy of the systems includes the energy used to replace the materials and the energy required for the operation of the water pump it was estimated that there would be a replacement of the pumps and fittings and components every ten years i e half the life cycle of the system this estimate took into account the lifespan of the pumps usually ten years the result was 930 mj the energy required for the operation of the water pump considered the power of the chosen pump the time in a day that it would be on and the number of days of service in addition to the factor of conversion of secondary energy to primary energy the time in which the pump is on is a function of the water consumption in the building the energy consumption for the operation of the water pump over the life cycle of the system was 23 68 gj for the 2017 data and 25 49 gj for the long term time series data the energy benefit of water treatment was then quantified the value found for the energy benefit varied according to the model and the rainfall data used this occurs because it takes into account the potential for potable water savings which varied among the rainfall data and models table 8 summarizes all data used for the lcea table 9 shows the final energy balance for each of the stages analysed the main difference between the systems was the embodied energy and transport energy in the pavement subsystem even though the energy benefit from potable water savings was variable no significant differences were found as the potential for potable water savings were very similar in all subsystems energy for pumping was also variable according to the water consumption data used i e 2017 versus long term time series data almost 2 gj difference as for the hydraulic components all systems had the same values as no differences in components were obtained in fittings pumps drains and tanks 4 3 life cycle cost assessment table 10 shows the initial costs for the hammes model as an example the initial costs of the acioli and pinto models followed the same trend it is worth mentioning that the three models evaluated in this study were researched for different purposes by their authors being compared in this study only to understand what influences the final costs of pervious pavements the acioli model had an initial cost equal to r 139 271 58 the main differences for the hammes model were the additional 2 cm of porous asphalt the absence of a chocker course using an extra layer of geotextile and the difference of the reservoir course thickness the pinto model had an initial cost equal to r 150 812 65 the main differences from the hammes model were the use of bituminous macadam in the chocker course the use of grit as the last layer and the difference of the reservoir layer thickness even with the grit it was decided to keep the waterproofing material in the model the labour costs for the initial installation of the hydraulic subsystem were estimated through research into existing budgets for similar projects the costs were estimated at r 80 00 per day for each plumber and r 50 00 per day for each assistant the labour cost was r 4500 00 for the pavement subsystem it was considered that the initial costs included the installation the maintenance cost of the pavement subsystem was difficult to obtain considering the land cleaning value of sicro 2 2016 as a reference an estimated value of r 0 25 per square meter was obtained the annual cost of cleaning the pavement was r 1125 00 in year 10 of the analysis it was considered the cost of replacing the components that had a life cycle shorter than the system the costs of two water pumps one float level and one solenoid valve were considered labour costs were estimated as r 180 00 the pumping costs were calculated by multiplying the total amount of energy consumed during the life cycle of the system by the average rate ufsc pays to the energy utility the tariff used was r 0 60 per kwh for 2017 the cost was r 131 63 while for the long term time series it was r 142 00 per year the economic benefit of the decrease in water consumption in the building was then assessed as the water supply tariffs vary according to the amount of water supplied and vary during the months of the year a logarithmic regression was extrapolated to make it possible to calculate the new potable water supply tariff regarding the potable water savings table 11 shows the benefits of each model for the two rainfall data scenarios the models and scenarios were then economically analysed table 12 shows the results obtained for npv and irr the marr used was 7 4 per year due to the high initial cost that all models presented they were not economically feasible all the analyses made in the study corroborate for the conception that the pervious asphalt model is promising as a stormwater harvesting system but has high initial costs compromising the economic feasibility of the project such costs are mainly linked to the thickness of the reservoir layer the plastic components used and the porous asphalt such costs are also high in asphalt paving projects without the purpose of collecting rainwater thus a second analysis was carried out in which it was verified whether it is worth investing the additional costs to build a pervious pavement instead of a non pervious pavement in other words to compare a pervious model to a non pervious model the costs of the non pervious model can be subtracted the analysis was carried out as if both pavements pervious and non pervious were analysed before the construction of the parking lot in a design approach the non pervious pavement was designed regarding only the traffic in the parking lot containing only the pavement layers and the pervious pavement was designed regarding the hydrological hydraulic containing the pervious pavement layers geotextiles waterproofing and hydraulic components the thicknesses of the non pervious pavement for a parking lot have taken into account a pre sizing according to brazil national department of transport infrastructure standards dnit no traffic or subgrade data were obtained so that only an estimate of the thicknesses was made table 13 shows the thicknesses of non pervious asphalt pavement for the site and the relative cost of the layers by making the comparative economic analysis i e reducing the initial costs of the non pervious pavement model the systems would be economically feasible table 14 shows the npv irr and discounted payback for all models and data 5 conclusions it can be concluded that the use of pervious pavements in parking lots for stormwater harvesting is promising literature review shows many benefits for users and the hydrologic cycle pervious pavements can be able to attenuate the effects of waterproofing urban surfaces also stormwater can be harvested and used for non potable uses reducing potable water costs and stormwater runoff in the current state of the urban drainage systems local suds can be helpful to mitigate floods costs and energy consumption to manufacture the pavement are very high right now hindering economic benefits and making it impossible to have a positive energy balance it is recommended to verify the profitability and sustainability of systems similar to those studied in this research by replacing the coating with pervious concrete pavers in order to try to obtain better results it was also observed that the implementation of a stormwater harvesting system would allow for potential for potable water savings of at least 37 0 this would bring a reduction in potable water expenses of up to r 200 000 00 over the entire system lifespan there was also no major difference in the potable water savings using higher available water coefficients this shows that even if the pavement loses some water to evaporation or absorption from the aggregates potable water savings higher than 37 0 would be achieved for available water coefficients ranging from 0 80 to 0 95 if water available is closer to 80 of total rainfall which is more common it can lead to results very similar to those due to higher available water coefficients the systems were not economically feasible due to the high initial cost of the pervious pavement regarding the reservoir layer the plastic components used and the porous asphalt however by analysing the implementation of the stormwater harvesting system as an alternative to the non pervious pavement profitability was obtained therefore if analysed since the initial design stage choosing to construct a pervious pavement to harvest stormwater instead of a usual non pervious pavement could be economically feasible it was observed that when considering rainfall over only 2017 the results were better than those for the long term time series due to the decrease in water consumption and the increase in rainfall pattern both patterns helped the system to obtain greater potable water savings potential the main conclusion is that stormwater harvesting systems using pervious pavements can be profitable for this it is necessary to be rigorous in the definition of pervious layers preferring granular layers to plastic components to save money besides it is recommended a reasonable control of the compaction of the reservoir layer so that it has the porosity designed to store stormwater temporarily as for sustainability it was observed that the system saves more energy than it consumes over the life cycle however due to the high embedded energy in the system mainly related to bituminous granular and plastic materials it is impossible to ensure a negative energy balance at the end of the life cycle further research on the field regarding other types of coating and models of layers is recommended to design more energy friendly pervious pavements it was observed that the pavement subsystem energy and costs were higher than any of the hydraulic components which indicates that to obtain profitability the pervious pavement has to be focused on cost reduction and on lcea

18292,microplastics are an emerging environmental contaminant existing knowledge on the precise transport processes involved in the movement of microplastics in natural water bodies is limited microplastic fate transport models rely on numerical simulations with limited empirical data to support and validate these models we adopted fluorometric principles to track the movement of both fluorescent dye and florescent stained microplastics polyethylene in purpose built laboratory flumes with standard fibre optic fluorometers neutrally buoyant microplastics behaved in the same manner as a solute rhodamine and more importantly displayed classical fundamental dispersion theory in uniform open channel flow this suggests rhodamine a fluorescent tracer can be released into the natural environment with the potential to mimic microplastic movement in the water column graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics fluorometric tracing longitudinal dispersion uniform flow microplastic transport advection diffusion 1 introduction microplastics defined as plastic particles 5 mm are an emerging environmental contaminant and are increasingly detected in freshwater environments jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 dris et al 2018 eriksen et al 2018 these contaminants originate from either primary or secondary sources boucher and froit 2017 primary sources include those intentionally manufactured for domestic and industrial purpose a common example being abrasive microbeads in personal care products and detergents boucher and froit 2017 secondary sources originate from the breakdown of large macro plastics largely by weathering processes including photodegradation which intensifies polymer abrasion gewert et al 2015 boucher and froit 2017 rummel et al 2017 these emerging contaminants have gained increased interest from society the scientific community and policymakers yet there is little understanding as to the environmental fate and behaviour of microplastics within fluvial systems kooi et al 2018 a unique feature of microplastics compared to other contaminant materials is their low density wide size distribution and persistence within the natural environment kooi et al 2018 this presents a challenge in validating models which can adequately capture their hydrodynamic behaviour in lotic ecosystems eriksen et al 2014 conservatively estimated that there are 250 000 tons of plastic floating within the world s oceans however a global survey by cózar et al 2014 estimated the global plastic load to be significantly lower and was measured to be within 7 000 to 35 000 tones the discrepancy between eriksen et al 2014 and cózar et al 2014 has been partially attributed to the size distribution of plastic debris with the visual methods employed by cózar et al 2014 unable to accurately detect sizes 1 mm in diameter erni cassola et al 2017 an inexpensive technique to visualize microplastics using microscopy has since been developed by erni cassola et al 2017 using nile red nr fluorescence this protocol allows the detection of small microplastics 20 1000 μm and has proven highly effective in quantifying the main groups of microplastic polymers that are commonly found within the water column polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and nylon 6 erni cassola et al 2017 there exist many potential pathways for the transport of microplastics from source to sea siegfried et al 2017 it is likely that size selective sinks are removing micro fragmented plastic debris during fluvial transport which could be contributing to the uncertainty in the fate of marine microplastics cózar et al 2014 the majority of microplastic studies have focused on the impact of these pollutants on marine ecosystems and their interactions with chemical pollutants ivar do sul and costa 2014 by comparison research into the physical transport processes governing the movement of microplastics within fluvial environments remains far more limited while fate transport models have attempted to explain the transport of microplastics within these systems law et al 2010 praetorius et al 2012 ballent et al 2013 they remain basic and are confined to predictive models using numerical simulations kooi et al 2018 field experimental studies are also limited and are restricted to sediment rillig et al 2017 and water samples collected from marine environments browne et al 2010 thompson et al 2004 horton et al 2017 as such the current knowledge pool provides a narrow understanding of the actual transport processes involved in microplastic movement in natural water bodies microplastics can enter fluvial systems via numerous land based activities including landfills domestic waste water and industrial activities which can be discharged into urban effluents dris et al 2018 boucher and froit 2017 lebreton et al 2017 sewage sludge is known to contain high quantities of microplastics dris et al 2018 as a large proportion is retained during water treatment mahon et al 2017 a significant proportion of microplastics i e pe and pp are sourced indirectly from the weathering and fragmentation of food packaging dris et al 2018 jambeck et al 2015 estimate that 4 4 to 12 7 million tonnes of plastic are discharged into the oceans each year as a consequence of outdated waste management strategies the main pathways of sewage are via river systems boucher and froit 2017 rivers transport an estimated 1 15 to 2 41 million tonnes of plastic waste to the sea lebreton et al 2017 the composition of plastic polymers within rivers is mainly comprised of pe 38 pp 24 pvc 19 and ps 6 andrady 2011 this data has been confirmed by several studies noting the presence of these polymers in river bed sediments across the globe klein et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 gasperi et al 2014 eerkes medrano et al 2015 hurley et al 2018 as such rivers represent the dominant medium connecting terrestrial microplastic sources to the marine sink subsequently the processes contributing to the loss of microplastics whilst in transit likely lies within the riverine environment there is a synergy in the transport mechanisms governing solutes and fine sediments in fluvial systems i e sorption diffusion and dispersion reviews of which include merritt et al 2003 wallis 2007 gottschalk et al 2009 wallis and guymer 2015 baalousha et al 2016 kooi et al 2018 as such it is not unreasonable to propose that microplastics ones which are neutrally buoyant could mimic solute transport in the natural environment the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d x achieved from fluorescent dye tracing is an established technique for measuring solute pollution spread in fluvial systems rutherford 1994 james 2002 ioannidou and pearson 2017 however to date there have been no novel methods developed to trace microplastics windsor et al 2019 the nr nile red dye used by erni cassola et al 2017 to selectively stain their range of microplastics exhibits a similar fluorescence signature λexcitation emission 552 636 nm to the traditional dye tracer rhodamine wt λexcitation emission 553 627 nm as such traditional fluorometric techniques to track rhodamine wt could potentially be used to track nr stained microplastics while there have been developments in fluorescent particle tracers for surface flow measurements tauro et al 2012 2013 this has largely been achieved through the use of particle image velocimetry if the movement of microplastics is found to mimic non toxic solute dyes i e rhodamine wt then these hydrologic tracers have the potential to be used as a starting point in which to further study microplastic movement in a real world setting the data generated from this could be used to support existing microplastic transport models and ultimately elucidate the fate of microplastics within a catchment this could help to resolve the marine microplastic mass imbalance and development of remediation strategies for the protection and enhancement of natural water quality in view of this there is a necessity to evaluate the applicability of this technique for microplastic tracking specifically within river systems the aims of this investigation were therefore threefold 1 to evaluate the suitability of using existing nr staining methods in combination with traditional fluorometric techniques to track microplastic movement 2 to compare the longitudinal dispersion characteristics of both rhodamine and nr stained microplastics in laboratory scale flumes under a range of different flow regimes 3 to elucidate the suitability of rhodamine as a proxy for microplastic movement in uniform open channels 2 methodology 2 1 microplastic staining polyethylene pe was chosen as the microplastic for this investigation pe is neutrally buoyant 0 975 g cm3 and is the most ubiquitous synthetic polymer found in water bodies geyer et al 2017 lebreton et al 2017 it is commonly used for packaging material predominately for single use products i e plastic bags plastic films etc geyer et al 2017 in addition experimental studies have shown pe to be a vector for organic contaminants through absorption teuten emma et al 2009 seidensticker et al 2018 making the need to understand the movement of these microplastics of increased importance in the natural environment pe is extensively fragmented into powdery fragments andrady 2011 with the increased abundance of these smaller synthetic polymers of significant ecological concern morét ferguson et al 2010 in order to replicate this material a size diameter of pe particles in the range of 40 46 μm powder was used the microplastic staining method outlined in erni cassola et al 2017 was adapted for use in this investigation here we adopt a method involving multiple incubation cycles of pe and nile red nr in order to trap the dye within the hydrophobic environment of the plastic during the process of heating expansion and cooling contraction the nr technical grade n3013 sigma aldrich was prepared in methanol to a working solution of 100 μg ml 1 by dissolving 10 mg of nr in 100 ml of methanol 1 g of pe powder 434272 sigma aldrich was suspended in 80 ml of ultrapure water and dimethyl sulfoxide v 1 1 solution the solution was incubated at room temperature 25 c 50 c and 75 c karakolis et al 2019 when each temperature was reached 2 ml of nr dye was added and left to stain for 10 20 and 30 min respectively karakolis et al 2019 after staining the particle dye solution was left overnight on an agitator at room temperature to enhance the fluorescence of the pe following this the plastic content was filtered and rinsed with deionised water until the filtrate ran clear the resulting florescent pe was then stored in 50 ml glass bottles and wrapped in aluminium foil 2 2 longitudinal dispersion and flow characteristics taylor s 1954 classical approach to describing the longitudinal dispersion of solutes in uniform flow conditions has been widely employed in numerous studies in both natural and laboratory open channel flows with in depth summaries of these data provided by both fischer et al 1979 and rutherford 1994 it follows a fickian diffusion type behaviour whereby the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d x in unidirectional flow conditions can be calculated from the passage of time t taken for the concentration of a tracer cloud c to move across a series of fixed points downstream from a discrete injection point it can be presented in the form of a one dimensional advection dispersion model ade from this the method of moments can be also used to estimate a single coefficient for the longitudinal dispersion d x which can be derived in accordance to fick s law by evaluating the rate of change of variance σ x 2 with time given by 2 1 d x 1 2 d σ x 2 d t 1 2 σ x 2 t 2 σ x 2 t 1 t 2 t 1 where σ x 2 t 1 and σ x 2 t 2 are the temporal variance of the tracer distributions at times t 1 and t 2 respectively fischer et al 1979 demonstrated that equation 2 1 can be rewritten 2 2 d x u 2 2 σ t 2 x 2 σ x 2 x 1 t 2 t 1 where 2 3 σ t 2 x i t t t i 2 c x i t d t t c x i t d t and the centroid t i of the distribution is given by 2 4 t i t t c x i t d t t c x i t d t where c depth averaged tracer concentration the mean velocity is 2 5 u x 2 x 1 t 2 t 1 where x is the distance along the channel m between the various measured positions along the channel and t is the time seconds for the centroid to move from one site to next d x can also be theoretically derived using elder 1959 equation which combines the shear dispersion effects of an idealised vertical velocity profile briefly 2 6 d x 5 93 h u where u is the shear velocity m s 1 and h is the mean channel depth m u can be functionally written as 2 7 u g r s o where g is gravity m2 s 1 r is the hydraulic radius a p a is the area m2 p is the wetted perimeter m and s o is the bed slope s o was experimentally determined for the velocities and ranged from 0 0010 to 0 0013 longitudinal mixing can be altered by transverse variations in flow velocity from shear effects due to channel roughness combined with turbulence and transverse mixing these parameters are not accounted for fully in equation 2 6 chikwendu 1986 presented a method for calculating the longitudinal dispersion in laminar or turbulent two dimensional or pipe flow which accounts for these shear stress effects in this method the flow is divided into n zones of parallel flow which is well mixed and moving at uniform velocity an interzone dispersion coefficient is calculated for each zone which accounts for mixing between the zones longitudinal dispersion is given by 2 8 d y n j 1 n 1 q 1 q 2 q j 2 1 q 1 q 2 q j 2 x v 12 j v 1 j 1 n 2 b j j 1 j 1 n q j e y j where 2 9 v 12 j k 1 j q k v k k 1 j q k m e a n v e l o c i t y i n t h e f i r s t j z o n e s v j 1 n k j 1 n q k v k k j 1 n q k m e a n v e l o c i t y i n t h e l a s t n j z o n e s in this study we apply the same technique to predict the longitudinal mixing coefficient from the defined vertical distribution of the longitudinal velocity an n zone model was created for each experimental velocity velocity measurements over the water column were acquired at intervals of 1 6 mm using a nortek vectrino fig s6 supplementary material an estimate of sheer stress u x was determined across each velocity using the log law relationship between the primary velocities over the depth and obtaining the gradient of the linear relationship the intercept of this line was used to derive the roughness of the channel bed manning s n these parameters alongside an assumed von karman constant of 0 41 were used to define the specific channel conditions by applying chikwendu s 1986 methodology and adopting the measured longitudinal velocity with suitable vertical exchange coefficients the overall calculated dispersion in the longitudinal direction can be determined 2 3 experiment flume conditions all tracer experiments were conducted in a 15 m long 300 mm wide recirculating tilting armfield flume fig 1 full details of the experimental set ups are presented in table 1 alongside some of the results uniform flow was established at average velocities of 0 05 0 62 m s 1 by adjusting the flume slope and tailgate this range was chosen to approximate velocities experienced by uk rivers guymer 2002 reynolds numbers r e were calculated for each velocity to determine the boundary conditions for each experimental injection and ranged from 7091 to over 118 000 table 1 indicative of turbulent flow conditions given by 2 10 r e u h v where u is the velocity m s 1 h is the mean channel depth m and v the kinematic viscosity m2 s 1 water depth was noted before each injection and varied between 135 mm to 180 mm within the flume and was confirmed using point gauges along the length of the flume dye and fluorescent pe tracing were carried out using four submerged turner design cyclops 7 fluorometers positioned at fixed points 1 97 m 5 63 m 9 13 m 12 3 m downstream from the injection point fig 1 the instruments were fixed at a position approximately 50 mm from the water surface and at a 20 angel to ensure maximum detection of the tracer cloud in the centre of flow and encompass its distribution at depth the cyclops s were connected to an automatic recorder which logged changes in the voltage of the water column as a consequence of fluorescence over a 0 5 s time interval manual pulse injections of both dye and fluorescent pe were made directly into the inlet pipe of the flume to ensure the that the contaminant was well mixed within the flow for each instantaneous injection of fluorescent pe approximately 1 g was injected combined with a small amount of water 10 ml it was then injected into the inlet pipe of the flume where it travelled approximately 1 m mixing with the turbulent inflow water before entering the flume fig 1 this was performed to ensure complete mixing before entry into the flume between tracer injections the injector point was flushed three times with water to ensure no cross contamination of rhodamine and pe for each dye injection 3 ml of rhodamine with a concentration of 106 ppb was used three to six discrete injections were undertaken for each discharge for both tracers the voltages recorded for both rhodamine and fluorescent pe were then converted into concentrations ppb and mg l 1 respectively using linear calibration curves r2 0 99 the cyclops instruments have a detection level of up to 15 cm from the optical sensor hence it was assumed that the majority of the water column set at 135 mm to 180 mm would be detected however to check that the pe particles and dye adhered to the assumptions of the one dimensional ade i e that they reached a homogenous lateral and vertical distribution in the water column particularly pe which has a naturally low density the cyclops instruments were positioned lying down at the same positions approximately 20 mm from the flume base three manual pulse injections of both the dye and pe were made as discussed previously across the range of average velocities tested i e 0 05 0 17 0 35 and 0 62 m s 1 for each test the dispersion coefficients were determined and compared to the corresponding data generated from the cyclops instruments positioned at the top of the water column supplementary material fig s1 the concentrations were also compared supplementary material fig s2 s5 overall these tests revealed similar corresponding dispersion coefficients generated at both the top and bottom measured positions with no significant differences reported concentrations were also comparable suggesting sufficient mixing of both the dye and pe across velocities 2 4 data processing before analysis the raw concentration data was processed by removing the background concentration this was defined as the mean concentration during the first 30 s before the tracer was injection the microplastic injections generated a more scattered dispersion band figs s7a s12a supplementary material especially for lower discharges 2 5 ls 1 this could be attributed to the pe particles generating discrete pockets of fluorescence compared to the well dissolved rhodamine dye to address this a smooth curve was drawn through the points compensating for background fluorescence and occasional anomalies figs s7b s12b supplementary material the standard ade coefficients were generated from the temporal concentration distribution of each tracer injection the cut off value of the distribution curve was defined as the point where the concentration at the tail of the curve reached approximately 5 of the peak concentration before analysis the background concentration was removed by interpolating a line between the leading and end tails of the concentration distribution curves the decision on where to interpolate this line from i e cut off points was i similar travel times standard deviation 3 dye 5 pe between the centroids of the distribution for the repeat injections and ii r2 value of 0 95 for the linear variance time plot the travel time t seconds of the passage of the centroid μ of the tracer cloud between measurement sites was calculated to understand how it changed from the upstream i profile to downstream ii briefly 2 11 t μ i i μ i 2 5 data analysis the data was processed using matlab and statistical analysis performed in graphpad prism v7 normality was tested using the shapiro wilk test the threshold level for significance was set at a probability of 0 05 the relationship between variables was tested using linear regression and root mean square error rmse 3 results the velocities calculated ranged from 0 05 to 0 65 m s 1 and were grouped into the following categories based on their averages 0 05 0 11 0 17 0 28 0 32 0 35 0 47 0 53 0 62 m s 1 the response curves of the instantaneous tracer injections were plotted as concentration against time elapsed figs 2 4 all profiles exhibit a gaussian shape distribution and were conservative under uniform flow conditions the travel times of the temporal concentration profiles were plotted in relation to velocity supplementary fig s13 and revealed that the dye and pe tracers move downstream at similar rates across all velocity centroid travel times were plotted in relation to velocity fig s13 supplementary material and show an expected inverse response the longitudinal dispersion coefficients obtained using the standard method of moments were plotted against the corresponding velocity fig 5 the coefficients range from 0 0034 to 0 0511 m2 s 1 for the dye and 0 0030 0 0690 m2 s 1 for the pe particles both the dye and pe longitudinal dispersion coefficients increase linearly with velocity with r2 values of 0 85 and 0 75 respectively fig 5b when the mean dispersion coefficients were plotted against velocity a higher linearity is recorded of 0 93 and 0 90 for the dye and pe respectively fig 5a in general the pe particles dispersed at a faster rate than the dye except at lower velocities 0 28 m s 1 table 1 however further comparison of the raw dispersion coefficient data revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between dispersion behaviour of the tracer and particle mediums welch s t test p 0 05 the longitudinal dispersion coefficients generated from the trace experiments was compared with the theoretical dx values obtained using both elder 1959 empirical ade model and the chikwendu 1986 model fig 6 as expected the analytical methodology of elder and the numerical methodology of chikwendu gave similar results overall there is a good fit between the measured experimental values and the theoretical dispersion coefficient constants this was confirmed by a one way anova with no significant difference identified between the experimental and theoretical dispersion data across all velocities p 0 05 exceptions to this trend were at velocities of 0 44 0 49 m s 1 when the theoretical values were in general significantly greater than the measured dye and pe dispersion coefficients fig 6 two anomalous dispersion coefficients were also observed for the dye at a velocity of 0 58 m s 1 and pe for a velocity of 0 65 m s 1 which were significantly greater than their respective theoretical values the strong agreement between the best fit line for both pe and dye and theoretical predictions is further reinforced by a comparison of the root mean square error rmse data table 2 here it is clear that the dye had a stronger agreement with the theoretical values except for a velocity of 0 35 and 0 62 m s 1 in general the dye and pe dispersion coefficients display a closer agreement to one another at lower velocities table 2 however overall all rmses were very strong across and between the experimental and theoretical coefficients 4 discussion the stained microplastics exhibited a stable fluorescence allowing detection and tracking in the water column previous research has suggested that microplastic particles are likely to behave in a similar manner to other particulate matter i e soil particles and organic matter with similar physical characteristics i e density size and shape nizzetto et al 2016 kooi et al 2018 the data suggest that pe microplastics 40 46 μm powder form disperse in a similar manner to rhodamine dye and comply with the assumption of fundamental dispersion theory in a straight channel under uniform flow conditions this is further supported by the comparative statistics this is likely attributable to the straight laboratory flume satisfying elder and chikwendu s assumption of an idealised velocity profile it is encouraging that both the pe and dye data plot on a similar linear trajectory across all experimental velocities when tested in uniform open flow conditions these velocities are representative of uk rivers however the physical and structural diversity of microplastics in the environment is abundant windsor et al 2019 and so their movement is compounded by the non uniformities of natural river reaches both within and across ecosystems i e meanders dead zones and vegetation this is emphasised by rutherford 1994 who reports longitudinal dispersion coefficients of between 30 h u to 3000 h u in natural river channels this is significantly greater than elder s 1959 theoretical value estimated for the boundary conditions of the flow channel used in the experiments obtaining more data for pe particles and dye across more representative complex river environments i e with a river bed may provide some guidance and insight into how this specific microplastic behaves in a natural river system nevertheless the methodology presented within this paper provides a foundational starting point to track and theoretically describe the movement of microplastics using existing solute transport technology we acknowledge the limitations of our data firstly only one specific type and size of microplastic was tested the inclusion of a wider range of plastics with different densities and sizes are required to elucidate the processes and validate the wider applicability of this methodology for example flakier microplastic particles generated primarily from car tyre abrasion lechner et al 2014 are likely to disperse differently due to increased drag secondly the microplastics tested were pure polymers with no biofilm growth in reality most microplastics are colonized by microbes a phenomenon which has been observed in marine long et al 2015 fazey and ryan 2016 michels et al 2018 and more recently freshwater environments parrish and fahrenfeld 2019 biofouling can change the hydrodynamics and size of microplastics which can cause even buoyant polymers to sink and settle in sediment due to aggregation besseling et al 2017 the environmental fate of microplastics is an emerging field of science as such there is only one conceptual fate transport model to our knowledge that describes microplastic transport in rivers nizzetto et al 2016 model progression is largely limited by a lack of empirical data however this in turn is constrained by the legalities and environmental implications of releasing microplastics into the natural environment this investigation provides a first attempt to trace the movement of neutrally buoyant microplastics in the water column using existing solute transport technology and theory furthermore this method uses a microplastic polymer pe which is ubiquitous within river environments and considered to be an environmental concern morét ferguson et al 2010 erni cassola et al 2017 kooi et al 2018 we show that a harmless fluorescent tracer in admissible doses smart and laidlaw 1977 rowinski and chrzanowski 2011 which can be safely released into the natural environment has the potential to be used a proxy for the movement of neutrally buoyant microplastics in uniform open channel flow this methodology could help to bridge current knowledge gaps including the residence times in fluvial systems transport pathways and sinks clark et al 2016 galloway et al 2017 windsor et al 2019 and thus validate existing transport models 5 conclusions the movement of neutrally buoyant microplastics polyethylene can be tracked in laboratory flume conditions using fluorometric techniques combined with existing solute transport technology neutrally buoyant microplastic particles behaved in a similar manner to solutes and followed theoretical dispersion theory in uniform open channel flow as such previously developed fluorescent tracking techniques using a harmless tracer which can be safely released into the

18292,microplastics are an emerging environmental contaminant existing knowledge on the precise transport processes involved in the movement of microplastics in natural water bodies is limited microplastic fate transport models rely on numerical simulations with limited empirical data to support and validate these models we adopted fluorometric principles to track the movement of both fluorescent dye and florescent stained microplastics polyethylene in purpose built laboratory flumes with standard fibre optic fluorometers neutrally buoyant microplastics behaved in the same manner as a solute rhodamine and more importantly displayed classical fundamental dispersion theory in uniform open channel flow this suggests rhodamine a fluorescent tracer can be released into the natural environment with the potential to mimic microplastic movement in the water column graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics fluorometric tracing longitudinal dispersion uniform flow microplastic transport advection diffusion 1 introduction microplastics defined as plastic particles 5 mm are an emerging environmental contaminant and are increasingly detected in freshwater environments jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 dris et al 2018 eriksen et al 2018 these contaminants originate from either primary or secondary sources boucher and froit 2017 primary sources include those intentionally manufactured for domestic and industrial purpose a common example being abrasive microbeads in personal care products and detergents boucher and froit 2017 secondary sources originate from the breakdown of large macro plastics largely by weathering processes including photodegradation which intensifies polymer abrasion gewert et al 2015 boucher and froit 2017 rummel et al 2017 these emerging contaminants have gained increased interest from society the scientific community and policymakers yet there is little understanding as to the environmental fate and behaviour of microplastics within fluvial systems kooi et al 2018 a unique feature of microplastics compared to other contaminant materials is their low density wide size distribution and persistence within the natural environment kooi et al 2018 this presents a challenge in validating models which can adequately capture their hydrodynamic behaviour in lotic ecosystems eriksen et al 2014 conservatively estimated that there are 250 000 tons of plastic floating within the world s oceans however a global survey by cózar et al 2014 estimated the global plastic load to be significantly lower and was measured to be within 7 000 to 35 000 tones the discrepancy between eriksen et al 2014 and cózar et al 2014 has been partially attributed to the size distribution of plastic debris with the visual methods employed by cózar et al 2014 unable to accurately detect sizes 1 mm in diameter erni cassola et al 2017 an inexpensive technique to visualize microplastics using microscopy has since been developed by erni cassola et al 2017 using nile red nr fluorescence this protocol allows the detection of small microplastics 20 1000 μm and has proven highly effective in quantifying the main groups of microplastic polymers that are commonly found within the water column polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and nylon 6 erni cassola et al 2017 there exist many potential pathways for the transport of microplastics from source to sea siegfried et al 2017 it is likely that size selective sinks are removing micro fragmented plastic debris during fluvial transport which could be contributing to the uncertainty in the fate of marine microplastics cózar et al 2014 the majority of microplastic studies have focused on the impact of these pollutants on marine ecosystems and their interactions with chemical pollutants ivar do sul and costa 2014 by comparison research into the physical transport processes governing the movement of microplastics within fluvial environments remains far more limited while fate transport models have attempted to explain the transport of microplastics within these systems law et al 2010 praetorius et al 2012 ballent et al 2013 they remain basic and are confined to predictive models using numerical simulations kooi et al 2018 field experimental studies are also limited and are restricted to sediment rillig et al 2017 and water samples collected from marine environments browne et al 2010 thompson et al 2004 horton et al 2017 as such the current knowledge pool provides a narrow understanding of the actual transport processes involved in microplastic movement in natural water bodies microplastics can enter fluvial systems via numerous land based activities including landfills domestic waste water and industrial activities which can be discharged into urban effluents dris et al 2018 boucher and froit 2017 lebreton et al 2017 sewage sludge is known to contain high quantities of microplastics dris et al 2018 as a large proportion is retained during water treatment mahon et al 2017 a significant proportion of microplastics i e pe and pp are sourced indirectly from the weathering and fragmentation of food packaging dris et al 2018 jambeck et al 2015 estimate that 4 4 to 12 7 million tonnes of plastic are discharged into the oceans each year as a consequence of outdated waste management strategies the main pathways of sewage are via river systems boucher and froit 2017 rivers transport an estimated 1 15 to 2 41 million tonnes of plastic waste to the sea lebreton et al 2017 the composition of plastic polymers within rivers is mainly comprised of pe 38 pp 24 pvc 19 and ps 6 andrady 2011 this data has been confirmed by several studies noting the presence of these polymers in river bed sediments across the globe klein et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 gasperi et al 2014 eerkes medrano et al 2015 hurley et al 2018 as such rivers represent the dominant medium connecting terrestrial microplastic sources to the marine sink subsequently the processes contributing to the loss of microplastics whilst in transit likely lies within the riverine environment there is a synergy in the transport mechanisms governing solutes and fine sediments in fluvial systems i e sorption diffusion and dispersion reviews of which include merritt et al 2003 wallis 2007 gottschalk et al 2009 wallis and guymer 2015 baalousha et al 2016 kooi et al 2018 as such it is not unreasonable to propose that microplastics ones which are neutrally buoyant could mimic solute transport in the natural environment the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d x achieved from fluorescent dye tracing is an established technique for measuring solute pollution spread in fluvial systems rutherford 1994 james 2002 ioannidou and pearson 2017 however to date there have been no novel methods developed to trace microplastics windsor et al 2019 the nr nile red dye used by erni cassola et al 2017 to selectively stain their range of microplastics exhibits a similar fluorescence signature λexcitation emission 552 636 nm to the traditional dye tracer rhodamine wt λexcitation emission 553 627 nm as such traditional fluorometric techniques to track rhodamine wt could potentially be used to track nr stained microplastics while there have been developments in fluorescent particle tracers for surface flow measurements tauro et al 2012 2013 this has largely been achieved through the use of particle image velocimetry if the movement of microplastics is found to mimic non toxic solute dyes i e rhodamine wt then these hydrologic tracers have the potential to be used as a starting point in which to further study microplastic movement in a real world setting the data generated from this could be used to support existing microplastic transport models and ultimately elucidate the fate of microplastics within a catchment this could help to resolve the marine microplastic mass imbalance and development of remediation strategies for the protection and enhancement of natural water quality in view of this there is a necessity to evaluate the applicability of this technique for microplastic tracking specifically within river systems the aims of this investigation were therefore threefold 1 to evaluate the suitability of using existing nr staining methods in combination with traditional fluorometric techniques to track microplastic movement 2 to compare the longitudinal dispersion characteristics of both rhodamine and nr stained microplastics in laboratory scale flumes under a range of different flow regimes 3 to elucidate the suitability of rhodamine as a proxy for microplastic movement in uniform open channels 2 methodology 2 1 microplastic staining polyethylene pe was chosen as the microplastic for this investigation pe is neutrally buoyant 0 975 g cm3 and is the most ubiquitous synthetic polymer found in water bodies geyer et al 2017 lebreton et al 2017 it is commonly used for packaging material predominately for single use products i e plastic bags plastic films etc geyer et al 2017 in addition experimental studies have shown pe to be a vector for organic contaminants through absorption teuten emma et al 2009 seidensticker et al 2018 making the need to understand the movement of these microplastics of increased importance in the natural environment pe is extensively fragmented into powdery fragments andrady 2011 with the increased abundance of these smaller synthetic polymers of significant ecological concern morét ferguson et al 2010 in order to replicate this material a size diameter of pe particles in the range of 40 46 μm powder was used the microplastic staining method outlined in erni cassola et al 2017 was adapted for use in this investigation here we adopt a method involving multiple incubation cycles of pe and nile red nr in order to trap the dye within the hydrophobic environment of the plastic during the process of heating expansion and cooling contraction the nr technical grade n3013 sigma aldrich was prepared in methanol to a working solution of 100 μg ml 1 by dissolving 10 mg of nr in 100 ml of methanol 1 g of pe powder 434272 sigma aldrich was suspended in 80 ml of ultrapure water and dimethyl sulfoxide v 1 1 solution the solution was incubated at room temperature 25 c 50 c and 75 c karakolis et al 2019 when each temperature was reached 2 ml of nr dye was added and left to stain for 10 20 and 30 min respectively karakolis et al 2019 after staining the particle dye solution was left overnight on an agitator at room temperature to enhance the fluorescence of the pe following this the plastic content was filtered and rinsed with deionised water until the filtrate ran clear the resulting florescent pe was then stored in 50 ml glass bottles and wrapped in aluminium foil 2 2 longitudinal dispersion and flow characteristics taylor s 1954 classical approach to describing the longitudinal dispersion of solutes in uniform flow conditions has been widely employed in numerous studies in both natural and laboratory open channel flows with in depth summaries of these data provided by both fischer et al 1979 and rutherford 1994 it follows a fickian diffusion type behaviour whereby the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d x in unidirectional flow conditions can be calculated from the passage of time t taken for the concentration of a tracer cloud c to move across a series of fixed points downstream from a discrete injection point it can be presented in the form of a one dimensional advection dispersion model ade from this the method of moments can be also used to estimate a single coefficient for the longitudinal dispersion d x which can be derived in accordance to fick s law by evaluating the rate of change of variance σ x 2 with time given by 2 1 d x 1 2 d σ x 2 d t 1 2 σ x 2 t 2 σ x 2 t 1 t 2 t 1 where σ x 2 t 1 and σ x 2 t 2 are the temporal variance of the tracer distributions at times t 1 and t 2 respectively fischer et al 1979 demonstrated that equation 2 1 can be rewritten 2 2 d x u 2 2 σ t 2 x 2 σ x 2 x 1 t 2 t 1 where 2 3 σ t 2 x i t t t i 2 c x i t d t t c x i t d t and the centroid t i of the distribution is given by 2 4 t i t t c x i t d t t c x i t d t where c depth averaged tracer concentration the mean velocity is 2 5 u x 2 x 1 t 2 t 1 where x is the distance along the channel m between the various measured positions along the channel and t is the time seconds for the centroid to move from one site to next d x can also be theoretically derived using elder 1959 equation which combines the shear dispersion effects of an idealised vertical velocity profile briefly 2 6 d x 5 93 h u where u is the shear velocity m s 1 and h is the mean channel depth m u can be functionally written as 2 7 u g r s o where g is gravity m2 s 1 r is the hydraulic radius a p a is the area m2 p is the wetted perimeter m and s o is the bed slope s o was experimentally determined for the velocities and ranged from 0 0010 to 0 0013 longitudinal mixing can be altered by transverse variations in flow velocity from shear effects due to channel roughness combined with turbulence and transverse mixing these parameters are not accounted for fully in equation 2 6 chikwendu 1986 presented a method for calculating the longitudinal dispersion in laminar or turbulent two dimensional or pipe flow which accounts for these shear stress effects in this method the flow is divided into n zones of parallel flow which is well mixed and moving at uniform velocity an interzone dispersion coefficient is calculated for each zone which accounts for mixing between the zones longitudinal dispersion is given by 2 8 d y n j 1 n 1 q 1 q 2 q j 2 1 q 1 q 2 q j 2 x v 12 j v 1 j 1 n 2 b j j 1 j 1 n q j e y j where 2 9 v 12 j k 1 j q k v k k 1 j q k m e a n v e l o c i t y i n t h e f i r s t j z o n e s v j 1 n k j 1 n q k v k k j 1 n q k m e a n v e l o c i t y i n t h e l a s t n j z o n e s in this study we apply the same technique to predict the longitudinal mixing coefficient from the defined vertical distribution of the longitudinal velocity an n zone model was created for each experimental velocity velocity measurements over the water column were acquired at intervals of 1 6 mm using a nortek vectrino fig s6 supplementary material an estimate of sheer stress u x was determined across each velocity using the log law relationship between the primary velocities over the depth and obtaining the gradient of the linear relationship the intercept of this line was used to derive the roughness of the channel bed manning s n these parameters alongside an assumed von karman constant of 0 41 were used to define the specific channel conditions by applying chikwendu s 1986 methodology and adopting the measured longitudinal velocity with suitable vertical exchange coefficients the overall calculated dispersion in the longitudinal direction can be determined 2 3 experiment flume conditions all tracer experiments were conducted in a 15 m long 300 mm wide recirculating tilting armfield flume fig 1 full details of the experimental set ups are presented in table 1 alongside some of the results uniform flow was established at average velocities of 0 05 0 62 m s 1 by adjusting the flume slope and tailgate this range was chosen to approximate velocities experienced by uk rivers guymer 2002 reynolds numbers r e were calculated for each velocity to determine the boundary conditions for each experimental injection and ranged from 7091 to over 118 000 table 1 indicative of turbulent flow conditions given by 2 10 r e u h v where u is the velocity m s 1 h is the mean channel depth m and v the kinematic viscosity m2 s 1 water depth was noted before each injection and varied between 135 mm to 180 mm within the flume and was confirmed using point gauges along the length of the flume dye and fluorescent pe tracing were carried out using four submerged turner design cyclops 7 fluorometers positioned at fixed points 1 97 m 5 63 m 9 13 m 12 3 m downstream from the injection point fig 1 the instruments were fixed at a position approximately 50 mm from the water surface and at a 20 angel to ensure maximum detection of the tracer cloud in the centre of flow and encompass its distribution at depth the cyclops s were connected to an automatic recorder which logged changes in the voltage of the water column as a consequence of fluorescence over a 0 5 s time interval manual pulse injections of both dye and fluorescent pe were made directly into the inlet pipe of the flume to ensure the that the contaminant was well mixed within the flow for each instantaneous injection of fluorescent pe approximately 1 g was injected combined with a small amount of water 10 ml it was then injected into the inlet pipe of the flume where it travelled approximately 1 m mixing with the turbulent inflow water before entering the flume fig 1 this was performed to ensure complete mixing before entry into the flume between tracer injections the injector point was flushed three times with water to ensure no cross contamination of rhodamine and pe for each dye injection 3 ml of rhodamine with a concentration of 106 ppb was used three to six discrete injections were undertaken for each discharge for both tracers the voltages recorded for both rhodamine and fluorescent pe were then converted into concentrations ppb and mg l 1 respectively using linear calibration curves r2 0 99 the cyclops instruments have a detection level of up to 15 cm from the optical sensor hence it was assumed that the majority of the water column set at 135 mm to 180 mm would be detected however to check that the pe particles and dye adhered to the assumptions of the one dimensional ade i e that they reached a homogenous lateral and vertical distribution in the water column particularly pe which has a naturally low density the cyclops instruments were positioned lying down at the same positions approximately 20 mm from the flume base three manual pulse injections of both the dye and pe were made as discussed previously across the range of average velocities tested i e 0 05 0 17 0 35 and 0 62 m s 1 for each test the dispersion coefficients were determined and compared to the corresponding data generated from the cyclops instruments positioned at the top of the water column supplementary material fig s1 the concentrations were also compared supplementary material fig s2 s5 overall these tests revealed similar corresponding dispersion coefficients generated at both the top and bottom measured positions with no significant differences reported concentrations were also comparable suggesting sufficient mixing of both the dye and pe across velocities 2 4 data processing before analysis the raw concentration data was processed by removing the background concentration this was defined as the mean concentration during the first 30 s before the tracer was injection the microplastic injections generated a more scattered dispersion band figs s7a s12a supplementary material especially for lower discharges 2 5 ls 1 this could be attributed to the pe particles generating discrete pockets of fluorescence compared to the well dissolved rhodamine dye to address this a smooth curve was drawn through the points compensating for background fluorescence and occasional anomalies figs s7b s12b supplementary material the standard ade coefficients were generated from the temporal concentration distribution of each tracer injection the cut off value of the distribution curve was defined as the point where the concentration at the tail of the curve reached approximately 5 of the peak concentration before analysis the background concentration was removed by interpolating a line between the leading and end tails of the concentration distribution curves the decision on where to interpolate this line from i e cut off points was i similar travel times standard deviation 3 dye 5 pe between the centroids of the distribution for the repeat injections and ii r2 value of 0 95 for the linear variance time plot the travel time t seconds of the passage of the centroid μ of the tracer cloud between measurement sites was calculated to understand how it changed from the upstream i profile to downstream ii briefly 2 11 t μ i i μ i 2 5 data analysis the data was processed using matlab and statistical analysis performed in graphpad prism v7 normality was tested using the shapiro wilk test the threshold level for significance was set at a probability of 0 05 the relationship between variables was tested using linear regression and root mean square error rmse 3 results the velocities calculated ranged from 0 05 to 0 65 m s 1 and were grouped into the following categories based on their averages 0 05 0 11 0 17 0 28 0 32 0 35 0 47 0 53 0 62 m s 1 the response curves of the instantaneous tracer injections were plotted as concentration against time elapsed figs 2 4 all profiles exhibit a gaussian shape distribution and were conservative under uniform flow conditions the travel times of the temporal concentration profiles were plotted in relation to velocity supplementary fig s13 and revealed that the dye and pe tracers move downstream at similar rates across all velocity centroid travel times were plotted in relation to velocity fig s13 supplementary material and show an expected inverse response the longitudinal dispersion coefficients obtained using the standard method of moments were plotted against the corresponding velocity fig 5 the coefficients range from 0 0034 to 0 0511 m2 s 1 for the dye and 0 0030 0 0690 m2 s 1 for the pe particles both the dye and pe longitudinal dispersion coefficients increase linearly with velocity with r2 values of 0 85 and 0 75 respectively fig 5b when the mean dispersion coefficients were plotted against velocity a higher linearity is recorded of 0 93 and 0 90 for the dye and pe respectively fig 5a in general the pe particles dispersed at a faster rate than the dye except at lower velocities 0 28 m s 1 table 1 however further comparison of the raw dispersion coefficient data revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between dispersion behaviour of the tracer and particle mediums welch s t test p 0 05 the longitudinal dispersion coefficients generated from the trace experiments was compared with the theoretical dx values obtained using both elder 1959 empirical ade model and the chikwendu 1986 model fig 6 as expected the analytical methodology of elder and the numerical methodology of chikwendu gave similar results overall there is a good fit between the measured experimental values and the theoretical dispersion coefficient constants this was confirmed by a one way anova with no significant difference identified between the experimental and theoretical dispersion data across all velocities p 0 05 exceptions to this trend were at velocities of 0 44 0 49 m s 1 when the theoretical values were in general significantly greater than the measured dye and pe dispersion coefficients fig 6 two anomalous dispersion coefficients were also observed for the dye at a velocity of 0 58 m s 1 and pe for a velocity of 0 65 m s 1 which were significantly greater than their respective theoretical values the strong agreement between the best fit line for both pe and dye and theoretical predictions is further reinforced by a comparison of the root mean square error rmse data table 2 here it is clear that the dye had a stronger agreement with the theoretical values except for a velocity of 0 35 and 0 62 m s 1 in general the dye and pe dispersion coefficients display a closer agreement to one another at lower velocities table 2 however overall all rmses were very strong across and between the experimental and theoretical coefficients 4 discussion the stained

membrane bioreactors hr mbrs integrating a biological process with a high rejection membrane such as nanofiltration nf forward osmosis fo and membrane distillation md have received significant attention in the field of wastewater reclamation due to their improved permeate quality as compared to conventional microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf based mbr lay et al 2010 luo et al 2014 in md mbr clean water can be achieved in a single step while an additional step is required to recover the clean water from the draw solution in fo mbr whereas in nf mbr with the improved mbr permeate as ro feed the subsequent ro process can be potentially operated at higher recovery rate due to less ro fouling tay et al 2018 in hr mbrs the high rejection membranes effectively retain the smaller size and refractory organic substances leading to enhanced biodegradation improved removal rates however the major disadvantage is the retention that leads to the accumulation of dissolved ions in the bioreactor by the high rejection membranes qiu and ting 2013 it is noted that the concentration factor cf defined as the ratio of concentration of mixed liquor in the bioreactor to the feed concentration is related to the sludge retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt in which the maximum value cfmax srt hrt lay et al 2010 thus srt is an important parameter in determining salt accumulation ratio in hr mbrs in conventional mf uf mbr extending the srt generally promoted lower soluble microbial products smp lower specific bound eps production better bio flocculation and formation of a more permeable cake layer therefore resulting in less membrane fouling iorhemen et al 2017 massé et al 2006 ng et al 2006 van den broeck et al 2012 wu et al 2011 it is noted that longer srt was often adopted to maintain high biomass concentrations lower f m ratio reduce solids production and minimize reactor volume pollice et al 2004 xiao et al 2019 in addition longer srt was preferred for more effective nitrification since the autotrophic nitrifiers are very slow growing microorganisms compared to other aerobic bacteria ge et al 2015 on the other hand in hr mbrs extending the srt essentially means increasing the salt accumulation which can potentially impact the physical chemical properties of the feed solution bioprocess and membrane operation lay et al 2010 luo et al 2014 for example when salinity increases solubility of oxygen decreases linearly which leads to lower oxygen transfer rate colt 2012 this substantially reduces the effectiveness of aeration which is translated into higher energy requirement to achieve the desired do level regarding the impact of salinity on bioprocess in both fo mbr and md mbr it has been found that elevated salinity could lead to a shift in microbial community lower growth yield and lower microbial kinetics of the activated sludge necessary for the biological treatment and eventually resulted in process deterioration luján facundo et al 2018 nawaz et al 2013 wijekoon et al 2014 in term of impact of salinity on membrane operation in general higher feed salinity means reduced net driving force due to higher osmotic pressure difference and greater transport of solutes across the membrane that lower the permeate flux and quality in addition accumulation of dissolved ions such as ca2 mg2 so4 2 po4 3 etc can increase the risk of membrane scaling and aggravate colloidal fouling due to their higher supersaturation indexes furthermore the increase in extracellular polymeric substances eps production under high salinity environment as a protective mechanism for bacteria was found to increase the fouling propensity in fo mbr qiu and ting 2013 it shall be noted that most of the work reported on impacts of salt accumulation were related to fo mbr and md mbr the in depth study to address this issue for nf mbr application was not available indeed research work on nf mbr in the literature was rather limited possibly associated with the poor permeability of nf membranes typical flux was less than 5 l m2h choi et al 2006 2007 phan et al 2016 zaviska et al 2013 except in our previous work where flux of 10 l m2h was attained with the use of a low pressure in house fabricated nf membrane tay et al 2018 therefore it is unclear whether such observations found in fo mbr and md mbr are applicable to nf mbr for instance the driving force and membrane properties such as structure permeability and rejection of fo md and nf membranes differ from each other which could have imposed different effects arisen from salt accumulation in the bioreactors on the bioprocess and membrane operation thus in this study the impacts of salt accumulation through the manipulation of srt on microbial behaviors bioreactor performance permeate quality and membrane fouling of nf mbr as well as the subsequent ro performance for water reclamation were investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 nf mbr setup and operating conditions two parallel lab scale moving bed biofilm reactors employing side stream nf membrane modules were used in this work the schematic diagram of the nf mbr is illustrated in fig s1 appendix the nf mbrs were operated at srt of 30 and 60 days hereinafter denoted as nf mbr 30 ls and nf mbr 60 hs respectively each bioreactor has a total effective working volume of 7 0 l and filled with 234 k3 bio carriers 20 of packing ratio the dimension of bio carrier is 12 mm ø 25 mm with a surface area of 500 m2 m3 ping yin chemical packing china the biofilm reactor was inoculated with aerobic activated sludge collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in singapore at a mixed liquor suspended solid mlss concentration of 1 g l the aeration rate was set at 500 ml min to maintain dissolved oxygen do level above 4 mg l the hydraulic retention time hrt ph and temperature were kept at 22 h 6 8 0 5 and 20 0 5 c respectively the permeate flux of nf mbr was maintained throughout the study at 10 l m2h via a mass flow controller installed on the permeate stream the feed retentate and permeate pressures were recorded by digital pressure transducers ashcroft usa connected to a data logging system labview national instrument usa the municipal wastewater after sieving with a 1 mm opening mesh was collected weekly and stored in a cool room at 4 c prior use as feed to nf mbrs the operating parameters of the nf mbrs and the characteristics of the municipal wastewater are summarized in tables 1 and 2 respectively in this study the in house fabricated glutaraldehyde cross linked layer by layer polyelectrolyte hollow fiber nf membranes with polyethersulfone pes uf as substrate were used and their characteristics are summarized in table s1 appendix the details of the fabrication of this nf membrane can be found in the previous publication liu et al 2015 unlike most commercial nf membranes with high rejection 90 of divalent ions and partial rejection i e 30 90 of monovalent ions this nf membrane does not reject monovalent ions while maintains high rejection of divalent ions thus has low osmotic pressure difference across the membrane which allows low pressure operation i e 2 bar each membrane module consists of 40 pieces of hollow fibers 0 34 m in length with a total effective area of 0 031 m2 the filtration was performed in an inside lumen out shell configuration periodic physical cleaning every two days of membrane was performed in order to maintain constant permeate flux at 10 l m2h throughout the test in detail the fouled nf module was first removed from the nf mbr and physical cleaning was conducted in a separate batch setup according to the following steps i flushing with tap water at 500 or 800 ml min equivalent to crossflow velocity of 0 5 or 0 8 m s for 30 s to remove clogged particles inside the lumen ii backwashing with ultrapure water at pressure of 2 or 3 bar for 15 min to detach the cake layer on the membrane surface iii flushing with tap water at 500 or 800 ml min for 3 min to remove the residual foulants inside the lumen after each physical cleaning cycle the recovery of membrane permeability was checked by pure water flux measurement during first 30 days of operation the mixed liquor in the bioreactor was directly fed to the nf membrane denoted as nf1 which caused severe membrane fouling then a sponge column sponge pore size of 0 5 mm refer to fig s1 in appendix was installed at the effluent outlet of the bioreactor before the nf module aiming to retain the larger sized particles of 0 5 mm a new nf membrane nf2 was used in the subsequent test 2 2 ro setup and operating conditions two identical ro systems were used to study the fouling potential of permeates

details of the ro system were described previously suwarno et al 2016 tay et al 2018 wu et al 2013 ro membrane bw 30 dow filmtec usa with an effective membrane area of 0 0186 m2 was employed in the ro test cell the ro membrane was first compacted with ultrapure water at flux of 50 l m2h and crossflow velocity of 0 10 m s for 1 h prior fouling test the ro feed water in the ro fouling test was the permeate collected from the nf mbrs during day 60 62 the collected nf mbr permeate was first concentrated using the ro by discharging the ro permeate until its concentration equivalent to 90 recovery ratio i e 10 original concentration was attained subsequently the ro fouling test was performed with the concentrated test solution at flux of 20 l m2h and crossflow velocity of 0 10 m s full recycle of retentate and permeate to the feed tank was adopted to simulate the ro fouling at high recovery of 90 the ph of test solution was maintained at ph 6 3 by acid dosing the ro fouling test lasted for 5 days 2 3 analytical measurements 2 3 1 water quality analysis the feed water mixed liquor and permeate of the nf mbrs were sampled twice weekly for analysis the supernatant of the feed water and

extracted by formaldehyde naoh method liu and fang 2002 zhang et al 2006 briefly the solid fraction was re suspended in 10 ml of ultrapure water followed by adding 12 μl of formaldehyde 36 5 sigma aldrich usa and keeping for 1 h at 4 c after that 0 8 ml of 1m naoh was added and kept for 3 h at 4 c subsequently the solution was centrifuged at 13200 g for 20 min and the supernatant was collected for bound eps measurement the eps contents were determined by measurement of polysaccharides and proteins concentrations the polysaccharides concentration was determined according to the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as a standard and absorbance measurement at 490 nm using a spectrometer hach usa dubois et al 1956 the protein concentration was determined by bradford method with bovine serum albumin bsa as standard and absorbance measurement at 595 nm bradford 1976 to examine the microbial community compositions the suspended activated sludge samples in the nf mbrs were collected during steady operation period and the cake layer foulants on nf2 membranes were collected at the end of operation the genomic dna of the microbial community was extracted from the samples by powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio usa the 16s rrna genes were sequenced by illumina miseq platform using primers 357wf cctacggggnggcwgcag and 785r gactachvgggtatctaatcc the sequencing results were analyzed by qiime using the standard de novo operational taxonomic unit otu based approach 2 3 3 nf membrane foulant solution preparation at the end of nf mbr operation the fouled nf modules were removed for autopsy studies the foulants were detached from the membrane surface 20 pieces of hollow fibers 3 cm in length total membrane area of 14 14 cm2 by soaking the membrane in 20 ml of ultrapure water and ultra sonicating for 30 min the foulant solution 10 ml was centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min and then filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter the supernatant i e soluble foulants was collected for eps and lc ocd analysis in addition 10 ml of foulant solution was digested by adding 2 nitric acid the digested foulant solution was centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min and then filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter the supernatant was collected for inorganic element analysis by icp oes 2 3 4 confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm clsm leica german was employed to record the biofilm morphology after the membrane sample 1 3 mm 0 45 mm was stained with dyes in detail the biofilm on the membrane surface was stained with live dead baclight bacterial viability kits molecular probes usa according to manufacturer s instruction the live and dead cells in the biofilm were analyzed and the biovolume was calculated using imaris software version 7 1 3 bitplane switzerland the eps staining procedure was conducted according to a reported procedure adav et al 2008 briefly 100 μl of 0 1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer was added to the sample to maintain the amino groups in non protonated status then 10 μl of 10 g l fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc molecular probes usa solution was added to bind with proteins the stained sample was placed on a shaker for 1 h after that 100 μl of 250 mg l concanavalin a con a conjugated with tetramethyl rhodamine molecular probes usa was added to the sample to bind with α d glucopyranose d polysaccharides and incubated at

intracellular lipids followed by washing twice with pbs prior to clsm analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of salt accumulation on nf mbr performance during 90 day operation of nf mbrs a gradual build up and accumulation of scale forming ions such as ca mg and po4 as well as tds doc and scod in the bioreactors was observed as expected due to their rejection by the nf membranes fig 1 the water quality of feed mixed liquor ad permeate of nf mbrs at steady state are summarized in fig 2 increasing the srt the measured concentrations of ca 159 5 10 6 mg l mg 151 4 16 3 mg l po4 53 9 3 3 mg l and tds 1434 2 85 3 mg l in the mixed liquor of nf mbr 60 hs during steady state were approximately 36 49 51 and 22 higher than those in the nf mbr 30 ls ca at 116 9 8 3 mg l mg at 101 4 10 7 mg l po4 at 35 7 3 1 mg l and tds at 1179 0 74 5 mg l respectively fig 1 to predict the mixed liquor salt concentrations c ml at steady state eq 1 was developed based on the mass balance of the nf mbr system which relates to the srt hrt and nf membrane rejection ηnf refer to appendix for details eq 1 c m l t c f 1 1 α 1 hrt e α t 1 α 1 hrt where α 1 hrt 1 srt 1 η nf 1 srt eq 1 differs from the previous work that assumes the membrane i e fo membrane has perfect rejection lay et al 2010 eq 1 assumes no salt precipitation in the bioreactor and scaling on the membrane surface as well as no adsorption of inorganic ions onto the biomass or biofilm on the biocarriers the measured concentrations correlated well within 15 error with the predicted concentrations i e ca 115 3 and 157 7 mg l mg 108 6 and 175 6 mg l po4 34 8 and 52 2 mg l for nf mbr 30 ls and nf mbr 60 hs respectively despite the good rejection properties of nf membrane i e ca 79 84 mg 92 95 po4 58 72 the overall removal attained for ca mg po4 was only 10 35 and 2 respectively thus the nf mbr permeate has almost similar concentrations of ca and po4 as the incoming feed further optimization work such as chemical assisted precipitation is required to increase the removal efficiency tuning the nf membrane to get higher rejection i e increase the number of polyelectrolyte layers or make a tighter membrane is a complicated issue as on one hand excellent removal of divalent ions is desired but on the other hand increased rejection of monovalent ions can cause an increase in osmotic pressure the soluble organics in terms of doc and scod in the mixed liquors also increased gradually before reaching steady values of doc 89 7 7 9 and 129 2 14 3 mg l scod 250 1 17 1 and 354 1 19 7 mg l for nf mbr 30 ls and nf mbr 60 hs respectively fig 1 the accumulation of soluble organics in the nf mbrs could be attributed to their rejections by the nf membrane and their slowly biodegradable or non biodegradable natures similar to inorganic ions greater accumulation of soluble organics was found in the nf mbr with a longer srt the impact of salt accumulation on the biodegradation efficiency of nf mbr can be assessed by estimating the biodegradation at steady state which was defined as eq 2 biodegradation 1 cml measured cml predicted 100 cml measured is the measured concentration of organics in the mixed liquor while cml predicted is the concentration of organics in the bioreactor assuming no biodegradation and negligible adsorption onto the membrane which can be obtained using eq 1 the results showed that the biodegradation of doc attained in nf mbr 30 ls and nf mbr 60 hs were 92 0 cml predicted 1115 5 mg l and 92 3 cml predicted 1679 8 mg l respectively showing insignificant effect from salt accumulation at different srts p 0 05 both nf mbrs produced permeates with comparable doc contents 1 1 0 8 mg l in nf mbr 30 ls vs 1 0 0 7 mg l in nf mbr 60 hs p 0 05 achieving 97 of doc removal fig 2 the nf mbr 60 hs produced a permeate with slightly higher cod level compared to the nf mbr 30 ls 4 3 2 7 mg l vs 2 5 1 1 mg l p 0 05 nevertheless both nf mbrs could achieve cod removal of 99 fig 2 not surprisingly the superior permeate quality was owing to the excellent rejection properties of nf membranes toward organic matters i e 98 5 thus no obvious impact of salt accumulation on permeate quality in terms of doc and scod could be observed unlike in the case of dissolved ions in addition both nf mbrs achieved excellent nitrification levels ammonia removal ratios 98 and produced permeates with very low nh3 levels 1 mg l despite the elevated salinity condition in the bioreactors in contrast the inhibition of nitrification process was commonly observed in fo mbr and md mbr due to the accumulation of nacl qiu and ting 2013 wang et al 2016 wijekoon et al 2014 the nitrifiers responsible for the two step bioprocess i e ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are sensitive to high salt environment campos et al 2002 moussa et al 2006 in the nf mbr system applied in this study the negative impact arisen from the accumulation of nacl was alleviated by allowing the passage of monovalent ions our findings suggested that the accumulation of ca mg and po4 has no adverse influence on the nitrification process the organic compositions of feed mixed liquor and permeate of nf mbrs were analyzed by lc ocd table 3 in both nf mbrs it was observed that 1 nf membranes demonstrated complete rejection of biopolymers 99 rejection of hs bb and 95 rejection of lwm 2 hs bb accounted for 75 of total soluble organics in the bioreactors compared to 31 in the feed indicating their larger accumulation rates i e higher concentration factors due to their slowly biodegradable or non biodegradable nature 3 limited accumulation of biopolymers 10 and lmw 14 in the bioreactors due to their easily biodegradable nature in addition the biodegradation of each fraction was estimated as summarized in table 3 and no obvious impact of salt accumulation was observed since both nf mbrs had similar biodegradation efficiencies for all components 3 2 impact of salt accumulation on biomass characteristics 3 2 1 short term spike test short term impact of rapid exposure of high concentration of divalent ions i e relative to the feed concentration on biomass characteristics was performed by spiking of salts into the bioreactors at different concentrations namely control no addition of salts 200 and 400 mg l ca 100 and 200 mg l mg the physiological responses in terms of cell viability microbial activity and eps production on day 0 4 and 7 are summarized in fig s3 appendix interestingly the abrupt change in salt concentrations did not show any negative impact on the biomass characteristics as compared to control the addition of ca increased the viability of biomass by 52 and 33 for 200 and 400 mg l ca respectively whereas no changes for samples spiked with mg in addition the microbial activity as reflected by sour analysis showed 29 increase at 200 mg l ca while no notable change for 400 mg l ca 100 and 200 mg l mg the improved viability and sour could be attributed to the important role of calcium ions in maintaining the cell structure cell division and signal transduction that subsequently promote cell growth and increase microbial activity dominguez 2004 yu and margolin 1997 furthermore the eps production was increased by 35 and 34 when spiked with 100 and 200 mg l mg respectively but comparable eps production as control when spiked with 200 and 400 mg l ca which indicated an increase in ca had negligible impact on eps production in nf mbrs 3 2 2 microbial activity and viability the characteristics of biomass in mixed liquor i e suspended biomass and on biocarriers i e attached biomass during long term operation of nf mbrs i e gradual accumulation of salts until steady state are summarized in table 4 the average mlss i e total suspended solids concentrations in nf mbr 30 ls and nf mbr 60 hs were relatively comparable at 1277 286 mg l and 1282 240 mg l p 0 05 respectively in contrast the attached solids on biocarriers of nf mbr 60 hs 594 132 mg l was higher than nf mbr 30 ls 515 134 mg l p 0 05 leading to a higher total solids amount p 0 05 both nf mbrs also had similar mlvss mlss ratio 0 79 0 89 p 0 05 the viability and activity of the suspended biomass were examined by atp and sour analysis table 5 in both nf mbrs the viability increased gradually with time but sour maintained relatively constant fig s4 in appendix averagely in nf mbr 30 ls the biomass had a viable ratio of 59 9 and sour of 11 2 1 9 mgo2 gmlvss h whereas the viability and sour in nf mbr 60 hs were 60 12 and 12 4 2 4 mgo2 gmlvss h respectively although the viability and sour in nf mbr 60 hs were slightly higher the values were not statistically significant p 0 05 suggesting that the impact of ca accumulation on microbial properties was not remarkable during the long term operation of nf mbr 3 2 3 eps production in addition the soluble and bound eps productions of suspended biomass in both nf mbrs experienced an increasing pattern during the initial stage followed by a slow decrease regardless of srts fig s5 in appendix the results agreed with the spike test above which showed mg had greater impact on eps production it was also noted that soluble eps accounted for almost 50 of the total eps in our nf mbrs and such ratio was higher than those reported in conventional mbrs wu et al 2011 zhang et al 2010 table 4 further compares the compositions of eps i e polysaccharides and protein in both nf mbrs at steady state the amount of protein was almost three folds of polysaccharides for both soluble and bound eps regardless of srts in addition higher soluble polysaccharides i e 35 were present in nf mbr 60 hs than nf mbr 30 ls p 0 05 while comparable soluble proteins were found in both nf mbrs p 0 05 both nf mbrs produced comparable amount of bound proteins p 0 05 and bound polysaccharides p 0 05 the results suggested that srt could influence soluble eps production in nf mbrs especially soluble polysaccharides 3 2 4 particle size and zeta potential furthermore the suspended biomass in nf mbr 60 hs had larger floc sizes p 0 05 and less negative surface charges p 0 05 compared to those in nf mbr 30 ls table 4 this could be attributed to the presence of higher concentrations of divalent cations under a longer srt which enhanced the bridging between negatively charged functional groups of the bioflocs in particular the charge neutralization effect and decrease in zeta potential to become less negative was more pronounced for ca sobeck and higgins 2002 zhang et al 2016 it has been reported that bioflocculation could be beneficial to membrane fouling reduction in conventional mbrs van den broeck et al 2012 thus its impact in nf mbrs will be discussed in section 3 3 3 2 5 microbial community in addition the microbial community compositions and relative abundances of bacterial populations at phylum level for the suspended activated sludge in both nf mbrs are illustrated in fig 3 it was found that at phylum level proteobacteria 48 7 in nf mbr 30 ls vs 51 2 in nf mbr 60 hs and planctomycetes 15 7 in nf mbr 30 ls vs 14 9 in nf mbr 60 hs were the predominant microbial communities this observation was similar to the reported findings in conventional mbrs jo et al 2016 takimoto et al 2018 xia et al 2012 also the microbial communities in both nf mbrs had comparable relative abundances fig 3 with similar observed otu chao1 shannon and simpson diversity indexes table 5 it implied that the microbial communities in nf mbrs were not significantly affected by the increased organic and salt accumulations with extending srt 3 3 impact of salt accumulation on nf membrane fouling 3 3 1 tmp and permeability of nf mbrs fig 4 a describes the tmp profile of the nf mbrs during the initial stage of operation before the nf mbrs reached steady operation and without applying the sponge column from day 0 30 nf1 severe fouling accompanied by a rapid increase in tmp was observed due to high loading of bioflocs directly to the nf module i e clogging of lumen hence the discussion will be focused on the later stages ii iii and iv of operation for nf2 in general the tmp profile displayed a sawtooth pattern in particular during stage iii and iv which was associated with the interplay between reversible irreversible fouling and cake enhanced osmotic pressure effect ceop tay et al 2018 to further examine the nf membrane fouling mechanisms the irreversible fouling resistance rirr t δtmpt tmp t tmp 0 and δtmpirr jμrirr t as shown in fig 4b and c were calculated from the clean membrane pure water permeability membrane pure water permeability after each physical cleaning cycle fig s6 and tmp profile fig 4a according to the model developed in our previous publication refer to appendix tay et al 2018 during stage ii operation at a backwashing pressure of 2 bar and flushing crossflow velocity of 0 5 m s there was an initial slow build up i e first 10 days of operation of nf2 followed by an exponential increase of irreversible fouling where rirr 20 and 30 1012 m 1 after 25 days of operation of nf2 for nf mbr 30 ls and nf mbr 60 hs respectively in stage iii the flushing crossflow velocity was increased from 0 5 m s to 0 8 m s with a fixed backwashing pressure of 2 bar in order to improve the cleaning efficiency where the rirr dropped to 12 and 27 1012 m 1 for nf mbr 30 ls and nf mbr 60 hs respectively the cleaning protocol appeared to be effective for the nf mbr 30 ls as it prevented further increase in rirr but not for the nf mbr 60 hs as there was a linear average increase in rirr in stage iv the backwashing pressure was increased from 2 to 3 bar with a fixed flushing crossflow velocity of 0 8 m s but it did not further reduce the irreversible fouling for nf mbr 30 ls only maintained rirr at the same level meanwhile the rirr continued to increase linearly average for nf mbr 60 hs hence physical cleaning was not effective these observations implied that the cake layer morphology in nf mbrs may be different 3 5 higher in final rirr value i e more compact cake layer in nf mbr 60 hs compared to nf mbr 30 ls as a result of salt accumulation effect discussed below in addition chemical cleaning was performed using citric acid after 43 and 52 days of operation of nf2 for both nf mbrs apparently the membrane permeability of nf mbr 60 hs could be restored by 12 42 suggesting partial irreversible fouling was removed by chemical cleaning however the effect of chemical cleaning in nf mbr 30 ls was not remarkable 5 restoration indicating the limitations of chemical cleaning using citric acid in the restoration of membrane permeability therefore further optimization of chemical cleaning protocol is crucial in future studies on nf mbr the nf membrane layer by layer polyelectrolytes of pah and pss used in this work cannot tolerate ph 9 one option is to apply chemical enhanced backwashing with weak acid edta or sds lateef et al 2013 the ceop effect approximated by δtmpceop δtmpt δtmpirr is associated with the cake thickness porosity and tortuosity chong et al 2008 therefore there was no immediate and sharp rise in tmp i e the upward part of the sawtooth during initial stage first 10 days of nf2 operation but an obvious tmp increase was noticed when a substantial cake layer was formed during later stage in stage ii as well as throughout stage iii and iv as shown in fig 4c the ceop effect was the predominant contributor and more severe in tmp increase for nf mbr 60 hs which was attributed to the thicker and more compact cake layer as well as higher salt concentration i e osmotic pressure as compared to nf mbr 30 ls 3 3 2 nf membrane foulants 3 3 2 1 morphology of cake layer foulants the clsm images of cells live cells and dead cells and eps proteins α d glucopyranose d polysaccharides β polysaccharides and intracellular lipids are shown in fig 5 and the calculated biovolumes are summarized in table 6 the biovolumes of live cells predominantly present on the cake layer surface dead cells abundantly distributed in both inner and outer regions of the cake layers and total eps in the nf foulants of nf mbr 60 hs were higher than those of nf mbr 30 ls first the higher amount of live cells and eps production were due to greater availability of doc and no inhibition of salt accumulation to support the biofilm formation second the higher amount of eps especially polysaccharides was associated with the greater amount of ca that formed polysaccharides ca complex with strong gelation properties meng et al 2011 which could not be easily removed by physical cleaning third the higher amount of dead cells could be due to the greater operating pressure which led to the formation of a compact cake layer that hindered the oxygen and nutrient transfer to the inner region of the cake layer 3 3 2 2 organic compositions in both nf mbrs the biopolymers appeared to be the predominant species accounting to 51 61 the results agreed well with our previous study on nf mbrs operated at different conditions tay et al 2018 the organic fractions i e biopolymers hs bb and lmw in the cake layer foulants of nf mbr 60 hs were greater than those of nf mbr 30 ls possibly this was due to greater adsorption at higher concentration of organic compounds in the bulk solution as well as more dead cell lysis in the cake layer biofilm 3 3 2 3 inorganic compositions higher accumulations of ca 226 1 mg m2 mg 97 6 mg m2 p 173 6 mg m2 s 48 8 mg m2 and si 19 1 mg m2 were found on the nf membrane in nf mbr 60 hs vs ca of 160 8 mg m2 mg of 49 2 mg m2 p of 103 0 mg m2 s of 30 0 mg m2 and si of 21 0 mg m2 for nf mbr 30 ls owing to the higher concentrations of salts in the mixed liquor in particular calcium phosphate accounted for more than 60 of total inorganic foulants on the nf membranes note that the solubility limit of ca3 po4 2 i e 2 07 10 33 has been far exceeded in the bioreactors refer to appendix 3 3 2 4 microbial community compositions in the cake layer foulants of nf mbr 30 ls planctomycetes and proteobacteria were the dominant phyla accounting for 38 9 and 24 4 respectively fig 4 similar to conventional aerobic mbrs chen et al 2016 in contrast the dominant microbial community in the cake layer foulants of nf mbr 60 hs was verrucomicrobia 45 7 which showed a low relative abundance in the suspended activated sludge fig 3 it has been reported that verrucomicrobia has the ability to hydrolyze high molecular weight substrates such as polysaccharides cardman et al 2014 nevertheless it suggested that salt accumulation could affect the composition of microbial communities in the cake layer foulants of nf mbrs in addition the observed otu and chao1 shannon and simpson diversity indexes of microbial communities in the cake layers of nf mbr 60 hs were 55 9 56 5 32 8 and 16 5 lower than nf mbr 30 ls respectively table 5 the differences in microbial community structure may be attributed to several factors such as operating pressure gao et al 2013 compositions and contents of eps on the membrane surface tsuneda et al 2003 3 4 impact of salt accumulation in nf mbrs on performance of downstream ro membranes as shown in fig 6 during the concentration stage i e when recovery was increased from 0 to 90 the tmp increased from 5 3 to 7 5 and 8 5 bar while during continuous operation at recovery equivalent to 90 the fouling rates i e dtmp dt were 0 25 and 0 38 bar d for ro fed with the permeate of nf mbr 30 ls and nf mbr 60 hs respectively in conventional mf uf mbr ro systems it had been demonstrated that the higher organic levels in terms of toc cod eps in mbr permeate could lead to more serious ro membrane fouling wu et al 2013 however in this study the permeates of both nf mbrs had comparable quality except higher scod for permeate of nf mbr 60 hs but resulted in relatively higher fouling rate for permeate of nf mbr 60 hs in addition previous studies had emphasized that assimilable organic carbon aoc was an important parameter in determining the biofouling potential of ro feed water in seawater desalination lee et al 2019 wu et al 2017 which had very low doc concentration 2 mg l similar to the permeate of nf mbr therefore it was unclear the difference in fouling rate was due to the difference in scod level or the compositions of organics further study will be focused on the effect of aoc in nf mbr permeate on ro membrane performance in order to further advance the nf mbr ro for water reclamation 4 conclusions this study compared the bioreactor and membrane performances in parallel nf mbr ro systems for water reclamation application under different salt accumulation conditions in nf mbrs which were operated under srt of 30 and 60 days respectively the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the concentration factor is a function of srt hrt and membrane rejection increasing the srt resulted in greater accumulation of scale forming inorganic salts i e ca mg po4 and organic compounds i e doc scod and especially hs bb due to its poor or non biodegradable nature the accumulation of divalent ions did not pose any adverse impact on the biodegradation efficiency and both nf mbrs achieved superior organic removal 97 and ammonia removal 98 2 the elevated divalent ions level promoted bioflocculation however their effects on microbial activity and viability were not statistically significant in the long term experiment salt accumulation did not influence the microbial community structure of activated sludge in nf mbrs but led to different predominant microbial communities in the cake layer foulants of nf membranes 3 more severe membrane fouling in the nf mbr was observed at a longer srt i e higher salt accumulation due to combined calcium phosphate scaling and ca polysaccharides complex formation which were not easily removed by physical cleaning the thicker and more compact irreversible fouling layer as well as higher salt concentration caused more severe ceop effect in the nf mbr with a longer srt physical cleaning i e backwash and flushing can be applied to maintain sustainable operation of the nf mbr at a low srt of 30 d 4 higher ro membrane fouling rate was observed when fed with the permeate of nf mbr with a longer srt despite both permeates of nf mbr had similar water quality i e doc of 2 mg l one possible explanation was the role of aoc towards ro fouling at a low doc level which requires further investigation in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors

18293,the impacts of salt accumulation through adjusting the solid retention time srt in the bioreactor on the bioprocess as well as membrane performance of a high retention nanofiltration membrane bioreactor nf mbr and subsequent reverse osmosis ro process for water reclamation are addressed in this study the build up of salts i e ca mg po4 is a function of srt hydraulic retention time hrt and membrane rejection despite the accumulation of salts both nf mbrs at srt of 30 and 60 days achieved i similar biodegradation efficiency ii excellent organic removal 97 and iii excellent ammonia removal 98 extending the srt could improve the microbial bio flocculation capability but did not influence the microbial activity viability and community structure however more severe membrane fouling was observed in the nf mbr with elevated salt levels which was attributed to the greater formation of calcium phosphate scale and ca polysaccharides complex i e irreversible fouling layer as well as the cake enhanced osmotic pressure ceop effect although both nf mbrs produced comparable quality of permeate a higher ro membrane fouling rate was observed when the permeate of nf mbr with srt at 60

membrane bioreactors hr mbrs integrating a biological process with a high rejection membrane such as nanofiltration nf forward osmosis fo and membrane distillation md have received significant attention in the field of wastewater reclamation due to their improved permeate quality as compared to conventional microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf based mbr lay et al 2010 luo et al 2014 in md mbr clean water can be achieved in a single step while an additional step is required to recover the clean water from the draw solution in fo mbr whereas in nf mbr with the improved mbr permeate as ro feed the subsequent ro process can be potentially operated at higher recovery rate due to less ro fouling tay et al 2018 in hr mbrs the high rejection membranes effectively retain the smaller size and refractory organic substances leading to enhanced biodegradation improved removal rates however the major disadvantage is the retention that leads to the accumulation of dissolved ions in the bioreactor by the high rejection membranes qiu and ting 2013 it is noted that the concentration factor cf defined as the ratio of concentration of mixed liquor in the bioreactor to the feed concentration is related to the sludge retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt in which the maximum value cfmax srt hrt lay et al 2010 thus srt is an important parameter in determining salt accumulation ratio in hr mbrs in conventional mf uf mbr extending the srt generally promoted lower soluble microbial products smp lower specific bound eps production better bio flocculation and formation of a more permeable cake layer therefore resulting in less membrane fouling iorhemen et al 2017 massé et al 2006 ng et al 2006 van den broeck et al 2012 wu et al 2011 it is noted that longer srt was often adopted to maintain high biomass concentrations lower f m ratio reduce solids production and minimize reactor volume pollice et al 2004 xiao et al 2019 in addition longer srt was preferred for more effective nitrification since the autotrophic nitrifiers are very slow growing microorganisms compared to other aerobic bacteria ge et al 2015 on the other hand in hr mbrs extending the srt essentially means increasing the salt accumulation which can potentially impact the physical chemical properties of the feed solution bioprocess and membrane operation lay et al 2010 luo et al 2014 for example when salinity increases solubility of oxygen decreases linearly which leads to lower oxygen transfer rate colt 2012 this substantially reduces the effectiveness of aeration which is translated into higher energy requirement to achieve the desired do level regarding the impact of salinity on bioprocess in both fo mbr and md mbr it has been found that elevated salinity could lead to a shift in microbial community lower growth yield and lower microbial kinetics of the activated sludge necessary for the biological treatment and eventually resulted in process deterioration luján facundo et al 2018 nawaz et al 2013 wijekoon et al 2014 in term of impact of salinity on membrane operation in general higher feed salinity means reduced net driving force due to higher osmotic pressure difference and greater transport of solutes across the membrane that lower the permeate flux and quality in addition accumulation of dissolved ions such as ca2 mg2 so4 2 po4 3 etc can increase the risk of membrane scaling and aggravate colloidal fouling due to their higher supersaturation indexes furthermore the increase in extracellular polymeric substances eps production under high salinity environment as a protective mechanism for bacteria was found to increase the fouling propensity in fo mbr qiu and ting 2013 it shall be noted that most of the work reported on impacts of salt accumulation were related to fo mbr and md mbr the in depth study to address this issue for nf mbr application was not available indeed research work on nf mbr in the literature was rather limited possibly associated with the poor permeability of nf membranes typical flux was less than 5 l m2h choi et al 2006 2007 phan et al 2016 zaviska et al 2013 except in our previous work where flux of 10 l m2h was attained with the use of a low pressure in house fabricated nf membrane tay et al 2018 therefore it is unclear whether such observations found in fo mbr and md mbr are applicable to nf mbr for instance the driving force and membrane properties such as structure permeability and rejection of fo md and nf membranes differ from each other which could have imposed different effects arisen from salt accumulation in the bioreactors on the bioprocess and membrane operation thus in this study the impacts of salt accumulation through the manipulation of srt on microbial behaviors bioreactor performance permeate quality and membrane fouling of nf mbr as well as the subsequent ro performance for water reclamation were investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 nf mbr setup and operating conditions two parallel lab scale moving bed biofilm reactors employing side stream nf membrane modules were used in this work the schematic diagram of the nf mbr is illustrated in fig s1 appendix the nf mbrs were operated at srt of 30 and 60 days hereinafter denoted as nf mbr 30 ls and nf mbr 60 hs respectively each bioreactor has a total effective working volume of 7 0 l and filled with 234 k3 bio carriers 20 of packing ratio the dimension of bio carrier is 12 mm ø 25 mm with a surface area of 500 m2 m3 ping yin chemical packing china the biofilm reactor was inoculated with aerobic activated sludge collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in singapore at a mixed liquor suspended solid mlss concentration of 1 g l the aeration rate was set at 500 ml min to maintain dissolved oxygen do level above 4 mg l the hydraulic retention time hrt ph and temperature were kept at 22 h 6 8 0 5 and 20 0 5 c respectively the permeate flux of nf mbr was maintained throughout the study at 10 l m2h via a mass flow controller installed on the permeate stream the feed retentate and permeate pressures were recorded by digital pressure transducers ashcroft usa connected to a data logging system labview national instrument usa the municipal wastewater after sieving with a 1 mm opening mesh was collected weekly and stored in a cool room at 4 c prior use as feed to nf mbrs the operating parameters of the nf mbrs and the characteristics of the municipal wastewater are summarized in tables 1 and 2 respectively in this study the in house fabricated glutaraldehyde cross linked layer by layer polyelectrolyte hollow fiber nf membranes with polyethersulfone pes uf as substrate were used and their characteristics are summarized in table s1 appendix the details of the fabrication of this nf membrane can be found in the previous publication liu et al 2015 unlike most commercial nf membranes with high rejection 90 of divalent ions and partial rejection i e 30 90 of monovalent ions this nf membrane does not reject monovalent ions while maintains high rejection of divalent ions thus has low osmotic pressure difference across the membrane which allows low pressure operation i e 2 bar each membrane module consists of 40 pieces of hollow fibers 0 34 m in length with a total effective area of 0 031 m2 the filtration was performed in an inside lumen out shell configuration periodic physical cleaning every two days of membrane was performed in order to maintain constant permeate flux at 10 l m2h throughout the test in detail the fouled nf module was first removed from the nf mbr and physical cleaning was conducted in a separate batch setup according to the following steps i flushing with tap water at 500 or 800 ml min equivalent to crossflow velocity of 0 5 or 0 8 m s for 30 s to remove clogged particles inside the lumen ii backwashing with ultrapure water at pressure of 2 or 3 bar for 15 min to detach the cake layer on the membrane surface iii flushing with tap water at 500 or 800 ml min for 3 min to remove the residual foulants inside the lumen after each physical cleaning cycle the recovery of membrane permeability was checked by pure water flux measurement during first 30 days of operation the mixed liquor in the bioreactor was directly fed to the nf membrane denoted as nf1 which caused severe membrane fouling then a sponge column sponge pore size of 0 5 mm refer to fig s1 in appendix was installed at the effluent outlet of the bioreactor before the nf module aiming to retain the larger sized particles of 0 5 mm a new nf membrane nf2 was used in the subsequent test 2 2 ro setup and operating conditions two identical ro systems were used to study the fouling potential of permeates

details of the ro system were described previously suwarno et al 2016 tay et al 2018 wu et al 2013 ro membrane bw 30 dow filmtec usa with an effective membrane area of 0 0186 m2 was employed in the ro test cell the ro membrane was first compacted with ultrapure water at flux of 50 l m2h and crossflow velocity of 0 10 m s for 1 h prior fouling test the ro feed water in the ro fouling test was the permeate collected from the nf mbrs during day 60 62 the collected nf mbr permeate was first concentrated using the ro by discharging the ro permeate until its concentration equivalent to 90 recovery ratio i e 10 original concentration was attained subsequently the ro fouling test was performed with the concentrated test solution at flux of 20 l m2h and crossflow velocity of 0 10 m s full recycle of retentate and permeate to the feed tank was adopted to simulate the ro fouling at high recovery of 90 the ph of test solution was maintained at ph 6 3 by acid dosing the ro fouling test lasted for 5 days 2 3 analytical measurements 2 3 1 water quality analysis the feed water mixed liquor and permeate of the nf mbrs were sampled twice weekly for analysis the supernatant of the feed water and

soluble eps in the mixed liquor and foulant solution was done by centrifuging the solution at 4000 g for 10 min at 4 c the supernatant was collected for soluble eps measurement the bound eps was extracted by formaldehyde naoh method liu and fang 2002 zhang et al 2006 briefly the solid fraction was re suspended in 10 ml of ultrapure water followed by adding 12 μl of formaldehyde 36 5 sigma aldrich usa and keeping for 1 h at 4 c after that 0 8 ml of 1m naoh was added and kept for 3 h at 4 c subsequently the solution was centrifuged at 13200 g for 20 min and the supernatant was collected for bound eps measurement the eps contents were determined by measurement of polysaccharides and proteins concentrations the polysaccharides concentration was determined according to the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as a standard and absorbance measurement at 490 nm using a spectrometer hach usa dubois et al 1956 the protein concentration was determined by bradford method with bovine serum albumin bsa as standard and absorbance measurement at 595 nm bradford 1976 to examine the microbial community compositions the suspended activated sludge samples in the nf mbrs were collected during steady operation period and the cake layer foulants on nf2 membranes were collected at the end of operation the genomic dna of the microbial community was extracted from the samples by powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio usa the 16s rrna genes were sequenced by illumina miseq platform using primers 357wf cctacggggnggcwgcag and 785r gactachvgggtatctaatcc the sequencing results were analyzed by qiime using the standard de novo operational taxonomic unit otu based approach 2 3 3 nf membrane foulant solution preparation at the end of nf mbr operation the fouled nf modules were removed for autopsy studies the foulants were detached from the membrane surface 20 pieces of hollow fibers 3 cm in length total membrane area of 14 14 cm2 by soaking the membrane in 20 ml of ultrapure water and ultra sonicating for 30 min the foulant solution 10 ml was centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min and then filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter the supernatant i e soluble foulants was collected for eps and lc ocd analysis in addition 10 ml of foulant solution was digested by adding 2 nitric acid the digested foulant solution was centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min and then filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter the supernatant was collected for inorganic element analysis by icp oes 2 3 4 confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm clsm leica german was employed to record the biofilm morphology after the membrane sample 1 3 mm 0 45 mm was stained with dyes in detail the biofilm on the membrane surface was stained with live dead baclight bacterial viability kits molecular probes usa according to manufacturer s instruction the live and dead cells in the biofilm were analyzed and the biovolume was calculated using imaris software version 7 1 3 bitplane switzerland the eps staining procedure was conducted according to a reported procedure adav et al 2008 briefly 100 μl of 0 1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer was added to the sample to maintain the amino groups in non protonated status then 10 μl of 10 g l fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc molecular probes usa solution was added to bind with proteins the stained sample was placed on a shaker for 1 h after that 100 μl of 250 mg l concanavalin a con a conjugated with tetramethyl rhodamine molecular probes usa was added to the sample to bind with α d glucopyranose d polysaccharides and incubated at room temperature for 30 min the stained sample was then washed twice with pbs to remove unbound dye after that 100 μl of 300 mg l calcofluor white sigma aldrich usa was added to the sample for 30 min

intracellular lipids followed by washing twice with pbs prior to clsm analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of salt accumulation on nf mbr performance during 90 day operation of nf mbrs a gradual build up and accumulation of scale forming ions such as ca mg and po4 as well as tds doc and scod in the bioreactors was observed as expected due to their rejection by the nf membranes fig 1 the water quality of feed mixed liquor ad permeate of nf mbrs at steady state are summarized in fig 2 increasing the srt the measured concentrations of ca 159 5 10 6 mg l mg 151 4 16 3 mg l po4 53 9 3 3 mg l and tds 1434 2 85 3 mg l in the mixed liquor of nf mbr 60 hs during steady state were approximately 36 49 51 and 22 higher than those in the nf mbr 30 ls ca at 116 9 8 3 mg l mg at 101 4 10 7 mg l po4 at 35 7 3 1 mg l and tds at 1179 0 74 5 mg l respectively fig 1 to predict the mixed liquor salt concentrations c ml at steady state eq 1 was developed based on the mass balance of the nf mbr system which relates to the srt hrt and nf membrane rejection ηnf refer to appendix for details eq 1 c m l t c f 1 1 α 1 hrt e α t 1 α 1 hrt where α 1 hrt 1 srt 1 η nf 1 srt eq 1 differs from the previous work that assumes the membrane i e fo membrane has perfect rejection lay et al 2010 eq 1 assumes no salt precipitation in the bioreactor and scaling on the membrane surface as well as no adsorption of inorganic ions onto the biomass or biofilm on the biocarriers the measured concentrations correlated well within 15 error with the predicted concentrations i e ca 115 3 and 157 7 mg l mg 108 6 and 175 6 mg l po4 34 8 and 52 2 mg l for nf mbr 30 ls and nf mbr 60 hs respectively despite the good rejection properties of nf membrane i e ca 79 84 mg 92 95 po4 58 72 the overall removal attained for ca mg po4 was only 10 35 and 2 respectively thus the nf mbr permeate has almost similar concentrations of ca and po4 as the incoming feed further optimization work such as chemical assisted precipitation is required to increase the removal efficiency tuning the nf membrane to get higher rejection i e increase the number of polyelectrolyte layers or make a tighter membrane is a complicated issue as on one hand excellent removal of divalent ions is desired but on the other hand increased rejection of monovalent ions can cause an increase in osmotic pressure the soluble organics in terms of doc and scod in the mixed liquors also increased gradually before reaching steady values of doc 89 7 7 9 and 129 2 14 3 mg l scod 250 1 17 1 and 354 1 19 7 mg l for nf mbr 30 ls and nf mbr 60 hs respectively fig 1 the accumulation of soluble organics in the nf mbrs could be attributed to their rejections by the nf membrane and their slowly biodegradable or non biodegradable natures similar to inorganic ions greater accumulation of soluble organics was found in the nf mbr with a longer srt the impact of salt accumulation on the biodegradation efficiency of nf mbr can be assessed by estimating the biodegradation at steady state which was defined as eq 2 biodegradation 1 cml measured cml predicted 100 cml measured is the measured concentration of organics in the mixed liquor while cml predicted is the concentration of organics in the bioreactor assuming no biodegradation and negligible adsorption onto the membrane which can be obtained using eq 1 the results showed that the biodegradation of doc attained in nf mbr 30 ls and nf mbr 60 hs were 92 0 cml predicted 1115 5 mg l and 92 3 cml predicted 1679 8 mg l respectively showing insignificant effect from salt accumulation at different srts p 0 05 both nf mbrs produced permeates with comparable doc contents 1 1 0 8 mg l in nf mbr 30 ls vs 1 0 0 7 mg l in nf mbr 60 hs p 0 05 achieving 97 of doc removal fig 2 the nf mbr 60 hs produced a permeate with slightly higher cod level compared to the nf mbr 30 ls 4 3 2 7 mg l vs 2 5 1 1 mg l p 0 05 nevertheless both nf mbrs could achieve cod removal of 99 fig 2 not surprisingly the superior permeate quality was owing to the excellent rejection properties of nf membranes toward organic matters i e 98 5 thus no obvious impact of salt accumulation on permeate quality in terms of doc and scod could be observed unlike in the case of dissolved ions in addition both nf mbrs achieved excellent nitrification levels ammonia removal ratios 98 and produced permeates with very low nh3 levels 1 mg l despite the elevated salinity condition in the bioreactors in contrast the inhibition of nitrification process was commonly observed in fo mbr and md mbr due to the accumulation of nacl qiu and ting 2013 wang et al 2016 wijekoon et al 2014 the nitrifiers responsible for the two step bioprocess i e ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are sensitive to high salt environment campos et al 2002 moussa et al 2006 in the nf mbr system applied in this study the negative impact arisen from the accumulation of nacl was alleviated by allowing the passage of monovalent ions our findings suggested that the accumulation of ca mg and po4 has no adverse influence on the nitrification process the organic compositions of feed mixed liquor and permeate of nf mbrs were analyzed by lc ocd table 3 in both nf mbrs it was observed that 1 nf membranes demonstrated complete rejection of biopolymers 99 rejection of hs bb and 95 rejection of lwm 2 hs bb accounted for 75 of total soluble organics in the bioreactors compared to 31 in the feed indicating their larger accumulation rates i e higher concentration factors due to their slowly biodegradable or non biodegradable nature 3 limited accumulation of biopolymers 10 and lmw 14 in the bioreactors due to their easily biodegradable nature in addition the biodegradation of each fraction was estimated as summarized in table 3 and no obvious impact of salt accumulation was observed since both nf mbrs had similar biodegradation efficiencies for all components 3 2 impact of salt accumulation on biomass characteristics 3 2 1 short term spike test short term impact of rapid exposure of high concentration of divalent ions i e relative to the feed concentration on biomass characteristics was performed by spiking of salts into the bioreactors at different concentrations namely control no addition of salts 200 and 400 mg l ca 100 and 200 mg l mg the physiological responses in terms of cell viability microbial activity and eps production on day 0 4 and 7 are summarized in fig s3 appendix interestingly the abrupt change in salt concentrations did not show any negative impact on the biomass characteristics as compared to control the addition of ca increased the viability of biomass by 52 and 33 for 200 and 400 mg l ca respectively whereas no changes for samples spiked with mg in addition the microbial activity as reflected by sour analysis showed 29 increase at 200 mg l ca while no notable change for 400 mg l ca 100 and 200 mg l mg the improved viability and sour could be attributed to the important role of calcium ions in maintaining the cell structure cell division and signal transduction that subsequently promote cell growth and increase microbial activity dominguez 2004 yu and margolin 1997 furthermore the eps production was increased by 35 and 34 when spiked with 100 and 200 mg l mg respectively but comparable eps production as control when spiked with 200 and 400 mg l ca which indicated an increase in ca had negligible impact on eps production in nf mbrs 3 2 2 microbial activity and viability the characteristics of biomass in mixed liquor i e suspended biomass and on biocarriers i e attached biomass during long term operation of nf mbrs i e gradual accumulation of salts until steady state are summarized in table 4 the average mlss i e total suspended solids concentrations in nf mbr 30 ls and nf mbr 60 hs were relatively comparable at 1277 286 mg l and 1282 240 mg l p 0 05 respectively in contrast the attached solids on biocarriers of nf mbr 60 hs 594 132 mg l was higher than nf mbr 30 ls 515 134 mg l p 0 05 leading to a higher total solids amount p 0 05 both nf mbrs also had similar mlvss mlss ratio 0 79 0 89 p 0 05 the viability and activity of the suspended biomass were examined by atp and sour analysis table 5 in both nf mbrs the viability increased gradually with time but sour maintained relatively constant fig s4 in appendix averagely in nf mbr 30 ls the biomass had a viable ratio of 59 9 and sour of 11 2 1 9 mgo2 gmlvss h whereas the viability and sour in nf mbr 60 hs were 60 12 and 12 4 2 4 mgo2 gmlvss h respectively although the viability and sour in nf mbr 60 hs were slightly higher the values were not statistically significant p 0 05 suggesting that the impact of ca accumulation on microbial properties was not remarkable during the long term operation of nf mbr 3 2 3 eps production in addition the soluble and bound eps productions of suspended biomass in both nf mbrs experienced an increasing pattern during the initial stage followed by a slow decrease regardless of srts fig s5 in appendix the results agreed with the spike test above which showed mg had greater impact on eps production it was also noted that soluble eps accounted for almost 50 of the total eps in our nf mbrs and such ratio was higher than those reported in conventional mbrs wu et al 2011 zhang et al 2010 table 4 further compares the compositions of eps i e polysaccharides and protein in both nf mbrs at steady state the amount of protein was almost three folds of polysaccharides for both soluble and bound eps regardless of srts in addition higher soluble polysaccharides i e 35 were present in nf mbr 60 hs than nf mbr 30 ls p 0 05 while comparable soluble proteins were found in both nf mbrs p 0 05 both nf mbrs produced comparable amount of bound proteins p 0 05 and bound polysaccharides p 0 05 the results suggested that srt could influence soluble eps production in nf mbrs especially soluble polysaccharides 3 2 4 particle size and zeta potential furthermore the suspended biomass in nf mbr 60 hs had larger floc sizes p 0 05 and less negative surface charges p 0 05 compared to those in nf mbr 30 ls table 4 this could be attributed to the presence of higher concentrations of divalent cations under a longer srt which enhanced the bridging between negatively charged functional groups of the bioflocs in particular the charge neutralization effect and decrease in zeta potential to become less negative was more pronounced for ca sobeck and higgins 2002 zhang et al 2016 it has been reported that bioflocculation could be beneficial to membrane fouling reduction in conventional mbrs van den broeck et al 2012 thus its impact in nf mbrs will be discussed in section 3 3 3 2 5 microbial community in addition the microbial community compositions and relative abundances of bacterial populations at phylum level for the suspended activated sludge in both nf mbrs are illustrated in fig 3 it was found that at phylum level proteobacteria 48 7 in nf mbr 30 ls vs 51 2 in nf mbr 60 hs and planctomycetes 15 7 in nf mbr 30 ls vs 14 9 in nf mbr 60 hs were the predominant microbial communities this observation was similar to the reported findings in conventional mbrs jo et al 2016 takimoto et al 2018 xia et al 2012 also the microbial communities in both nf mbrs had comparable relative abundances fig 3 with similar observed otu chao1 shannon and simpson diversity indexes table 5 it implied that the microbial communities in nf mbrs were not significantly affected by the increased organic and salt accumulations with extending srt 3 3 impact of salt accumulation on nf membrane fouling 3 3 1 tmp and permeability of nf mbrs fig 4 a describes the tmp profile of the nf mbrs during the initial stage of operation before the nf mbrs reached steady operation and without applying the sponge column from day 0 30 nf1 severe fouling accompanied by a rapid increase in tmp was observed due to high loading of bioflocs directly to the nf module i e clogging of lumen hence the discussion will be focused on the later stages ii iii and iv of operation for nf2 in general the tmp profile displayed a sawtooth pattern in particular during stage iii and iv which was associated with the interplay between reversible irreversible fouling and cake enhanced osmotic pressure effect ceop tay et al 2018 to further examine the nf membrane fouling mechanisms the irreversible fouling resistance rirr t δtmpt tmp t tmp 0 and δtmpirr jμrirr t as shown in fig 4b and c were calculated from the clean membrane pure water permeability membrane pure water permeability after each physical cleaning cycle fig s6 and tmp profile fig 4a according to the model developed in our previous publication refer to appendix tay et al 2018 during stage ii operation at a backwashing pressure of 2 bar and flushing crossflow velocity of 0 5 m s there was an initial slow build up i e first 10 days of operation of nf2 followed by an exponential increase of irreversible fouling where rirr 20 and 30 1012 m 1 after 25 days of operation of nf2 for nf mbr 30 ls and nf mbr 60 hs respectively in stage iii the flushing crossflow velocity was increased from 0 5 m s to 0 8 m s with a fixed backwashing pressure of 2 bar in order to improve the cleaning efficiency where the rirr dropped to 12 and 27 1012 m 1 for nf mbr 30 ls and nf mbr 60 hs respectively the cleaning protocol appeared to be effective for the nf mbr 30 ls as it prevented further increase in rirr but not for the nf mbr 60 hs as there was a linear average increase in rirr in stage iv the backwashing pressure was increased from 2 to 3 bar with a fixed flushing crossflow velocity of 0 8 m s but it did not further reduce the irreversible fouling for nf mbr 30 ls only maintained rirr at the same level meanwhile the rirr continued to increase linearly average for nf mbr 60 hs hence physical cleaning was not effective these observations implied that the cake layer morphology in nf mbrs may be different 3 5 higher in final rirr value i e more compact cake layer in nf mbr 60 hs compared to nf mbr 30 ls as a result of salt accumulation effect discussed below in addition chemical cleaning was performed using citric acid after 43 and 52 days of operation of nf2 for both nf mbrs apparently the membrane permeability of nf mbr 60 hs could be restored by 12 42 suggesting partial irreversible fouling was removed by chemical cleaning however the effect of chemical cleaning in nf mbr 30 ls was not remarkable 5 restoration indicating the limitations of chemical cleaning using citric acid in the restoration of membrane permeability therefore further optimization of chemical cleaning protocol is crucial in future studies on nf mbr the nf membrane layer by layer polyelectrolytes of pah and pss used in this work cannot tolerate ph 9 one option is to apply chemical enhanced backwashing with weak acid edta or sds lateef et al 2013 the ceop effect approximated by δtmpceop δtmpt δtmpirr is associated with the cake thickness porosity and tortuosity chong et al 2008 therefore there was no immediate and sharp rise in tmp i e the upward part of the sawtooth during initial stage first 10 days of nf2 operation but an obvious tmp increase was noticed when a substantial cake layer was formed during later stage in stage ii as well as throughout stage iii and iv as shown in fig 4c the ceop effect was the predominant contributor and more severe in tmp increase for nf mbr 60 hs which was attributed to the thicker and more compact cake layer as well as higher salt concentration i e osmotic pressure as compared to nf mbr 30 ls 3 3 2 nf membrane foulants 3 3 2 1 morphology of cake layer foulants the clsm images of cells live cells and dead cells and eps proteins α d glucopyranose d polysaccharides β polysaccharides and intracellular lipids are shown in fig 5 and the calculated biovolumes are summarized in table 6 the biovolumes of live cells predominantly present on the cake layer surface dead cells abundantly distributed in both inner and outer regions of the cake layers and total eps in the nf foulants of nf mbr 60 hs were higher than those of nf mbr 30 ls first the higher amount of live cells and eps production were due to greater availability of doc and no inhibition of salt accumulation to support the biofilm formation second the higher amount of eps especially polysaccharides was associated with the greater amount of ca that formed polysaccharides ca complex with strong gelation properties meng et al 2011 which could not be easily removed by physical cleaning third the higher amount of dead cells could be due to the greater operating pressure which led to the formation of a compact cake layer that hindered the oxygen and nutrient transfer to the inner region of the cake layer 3 3 2 2 organic compositions in both nf mbrs the biopolymers appeared to be the predominant species accounting to 51 61 the results agreed well with our previous study on nf mbrs operated at different conditions tay et al 2018 the organic fractions i e biopolymers hs bb and lmw in the cake layer foulants of nf mbr 60 hs were greater than those of nf mbr 30 ls possibly this was due to greater adsorption at higher concentration of organic compounds in the bulk solution as well as more dead cell lysis in the cake layer biofilm 3 3 2 3 inorganic compositions higher accumulations of ca 226 1 mg m2 mg 97 6 mg m2 p 173 6 mg m2 s 48 8 mg m2 and si 19 1 mg m2 were found on the nf membrane in nf mbr 60 hs vs ca of 160 8 mg m2 mg of 49 2 mg m2 p of 103 0 mg m2 s of 30 0 mg m2 and si of 21 0 mg m2 for nf mbr 30 ls owing to the higher concentrations of salts in the mixed liquor in particular calcium phosphate accounted for more than 60 of total inorganic foulants on the nf membranes note that the solubility limit of ca3 po4 2 i e 2 07 10 33 has been far exceeded in the bioreactors refer to appendix 3 3 2 4 microbial community compositions in the cake layer foulants of nf mbr 30 ls planctomycetes and proteobacteria were the dominant phyla accounting for 38 9 and 24 4 respectively fig 4 similar to conventional aerobic mbrs chen et al 2016 in contrast the dominant microbial community in the cake layer foulants of nf mbr 60 hs was verrucomicrobia 45 7 which showed a low relative abundance in the suspended activated sludge fig 3 it has been reported that verrucomicrobia has the ability to hydrolyze high molecular weight substrates such as polysaccharides cardman et al 2014 nevertheless it suggested that salt accumulation could affect the composition of microbial communities in the cake layer foulants of nf mbrs in addition the observed otu and chao1 shannon and simpson diversity indexes of microbial communities in the cake layers of nf mbr 60 hs were 55 9 56 5 32 8 and 16 5 lower than nf mbr 30 ls respectively table 5 the differences in microbial community structure may be attributed to several factors such as operating pressure gao et al 2013 compositions and contents of eps on the membrane surface tsuneda et al 2003 3 4 impact of salt accumulation in nf mbrs on performance of downstream ro membranes as shown in fig 6 during the concentration stage i e when recovery was increased from 0 to 90 the tmp increased from 5 3 to 7 5 and 8 5 bar while during continuous operation at recovery equivalent to 90 the fouling rates i e dtmp dt were 0 25 and 0 38 bar d for ro fed with the permeate of nf mbr 30 ls and nf mbr 60 hs respectively in conventional mf uf mbr ro systems it had been demonstrated that the higher organic levels in terms of toc cod eps in mbr permeate could lead to more serious ro membrane fouling wu et al 2013 however in this study the permeates of both nf mbrs had comparable quality except higher scod for permeate of nf mbr 60 hs but resulted in relatively higher fouling rate for permeate of nf mbr 60 hs in addition previous studies had emphasized that assimilable organic carbon aoc was an important parameter in determining the biofouling potential of ro feed water in seawater desalination lee et al 2019 wu et al 2017 which had very low doc concentration 2 mg l similar to the permeate of nf mbr therefore it was unclear the difference in fouling rate was due to the difference in scod level or the compositions of organics further study will be focused on the effect of aoc in nf mbr permeate on ro membrane performance in order to further advance the nf mbr ro for water reclamation 4 conclusions this study compared the bioreactor and membrane performances in parallel nf mbr ro systems for water reclamation application under different salt accumulation conditions in nf mbrs which were operated under srt of 30 and 60 days respectively the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the concentration factor is a function of srt hrt and membrane rejection increasing the srt resulted in greater accumulation of scale forming inorganic salts i e ca mg po4 and organic compounds i e doc scod and especially hs bb due to its poor or non biodegradable nature the accumulation of divalent ions did not pose any adverse impact on the biodegradation efficiency and both nf mbrs achieved superior organic removal 97 and ammonia removal 98 2 the elevated divalent ions level promoted bioflocculation however their effects on microbial activity and viability were not statistically significant in the long term experiment salt accumulation did not influence the microbial community structure of activated sludge in nf mbrs but led to different predominant microbial communities in the cake layer foulants of nf membranes 3 more severe membrane fouling in the nf mbr was observed at a longer srt i e higher salt accumulation due to combined calcium phosphate scaling and ca polysaccharides complex formation which were not easily removed by physical cleaning the thicker and more compact irreversible fouling layer as well as higher salt concentration caused more severe ceop effect in the nf mbr with a longer srt physical cleaning i e backwash and flushing can be applied to maintain sustainable operation of the nf mbr at a low srt of 30 d 4 higher ro membrane fouling rate was observed when fed with the permeate of nf mbr with a longer srt despite both permeates of nf mbr had similar water quality i e doc of 2 mg l one possible explanation was the role of aoc towards ro fouling at a low doc level which requires further investigation in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors

18294,the extensive application of sulfonamides sas raises concern regarding its negative environmental effects in aquatic environments macrophytes may not only be affected by various pollutants they may also help to reduce the concentrations in the surrounding environment we studied both the ecotoxicological effects of sulfonamide sn on and its removal by vallisneria natans lour hara an important submerged macrophyte in chinese lakes and rivers the toxic effect and oxidative stress caused by sn resulted in a reduction of total chlorophyll chl a and b and autofluorescence of chloroplast meanwhile the levels of reactive oxygen species ros including o2 and h2o2 and peroxidase pod increased with increasing sn concentration and duration of exposure after 20 days exposure a reduction in the relative growth rate rgr and leaf length of v natans was found under sn stress but sn had only a weak effect on root length although high sn concentrations had toxic effects on the growth of v natans the plant was overall resistant to the sn doses that we used we studied the effect of v natans on sulfonamide removal in an additional 13 day exposure experiment with focus on the dynamics of dissolved oxygen do the oxidation reduction potential orp and microbial communities in the water column as well as in the periphyton on v natans surfaces the results show that presence of v natans significantly improved the sn removal efficiency likely by increasing do orp and bacterial diversity in the water column the presence of v natans led to higher relative abundances of saccharimonadales and rhizoniales lefse analysis showed that saccharimonadales micrococcales sphingobacteriales bacteroidales obscuribacterales flavobacteriales pseudomonadaceae and myxococcales which are considered to be sn resistant bacteria increased significantly in the v s v natans and sn treatment compared with the v s v natans and no sn treatment and v s no v natans and sn treatment as far as we know ours is the first study of the ecotoxicological effects of sulfonamide and its removal by submerged vascular plants here v natans thus our results add to the understanding of the antibiotic removal mechanism of macrophytes in freshwater systems and help to clarify the linkages between antibiotics and macrophyte microbe systems thereby providing new insight into ecological based removal of antibiotics in aquatic systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfonamide vallisneria natans ecotoxicological effects removal mechanism microbial community 1 introduction sulfonamides sas have been used for more than 50 years within the fields of veterinary chemotherapeutics and human medicine due to their low cost and broad spectrum of activity in preventing or treating bacterial infections białk bielińska et al 2011 however sas are poorly absorbed in the gut and not completely metabolised by higher organisms and they are usually excreted as the parent compounds or metabolites garcía galán et al 2008 in addition due to the incomplete removal during wastewater treatment and their continued release into the environment sas are frequently detected in the aquatic environment kümmerer 2009 take china as an example the consumption and production of antibiotics in china are the highest in the world li et al 2018 sas in water samples collected from feedlot wastewater pools and irrigation ditches in shanghai city have shown total concentrations of 198 323 μg l 1 ji et al 2011 and in the yangtze estuary and huangpu river sas concentrations up to 219 ng l 1 and 313 ng l 1 have been recorded yan et al 2013 although the average concentrations of sas in environmental samples are low at the μg l 1 or ng l 1 level li et al 2018 they are continuously being released so they will eventually pose a serious environmental risk garcía galán et al 2009 santos et al 2010 sas are designed to target specific metabolic pathways they competitively inhibit the conversion of p aminobenzoic acid paba by inhibiting the biosynthetic pathway of folate an essential molecule required by all living organisms so they not only affect bacteria but may also to a varying degree have unwanted effects on other organisms such as microalgae zooplankton fish and macrophytes garcía galán et al 2009 park and choi 2008 schauss et al 2009 in general removal of sas is achieved through activated sludge based on microorganisms and adsorption yang et al 2012 2016 ozonation based on oxidation garcía galán et al 2012 and magnetic nanocomposite based on adsorption bao et al 2013 however so far only few studies have focused on antibiotic phytoremediation in natural aquatic ecosystems although uptake by crop plants of antibiotics has been extensively reported eggen et al 2011 migliore et al 2003 phytoremediation is a new technology that uses plants to degrade assimilate metabolise or detoxify metals kamal et al 2004 hydrocarbons wang 2004 pesticides gao et al 2000 and chlorinated solvents roy et al 1994 aquatic macrophytes play the key role in removing pollutants improving water quality and maintaining aquatic ecosystem stability wang et al 2011 several studies have clarified the removal process of nutrients and conventional organic pollutants by submerged plants through absorption zhu et al 2016a 2016b however knowledge about the removal of antibiotics by submerged macrophytes especially by changing the surrounding physical and chemical environment and thereby shaping the microbial community in the water column and the epiphytic biofilm is still fragmentary vallisneria natans lour hara is a fully submerged perennial rooted plant and is widely distributed in freshwaters in china wang et al 2011 where it plays an important role in maintaining the health of aquatic ecosystems by releasing oxygen and providing food and shelter for aquatic animals rai et al 1995 moreover it can also assimilate toxic components and thereby reduce their concentrations in the surrounding water v natans has been shown to take up microcystin rr yin et al 2005 heavy metals chen et al 2014 and other organic pollutants including pesticides pharmaceuticals and personal care products gao et al 2000 olette et al 2008 now v natans has become one of the most important aquatic plants in china for evaluating aquatic environmental pollution and ecological restoration wang et al 2011 however hitherto the effects of emerging pollutants ex antibiotic pollutants on and their removal by v natans remain poorly elucidated the main objectives of the present study were to 1 explore the tolerance of v natans to high concentration of sulfonamide sn through the physiological and morphologic response of v natans to sn exposure 2 explore whether the presence of v natans can enhance the removal efficiency of sn in the water column we hypothesised that v natans would overall be resistant to natural sn doses and that its presence could enhance the removal of sn by changing the redox environment of the water body and by altering the microbial communities of the water column we investigated ecotoxicological effects of sn and its removal by v natans for the first time our results might add to the understanding of the antibiotic removal mechanism of macrophytes in freshwater systems and help to clarify the linkages between antibiotics and macrophyte microbe systems our study provides new insight into ecological removal of antibiotics in lakes and rivers in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sn 99 8 purity and other chemicals were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china and the physico chemical properties of sn are presented in table s1 the chemical contents of hoagland solution are given in table s2 xue and yan 2011 2 2 v natans incubation and treatments v natans plants were collected from a small freshwater lake lake minghu 30 53 14 n 121 53 23 e located in the campus of shanghai ocean university shanghai china where the species dominates the macrophyte community before exposure to sn the plants were acclimatised for two weeks under laboratory conditions 10 hoagland solution constant white light on a 12 12 l d cycle 25 1 c after two weeks of pre incubation we selected approx 5 cm long v natans seedlings with three leaves and no branches for the experiments 2 3 experimental design 2 3 1 ecotoxicology experiment in order to observe the toxicological response and tolerance of v natans to high concentrations of sn thirty approximately similar v natans seedlings total fresh weight 71 58 2 44 g mean sd average length 5 cm were collected and transferred to a tank fig s1 containing glass beads and 10 hoagland solution with four levels of sn 0 10 30 and 50 mg l 1 there were four replicates of each sn level all culture solutions were refreshed in a static way every 5 days throughout the acclimation and experimental periods all tanks were incubated as described in section 2 2 during the experiment we randomly collected one v natans seedling from each tank on day 0 and day 20 respectively the periphyton attached to the plant leaves and roots was removed using a soft brush the leaves and roots were washed with distilled water and dried carefully with blotting paper after which the fresh weight of the plant fw was measured and the relative growth rate rgr calculated after 0 10 and 20 days of exposure one v natans seedling was collected randomly from each tank to measure leaf length and root length the leaves of the seedlings were frozen in an ice bath to measure total chlorophyll chlorophyll a chl a chlorophyll b chl b malondialdehyde mda o2 h2o2 and peroxidase pod activity after 20 days of exposure fresh leaf tissue of v natans from the different levels of the sn treatments was collected randomly to measure chloroplast autofluorescence 2 3 2 removal of sn by v natans the removal of sn was studied in tanks fig s1 three treatment groups were assigned v s v natans and no sn v s no v natans and sn v s v natans and sn all treatments were run with four replicates and the experiment lasted for 13 days several previous studies on removal of antibiotics have used high concentrations 10 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 xiong et al 2017 li et al 2015 and by applying concentrations higher than the typical natural sn concentrations 30 mg l 1 we expected to more easily detect the effect of v natans on the maintenance of the microbial community and the removal of antibiotics in the beginning of the experiment the sn concentration was measured every second day and dissolved oxygen do and the oxidation reduction potential orp were recorded every day microbial samples from the water and the leaf surface were collected on day 11 including five types wv s water sample v natans and no sn wv s

then frozen at 80 c until the extraction of dna 2 4 relative growth rate the relative growth rate rgr is calculated according to the following formula rgr w w 0 w 0 100 where w 0 is the fresh weight

estimation of the mda content based on the method of heath and packer 1968 briefly about 0 1 g fresh plant material was ground with 5 ml 1 trichloroacetic acid tca the homogenate was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 15 min after which 0 5 ml of the supernatant was mixed with 2 ml 0 5 thiobarbituric acid in 20 tca the mixture was heated at 96 c for 30 min stopped at 0 c and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min followed by measurement of absorbance at 450 532 and 600 nm on a spectrophotometer the relationship between mda and od can be explained using the below equation mda μ mol g 1 6 45 od 532 od 600

relative abundances are shown in fig 8 a and b at phylum and order level respectively the dominant phyla were proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobactcria followed by patescibacteria and verrucomicrobia fig 8a sn increased the relative abundance of patescibacteria actinobactcria and cyanobacteria in the periphyton samples and the abundance of patescibacteria in the water samples the presence of v natans increased the relative abundance of patescibacteria in the water samples while sn decreased the relative abundance of verrucomicrobia proteobacteria and bacteroidetes fig 8a the dominant orders were betaproteobacteriales micrococcales and saccharimonadales sn increased the relative abundance of saccharimonadales sphingobacteriales and micrococcales in the periphyton samples and saccharimonadales and rhizoniales in the water samples the presence of v natans increased the relative abundance of saccharimonadales and rhizoniales in the water samples while sn led to a reduction of the relative abundance of chitinophagales betaproteobacteriales and flavobacteriales fig 8b lefse analysis was performed to reveal the significant ranking of abundant modules the

and between the pv s and pv s the biomarkers displaying differences were saccharimonadales micrococcales sphingobacteriales bacteroidales obscuribacterales and myxococcales 4 discussion 4 1 ecotoxicological effects of sn our results indicated that high sn had toxic effects on the growth and physiological metabolism of v natans leaves are organs for photosynthesis and under the condition of stress the photosynthesis efficiency will decrease inhibiting the growth and development of plants and the synthesis of chl a and chl b wang et al 2011 previous research has indicated that autofluorescence intensity was closely related to the chlorophyll content paddock 1999 and the chlorophyll variation trend of v natans and phragmites communis observed under the stress of oxytetracycline tetracycline and sulfamethazine was similar to that of our study table 1 jiao et al 2008 lin et al 2013 in addition ros o2 oh and h2o2 are toxic to plant cells because they can rapidly attack chloroplasts nucleic acid proteins and membrane lipids apel and hirt 2004 moreover being a lipid peroxide mda levels can indirectly reflect the severity of free radical attacks and mda can thus reflect the degree of stress injury to plants nimptsch and pflugmacher 2007 our results indicated that high sn had toxic effects on the physiological metabolism and caused structural and functional damage in v natans fig 1a b figs 3 and fig 4a c despite the toxic effects v natans was overall rather resistant to sn as the plant biomass still increased significantly compared with the initial period with high sn fig 1c pod can decompose h2o2 to water and oxygen and is found in the cytosol the cell wall and in vacuolar and extracellular spaces mishra et al 2006 the stimulated activity of pod in the sn treated leaves reflected an enhanced degree of antioxidative response in v natans to resist the oxidative stress fig 4d several cellular processes such as aerobic respiration and photosynthesis can produce reactive oxygen species ros superoxide o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen 1o2 baxter et al 2014 that play important physiological roles in plant development and defence cona et al 2006 previous research has indicated that an increased chlorophyll content in microalgal cells reflects that chlorophyll acts as a protective agent to neutralise the accumulated ros in chloroplast xiong et al 2016 therefore we speculate that the chlorophyll content in v natans cells has a similar function in addition mda can also serve as an indicator of several different enzymes nadph dependent oxidase peroxidases apel and hirt 2004 these enzymes can effectively transform the accumulated contaminants intracellularly through various enzymatic systems tang et al 2016 our experiment was run at high sn concentrations compared with typical concentrations in the field the toxicological effects on the plants though modest in our study are therefore expected to be markedly lower under field conditions 4 2 removal of sn by v natans our results indicate that the presence of v natans changed the redox environment of the water body by increasing do and orp which likely favouring the removal of sn figs 5 and 6 several studies have shown that the plant community via photosynthesis can enhance do to saturation levels of 150 200 in highly productive streams thomann and mueller 1987 with implications also for the redox status li and bishop 2002 and decomposition of organic matter yadav et al 2014 moreover some macrophytes e g pistia stratiotes myriophyllum aquaticum have been shown to release reactive oxygen species in root exudates that may inactivate tetracycline tc and oxytetracycline otc gujarathi et al 2005 previous research has shown that pollutants tn tp bod5 and cod can be removed by hydroxyl radicals zhuang et al 2014 some studies of the photocatalytic decomposition of sas have reported that the degradation reaction was mainly initiated via hydroxylation by hydroxyl radicals yan et al 2011 in an investigation degradation of sulfamonomethoxine smm was found to be initiated by hydroxylation of the phenyl and pyrimidinyl portions transformation of a nh2 group into a no group and substitution of the och3 group with an oh group nomura et al 2017 moreover zhang et al 2018 found that v natans can repair polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs by increasing orp in sediments in our study although the content of ros h2o2 and o2 in the water column was not determined we measured the changes of ros content in the body of v natans in the first toxicological experiment fig 4b and c and those of orp in the sn removal experiment fig 5b the corresponding increase of these parameters may also be the reasons for the decrease of sn biodegradation microbial transformation has been proposed to play the major role in sas removal müller et al 2013 yang et al 2012 in the present study sn and the presence of v natans increased the relative abundance of saccharimonadales flavobacteriales rhizoniales micrococcales sphingobacteriales bacteroidales obscuribacterales myxococcales and pseudomonadaceae fig 8 a previous study has shown that pseudomonadaceae flavobacteriales and sphingobacteriales are aerobic bacteria yan et al 2015 in our study the presence of v natans may favoured these by the higher do level supporting the dominance of these microbes so far a few sas degrading microorganisms have been isolated and characterised including pseudomonas jiang et al 2014 and myxococcales birkigt et al 2015 müller et al 2013 moreover acinetobacter myxococcales and bacteroidales isolated from marine environments have been reported to be involved in sulfapyridine and sulfathiazole degradation zhang et al 2012 three orders i e myxococcales sphingobacteriales and flavobacteriales have been reported to be associated with the degradation of organic pollutants such as aromatic hydrocarbons alonso gutiérrez et al 2009 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2010 we found the diversity of bacteria to be higher in the treatment with than without v natans fig 7c and the higher bacterial diversity may have favoured sn removal studies of the removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps have revealed similar results kang et al 2018 our study used aquatic macrophytes and microorganisms as the main research objects to provide new insight into the degradation of sas in natural waters some studies have shown that photolysis appears to be the main degradation process of sas in natural waters andreozzi et al 2003 others have found that also plant enrichment and adsorption are pathways for sas degradation but adsorption and accumulation levels are relatively low μg kg 1 and not considered to be their main removal route choi et al 2008 senta et al 2013 bao et al 2010 xian et al 2010 moreover enzymes cytochrome p450 enzyme families glutathione s transferases and laccase of microalgae are actively involved in the degradation of xenobiotic organic pollutants kurade et al 2016 mellor et al 2016 xiong et al 2016 v natans may use a similar route to degrade sn which needs further investigation 5 conclusion our study showed that sn had toxic effects on the growth of v natans but that v natans was relatively resistant to sn showing net growth at all doses of sn v natans significantly improved the removal efficiency of sn in the water column sn removal was related to the orp conditions and diversity of the bacterial community triggered by v natans sn and the presence of v natans increased the relative abundances of saccharimonadales flavobacteriales rhizoniales micrococcales sphingobacteriales bacteroidales obscuribacterales myxococcales and pseudomonadaceae which are all considered to be sn resistant bacteria our results add to the understanding of the antibiotic removal mechanism of macrophytes in freshwater systems but further experimental studies are needed to clarify the exact mechanisms behind the interaction between antibiotics and the macrophyte microorganism systems for example by studying the variation of specific epiphytic and pelagic eukaryotic

18294,the extensive application of sulfonamides sas raises concern regarding its negative environmental effects in aquatic environments macrophytes may not only be affected by various pollutants they may also help to reduce the concentrations in the surrounding environment we studied both the ecotoxicological effects of sulfonamide sn on and its removal by vallisneria natans lour hara an important submerged macrophyte in chinese lakes and rivers the toxic effect and oxidative stress caused by sn resulted in a reduction of total chlorophyll chl a and b and autofluorescence of chloroplast meanwhile the levels of reactive oxygen species ros including o2 and h2o2 and peroxidase pod increased with increasing sn concentration and duration of exposure after 20 days exposure a reduction in the relative growth rate rgr and leaf length of v natans was found under sn stress but sn had only a weak effect on root length although high sn concentrations had toxic effects on the growth of v natans the plant was overall resistant to the sn doses that we used we studied the effect of v natans on sulfonamide removal in an additional 13 day exposure experiment with focus on the dynamics of dissolved oxygen do the oxidation reduction potential orp and microbial communities in the water column as well as in the periphyton on v natans surfaces the results show that presence of v natans significantly improved the sn removal efficiency likely by increasing do orp and bacterial diversity in the water column the presence of v natans led to higher relative abundances of saccharimonadales and rhizoniales lefse analysis showed that saccharimonadales micrococcales sphingobacteriales bacteroidales obscuribacterales flavobacteriales pseudomonadaceae and myxococcales which are considered to be sn resistant bacteria increased significantly in the v s v natans and sn treatment compared with the v s v natans and no sn treatment and v s no v natans and sn treatment as far as we know ours is the first study of the ecotoxicological effects of sulfonamide and its removal by submerged vascular plants here v natans thus our results add to the understanding of the antibiotic removal mechanism of macrophytes in freshwater systems and help to clarify the linkages between antibiotics and macrophyte microbe systems thereby providing new insight into ecological based removal of antibiotics in aquatic systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfonamide vallisneria natans ecotoxicological effects removal mechanism microbial community 1 introduction sulfonamides sas have been used for more than 50 years within the fields of veterinary chemotherapeutics and human medicine due to their low cost and broad spectrum of activity in preventing or treating bacterial infections białk bielińska et al 2011 however sas are poorly absorbed in the gut and not completely metabolised by higher organisms and they are usually excreted as the parent compounds or metabolites garcía galán et al 2008 in addition due to the incomplete removal during wastewater treatment and their continued release into the environment sas are frequently detected in the aquatic environment kümmerer 2009 take china as an example the consumption and production of antibiotics in china are the highest in the world li et al 2018 sas in water samples collected from feedlot wastewater pools and irrigation ditches in shanghai city have shown total concentrations of 198 323 μg l 1 ji et al 2011 and in the yangtze estuary and huangpu river sas concentrations up to 219 ng l 1 and 313 ng l 1 have been recorded yan et al 2013 although the average concentrations of sas in environmental samples are low at the μg l 1 or ng l 1 level li et al 2018 they are continuously being released so they will eventually pose a serious environmental risk garcía galán et al 2009 santos et al 2010 sas are designed to target specific metabolic pathways they competitively inhibit the conversion of p aminobenzoic acid paba by inhibiting the biosynthetic pathway of folate an essential molecule required by all living organisms so they not only affect bacteria but may also to a varying degree have unwanted effects on other organisms such as microalgae zooplankton fish and macrophytes garcía galán et al 2009 park and choi 2008 schauss et al 2009 in general removal of sas is achieved through activated sludge based on microorganisms and adsorption yang et al 2012 2016 ozonation based on oxidation garcía galán et al 2012 and magnetic nanocomposite based on adsorption bao et al 2013 however so far only few studies have focused on antibiotic phytoremediation in natural aquatic ecosystems although uptake by crop plants of antibiotics has been extensively reported eggen et al 2011 migliore et al 2003 phytoremediation is a new technology that uses plants to degrade assimilate metabolise or detoxify metals kamal et al 2004 hydrocarbons wang 2004 pesticides gao et al 2000 and chlorinated solvents roy et al 1994 aquatic macrophytes play the key role in removing pollutants improving water quality and maintaining aquatic ecosystem stability wang et al 2011 several studies have clarified the removal process of nutrients and conventional organic pollutants by submerged plants through absorption zhu et al 2016a 2016b however knowledge about the removal of antibiotics by submerged macrophytes especially by changing the surrounding physical and chemical environment and thereby shaping the microbial community in the water column and the epiphytic biofilm is still fragmentary vallisneria natans lour hara is a fully submerged perennial rooted plant and is widely distributed in freshwaters in china wang et al 2011 where it plays an important role in maintaining the health of aquatic ecosystems by releasing oxygen and providing food and shelter for aquatic animals rai et al 1995 moreover it can also assimilate toxic components and thereby reduce their concentrations in the surrounding water v natans has been shown to take up microcystin rr yin et al 2005 heavy metals chen et al 2014 and other organic pollutants including pesticides pharmaceuticals and personal care products gao et al 2000 olette et al 2008 now v natans has become one of the most important aquatic plants in china for evaluating aquatic environmental pollution and ecological restoration wang et al 2011 however hitherto the effects of emerging pollutants ex antibiotic pollutants on and their removal by v natans remain poorly elucidated the main objectives of the present study were to 1 explore the tolerance of v natans to high concentration of sulfonamide sn through the physiological and morphologic response of v natans to sn exposure 2 explore whether the presence of v natans can enhance the removal efficiency of sn in the water column we hypothesised that v natans would overall be resistant to natural sn doses and that its presence could enhance the removal of sn by changing the redox environment of the water body and by altering the microbial communities of the water column we investigated ecotoxicological effects of sn and its removal by v natans for the first time our results might add to the understanding of the antibiotic removal mechanism of macrophytes in freshwater systems and help to clarify the linkages between antibiotics and macrophyte microbe systems our study provides new insight into ecological removal of antibiotics in lakes and rivers in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sn 99 8 purity and other chemicals were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china and the physico chemical properties of sn are presented in table s1 the chemical contents of hoagland solution are given in table s2 xue and yan 2011 2 2 v natans incubation and treatments v natans plants were collected from a small freshwater lake lake minghu 30 53 14 n 121 53 23 e located in the campus of shanghai ocean university shanghai china where the species dominates the macrophyte community before exposure to sn the plants were acclimatised for two weeks under laboratory conditions 10 hoagland solution constant white light on a 12 12 l d cycle 25 1 c after two weeks of pre incubation we selected approx 5 cm long v natans seedlings with three leaves and no branches for the experiments 2 3 experimental design 2 3 1 ecotoxicology experiment in order to observe the toxicological response and tolerance of v natans to high concentrations of sn thirty approximately similar v natans seedlings total fresh weight 71 58 2 44 g mean sd average

culture solutions were refreshed in a static way every 5 days throughout the acclimation and experimental periods all tanks were incubated as described in section 2 2 during the experiment we randomly collected one v natans seedling from each tank on day 0 and day 20 respectively the periphyton attached to the plant leaves and roots was removed using a soft brush the leaves and roots were washed with distilled water and dried carefully with blotting paper after which the fresh weight of the plant fw was measured and the relative growth rate rgr calculated after 0 10 and 20 days of exposure one v natans seedling was collected randomly from each tank to measure leaf length and root length the leaves of the seedlings were frozen in an ice bath to measure total chlorophyll chlorophyll a chl a chlorophyll b chl b malondialdehyde mda o2 h2o2 and peroxidase pod activity after 20 days of exposure fresh leaf tissue of v natans from the different levels of the sn treatments was collected randomly to measure chloroplast autofluorescence 2 3 2 removal of sn by v natans the removal of sn was studied in tanks fig s1 three treatment groups were assigned v s v natans and no sn v s no v natans and sn v s v natans and sn all treatments were run with four replicates and the experiment lasted for 13 days several previous studies on removal of antibiotics have used high concentrations 10 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 xiong et al 2017 li et al 2015 and by applying concentrations higher than the typical natural sn concentrations 30 mg l 1 we expected to more easily detect the effect of v natans on the maintenance of the microbial community and the removal of antibiotics in the beginning of the experiment the sn concentration was measured every second day and dissolved oxygen do and the oxidation reduction potential orp were recorded every day microbial samples from the water and the leaf surface were collected on day 11 including five types wv s water sample v natans and no sn wv s

relative abundances are shown in fig 8 a and b at phylum and order level respectively the dominant phyla were proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobactcria followed by patescibacteria and verrucomicrobia fig 8a sn increased the relative abundance of patescibacteria actinobactcria and cyanobacteria in the periphyton samples and the abundance of patescibacteria in the water samples the presence of v natans increased the relative abundance of patescibacteria in the water samples while sn decreased the relative abundance of verrucomicrobia proteobacteria and bacteroidetes fig 8a the dominant orders were betaproteobacteriales micrococcales and saccharimonadales sn increased the relative abundance of saccharimonadales sphingobacteriales and micrococcales in the periphyton samples and saccharimonadales and rhizoniales in the water samples the presence of v natans increased the relative abundance of saccharimonadales and rhizoniales in the water samples while sn led to a

and between the pv s and pv s the biomarkers displaying differences were saccharimonadales micrococcales sphingobacteriales bacteroidales obscuribacterales and myxococcales 4 discussion 4 1 ecotoxicological effects of sn our results indicated that high sn had toxic effects on the growth and physiological metabolism of v natans leaves are organs for photosynthesis and under the condition of stress the photosynthesis efficiency will decrease inhibiting the growth and development of plants and the synthesis of chl a and chl b wang et al 2011 previous research has indicated that autofluorescence intensity was closely related to the chlorophyll content paddock 1999 and the chlorophyll variation trend of v natans and phragmites communis observed under the stress of oxytetracycline tetracycline and sulfamethazine was similar to that of our study table 1 jiao et al 2008 lin et al 2013 in addition ros o2 oh and h2o2 are toxic to plant cells because they can rapidly attack chloroplasts nucleic acid proteins and membrane lipids apel and hirt 2004 moreover being a lipid peroxide mda levels can indirectly reflect the severity of free radical attacks and mda can thus reflect the degree of stress injury to plants nimptsch and pflugmacher 2007 our results indicated that high sn had toxic effects on the physiological metabolism and caused structural and functional damage in v natans fig 1a b figs 3 and fig 4a c despite the toxic effects v natans was overall rather resistant to sn as the plant biomass still increased significantly compared with the initial period with high sn fig 1c pod can decompose h2o2 to water and oxygen and is found in the cytosol the cell wall and in vacuolar and extracellular spaces mishra et al 2006 the stimulated activity of pod in the sn treated leaves reflected an enhanced degree of antioxidative response in v natans to resist the oxidative stress fig 4d several cellular processes such as aerobic respiration and photosynthesis can produce reactive oxygen species ros superoxide o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen 1o2 baxter et al 2014 that play important physiological roles in plant development and defence cona et al 2006 previous research has indicated that an increased chlorophyll content in microalgal cells reflects that chlorophyll acts as a protective agent to neutralise the accumulated ros in chloroplast xiong et al 2016 therefore we speculate that the chlorophyll content in v natans cells has a similar function in addition mda can also serve as an indicator of several different enzymes nadph dependent oxidase peroxidases apel and hirt 2004 these enzymes can effectively transform the accumulated contaminants intracellularly through various enzymatic systems tang et al 2016 our experiment was run at high sn concentrations compared with typical concentrations in the field the toxicological effects on the plants though modest in our study are therefore expected to be markedly lower under field conditions 4 2 removal of sn by v natans our results indicate that the presence of v natans changed the redox environment of the water body by increasing do and orp which likely favouring the removal of sn figs 5 and 6 several studies have shown that the plant community via photosynthesis can enhance do to saturation levels of 150 200 in highly productive streams thomann and mueller 1987 with implications also for the redox status li and bishop 2002 and decomposition of organic matter yadav et al 2014 moreover some macrophytes e g pistia stratiotes myriophyllum aquaticum have been shown to release reactive oxygen species in root exudates that may inactivate tetracycline tc and oxytetracycline otc gujarathi et al 2005 previous research has shown that pollutants tn tp bod5 and cod can be removed by hydroxyl radicals zhuang et al 2014 some studies of the photocatalytic decomposition of sas have reported that the degradation reaction was mainly initiated via hydroxylation by hydroxyl radicals yan et al 2011 in an investigation degradation of sulfamonomethoxine smm was found to be initiated by hydroxylation of the phenyl and pyrimidinyl portions transformation of a nh2 group into a no group and substitution of the och3 group with an oh group nomura et al 2017 moreover zhang et al 2018 found that v natans can repair polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs by increasing orp in sediments in our study although the content of ros h2o2 and o2 in the water column was not determined we measured the changes of ros content in the body of v natans in the first toxicological experiment fig 4b and c and those of orp in the sn removal experiment fig 5b the corresponding increase of these parameters may also be the reasons for the decrease of sn biodegradation microbial transformation has been proposed to play the major role in sas removal müller et al 2013 yang et al 2012 in the present study sn and the presence of v natans increased the relative abundance of saccharimonadales flavobacteriales rhizoniales micrococcales sphingobacteriales bacteroidales obscuribacterales myxococcales and pseudomonadaceae fig 8 a previous study has shown that pseudomonadaceae flavobacteriales and sphingobacteriales are aerobic bacteria yan et al 2015 in our study the presence of v natans may favoured these by the higher do level supporting the dominance of these microbes so far a few sas degrading microorganisms have been isolated and characterised including pseudomonas jiang et al 2014 and myxococcales birkigt et al 2015 müller et al 2013 moreover acinetobacter myxococcales and bacteroidales isolated from marine environments have been reported to be involved in sulfapyridine and sulfathiazole degradation zhang et al 2012 three orders i e myxococcales sphingobacteriales and flavobacteriales have been reported to be associated with the degradation of organic pollutants such as aromatic hydrocarbons alonso gutiérrez et al 2009 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2010 we found the diversity of bacteria to be higher in the treatment with than without v natans fig 7c and the higher bacterial diversity may have favoured sn removal studies of the removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps have revealed similar results kang et al 2018 our study used aquatic macrophytes and microorganisms as the main research objects to provide new insight into the degradation of sas in natural waters some studies have shown that photolysis appears to be the main degradation process of sas in natural waters andreozzi et al 2003 others have found that also plant enrichment and adsorption are pathways for sas degradation but adsorption and accumulation levels are relatively low μg kg 1 and not considered to be their main removal route choi et al 2008 senta et al 2013 bao et al 2010 xian et al 2010 moreover enzymes cytochrome p450 enzyme families glutathione s transferases and laccase of microalgae are actively involved in the degradation of xenobiotic organic pollutants kurade et al 2016 mellor et al 2016 xiong et al 2016 v natans may use a similar route to degrade sn which needs further investigation 5 conclusion our study showed that sn had toxic effects on the growth of v natans but that v natans was relatively resistant to sn showing net growth at all doses of sn v natans significantly improved the removal efficiency of sn in the water column sn removal was related to the orp conditions and diversity of the bacterial community triggered by v natans sn and the presence of v natans increased the relative abundances of saccharimonadales flavobacteriales rhizoniales micrococcales sphingobacteriales bacteroidales obscuribacterales myxococcales and pseudomonadaceae which are all considered to be sn resistant bacteria our results add to the understanding of the antibiotic removal mechanism of macrophytes in freshwater systems but further experimental studies are needed to clarify the exact mechanisms behind the interaction between antibiotics and the macrophyte microorganism systems for example by studying the variation of specific epiphytic and pelagic eukaryotic
