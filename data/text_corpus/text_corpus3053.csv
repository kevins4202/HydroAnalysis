15265,wastewater ww treatment in anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr is considered more sustainable than in aerobic reactors however outputs from anmbr are a mixed methane and carbon dioxide gas stream as well as ammonium n and phosphate p containing waters using anmbr outputs as inputs for photoautotrophic algal cultivation can strip the co2 while removing n and p from effluent which feed algal biomass generation recent advances in algal engineering have generated strains that produce high value side products concomitant with biomass although only shown in heavily domesticated lab adapted strains here it was investigated whether engineered chlamydomonas reinhardtii could be grown directly in anmbr effluent with co2 concentrations found in anmbr off gas the strain was found to proliferate over bacteria in the non sterile effluent consume n and p to levels that meet general discharge or reuse limits and tolerate cultivation in modelled extreme outdoor environmental conditions prevalent along the central red sea coast in addition to 2 4 g cdw l 1 biomass production in 96 h a high value heterologous sesquiterpene co product could be obtained from milking up to 837 µg l 1 culture in 96 h this is the first demonstration of a combined bio process that employs a heavily engineered algal strain to enhance the product generation potentials from anmbr effluent

chemical ww nutrient removal methods require high energy consumption have long process times and result in carbon emissions as well as excess sludge discharge li et al 2019 in contrast anaerobic

product of wastewater treatment however with a high percentage of carbon dioxide co2 viruela et al 2016 additionally residual ammonium and phosphate remain in waters after anmbr treatment at levels that prohibit direct discharge into the environment gao et al 2021 xiong et al 2018 coupling anmbr ww treatment with downstream cultivation of algae in photobioreactors has been proposed as an additional process step chaudry 2021 ding et al 2022 gao et al 2021 leite et al 2019 using energy from photosynthesis microalgae consume co2 as a carbon source ammonium and phosphate as nitrogen n and phosphorous p sources respectively common laboratory media for growth of many green algae contain 7 5 mm ammonium chloride and 1 mm potassium phosphate total of mono and dibasic as n and p sources respectively gorman and levine 1965 while some algae prefer nitrate or urea instead of ammonium excess phosphates serve as a ph buffer in addition to their role source of p during anaerobic digestion of wastewaters existing organic n and p are converted into ammonium and inorganic phosphate which algae internalize as macronutrients serna garcía et al 2020b algal biomass can be a source of many valuable natural molecules or itself be used as a feedstock for processes like the production of biochar or emerging bio materials rajput et al 2022 engineering further levels of product generation from algal cells through synthetic biology has been proposed to increase the value of these bioproduction concepts the model green microalga chlamydomonas reinhardtii has now been extensively used to benchmark heterologous metabolite production from genetic engineering lauersen 2019 this has been facilitated by the domestication of c reinhardtii through several rounds of mutation and transformation neupert et al 2020 2009 while advances in synthetic transgene design have enabled robust expression of heterologous pathways in this alga baier et al 2020 2018 c reinhardtii is also generally regarded to be of safe gras status making it an interesting candidate for scaled processes in ww treatment gras notice no grn 000773 us food drug administration heterologous production of

perozeni et al 2020 have now been shown from c reinhardtii the produced terpenoid products are preferably harvested separate from algal biomass using solvent culture living extraction or milking during cultivation in this way the sesquiterpene patchoulol was produced up to 430 µg l 1 in 7 days equal to 300 µg g cdw 1 from c reinhardtii grown with co2 acetate in lab scale lauersen et al 2016 titers of 6 2 mg l 1 in 6 days were shown in high cell density bioreactors with enhanced nutrient cultivation medium abdallah et al 2022 highly domesticated and engineerable algae have only recently been reported and bioprocesses that leverage these new organisms in practice have yet to be developed since engineered algae strains are adapted to laboratory conditions they may not be as robust as algal species currently used in wastewater treatment or unsterile cultivation conditions here the performance of highly domesticated c reinhardtii strains directly in anmbr effluent was investigated an engineered strain was found to simultaneously remove n and p from effluent consume waste co2 and yield the heterologous sesquiterpenoid patchoulol as co product to biomass through metabolite milking the findings presented here show that in addition to the valuable production of reclaimed water co products can be generated through engineered algae that can improve waste stream treatment

seasons in thuwal saudi arabia local weather station data were used to model 1 week from each of february winter may spring august summer and november autumn from 2014 suppl data 2 in the reactors to capture patchoulol produced from the algal cells during growth 20 ml of the perfluorinated amine fc 3283 acros organics geel belgium was added to each culture as an underlay as recently described overmans and lauersen 2022 daily samples of 10 ml algae culture from each replicate flask were taken for determination of bacterial algal cell concentrations biomass quantification and nutrient analysis suppl data 5 while 500 μl of fc 3283 was sampled daily from each replicate bioreactor flask to quantify the accumulation of patchoulol product in the underlay all fc 3283 samples were immediately stored at 20 c until the end of the experiment 4 weeks storage when the samples were together processed for gc ms analysis 2 4 culture growth measurements algal culture growth was

biological replicate sample was diluted 1 100 with 0 9 nacl solution of each diluted sample 250 μl was measured in technical duplicates n 2 using a 96 well microtiter plate loaded into the autosampler samples were mixed three times immediately before analysis and the first 25 μl of sample was discarded to ensure a stable cell flow rate during measurement data acquisition was stopped when 50 μl from

carbon respectively 2 8 data analysis all data were processed and visualized using either the software programs jmp pro 16 2 sas institute inc cary nc or graphpad prism 9 4 1 graphpad software inc ca usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 c reinhardtii uvm4 cultivation in raw anmbr effluent c reinhardtii uvm4 was cultivated in different dilutions of raw anmbr effluent to evaluate the growth of this strain in non sterile conditions with the inherent n and p of this liquid anmbr effluent contains ammonium and phosphate the c n and c p ratios are generally low and support autotrophic algal growth more than heterotrophic bacterial growth cultures were sparged with clean 7 co2 to provide a carbon source similar to what would come from an anmbr reactor and to regulate culture ph as algae grow they consume co2 which raises culture ph co2 injection for ph control in this way minimizes wasted co2 as it is only supplied as the algae consume it other green algae like scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp have both been shown to grow well in anmbr effluent serna garcía et al 2020b a recent chlamydomonas sp isolate from ww has been shown to grow robustly in non sterile ww conditions and can outcompete bacterial contaminants klassen et al 2020 however few studies have shown c reinhardtii growth for ww post treatment fewer for effluent from anmbrs and none to date have used a heavily domesticated and lab adapted genetically engineered strain the c reinhardtii strain uvm4 is derived from several rounds of mutagenesis and transformation of a parent wild type strain neupert et al 2009 despite gras status see introduction this strain is considered genetically modified due to the presence of transformed plasmids with selection marker cassettes this is true for all strains that have been engineered to produce heterologous co products and bioprocesses which would work with engineered algal cells would require biocontainment to be considered in process designs beyond the argumentation of selection marker escape into the environment the domestication of this alga through mutagenesis has not likely created further risks to its use uvm4 lacks a cell wall has been long adapted to nutrient surplus conditions and may be outcompeted by other organisms it was therefore important to determine its ability to grow directly in unsterile anmbr effluent as a precondition for proposal of its use in downstream effluent polishing and value generation mixed microalgae bacteria photo bioreactors can remove nutrients and co2 from anmbr effluent xiong et al 2018 and the growth of c reinhardtii uvm4 on either pure or diluted effluent was demonstrated here fig 2b the strain grew directly in non sterile effluent and completely consumed n and p as nutrients for its biomass after 144 h cultivation fig 2c c reinhardtii uvm4 was found to grow in all dilutions of effluent in water with only the 25 dilution exhibiting reduced growth behaviours fig 2b the effluents used for this experiment initially contained 23 25 mg l 1 ammonium nh4 n and 7 8 mg l 1 phosphate po4 3 p the raw effluent 100 and 50 dilution were suitable substrates for algal culture growth with nutrient removal occurring earlier in the 50 dilutions fig 2c and e previous microalgae bacteria cultures have been shown to have excellent stability as the symbiosis of microalgae and bacteria can even improve pollutant removal in wastewater liu and hong 2021 mixed cultures have also been shown to promote growth of other chlamydomonas spp klassen et al 2020 here the heavily domesticated c reinhardtii uvm4 was robust enough to be the dominant microorganism in the anmbr effluent under non sterile conditions suppl fig 1 and yield water which had nutrient levels acceptable for discharge al jasser 2011 this finding encouraged further investigation into how an engineered alga could be used for post treatment of anmbr effluent 3 2 c reinhardtii growth under extreme climate with raw anmbr effluent the ability of c reinhardtii uvm4 to grow in raw anmbr effluent in simulated weather conditions temperature and par from the saudi arabian red sea shores was tested fig 3 a the saudi arabian central red sea is characterized by an arid climate with daytime summer air temperatures of 40 c almazroui et al 2012 alsarmi and washington 2014 in addition the urban population of saudi arabia is growing and effective wastewater treatment strategies are required that are compatible with the local environmental conditions here domesticated c reinhardtii cultures grown directly in anmbr effluent were found to tolerate the local light and temperature regime across the year with slightly lower biomass generated under the winter conditions fig 3 b during most modelled months the algal biomass of anmbr effluent batch cultivation was 2 g l 1 by 96 h fig 3 b the highest biomass production was observed in the modelled month of june 2 26 g l 1 29 35 c fig 3 a during august even higher temperatures are found t 31 37 c nevertheless the uvm4 strain grew well reaching 2 12 g cdw l 1 fig 3 b bacterial contamination was present in all conditions but did not cause algal culture crash nor did bacteria outcompete the culture during the investigation period suppl fig 2 environmental modelling using local weather data in replicate bioreactors as shown here will be a valuable tool for benchmarking strain performance for outdoor cultivation in different locales this is the first example of such modelling for an engineered c reinhardtii strain grown in ww and complements previous efforts to grow engineered algae and cyanobacteria in outdoor conditions wichmann et al 2021 this full year modelling with each month provided valuable insight into how bioprocesses may perform in the local context throughout the year conditions from specific months were then chosen to represent seasonal changes to model outdoor bio process performance using a strain engineered to produce the heterologous sesquiterpenoid patchoulol and assess its product yields when grown directly in anmbr effluent 3 3 specialty chemical co production during effluent nutrient removal by an engineered green alga uvm4 has previously been genetically and metabolically modified to produce the heterologous plant sesquiterpenoid patchouli alcohol patchoulol abdallah et al 2022 lauersen et al 2016 heterologous terpenoid products can be collected during cultivation of microbial cultures using a two phase culture solvent system a process also called metabolic milking beekwilder et al 2014 lauersen 2019 overmans et al 2022 during solvent milking hydrophobic terpenoid products accumulate in biocompatible solvents as the products are more favored to partition into the solvents than into the cells or culture medium gruchattka and kayser 2015 recently we have shown a novel approach to this continuous culture solvent interaction by employing perfluorinated liquids that form a layer underneath the aqueous culture medium an underlay due to their higher densities overmans and lauersen 2022 these liquid fluorocarbons fcs are inert and accumulate terpenoid products from microbial cultures efficiently unlike organic solvent overlays i e dodecane fcs can be effectively used in the algem photobioreactors to capture terpenoid products during algal cultivation due to their high density and physical dynamics the engineered patchoulol producing c reinhardtii was cultivated in representative seasonal conditions spring summer autumn winter as well as in two artificial illumination conditions continuous light and a 12 h 12 h light dark cycle at constant temperature fig 4 these artificial conditions were used to compare controlled cultures with outdoor conditions that could be employed for algal based anmbr effluent nutrient removal at large scales as in municipal ww treatment processes the patchoulol producing c reinhardtii was found to grow well in anmbr effluent generating 2 35 2 18 and 2 43 g cdw l 1 culture in may august and november conditions respectively after 36 60 h of cultivation fig 4b continuous light generated 2 7 g cdw l 1 after 60 h of cultivation whereas in february and the 12 h 12 h light conditions biomass reached a maximum of 2 0 g cdw l 1 after 80 h fig 4b across all conditions patchoulol production gradually increased over the 96 h experimental period figs 4g h suppl 3 continuous light yielded the highest patchoulol production with a maximum titer of 837 µg patchoulol l 1 culture after 96 h fig 4g under the 12 h 12 h light dark illumination cycle and the simulated february november and may conditions patchoulol titers were relatively similar to each other by the end of the experiment with concentrations of 460 542 395 and 423 µg l 1 culture under august conditions patchoulol production was considerably lower 76 µg l 1 culture patchoulol production per cell based on algal cell count measurements fig 4 f showed a similar pattern to the volumetric yields cell specific patchoulol production was highest in the continuous light regime 188 fg cell 1 and negligible in the summer conditions august 20 fg cell 1 fig 4h moderate production of patchoulol per cell was observed under the 12 h 12 h light dark illumination 146 fg cell 1 the simulated february 136 fg cell 1 november 93 fg cell 1 and may 80 fg cell 1 conditions the latter finding suggests that patchoulol production per cell gradually decreases with increasing cultivation temperature 3 4 culture of engineered alga in unsterile effluent and biomass accumulation despite the presence of contaminating bacteria algal biomass of the highly engineered strain was also dominant in these unsterile cultivations suppl fig 4 algal bacterial consortia in wastewater treatment can simultaneously degrade organic carbon by heterotrophic bacteria and nutrients n and p by photoautotrophic algae in their interactions the oxygen produced by algae sustains bacterial respiration that contributes to nitrification and denitrification as well as organic matter removal in return the co2 produced by bacteria enhances microalgae growth foladori et al 2018 gou et al 2020 qu et al 2020 reported that chlamydomonas sp qwy37 remediated swine wastewater reduced the amount of total n by 96 and removed 100 of p the newly isolated chlamydomonas sp yc exhibits high tolerance towards ammonium and was used to treat undiluted rare earth element mining wastewater zhou et al 2022 here engineered c reinhardtii patchoulol producing strain removed all ammonium and phosphate from the raw effluent by the end of the cultivations 96 h except for the nh4 n content in the 12 h 12 h dark light cultures figs 4 d e and suppl 5 it could be expected that some cell wall proteins of the alga may be present at the end of cultivation which would be removed by any ultrafiltration steps used for biomass concentration under continuous light and conditions simulating may and august the same strain was able to take up all the nh4 n after only 72 h and phosphates after 48 h fig 3 d e as ph was controlled 7 7 1 across experimental conditions nh4 n volatilization and po4 3 p precipitation were not issues here unlike in previous studies gutzeit et al 2005 it was observed that algal biomass generation was highest in may and august conditions after 24 48 h fig 4 b whereas the rate of biomass generation decreased after the consumption of n and p sources fig 3 d e these findings point to potential repetitive batch scheduling conditions which could be used to cycle nutrient removal with biomass generation one of the advantages of using microalgae to treat ww is their photosynthetic co2 fixation which can also be used to assist the cleaning of co2 from ch4 in anmbr off gas ruiz martinez et al 2012 a previous report also found that co2 from a lab scale anmbr was completely consumed by algal culture but only after 4 d of operation xiong et al 2018 here 7 co2 without ch4 was provided as a carbon source and ph control in order to see maximal growth of algae with the available n and p of the effluent due to safety concerns ch4 was not included in our gas streams however it is unlikely that this chemical would have an effect in the culture medium chemistry or algal metabolism our cultivations yielded cdw of over 2 g l 1 by 48h in the simulated august may november and continuous culture conditions fig 4b for may and continuous illumination conditions rates of co2 to biomass biofixation were 2 and 1 88 g l 1 respectively in the 24 h of the second day of cultivation fig 4c the growth performance of the strain and biomass accumulation over 96 h are equivalent to 3 66 and 3 44 g of co2 into biomass l 1 algal culture for may and august respectively the lab scale anmbr used to generate effluent for this study generates 631 5 mg of co2 l 1 effluent it should then be possible for the engineered c reinhardtii strain to capture 100 of the co2 generated in its off gas using the n and p found in 1 l effluent in 24 h of the logarithmic growth phase of these conditions however cultivation periods longer than 24 h would be required for complete n and p consumption as this required 48 72 h in the conditions tested here fig 4 d e therefore anmbr off gas storage and controlled feeding to algal cultures would need to be independently controlled to maximize n and p removal from the effluent while scrubbing co2 from the gas mixture these process factors would need to be considered in bio process design scheduling the high temperature and light conditions typical for the central red sea coast of saudi arabia seem to be favorable for rapid growth of the engineered c reinhardtii strain even in this effluent the milking of a terpenoid co product during nutrient removal could be considered a highly promising way to increase the economics of lost resources in wws solvent milking can be cyclic wherein the extraction of the patchoulol from the solvent can be performed and the solvent returned to culture in low opex bio processes overmans et al 2022 here we chose the sesquiterpenoid patchoulol as an exemplary product of the engineered algae due to the availability of strains different terpenoids produced by engineered algae could be chosen based on market demands as many of these products have been shown and engineering is ongoing lauersen 2019 the market price of synthetic patchoulol made by engineered yeast is 1 2 usd g 1 clearwood by firmenich https perfumersupplyhouse com product clearwood firmenich patchoulol productivity from the engineered algae was up to 837 µg l 1 algal culture in effluent 96 h and between 200 and 400 µg l 1 culture d 1 across biological replicates in the highest growth phase of 24 48 h figs 4g supp 4 at these productivities 1 2 usd could be generated for every 1 975 l 96 h batch or 5 000 2 500 l d 1 high growth rate repetitive batch of effluent higher temperatures in august simulations resulted in drastically lower patchoulol co product yields indicating unfavorable isoprenoid metabolism in these higher temperatures despite high biomass production rates fig 4 in other conditions with lower temperatures patchoulol production was higher although nutrient removal and algal growth were slower therefore a balance in process design will perhaps be necessary wherein seasonal outdoor lower energy input processes are switched with semi artificial cultivation conditions in summer conditions these factors for co product generation will also need to be balanced with culture residence times to ensure complete n and p removal gas stream co2 stripping and biomass separation 4 conclusions we show here that a highly domesticated lab adapted and engineered green alga can grow directly in unsterile anmbr effluents and yield considerable biomass 2 7 g cdw l 1 even under extreme light and temperature conditions typical for the central red sea coast of the arabian peninsula using a co product milking strategy we could simultaneously generate clean water and algal biomass and convert waste co2 into a valuable co product patchoulol which was non intrusively collected through microbial milking this process could readily be extended to other high value isoprenoids secreted recombinant proteins or volatile bulk chemical feedstocks produced by engineered algae the biomass itself is valuable although engineering alternative pigments could further enhance this alternatively algal biomass generated through post treatment of anmbr effluent could be used as a bulk vehicle for carbon re utilization and nutrient recovery strategies such as biomass conversion to biochar hydrothermal liquefaction conversion to asphalt generation of phytostimulant fertilizers or direct use in bio materials plastics production the demonstration that domesticated and engineerable algae can grow directly in anmbr effluent and yield high value side products drastically expands the range of possibilities to increase the circular value of these systems this can potentially be done by having municipal wastewater go through anmbr based treatment and the anmbr effluent being fed into a photobioreactor inoculated with the engineered algal strains to yield valuable products and or biomass fig 1 funding the research reported in this publication was supported by the kaust impact

that prohibit direct discharge into the environment gao et al 2021 xiong et al 2018 coupling anmbr ww treatment with downstream cultivation of algae in photobioreactors has been proposed as an additional process step chaudry 2021 ding et al 2022 gao et al 2021 leite et al 2019 using energy from photosynthesis microalgae consume co2 as a carbon source ammonium and phosphate as nitrogen n and phosphorous p sources respectively common laboratory media for growth of many green algae contain 7 5 mm ammonium chloride and 1 mm potassium phosphate total of mono and dibasic as n and p sources respectively gorman and levine 1965 while some algae prefer nitrate or urea instead of ammonium excess phosphates serve as a ph buffer in addition to their role source of p during anaerobic digestion of wastewaters existing organic n and p are converted into ammonium and inorganic phosphate which algae internalize as macronutrients serna garcía et al 2020b algal biomass can be a source of many valuable natural molecules or itself be used as a feedstock for processes like the production of biochar or emerging bio materials rajput et al 2022 engineering further levels of product generation from algal cells through synthetic biology has been proposed to increase the value of these bioproduction concepts the model green microalga chlamydomonas reinhardtii has now been extensively used to benchmark heterologous metabolite production from genetic engineering lauersen 2019 this has been facilitated by the domestication of c reinhardtii through several rounds of mutation and transformation neupert et al 2020 2009 while advances in synthetic transgene design have enabled robust expression of heterologous pathways in this alga baier et al 2020 2018 c reinhardtii is also generally regarded to be of safe gras status making it an interesting candidate for scaled processes in ww treatment gras notice no grn 000773 us food drug administration heterologous production of

perozeni et al 2020 have now been shown from c reinhardtii the produced terpenoid products are preferably harvested separate from algal biomass using solvent culture living extraction or milking during cultivation in this way the sesquiterpene patchoulol was produced up to 430 µg l 1 in 7 days equal to 300 µg g cdw 1 from c reinhardtii grown with co2 acetate in lab scale lauersen et al 2016 titers of 6 2 mg l 1 in 6 days were shown in high cell density bioreactors with enhanced nutrient cultivation medium abdallah et al 2022 highly domesticated and engineerable algae have only recently been reported and bioprocesses that leverage these new organisms in practice have yet to be developed since engineered algae strains are adapted to laboratory conditions they may not be as robust as algal species currently used in wastewater treatment or unsterile cultivation conditions here the performance of highly domesticated c reinhardtii strains directly in anmbr effluent was investigated an engineered strain was found to simultaneously remove n and p from effluent consume waste co2 and yield the heterologous sesquiterpenoid patchoulol as co product to biomass through metabolite milking the findings presented here show that in addition to the valuable production of reclaimed water co products can be generated through engineered algae that can improve waste stream treatment

capture patchoulol produced from the algal cells during growth 20 ml of the perfluorinated amine fc 3283 acros organics geel belgium was added to each culture as an underlay as recently described overmans and lauersen 2022 daily samples of 10 ml algae culture from each replicate flask were taken for determination of bacterial algal cell concentrations biomass quantification and nutrient analysis suppl data 5 while 500 μl of fc 3283 was sampled daily from each replicate bioreactor flask to quantify the accumulation of patchoulol product in the underlay all fc 3283 samples were immediately stored at 20 c until the end of the experiment 4 weeks storage when the samples were together processed for gc ms analysis 2 4 culture growth measurements algal culture growth was

usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 c reinhardtii uvm4 cultivation in raw anmbr effluent c reinhardtii uvm4 was cultivated in different dilutions of raw anmbr effluent to evaluate the growth of this strain in non sterile conditions with the inherent n and p of this liquid anmbr effluent contains ammonium and phosphate the c n and c p ratios are generally low and support autotrophic algal growth more than heterotrophic bacterial growth cultures were sparged with clean 7 co2 to provide a carbon source similar to what would come from an anmbr reactor and to regulate culture ph as algae grow they consume co2 which raises culture ph co2 injection for ph control in this way minimizes wasted co2 as it is only supplied as the algae consume it other green algae like scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp have both been shown to grow well in anmbr effluent serna garcía et al 2020b a recent chlamydomonas sp isolate from ww has been shown to grow robustly in non sterile ww conditions and can outcompete bacterial contaminants klassen et al 2020 however few studies have shown c reinhardtii growth for ww post treatment fewer for effluent from anmbrs and none to date have used a heavily domesticated and lab adapted genetically engineered strain the c reinhardtii strain uvm4 is derived from several rounds of mutagenesis and transformation of a parent wild type strain neupert et al 2009 despite gras status see introduction this strain is considered genetically modified due to the presence of transformed plasmids with selection marker cassettes this is true for all strains that have been engineered to produce heterologous co products and bioprocesses which would work with engineered algal cells would require biocontainment to be considered in process designs beyond the argumentation of selection marker escape into the environment the domestication of this alga through mutagenesis has not likely created further risks to its use uvm4 lacks a cell wall has been long adapted to nutrient surplus conditions and may be outcompeted by other organisms it was therefore important to determine its ability to grow directly in unsterile anmbr effluent as a precondition for proposal of its use in downstream effluent polishing and value generation mixed microalgae bacteria photo bioreactors can remove nutrients and co2 from anmbr effluent xiong et al 2018 and the growth of c reinhardtii uvm4 on either pure or diluted effluent was demonstrated here fig 2b the strain grew directly in non sterile effluent and completely consumed n and p as nutrients for its biomass after 144 h cultivation fig 2c c reinhardtii uvm4 was found to grow in all dilutions of effluent in water with only the 25 dilution exhibiting reduced growth behaviours fig 2b the effluents used for this experiment initially contained 23 25 mg l 1 ammonium nh4 n and 7 8 mg l 1 phosphate po4 3 p the raw effluent 100 and 50 dilution were suitable substrates for algal culture growth with nutrient removal occurring earlier in the 50 dilutions fig 2c and e previous microalgae bacteria cultures have been shown to have excellent stability as the symbiosis of microalgae and bacteria can even improve pollutant removal in wastewater liu and hong 2021 mixed cultures have also been shown to promote growth of other chlamydomonas spp klassen et al 2020 here the heavily domesticated c reinhardtii uvm4 was robust enough to be the dominant microorganism in the anmbr effluent under non sterile conditions suppl fig 1 and yield water which had nutrient levels acceptable for discharge al jasser 2011 this finding encouraged further investigation into how an engineered alga could be used for post treatment of anmbr effluent 3 2 c reinhardtii growth under extreme climate with raw anmbr effluent the ability of c reinhardtii uvm4 to grow in raw anmbr effluent in simulated weather conditions temperature and par from the saudi arabian red sea shores was tested fig 3 a the saudi arabian central red sea is characterized by an arid climate with daytime summer air temperatures of 40 c almazroui et al 2012 alsarmi and washington 2014 in addition the urban population of saudi arabia is growing and effective wastewater treatment strategies are required that are compatible with the local environmental conditions here domesticated c reinhardtii cultures grown directly in anmbr effluent were found to tolerate the local light and temperature regime across the year with slightly lower biomass generated under the winter conditions fig 3 b during most modelled months the algal biomass of anmbr effluent batch cultivation was 2 g l 1 by 96 h fig 3 b the highest biomass production was observed in the modelled month of june 2 26 g l 1 29 35 c fig 3 a during august even higher temperatures are found t 31 37 c nevertheless the uvm4 strain grew well reaching 2 12 g cdw l 1 fig 3 b bacterial contamination was present in all conditions but did not cause algal culture crash nor did bacteria outcompete the culture during the investigation period suppl fig 2 environmental modelling using local weather data in replicate bioreactors as shown here will be a valuable tool for benchmarking strain performance for outdoor cultivation in different locales this is the first example of such modelling for an engineered c reinhardtii strain grown in ww and complements previous efforts to grow engineered algae and cyanobacteria in outdoor conditions wichmann et al 2021 this full year modelling with each month provided valuable insight into how bioprocesses may perform in the local context throughout the year conditions from specific months were then chosen to represent seasonal changes to model outdoor bio process performance using a strain engineered to produce the heterologous sesquiterpenoid patchoulol and assess its product yields when grown directly in anmbr effluent 3 3 specialty chemical co production during effluent nutrient removal by an engineered green alga uvm4 has previously been genetically and metabolically modified to produce the heterologous plant sesquiterpenoid patchouli alcohol patchoulol abdallah et al 2022 lauersen et al 2016 heterologous terpenoid products can be collected during cultivation of microbial cultures using a two phase culture solvent system a process also called metabolic milking beekwilder et al 2014 lauersen 2019 overmans et al 2022 during solvent milking hydrophobic terpenoid products accumulate in biocompatible solvents as the products are more favored to partition into the solvents than into the cells or culture medium gruchattka and kayser 2015 recently we have shown a novel approach to this continuous culture solvent interaction by employing perfluorinated liquids that form a layer underneath the aqueous culture medium an underlay due to their higher densities overmans and lauersen 2022 these liquid fluorocarbons fcs are inert and accumulate terpenoid products from microbial cultures efficiently unlike organic solvent overlays i e dodecane fcs can be effectively used in the algem photobioreactors to capture terpenoid products during algal cultivation due to their high density and physical dynamics the engineered patchoulol producing c reinhardtii was cultivated in representative seasonal conditions spring summer autumn winter as well as in two artificial illumination conditions continuous light and a 12 h 12 h light dark cycle at constant temperature fig 4 these artificial conditions were used to compare controlled cultures with outdoor conditions that could be employed for algal based anmbr effluent nutrient removal at large scales as in municipal ww treatment processes the patchoulol producing c reinhardtii was found to grow well in anmbr effluent generating 2 35 2 18 and 2 43 g cdw l 1 culture in may august and november conditions respectively after 36 60 h of cultivation fig 4b continuous light generated 2 7 g cdw l 1 after 60 h of cultivation whereas in february and the 12 h 12 h light conditions biomass reached a maximum of 2 0 g cdw l 1 after 80 h fig 4b across all conditions patchoulol production gradually increased over the 96 h experimental period figs 4g h suppl 3 continuous light yielded the highest patchoulol production with a maximum titer of 837 µg patchoulol l 1 culture after 96 h fig 4g under the 12 h 12 h light dark illumination cycle and the simulated february november and may conditions patchoulol titers were relatively similar to each other by the end of the experiment with concentrations of 460 542 395 and 423 µg l 1 culture under august conditions patchoulol production was considerably lower 76 µg l 1 culture patchoulol production per cell based on algal cell count measurements fig 4 f showed a similar pattern to the volumetric yields cell specific patchoulol production was highest in the continuous light regime 188 fg cell 1 and negligible in the summer conditions august 20 fg cell 1 fig 4h moderate production of patchoulol per cell was observed under the 12 h 12 h light dark illumination 146 fg cell 1 the simulated february 136 fg cell 1 november 93 fg cell 1 and may 80 fg cell 1 conditions the latter finding suggests that patchoulol production per cell gradually decreases with increasing cultivation temperature 3 4 culture of engineered alga in unsterile effluent and biomass accumulation despite the presence of contaminating bacteria algal biomass of the highly engineered strain was also dominant in these unsterile cultivations suppl fig 4 algal bacterial consortia in wastewater treatment can simultaneously degrade organic carbon by heterotrophic bacteria and nutrients n and p by photoautotrophic algae in their interactions the oxygen produced by algae sustains bacterial respiration that contributes to nitrification and denitrification as well as organic matter removal in return the co2 produced by bacteria enhances microalgae growth foladori et al 2018 gou et al 2020 qu et al 2020 reported that chlamydomonas sp qwy37 remediated swine wastewater reduced the amount of total n by 96 and removed 100 of p the newly isolated chlamydomonas sp yc exhibits high tolerance towards ammonium and was used to treat undiluted rare earth element mining wastewater zhou et al 2022 here engineered c reinhardtii patchoulol producing strain removed all ammonium and phosphate from the raw effluent by the end of the cultivations 96 h except for the nh4 n content in the 12 h 12 h dark light cultures figs 4 d e and suppl 5 it could be expected that some cell wall proteins of the alga may be present at the end of cultivation which would be removed by any ultrafiltration steps used for biomass concentration under continuous light and conditions simulating may and august the same strain was able to take up all the nh4 n after only 72 h and phosphates after 48 h fig 3 d e as ph was controlled 7 7 1 across experimental conditions nh4 n volatilization and po4 3 p precipitation were not issues here unlike in previous studies gutzeit et al 2005 it was observed that algal biomass generation was highest in may and august conditions after 24 48 h fig 4 b whereas the rate of biomass generation decreased after the consumption of n and p sources fig 3 d e these findings point to potential repetitive batch scheduling conditions which could be used to cycle nutrient removal with biomass generation one of the advantages of using microalgae to treat ww is their photosynthetic co2 fixation which can also be used to assist the cleaning of co2 from ch4 in anmbr off gas ruiz martinez et al 2012 a previous report also found that co2 from a lab scale anmbr was completely consumed by algal culture but only after 4 d of operation xiong et al 2018 here 7 co2 without ch4 was provided as a carbon source and ph control in order to see maximal growth of algae with the available n and p of the effluent due to safety concerns ch4 was not included in our gas streams however it is unlikely that this chemical would have an effect in the culture medium chemistry or algal metabolism our cultivations yielded cdw of over 2 g l 1 by 48h in the simulated august may november and continuous culture conditions fig 4b for may and continuous illumination conditions rates of co2 to biomass biofixation were 2 and 1 88 g l 1 respectively in the 24 h of the second day of cultivation fig 4c the growth performance of the strain and biomass accumulation over 96 h are equivalent to 3 66 and 3 44 g of co2 into biomass l 1 algal culture for may and august respectively the lab scale anmbr used to generate effluent for this study generates 631 5 mg of co2 l 1 effluent it should then be possible for the engineered c reinhardtii strain to capture 100 of the co2 generated in its off gas using the n and p found in 1 l effluent in 24 h of the logarithmic growth phase of these conditions however cultivation periods longer than 24 h would be required for complete n and p consumption as this required 48 72 h in the conditions tested here fig 4 d e therefore anmbr off gas storage and controlled feeding to algal cultures would need to be independently controlled to maximize n and p removal from the effluent while scrubbing co2 from the gas mixture these process factors would need to be considered in bio process design scheduling the high temperature and light conditions typical for the central red sea coast of saudi arabia seem to be favorable for rapid growth of the engineered c reinhardtii strain even in this effluent the milking of a terpenoid co product during nutrient removal could be considered a highly promising way to increase the economics of lost resources in wws solvent milking can be cyclic wherein the extraction of the patchoulol from the solvent can be performed and the solvent returned to culture in low opex bio processes overmans et al 2022 here we chose the sesquiterpenoid patchoulol as an exemplary product of the engineered algae due to the availability of strains different terpenoids produced by engineered algae could be chosen based on market demands as many of these products have been shown and engineering is ongoing lauersen 2019 the market price of synthetic patchoulol made by engineered yeast is 1 2 usd g 1 clearwood by firmenich https perfumersupplyhouse com product clearwood firmenich patchoulol productivity from the engineered algae was up to 837 µg l 1 algal culture in effluent 96 h and between 200 and 400 µg l 1 culture d 1 across biological replicates in the highest growth phase of 24 48 h figs 4g supp 4 at these productivities 1 2 usd could be generated for every 1 975 l 96 h batch or 5 000 2 500 l d 1 high growth rate repetitive batch of effluent higher temperatures in august simulations resulted in drastically lower patchoulol co product yields indicating unfavorable isoprenoid metabolism in these higher temperatures despite high biomass production rates fig 4 in other conditions with lower temperatures patchoulol production was higher although nutrient removal and algal growth were slower therefore a balance in process design will perhaps be necessary wherein seasonal outdoor lower energy input processes are switched with semi artificial cultivation conditions in summer conditions these factors for co product generation will also need to be balanced with culture residence times to ensure complete n and p removal gas stream co2 stripping and biomass separation 4 conclusions we show here that a highly domesticated lab adapted and engineered green alga can grow directly in unsterile anmbr effluents and yield considerable biomass 2 7 g cdw l 1 even under extreme light and temperature conditions typical for the central red sea coast of the arabian peninsula using a co product milking strategy we could simultaneously generate clean water and algal biomass and convert waste co2 into a valuable co product patchoulol which was non intrusively collected through microbial milking this process could readily be extended to other high value isoprenoids secreted recombinant proteins or volatile bulk chemical feedstocks produced by engineered algae the biomass itself is valuable although engineering alternative pigments could further enhance this alternatively algal biomass generated through post treatment of anmbr effluent could be used as a bulk vehicle for carbon re utilization and nutrient recovery strategies such as biomass conversion to biochar hydrothermal liquefaction conversion to asphalt generation of phytostimulant fertilizers or direct use in bio materials plastics production the demonstration that domesticated and engineerable algae can grow directly in anmbr effluent and yield high value side products drastically expands the range of possibilities to increase the circular value of these systems this can potentially be done by having municipal wastewater go through anmbr based treatment and the anmbr effluent being fed into a photobioreactor inoculated with the engineered algal strains to yield valuable products and or biomass fig 1 funding the research reported in this publication was supported by the kaust impact

15266,the technology of cultivating salt tolerant limnetic microalgae in seawater reduces the freshwater demand and costs of biodiesel production however all current trials still occur on the bench scale and efforts for pilot scale operation are urgently needed this study firstly optimised the diameter of the photobioreactors pbrs to 0 2 m as the single module to produce lipid rich golenkinia sp sdec 16 because of the better algal growth and light attenuation in the pbrs and then established a 1000 l algal cultivation system in a medium of seawater supplemented with monosodium glutamate wastewater at a ratio of 1 1000 s msgw the biomass productivity was 0 26 g l d which was approaching the 0 30 g l d obtained in bg11 and the lipid productivity 98 99 mg l d was doubled in comparison to growth in bg11 c16 c18 accounted for more than 98 of the total fatty acid in s msgw and the biodiesel properties also met the biodiesel standards the input cost of the biodiesel in this pilot scale system was estimated to be 2 2 kg when considering the carbon reduction and diversified application of the biomass golenkinia sp would annually capture 186 77 kg m3 pbr of co2 and yield an output to

because of its advantages of being free of sulfur and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon kant bhatia et al 2021 biodiesel can also meet the demands of existing engines without any modification due to its similar combustion properties to fossil fuels kant bhatia et al 2021 microalgae are considered to be promising candidates for biodiesel production due to their unique advantages of rapid growth high photosynthetic rate and no need for arable land wijffels and barbosa 2010 kafil et al 2022 microalgae s efficiency in converting solar energy is able to reach 3 higher than the efficiency of 1 found in most higher plants liu et al 2021a therefore with the urgent global demand for carbon reduction there is an extensive development opportunity for microalga based biofuels one analysis estimated that the global market for microalgal biofuels will reach us 10 73 billion by 2025 kumar et al 2020 however the high demands for freshwater and nutrients during cultivation of microalgae greatly increase the operating cost and become the main limiting factors for large scale application microalgae would need 1 5 million l ha year of freshwater in open ponds and the evaporation would be 7 11 million l ha year singh and gu 2010 in contrast to the scarce freshwater seawater covers about 71 of the earth s surface and is rich in mineral elements which offers potential to replace the freshwater and microelements that constitute a chemical medium therefore there are benefits in attempting to replace freshwater with seawater to grow salt tolerant microalgae currently the research on cultivating microalgae in seawater is focused on marine algae including tetraselmis omirou et al 2018 and nannochloropsis cheng et al 2022 however the species of marine algae that have been researched are still scarce in nature and most of them yielded low biomass and lipid productivities insufficient to meet the prerequisites for commercialisation by contrast thousands of limnetic microalgae being isolated exist which some of them are known for their high growth rate and lipid accumulation additionally high salinity is an effective way of stimulating limnetic microalgae to increase lipid accumulation aziz et al 2020 therefore cultivating microalgae in seawater will achieve the dual benefits of saving freshwater and producing algal lipids the selection of nutrient sources for growing microalgae is an essential task due to the low nitrogen n and phosphorous p in seawater attempts to grow microalgae in wastewater have produced satisfactory achievements bhatia et al 2022 seawater medium coupled with wastewater thus has a chance to replace the traditional chemical freshwater medium for cultivating limnetic microalgae the monosodium glutamate wastewater msgw is a food industry wastewater with characteristics of having high n p concentrations and being free of heavy metals previous studies showed that msgw is a suitable nutrient source for lipid rich species such as golenkinia sp sdec 16 chlorella sp sdec 18 s subsalsa p tricornutum and n oceanica liu et al 2021b jiang et al 2019 yu et al 2022 in particular golenkinia sp sdec 16 produced a lipid productivity of 48 mg l d liu et al 2021b triple the output in bg11 until now however all trials are still at the laboratory scale and sufficient detailed data at the large scale need to be gathered moreover almost all of the previous studies focus only on the metabolite content and the productivity on the day of harvesting for example the freshwater chlorella g 9 cultivated in sewage supplemented with 40 seawater accumulated a biomass of 0 55 g l and a lipid content of 45 after 15 days gao et al 2022 the isolate ri67 3 grown in chemical medium supplemented with 50 seawater obtained a biomass of 0 168 g l and a lipid content of 33 on the 20th day ummalyma et al 2020 however discovering the temporal changes in metabolites the mechanism of salt tolerance in microalgae and the optimal duration of cultivation still need more attention consequently based on the 0 08 g l biomass and 48 mg l d lipid productivity achieved by golenkinia sdec 16 in the previous laboratory scale trials this study was designed to support and validate the feasibility of using a seawater based medium for pilot scale cultivation of sdec 16 the aims of this study were 1 to optimize the cylindrical photobioreactors 2 to evaluate the growth and metabolism of golenkinia sp sdec 16 grown in s msgw in this system and 3 to establish a 1000 l algal cultivation system and analyse its carbon reduction and economic benefits 2 material and methods 2 1 algal strains and medium the microalga golenkinia sp sdec 16 accession no kt180320 was used in this study as it was proven to have an excellent performance in a seawater based medium liu et al 2021b the s msgw was composed of 0 1 msgw from a gourmet powder factory in shandong china and 99 9 natural seawater collected from qingdao china in which the concentration of total nitrogen tn was 323 9 mg l total phosphorous tp was 5 8 mg l and ammonia nitrogen nh3 n was 113 1 mg l for the preparation stage the microalgae were cultured with sterile bg11 in 3 l photobioreactors 25 c 120 μmol m2 s of continuous illumination from daylight fluorescent tubes when microalgae entered the logarithmic phase of growth the algal liquid was centrifuged at 5000 rpm and 4 c and then re suspended with s msgw 2 2 design of the experiments 2 2 1 optimization of pbrs three diameters of the pbrs namely 0 1 m 0 2 m and 0 3 m were selected as candidates according to the general application in laboratory and industry the height was designed to be 2 m to maximize the site space the medium was pumped through the top pipelines the bottom was conical with an aeration pipe and scupper for integration of algal cultivation and harvesting upon reaching the stationary phase of growth the aeration was stopped and the contents of the bioreactors were allowed to stand for about 12 h after the microalgae self settled down to the bottom the pump was set up to transfer the concentrated algal liquid to harvest tank for harvesting optimization of diameter was based on the data of algal growth in s msgw 2 2 2 algal growth and metabolites in the optimized pbrs the time courses of growth pigments and metabolites content of sdec 16 grown in the optimized pbrs were all characterized four culture groups were selected 1 s msgw seawater supplemented with msgw at a ratio of 1 1000 2 f msgw freshwater supplemented with msgw at a ratio of 1 1000 3 s bg11 seawater based bg11 and 4 f bg11 freshwater based bg11 at the beginning the algal seeds were added to the pbrs filled with the medium with an initial biomass concentration of 0 2 0 3 g l aeration was provided by an air pump with a flow rate of 2 0 2 5 l min through a 0 22 μm filter membrane when microalgae grew to the stationary phase the aeration was stopped and after 12 hours sedimentation cells were harvested by the bottom scupper the concentrated algal liquid was transferred to the harvest tank and centrifuged to harvest the algal sludge which was then freeze dried for assessment all experimental groups were set up independently in triplicate 2 2 3 establishment of a 1000 l system in this study a pilot scale microalgal cultivation plant was constructed consisted of a light source an algal cultivation system an aeration system and a harvest system fig 1 unilateral continuous illumination with 120 μmol m2 s light intensity was provided by 60 daylight fluorescent tubes 10 w each for the algal cultivation system 20 optimized pbrs with 1000 l of total volume were simultaneously operated under the condition of 25 27 c and 2 0 l min air aeration the aeration system comprised an air pump 1 5 kw branch pipes and gas flowmeters a 50 l tank was prepared for receiving the concentrated algal liquid after sedimentation 2 3 analysis of microalgae 2 3 1 determination of microalgal growth the algal growth was charactered by dry biomass mass d b m g l and cell count cells l the cell count was conducted under an optical microscope bx53 olympus dbm was assessed by a gravimetric method 20 ml of algal

as the basic model which expressions are as follows 12 i i 0 4 α 1 1 α 1 2 e α 2 1 α 1 2 e α 2 where α 1 and α 2 are calculated as 13 α 1 e a e a e s 14 α 2 e a e s α 1 dbm l where i 0 and i μmol m2 s are the intensities of the incident and emitted light entering and exiting the algal medium respectively d b m is the biomass concentration of microalgae here for sdec 16 l is the light path in the pbrs and e a and e s m2 g are the mass absorption coefficient and scattering coefficient of the microalgae respectively firstly the value of i was measured based on the medium with different biomass concentration 100 2000 mg l and i 0 was set as 120 μmol m2 s origin 9 1 software was used for fitting the curve of the cornet model to calculate the e a and e s finally the average light intensity in the pbrs with the changes in biomass concentration was calculated based on the fitted curve and average light path l 15 l 1 π d sin θ d θ where d is the diameter of the pbrs 2 3 5 analysis of fatty acid methyl ester fame profiles the fatty acid fa from microalgal biomass of each culture group was extracted by a two step in situ process and the fame profiles were then analysed through the method of gc ms according to the previous study song et al 2013 which are shown in text s3 2 3 6 analysis of biodiesel properties the properties of biodiesel from algal biomass of each group were calculated based on the fame profiles according to the prediction and evaluation model proposed in the previous study song et al 2013 hoekman et al 2012 the equations between average degree of unsaturation a d u

benefits the economic benefits of this system were calculated and expressed as the inputs outputs and output to input ratio oir which are detailed in text s4 2 4 2 carbon reduction the advantage of microalgae over higher plants is their excellent carbon sequestration efficiency which theoretically is 1 8 g co2 g biomass wijffels and barbosa 2010 the carbon reduction of this system was therefore based on the microalgal growth the majority of the total input was from electrical energy so the carbon reduction was also assessed for the condition of solar energy being used to generate electricity to power the system 2 5 calculations on the photovoltaic system 2 5 1 daily electricity demand δ w s daily electricity demand of the system was considered to be the summation of the electricity

pbrs three diameters of the pbrs were investigated in this study fig 2 microalgae in the pbrs experienced a one day lag phase fig 2a showing their adaptive process when shifted from the f bg11 to s msgw the subsequent rapid growth of golenkinia sp sdec 16 showed their excellent tolerance to high salinity proven in detail previously liu et al 2021b after the ten day cultivation microalgae reached the stationary phase achieving maximum biomass concentrations of 2 49 2 34 and 1 49 g l for 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m diameters respectively considering the volume the biomass production was 39 09 g 0 1 m 146 95 g 0 2 m and 139 18 g 0 3 m respectively the optimal diameter was thus found to be 0 2 m for 0 3 m diameter the biomass productivity quickly declined from the 3rd day fig 2b the maximum dbp values for diameters of 0 1 and 0 2 m were 0 32 and 0 30 g l d respectively both occurring on the 6th day light intensity plays a vital role in algal growth patel et al 2019 large bioreactor size means long distances for light to traverse and the differences in algal growth seen in pbrs with different diameters may be mainly caused by light attenuation therefore the changes in light attenuation were assessed fig 3 in the same pbr the light intensity exponentially decayed with the increase of biomass concentration while in pbrs with different diameters the longer the path the light traversed the more rapidly the light was attenuated the curves fit to the light attenuation data from different pbrs indicate that the absorption e a and scattering e a coefficients were 0 034 and 0 087 m2 g respectively so the cornet model in the different column pbrs could be expressed as in fig 3b because of the normal incidence of the parallel light from the side the average light paths l were 0 064 0 127 and 0 191 m for the 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m diameter pbrs respectively fig 3c indicate that during the initial stage the average light intensities in the 0 1 m and 0 2 m diameter pbrs were higher than that in the 0 3 m diameter pbr wherein after passing through the 0 3 m pbr the light with 6000 lux incident intensity had decayed about 50 the inadequate light may be one of the main limitations leading to the low biomass concentration in the pbr of 0 3 m diameter 3 2 the growth characteristics of sdec 16 in optimized photobioreactors the growth characteristics in all systems were assessed in the photobioreactors with 0 2 m diameter the maximum biomass of sdec 16 in s msgw was 2 08 g l about 86 of the 2 43 g l obtained in f bg11 medium showing that the high salinity in seawater had no significant inhibition effect on the algal growth while s bg11 had an inhibition effect fig 4 msgw a kind of wastewater formed after bacterial fermentation for monosodium glutamate production contains large amounts of residual nutrients vitamins and amino acids which had important positive effects on the algal growth the maximum biomass productivity was 0 26 g l d which occurred on the 3rd day and was about 87 of that obtained in f bg11 on the 6th day 0 30 g l d the specific growth rate μ in all systems initially increased during the first 2 to 3 days and then slowly decreased the peak in μ for s msgw was 0 42 d 1 which was similar to the 0 4 d 1 achieved in f bg11 for the cell counts the peak values were 95 7 78 3 53 7 and 27 3 108 cells l for f bg11 f msgw s msgw and s bg11 respectively unlike biomass concentration the cell counts of sdec 16 in freshwater systems were significantly higher than those in seawater systems especially for msgw as the nutrient source the biomass concentration in s msgw was higher than that in f msgw but the cell count showed the reverse trend the changes in the mass of individual cells were monitored showing that the high salinity in s msgw stimulated accumulation of metabolites leading to an increment in the mass of individual cells after the algal seed was inoculated into the seawater medium the mass of a single cell sharply increased from 0 2 to 0 4 ng cell within 2 days of the lag phase in the growth of microalgae in contrast for the freshwater medium the increase from 0 2 to 0 3 ng cell occurred after the 6th day during the late exponential or stationary growth phase of microalgae fig 4e under saline condition in the seawater microalgae accumulated compatible solutes to respond to the initial change in osmotic pressure while in the freshwater medium accumulation of metabolites occurred when microalgae faced with the stress of self shadowing or nutrient deficiency previous studies demonstrated that metabolite accumulation is a general pathway for microalgae to resist high salinity for example scenedesmus dimorphus cells accumulated lipid when faced with 160 mm nacl gour et al 2020 the lipid content in parachlorella kessleri cells increased from 31 to 51 after 7 day exposure to 350 mm nacl and the protein content decreased from 26 8 to 17 1 you et al 2019 in order to ascertain the synthesis of lipids carbohydrates and proteins their contents and productivities as functions of culture time were further analysed 3 3 accumulation of metabolites the content of the metabolites in f bg11 remained relatively stable fig 5 in s msgw the lipid content was stable in the range of 25 30 during the first 3 days but sharply increased in the subsequent 2 days and then slightly increased with cultivation time the maximum lipid content of sdec 16 in s msgw was 60 5 which is 2 4 times higher than the 25 6 achieved in f bg11 for carbohydrate content the trend in s msgw was completely opposite to the lipid content within 3 days after seed inoculation the carbohydrate content rapidly rose from 31 8 to 50 1 then swiftly dropped to 17 5 on the 6th day and finally ended up fluctuating around about 10 which represented a significant decrease compared to the level in f bg11 26 6 several studies considered the lipid to be a compatible solute to balance the osmotic pressure for example the glycerol content in dunaliella salina quickly increased within 1 to 3 h and then gradually obtained its peak level after 24 h when the salinity changed from 1 to 3 m zhao et al 2013 for golenkinia sp sdec 16 however when shifting from freshwater to seawater the lipid content remained low but the carbohydrate content massively increased which indicates that the carbohydrates rather than the lipids were the early osmotic protectants following the initial switching to the saline environment a similar phenomenon happened with some cyanobacteria for which a rough correlation was found between the kind level of the accumulated compatible solutes and the level of salinity exposed luo et al 2022 the known halotolerant model microalga synechocystis sp rapidly and massively accumulated trehalose glucosylglycerol and sucrose in salt shocked cells oren 2015 moreover it was also reported that there was a strong exchange of carbon between the different compatible solutes during the early and late salt stress kirsch et al 2019 in this study the opposite trends for carbohydrates and lipids indicated that golenkinia sp sdec 16 accumulated large amounts of carbohydrate during the onset of adaptation when shocked by high salinity and then when it entered the late adaptive phase the algal cells converted the energy storage compounds from carbohydrate to lipid allowing the lipid content to significantly increase in the stationary phase of salt exposure hence for golenkinia sp sdec 16 carbohydrate synthesis formed the short term adaptation process to the salt and the cells accumulated adequate lipid after long term salt acclimatisation regarding the changes in the protein content in s msgw fig 5c there was also a slight increase from 19 3 to 24 9 within the first 3 days followed by a return to normal levels which was also due to the processes of adaptation to the salt environment it has been demonstrated that na ions moved inside the algal cells within a few seconds and were then exported to the surrounding medium through the corresponding translocators including h na h and na k antiporters to maintain homoeostasis nitschmann and packer 1992 katz et al 1991 iwano 1995 the increase in protein content thus reflected the second approach of golenkinia sp to tolerate the high salinity in s msgw according to fig 5d the metabolic activity had changed to the lipid dominated approach on the 10th day which however did not occur in the freshwater based medium showing the decisive role of salinity in changing the metabolism the lipid productivity in s msgw 98 99 mg l d was significantly higher than that in f bg11 48 94 mg l d but the carbohydrate accumulation was significantly lower fig 5e taking all of the above into account there were two pathways for golenkinia sp to resist the salty condition as follows 1 within the first few days after being shocked by high salinity golenkinia sp immediately synthesized carbohydrate which would be converted to the lipid dominated metabolism after long term salt acclimatisation the appearance of a large amount of lipid in the cells marked the end of the salt resistance process 2 golenkinia sp responded rapidly to start up the protein synthesis system to produce some antiporters to export the intracellular na and maintained homoeostasis protecting the algal cells from damage due to hyperosmolarity 3 4 analysis of fa profiles and biodiesel properties besides the lipid content and productivity the fa profiles are also vital for production of microalga based biodiesel as shown in fig 6 the fa profiles of golenkinia sdec 16 in seawater were similar to those in freshwater medium the c16 c18 fatty acids that are suitable for biodiesel occupied more than 95 of the total fame for all groups especially for the s msgw group 98 indicating that the fatty acid from golenkinia sdec 16 in s msgw is the good candidate for biodiesel production the properties of biodiesel depended on the fa profiles and the predictions and models between fa profiles and some important properties of biodiesel have established for convenient assessment of biodiesel properties song et al 2013 hoekman et al 2012 for all cases the pufa dominated the fa profiles of sdec 16 and the average degree of unsaturation adu of the biodiesel ranged from 1 6 1 8 showing its satisfactory low temperature fluidity for other properties ν k ρ c p c n i v and h h v table 1 all met the demand of the biodiesel standard including chn gb t 20828 t zzb 2614 us astm d6751 and is 15607 which indicated that the salt environment in s msgw would not pose adverse effects on the biodiesel properties therefore using s msgw for cultivating freshwater golenkinia sdec 16 is a promising technology for microalga based biodiesel production 3 5 changes in photosynthesis the photosynthetic pigment content directly reflects the viability of cell photosynthesis and the degree of cellular damage golenkinia sp synthesized large amounts of chlorophyll in the freshwater media 33 44 mg l in f bg11 and 25 74 mg l in f msg compared to the large accumulation of carotenoid 3 31 mg l in s msgw under the saline conditions in the seawater fig 7 carotenoids are a vital part of the cell s protective mechanism and are able to counteract reactive oxygen species ros thereby avoiding lipid peroxidation and protecting the integrity and function of the photosynthetic apparatus gong and bassi 2016 carotenoids accounted for 17 48 and 18 09 of the total pigments in s bg11 and s msgw respectively fig 7b yet in the freshwater medium the ratio of carotenoids to total pigments was only 6 07 in f bg11 and 9 44 in f msgw the significant difference indicates that sdec 16 accumulated carotenoids as a defence against high salinity it should be especially noted that the total pigment contents were related to the biomass concentration so they were not able to reflect the intracellular changes in pigment synthesis and hence the mean carotenoid content of an individual cell was calculated as in fig 7c after inoculation the mean carotenoid contents of sdec 16 in s bg11and s msgw rapidly increased and then peaked 8 50 and 7 58 10 4 ng cell respectively within 4 to 6 days which were 2 6 and 1 9 times higher than for f bg11and f msg respectively saline condition stimulated the algal cells to form large amounts of ros which can oxidize the intracellular structure pancha et al 2015 it has been reported in the higher plants that carotenoids functioned as the first defensive line against singlet o2 ramel et al 2012 the fast synthesis and accumulation of carotenoids at the beginning thus served as sdec 16 s first line of defence to resist the oxidative damage caused by the high salinity the changes in the ratio of chl a chl b fig 7d in the seawater medium showed a lag phase during the first 4 5 days and the ratios promptly rose to about 3 6 and 3 7 in s bg11 and s msgw for freshwater medium chl a chl b remained relatively stable at 2 6 2 8 the clear lag phase of chl a chl b indicates that the microalgae were adapting to the adverse saline conditions and the subsequent sharp increase indicates a reduction in the rate of photophosphorylation during electron transfer srivastava et al 2017 caro chl in seawater quickly increased after the salt shock fig 7e showing the higher rate of carotenoid synthesis than that for chlorophyll 3 6 establishment of a 1000 l algal cultivation system 3 6 1 design and performance of the pilot scale system after optimizing the bioreactors and ascertaining the metabolic behaviour of golenkinia sdec 16 in s msgw this study further established a 1000 l algal cultivation system to bring the promising technology closer to practical application each photobioreactor constituted one basic module and 20 independent modules were simultaneously operated for growing microalgae the pre prepared s msgw in a tank was pumped into the module through the cover another injection port was designed for adding algal broth and was kept airtight during the cultivation period according to figs 2 and 4 the algal growth tended to be stable on the 7th day in this system we therefore set the culture period as 7 days which meant that this system would harvest 284 3 and 161 4 mg l d of algal biomass and lipid using s msgw respectively compared with other microalgae in large scale cultivation qurat ul ain et al 2022 hoeniges et al 2022 vadiveloo et al 2022 díez montero et al 2020 chi et al 2022 kumar et al 2019 park et al 2019 pereira et al 2018 wen et al 2016 pegallapati et al 2013 peng et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 arbib et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 biondi et al 2013 peter et al 2022 the biomass and lipid productivity of golenkinia sp sdec 16 were in the lead position table 2 during industrial cultivation of graesiella sp in bg11 in a 40 000 l open raceway pond orp only 6 2 and 2 1 mg l d of biomass and lipid productivity were obtained upon harvesting even while sparging with pure co2 wen et al 2016 in a 14 000 l column pbr the biomass productivity of chlorella vulgaris was 42 86 mg l d in bg11 medium with pure co2 aeration peter et al 2022 ascochloris sp in 480 l semi cylindrical pbrs yielded biomass and lipid productivities of 207 and 72 mg l d in raw dairy wastewater aerated by air in terms of seawater based media nannochloropsis sp exhibited high biomass and lipid productivity 330 and 110 mg l d respectively in guillard s f medium aerated by pure co2 biondi et al 2013 hence the biomass and lipid productivity were species dependant and pure co2 was not able to enhance the algal growth because of the possible toxicity of high levels of co2 to microalgae it was reported that co2 higher than 10 would inhibit the growth of microalgae ramos ibarra et al 2019 moreover pure co2 will greatly increase the cost of algal cultivation and pose the risk of leakage if excessive consequently air aeration is recommended for practical production an additional concern is that how to treat the wastewater after algal cultivation although it would contain a lot of organics excreted by microalgae as well as unconsumed nutrients from the original medium in our study the residual liquid in the pbrs was recycled after the addition of phosphorous or msgw data not published which avoided discharging the wastewater into the environment 3 6 2 carbon economic analysis the economic benefit of the established system was expressed as the output to input ratio oir the inputs originated from three parts algal cultivation harvesting drying lipid extraction and transesterification and each part was in turn composed of electricity and chemicals shown in fig 8 s msgw was composed of the natural seawater and msgw so that the medium cost was negligible and the price of f bg11 medium was 29 22 tonne in our previous study f bg11 was recycled twice and the biomass concentration clearly decreased in the thrice recycled medium with the assumption of recycling the medium twice 16 days as one cycle for calculations the cost of the chemical medium would be 667 year growing sdec 16 in s msgw can hence greatly reduce the culture inputs during industrial production the electricity consumption during algal cultivation was mainly from the light and aeration systems in which 60 lamps 10 w for each one and an aeration pump 1 5 kw worked continuously every day and so the total electrical cost was 1472 year for harvesting and drying the cost of electricity from centrifugation and freeze drying was 70 year for lipid extraction the cost included electricity ultrasound and centrifugation chemicals chloroform methanol and nacl and nitrogen gas in the actual extraction process the ratio of algal powder to extracting solution was used in a ratio of 1 10 g ml and 80 of the evaporated solutions were recycled so the chemicals costs were 51 year for transesterification lipases for catalysis have been widely applied in industry due to its low cost and less pollution compared to traditional acid or base catalyst herein the costs were estimated based on the method of lipases which were mainly from lipases methanol and electricity the recovery efficiency of the immobilized enzymes and methanol can reach 50 and 80 respectively so the cost of transesterification was 20 year m3 pbr the contributions to the inputs at different stages are shown in fig 8 it was found that the cultivation inputs occupied the majority of the total cost and electricity was the largest component for all cases in case of using solar energy as the power the input costs for biodiesel production would only be 2 7 kg in total for the purpose of algal biomass production the input costs of this algal system using s msgw as the medium would be 1542 year m3 pbr and would be 1635 year m3 pbr for the purpose of biodiesel production compared to the input costs for f bg11 these values would be 2231 and 2302 year m3 pbr showing that this technology would reduce about 30 of the total input for algal biomass and biodiesel production if using solar energy as the power the input costs would only be 92 year m3 pbr for biomass production and 163 year m3 pbr for biodiesel production therefore the total input cost would be 0 7 kg biomass for biomass production and 2 7 kg biodiesel for biodiesel production in addition previous study showed that seawater made the cell walls of microalgae fragile and the extraction efficiency of lipid was increased by 30 40 pei et al 2022 so the cost for biodiesel production would be finally estimated to be 2 2 kg biodiesel the outputs depend on the price of biodiesel and powdered biomass for biodiesel production though the recent price of biodiesel only ranges from 1 3 1 5 kg biodiesel lower than 2 2 kg in this system some by products during transesterification such as crude glycerine with the price of 0 5 1 5 kg glycerine according to its content can partly compensate the gap moreover the post extracted algal residues can also be multiply applied such as anaerobic fermentation for biogas production to further enhance the economic feasibility for biomass production because this algal powder of golenkinia sdec 16 was not commercialised yet the output was estimated according to the current prices 5 100 kg biomass of some commercialised microalgae such as chlorella spirulina euglena and haematococcus pluvialis based on this we specified a price of 50 kg biomass for which the output of our system would yield 5188 or 6179 year m3 pbr for s msgw or bg11 respectively therefore the oir for s msgw was 3 4 higher than the 2 8 estimated for bg11 for the photovoltaic system it comprises an inverter accumulator batteries and photovoltaic panels the required power and daily electricity demand of the light and aeration systems combined were 2100 w and 50 4 kwh respectively a high quality inverter is rated at more than 95 efficiency and we specified 95 here so the total power of the photovoltaic system p t would be 2210 w for the accumulator battery the common type of 300 ah 12v was selected and the depth of discharge dod was taken as 70 so the accumulator battery capacity c a p b and required input of electricity would be 6000 ah and 72 kwh respectively meaning that 20 units of the selected accumulator battery would be enough the output power of a photovoltaic system is related to the local daily sunshine duration which varied from 5 51 to 6 78 h in shandong china from 2014 to 2019 according to the shandong meteorological bureau http sd cma gov cn considering the power efficiency of the panels during electricity generation η p being generally 70 the output power p o would be 15 2 18 7 kw if the power density of sunlight and the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the panels were taken as 1000 w m2 and 16 respectively the power density would be 160 w m2 the required area then becomes 95 117 m2 which would result in a final specification of 120 m2 for actual construction in addition to the economic promise golenkinia sdec 16 achieved the maximum biomass concentrations of 1 99 within 7 days in s msgw corresponding to 103 76 kg of annual biomass production the established algal system would hence capture 186 77 kg co2 y m3 pbr within the sdec 16 biomass grown in s msgw 3 7 issues to focus on for practical implementation 3 7 1 wastewater recycling the treatment of wastewater from algal cultivation in seawater is a considerable issue due to its excessive salinity for common bacterial species used in wastewater treatment which needs to be considered more carefully recycling the wastewater after harvesting will reduce the discharge and the water demand for growth medium in this study the final contents of tn and tp were 201 6 and 0 2 mg l in s msgw achieving tn and tp removal efficiencies of 37 8 and 96 6 respectively the algal growth may consequently be limited by phosphorous and the key issue arising in recycling the medium was to supply with phosphorous in other studies tn and tp removal efficiencies greatly varied between 34 79 and 66 100 respectively for different microalgae including phaeodactylum tricornutum nannochloropsis oceanica and spirulina subsalsa vadiveloo et al 2022 díez montero et al 2020 therefore for effective recycling the wastewater the kinetics of n p assimilation should be established for different algal species microalgae excrete extracellular polymeric substances eps during their growth especially under high salinity yu et al 2020 the feasibility of wastewater recycling is a priority and needs detailed research to discover the eps excreted in seawater based medium and their effects on the algal growth 3 7 2 nutrient source selection wastewater selection is another important issue that needs to be discussed several studies focused only on culturing microalgae with wastewater amongst which the relatively mild domestic wastewater was preferred the high load industrial wastewater was undesirable because it generally needs large amounts of water to be diluted and contains heavy metals and toxic organics high ammonia and an imbalanced ratio of n p often reduce the biomass concentration the msgw is characterized as having a high level of nutrients and being free of heavy metals toxic organics its benefits for algal growth and metabolism have been demonstrated previously no matter whether in seawater or freshwater liu et al 2021 jiang et al 2019 consequently when considering wastewater based nutrients biotoxicity to microalgae must be tested to ensure survival of microalgae wastewater selection should also be based on the local economic and industrial conditions for easy collection and transportation 3 7 3 device development mariculture cannot exist without the topic of corrosion due to the high concentration of chloride ions especially in the oxygen enriched environments supporting algal photosynthesis though the core vessel of the bioreactor is made of glass or organic glass parts of the pipelines elbows or subsequent harvest devices are probably built with stainless steel so periodic cleaning and maintenance need to be conducted use of corrosion resistant plastics and highly passivated stainless steel is strongly recommended in summary while this study successfully established a large scale algal cultivation system based on s msgw and simultaneously achieved carbon reduction and algal biomass production the system is still faced with the above questions some aspects including bioreactor design environmental biological engineering and material science also need deeper multidisciplinary cooperation to make this system more practical and efficient 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that in the established pilot scale algal cultivation system golenkinia sp sdec 16 obtained a similar biomass productivity 0 26 g l d and a doubled lipid productivity 98 99 mg l d compared to bg11 medium carbohydrate content greatly increased following the initial salt shock but the carbohydrate contribution in metabolite percentage became less in favour of lipid production the fa profiles in s msgw were rich in c16 c18 98 and the biodiesel properties also met the biodiesel standards the mean carotenoid content in single cells was 7 58 10 4 ng cell which was higher than that for bg11 all of the electricity needed by this system can be supplied by 120 m2 of photovoltaic panels our pilot scale algal cultivation system would simultaneously achieve co2 sequestration and algal biomass production declaration of competing interest

15266,the technology of cultivating salt tolerant limnetic microalgae in seawater reduces the freshwater demand and costs of biodiesel production however all current trials still occur on the bench scale and efforts for pilot scale operation are urgently needed this study firstly optimised the diameter of the photobioreactors pbrs to 0 2 m as the single module to produce lipid rich golenkinia sp sdec 16 because of the better algal growth and light attenuation in the pbrs and then established a 1000 l algal cultivation system in a medium of seawater supplemented with monosodium glutamate wastewater at a ratio of 1 1000 s msgw the biomass productivity was 0 26 g l d which was approaching the 0 30 g l d obtained in bg11 and the lipid productivity 98 99 mg l d was doubled in comparison to growth in bg11 c16 c18 accounted for more than 98 of the total fatty acid in s msgw and the biodiesel properties also met the biodiesel standards the input cost of the biodiesel in this pilot scale system was estimated to be 2 2 kg when considering the carbon reduction and diversified application of the biomass golenkinia sp would annually capture 186 77 kg m3 pbr of co2 and yield an output to input ratio oir of 3 4 in s msgw higher than the 2 8 in bg11 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords limnetic microalgae seawater pilot scale algal cultivation system biodiesel production metabolites data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction shortage of fossil fuels and excessive emission of greenhouse gases lead to energy and environment crises which will be alleviated by promoting the rapid development of renewable and green energy kant bhatia et al 2022 biodiesel is a renewable and carbon neutral energy and it is expected to displace fossil fuel because of its advantages of being free of sulfur and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon kant bhatia et al 2021 biodiesel can also meet the demands of existing engines without any modification due to its similar combustion properties to fossil fuels kant bhatia et al 2021 microalgae are considered to be promising candidates for biodiesel production due to their unique advantages of rapid growth high photosynthetic rate and no need for arable land wijffels and barbosa 2010 kafil et al 2022 microalgae s efficiency in converting solar energy is able to reach 3 higher than the efficiency of 1 found in most higher plants liu et al 2021a therefore with the urgent global demand for carbon reduction there is an extensive development opportunity for microalga based biofuels one analysis estimated that the global market for microalgal biofuels will reach us 10 73 billion by 2025 kumar et al 2020 however the high demands for freshwater and nutrients during cultivation of microalgae greatly increase the operating cost and become the main limiting factors for large scale application microalgae would need 1 5 million l ha year of freshwater in open ponds and the evaporation would be 7 11 million l ha year singh and gu 2010 in contrast to the scarce freshwater seawater covers about 71 of the earth s surface and is rich in mineral elements which offers potential to replace the freshwater and microelements that constitute a chemical medium therefore there are benefits in attempting to replace freshwater with seawater to grow salt tolerant microalgae currently the research on cultivating microalgae in seawater is focused on marine algae including tetraselmis omirou et al 2018 and nannochloropsis cheng et al 2022 however the species of marine algae that have been researched are still scarce in nature and most of them yielded low biomass and lipid productivities insufficient to meet the prerequisites for commercialisation by contrast thousands of limnetic microalgae being isolated exist which some of them are known for their high growth rate and lipid accumulation additionally high salinity is an effective way of stimulating limnetic microalgae to increase lipid accumulation aziz et al 2020 therefore cultivating microalgae in seawater will achieve the dual benefits of saving freshwater and producing algal lipids the selection of nutrient sources for growing microalgae is an essential task due to the low nitrogen n and phosphorous p in seawater attempts to grow microalgae in wastewater have produced satisfactory achievements bhatia et al 2022 seawater medium coupled with wastewater thus has a chance to replace the traditional chemical freshwater medium for cultivating limnetic microalgae the monosodium glutamate wastewater msgw is a food industry wastewater with characteristics of having high n p concentrations and being free of heavy metals previous studies showed that msgw is a suitable nutrient source for lipid rich species such as golenkinia sp sdec 16 chlorella sp sdec 18 s subsalsa p tricornutum and n oceanica liu et al 2021b jiang et al 2019 yu et al 2022 in particular golenkinia sp sdec 16 produced a lipid productivity of 48 mg l d liu et al 2021b triple the output in bg11 until now however all trials are still at the laboratory scale and sufficient detailed data at the large scale need to be gathered moreover almost all of the previous studies focus only on the metabolite content and the productivity on the day of harvesting for example the freshwater chlorella g 9 cultivated in sewage supplemented with 40 seawater accumulated a biomass of 0 55 g l and a lipid content of 45 after 15 days gao et al 2022 the isolate ri67 3 grown in chemical medium supplemented with 50 seawater obtained a biomass of 0 168 g l and a lipid content of 33 on the 20th day ummalyma et al 2020 however discovering the temporal changes in metabolites the mechanism of salt tolerance in microalgae and the optimal duration of cultivation still need more attention consequently based on the 0 08 g l biomass and 48 mg l d lipid productivity achieved by golenkinia sdec 16 in the previous laboratory scale trials this study was designed to support and validate the feasibility of using a seawater based medium for pilot scale cultivation of sdec 16 the aims of this study were 1 to optimize the cylindrical photobioreactors 2 to evaluate the growth and metabolism of golenkinia sp sdec 16 grown in s msgw in this system and 3 to establish a 1000 l algal cultivation system and analyse its carbon reduction and economic benefits 2 material and methods 2 1 algal strains and medium the microalga golenkinia sp sdec 16 accession no kt180320 was used in this study as it was proven to have an excellent performance in a seawater based medium liu et al 2021b the s msgw was composed of 0 1 msgw from a gourmet powder factory in shandong china and 99 9 natural seawater collected from qingdao china in which the concentration of total nitrogen tn was 323 9 mg l total phosphorous tp was 5 8 mg l and ammonia nitrogen nh3 n was 113 1 mg l for the preparation stage the microalgae were cultured with sterile bg11 in 3 l photobioreactors 25 c 120 μmol m2 s of continuous illumination from daylight fluorescent tubes when microalgae entered the logarithmic phase of growth the algal liquid was centrifuged at 5000 rpm and 4 c and then re suspended with s msgw 2 2 design of the experiments 2 2 1 optimization of pbrs three diameters of the pbrs namely 0 1 m 0 2 m and 0 3 m were selected as candidates according to the general application in laboratory and industry the height was designed to be 2 m to maximize the site space the medium was pumped through the top pipelines the bottom was conical with an aeration pipe and scupper for integration of algal cultivation and harvesting upon reaching the stationary phase of growth the aeration was stopped and the contents of the bioreactors were allowed to stand for about 12 h after the microalgae self settled down to the bottom the pump was set up to transfer the concentrated algal liquid to harvest tank for harvesting optimization of diameter was based on the data of algal growth in s msgw 2 2 2 algal growth and metabolites in the optimized pbrs the time courses of growth pigments and metabolites content of sdec 16 grown in the optimized pbrs were all characterized four culture groups were selected 1 s msgw seawater supplemented with msgw at a ratio of 1 1000 2 f msgw freshwater supplemented with msgw at a ratio of 1 1000 3 s bg11 seawater based bg11 and 4 f bg11 freshwater based bg11 at the beginning the algal seeds were added to the pbrs filled with the medium with an initial biomass concentration of 0 2 0 3 g l aeration was provided by an air pump with a flow rate of 2 0 2 5 l min through a 0 22 μm filter membrane when microalgae grew to the stationary phase the aeration was stopped and after 12 hours sedimentation cells were harvested by the bottom scupper the concentrated algal liquid was transferred to the harvest tank and centrifuged to harvest the algal sludge which was then freeze dried for assessment all experimental groups were set up independently in triplicate 2 2 3 establishment of a 1000 l system in this study a pilot scale microalgal cultivation plant was constructed consisted of a light source an algal cultivation system an aeration system and a harvest system fig 1 unilateral continuous illumination with 120 μmol m2 s light intensity was provided by 60 daylight fluorescent tubes 10 w each for the algal cultivation system 20 optimized pbrs with 1000 l of total volume were simultaneously operated under the condition of 25 27 c and 2 0 l min air aeration the aeration system comprised an air pump 1 5 kw branch pipes and gas flowmeters a 50 l tank was prepared for receiving the concentrated algal liquid after sedimentation 2 3 analysis of microalgae 2 3 1 determination of microalgal growth the algal growth was charactered by dry biomass mass d b m g l and cell count cells l the cell count was conducted under an optical microscope bx53 olympus dbm was assessed by a gravimetric method 20 ml of algal

as the basic model which expressions are as follows 12 i i 0 4 α 1 1 α 1 2 e α 2 1 α 1 2 e α 2 where α 1 and α 2 are calculated as 13 α 1 e a e a e s 14 α 2 e a e s α 1 dbm l where i 0 and i μmol m2 s are the intensities of the incident and emitted light entering and exiting the algal medium respectively d b m is the biomass concentration of microalgae here for sdec 16 l is the light path in the pbrs and e a and e s m2 g are the mass absorption coefficient and scattering coefficient of the microalgae respectively firstly the value of i was measured based on the medium with different biomass concentration 100 2000 mg l and i 0 was set as 120 μmol m2 s origin 9 1 software was used for fitting the curve of the cornet model to calculate the e a and e s finally the average light intensity in the pbrs with the changes in biomass concentration was calculated based on the fitted curve and average light path l 15 l 1 π d sin θ d θ where d is the diameter of the pbrs 2 3 5 analysis of fatty acid methyl ester fame profiles the fatty acid fa from microalgal biomass of each culture group was extracted by a two step in situ process and the fame profiles were then analysed through the method of gc ms according to the previous study song et al 2013 which are shown in text s3 2 3 6 analysis of biodiesel properties the properties of biodiesel from algal biomass of each group were calculated based on the fame profiles according to the prediction and evaluation model proposed in the previous study song et al 2013 hoekman et al 2012 the equations between average degree of unsaturation a d u

benefits the economic benefits of this system were calculated and expressed as the inputs outputs and output to input ratio oir which are detailed in text s4 2 4 2 carbon reduction the advantage of microalgae over higher plants is their excellent carbon sequestration efficiency which theoretically is 1 8 g co2 g biomass wijffels and barbosa 2010 the carbon reduction of this system was therefore based on the microalgal growth the majority of the total input was from electrical energy so the carbon reduction was also assessed for the condition of solar energy being used to generate electricity to power the system 2 5 calculations on the photovoltaic system 2 5 1 daily electricity demand δ w s daily electricity demand of the system was considered to be the summation of the electricity

pbrs three diameters of the pbrs were investigated in this study fig 2 microalgae in the pbrs experienced a one day lag phase fig 2a showing their adaptive process when shifted from the f bg11 to s msgw the subsequent rapid growth of golenkinia sp sdec 16 showed their excellent tolerance to high salinity proven in detail previously liu et al 2021b after the ten day cultivation microalgae reached the stationary phase achieving maximum biomass concentrations of 2 49 2 34 and 1 49 g l for 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m diameters respectively considering the volume the biomass production was 39 09 g 0 1 m 146 95 g 0 2 m and 139 18 g 0 3 m respectively the optimal diameter was thus found to be 0 2 m for 0 3 m diameter the biomass productivity quickly declined from the 3rd day fig 2b the maximum dbp values for diameters of 0 1 and 0 2 m were 0 32 and 0 30 g l d respectively both occurring on the 6th day light intensity plays a vital role in algal growth patel et al 2019 large bioreactor size means long distances for light to traverse and the differences in algal growth seen in pbrs with different diameters may be mainly caused by light attenuation therefore the changes in light attenuation were assessed fig 3 in the same pbr the light intensity exponentially decayed with the increase of biomass concentration while in pbrs with different diameters the longer the path the light traversed the more rapidly the light was attenuated the curves fit to the light attenuation data from different pbrs indicate that the absorption e a and scattering e a coefficients were 0 034 and 0 087 m2 g respectively so the cornet model in the different column pbrs could be expressed as in fig 3b because of the normal incidence of the parallel light from the side the average light paths l were 0 064 0 127 and 0 191 m for the 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m diameter pbrs respectively fig 3c indicate that during the initial stage the average light intensities in the 0 1 m and 0 2 m diameter pbrs were higher than that in the 0 3 m diameter pbr wherein after passing through the 0 3 m pbr the light with 6000 lux incident intensity had decayed about 50 the inadequate light may be one of the main limitations leading to the low biomass concentration in the pbr of 0 3 m diameter 3 2 the growth characteristics of sdec 16 in optimized photobioreactors the growth characteristics in all systems were assessed in the photobioreactors with 0 2 m diameter the maximum biomass of sdec 16 in s msgw was 2 08 g l about 86 of the 2 43 g l obtained in f bg11 medium showing that the high salinity in seawater had no significant inhibition effect on the algal growth while s bg11 had an inhibition effect fig 4 msgw a kind of wastewater formed after bacterial fermentation for monosodium glutamate production contains large amounts of residual nutrients vitamins and amino acids which had important positive effects on the algal growth the maximum biomass productivity was 0 26 g l d which occurred on the 3rd day and was about 87 of that obtained in f bg11 on the 6th day 0 30 g l d the specific growth rate μ in all systems initially increased during the first 2 to 3 days and then slowly decreased the peak in μ for s msgw was 0 42 d 1 which was similar to the 0 4 d 1 achieved in f bg11 for the cell counts the peak values were 95 7 78 3 53 7 and 27 3 108 cells l for f bg11 f msgw s msgw and s bg11 respectively unlike biomass concentration the cell counts of sdec 16 in freshwater systems were significantly higher than those in seawater systems especially for msgw as the nutrient source the biomass concentration in s msgw was higher than that in f msgw but the cell count showed the reverse trend the changes in the mass of individual cells were monitored showing that the high salinity in s msgw stimulated accumulation of metabolites leading to an increment in the mass of individual cells after the algal seed was inoculated into the seawater medium the mass of a single cell sharply increased from 0 2 to 0 4 ng cell within 2 days of the lag phase in the growth of microalgae in contrast for the freshwater medium the increase from 0 2 to 0 3 ng cell occurred after the 6th day during the late exponential or stationary growth phase of microalgae fig 4e under saline condition in the seawater microalgae accumulated compatible solutes to respond to the initial change in osmotic pressure while in the freshwater medium accumulation of metabolites occurred when microalgae faced with the stress of self shadowing or nutrient deficiency previous studies demonstrated that metabolite accumulation is a general pathway for microalgae to resist high salinity for example scenedesmus dimorphus cells accumulated lipid when faced with 160 mm nacl gour et al 2020 the lipid content in parachlorella kessleri cells increased from 31 to 51 after 7 day exposure to 350 mm nacl and the protein content decreased from 26 8 to 17 1 you et al 2019 in order to ascertain the synthesis of lipids carbohydrates and proteins their contents and productivities as functions of culture time were further analysed 3 3 accumulation of metabolites the content of the metabolites in f bg11 remained relatively stable fig 5 in s msgw the lipid content was stable in the range of 25 30 during the first 3 days but sharply increased in the subsequent 2 days and then slightly increased with cultivation time the maximum lipid content of sdec 16 in s msgw was 60 5 which is 2 4 times higher than the 25 6 achieved in f bg11 for carbohydrate content the trend in s msgw was completely opposite to the lipid content within 3 days after seed inoculation the carbohydrate content rapidly rose from 31 8 to 50 1 then swiftly dropped to 17 5 on the 6th day and finally ended up fluctuating around about 10 which represented a significant decrease compared to the level in f bg11 26 6 several studies considered the lipid to be a compatible solute to balance the osmotic pressure for example the glycerol content in dunaliella salina quickly increased within 1 to 3 h and then gradually obtained its peak level after 24 h when the salinity changed from 1 to 3 m zhao et al 2013 for golenkinia sp sdec 16 however when shifting from freshwater to seawater the lipid content remained low but the carbohydrate content massively increased which indicates that the carbohydrates rather than the lipids were the early osmotic protectants following the initial switching to the saline environment a similar phenomenon happened with some cyanobacteria for which a rough correlation was found between the kind level of the accumulated compatible solutes and the level of salinity exposed luo et al 2022 the known halotolerant model microalga synechocystis sp rapidly and massively accumulated trehalose glucosylglycerol and sucrose in salt shocked cells oren 2015 moreover it was also reported that there was a strong exchange of carbon between the different compatible solutes during the early and late salt stress kirsch et al 2019 in this study the opposite trends for carbohydrates and lipids indicated that golenkinia sp sdec 16 accumulated large amounts of carbohydrate during the onset of adaptation when shocked by high salinity and then when it entered the late adaptive phase the algal cells converted the energy storage compounds from carbohydrate to lipid allowing the lipid content to significantly increase in the stationary phase of salt exposure hence for golenkinia sp sdec 16 carbohydrate synthesis formed the short term adaptation process to the salt and the cells accumulated adequate lipid after long term salt acclimatisation regarding the changes in the protein content in s msgw fig 5c there was also a slight increase from 19 3 to 24 9 within the first 3 days followed by a return to normal levels which was also due to the processes of adaptation to the salt environment it has been demonstrated that na ions moved inside the algal cells within a few seconds and were then exported to the surrounding medium through the corresponding translocators including h na h and na k antiporters to maintain homoeostasis nitschmann and packer 1992 katz et al 1991 iwano 1995 the increase in protein content thus reflected the second approach of golenkinia sp to tolerate the high salinity in s msgw according to fig 5d the metabolic activity had changed to the lipid dominated approach on the 10th day which however did not occur in the freshwater based medium showing the decisive role of salinity in changing the metabolism the lipid productivity in s msgw 98 99 mg l d was significantly higher than that in f bg11 48 94 mg l d but the carbohydrate accumulation was significantly lower fig 5e taking all of the above into account there were two pathways for golenkinia sp to resist the salty condition as follows 1 within the first few days after being shocked by high salinity golenkinia sp immediately synthesized carbohydrate which would be converted to the lipid dominated metabolism after long term salt acclimatisation the appearance of a large amount of lipid in the cells marked the end of the salt resistance process 2 golenkinia sp responded rapidly to start up the protein synthesis system to produce some antiporters to export the intracellular na and maintained homoeostasis protecting the algal cells from damage due to hyperosmolarity 3 4 analysis of fa profiles and biodiesel properties besides the lipid content and productivity the fa profiles are also vital for production of microalga based biodiesel as shown in fig 6 the fa profiles of golenkinia sdec 16 in seawater were similar to those in freshwater medium the c16 c18 fatty acids that are suitable for biodiesel occupied more than 95 of the total fame for all groups especially for the s msgw group 98 indicating that the fatty acid from golenkinia sdec 16 in s msgw is the good candidate for biodiesel production the properties of biodiesel depended on the fa profiles and the predictions and models between fa profiles and some important properties of biodiesel have established for convenient assessment of biodiesel properties song et al 2013 hoekman et al 2012 for all cases the pufa dominated the fa profiles of sdec 16 and the average degree of unsaturation adu of the biodiesel ranged from 1 6 1 8 showing its satisfactory low temperature fluidity for other properties ν k ρ c p c n i v and h h v table 1 all met the demand of the biodiesel standard including chn gb t 20828 t zzb 2614 us astm d6751 and is 15607 which indicated that the salt environment in s msgw would not pose adverse effects on the biodiesel properties therefore using s msgw for cultivating freshwater golenkinia sdec 16 is a promising technology for microalga based biodiesel production 3 5 changes in photosynthesis the photosynthetic pigment content directly reflects the viability of cell photosynthesis and the degree of cellular damage golenkinia sp synthesized large amounts of chlorophyll in the freshwater media 33 44 mg l in f bg11 and 25 74 mg l in f msg compared to the large accumulation of carotenoid 3 31 mg l in s msgw under the saline conditions in the seawater fig 7 carotenoids are a vital part of the cell s protective mechanism and are able to counteract reactive oxygen species ros thereby avoiding lipid peroxidation and protecting the integrity and function of the photosynthetic apparatus gong and bassi 2016 carotenoids accounted for 17 48 and 18 09 of the total pigments in s bg11 and s msgw respectively fig 7b yet in the freshwater medium the ratio of carotenoids to total pigments was only 6 07 in f bg11 and 9 44 in f msgw the significant difference indicates that sdec 16 accumulated carotenoids as a defence against high salinity it should be especially noted that the total pigment contents were related to the biomass concentration so they were not able to reflect the intracellular changes in pigment synthesis and hence the mean carotenoid content of an individual cell was calculated as in fig 7c after inoculation the mean carotenoid contents of sdec 16 in s bg11and s msgw rapidly increased and then peaked 8 50 and 7 58 10 4 ng cell respectively within 4 to 6 days which were 2 6 and 1 9 times higher than for f bg11and f msg respectively saline condition stimulated the algal cells to form large amounts of ros which can oxidize the intracellular structure pancha et al 2015 it has been reported in the higher plants that carotenoids functioned as the first defensive line against singlet o2 ramel et al 2012 the fast synthesis and accumulation of carotenoids at the beginning thus served as sdec 16 s first line of defence to resist the oxidative damage caused by the high salinity the changes in the ratio of chl a chl b fig 7d in the seawater medium showed a lag phase during the first 4 5 days and the ratios promptly rose to about 3 6 and 3 7 in s bg11 and s msgw for freshwater medium chl a chl b remained relatively stable at 2 6 2 8 the clear lag phase of chl a chl b indicates that the microalgae were adapting to the adverse saline conditions and the subsequent sharp increase indicates a reduction in the rate of photophosphorylation during electron transfer srivastava et al 2017 caro chl in seawater quickly increased after the salt shock fig 7e showing the higher rate of carotenoid synthesis than that for chlorophyll 3 6 establishment of a 1000 l algal cultivation system 3 6 1 design and performance of the pilot scale system after optimizing the bioreactors and ascertaining the metabolic behaviour of golenkinia sdec 16 in s msgw this study further established a 1000 l algal cultivation system to bring the promising technology closer to practical application each photobioreactor constituted one basic module and 20 independent modules were simultaneously operated for growing microalgae the pre prepared s msgw in a tank was pumped into the module through the cover another injection port was designed for adding algal broth and was kept airtight during the cultivation period according to figs 2 and 4 the algal growth tended to be stable on the 7th day in this system we therefore set the culture period as 7 days which meant that this system would harvest 284 3 and 161 4 mg l d of algal biomass and lipid using s msgw respectively compared with other microalgae in large scale cultivation qurat ul ain et al 2022 hoeniges et al 2022 vadiveloo et al 2022 díez montero et al 2020 chi et al 2022 kumar et al 2019 park et al 2019 pereira et al 2018 wen et al 2016 pegallapati et al 2013 peng et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 arbib et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 biondi et al 2013 peter et al 2022 the biomass and lipid productivity of golenkinia sp sdec 16 were in the lead position table 2 during industrial cultivation of graesiella sp in bg11 in a 40 000 l open raceway pond orp only 6 2 and 2 1 mg l d of biomass and lipid productivity were obtained upon harvesting even while sparging with pure co2 wen et al 2016 in a 14 000 l column pbr the biomass productivity of chlorella vulgaris was 42 86 mg l d in bg11 medium with pure co2 aeration peter et al 2022 ascochloris sp in 480 l semi cylindrical pbrs yielded biomass and lipid productivities of 207 and 72 mg l d in raw dairy wastewater aerated by air in terms of seawater based media nannochloropsis sp exhibited high biomass and lipid productivity 330 and 110 mg l d respectively in guillard s f medium aerated by pure co2 biondi et al 2013 hence the biomass and lipid productivity were species dependant and pure co2 was not able to enhance the algal growth because of the possible toxicity of high levels of co2 to microalgae it was reported that co2 higher than 10 would inhibit the growth of microalgae ramos ibarra et al 2019 moreover pure co2 will greatly increase the cost of algal cultivation and pose the risk of leakage if excessive consequently air aeration is recommended for practical production an additional concern is that how to treat the wastewater after algal cultivation although it would contain a lot of organics excreted by microalgae as well as unconsumed nutrients from the original medium in our study the residual liquid in the pbrs was recycled after the addition of phosphorous or msgw data not published which avoided discharging the wastewater into the environment 3 6 2 carbon economic analysis the economic benefit of the established system was expressed as the output to input ratio oir the inputs originated from three parts algal cultivation harvesting drying lipid extraction and transesterification and each part was in turn composed of electricity and chemicals shown in fig 8 s msgw was composed of the natural seawater and msgw so that the medium cost was negligible and the price of f bg11 medium was 29 22 tonne in our previous study f bg11 was recycled twice and the biomass concentration clearly decreased in the thrice recycled medium with the assumption of recycling the medium twice 16 days as one cycle for calculations the cost of the chemical medium would be 667 year growing sdec 16 in s msgw can hence greatly reduce the culture inputs during industrial production the electricity consumption during algal cultivation was mainly from the light and aeration systems in which 60 lamps 10 w for each one and an aeration pump 1 5 kw worked continuously every day and so the total electrical cost was 1472 year for harvesting and drying the cost of electricity from centrifugation and freeze drying was 70 year for lipid extraction the cost included electricity ultrasound and centrifugation chemicals chloroform methanol and nacl and nitrogen gas in the actual extraction process the ratio of algal powder to extracting solution was used in a ratio of 1 10 g ml and 80 of the evaporated solutions were recycled so the chemicals costs were 51 year for transesterification lipases for catalysis have been widely applied in industry due to its low cost and less pollution compared to traditional acid or base catalyst herein the costs were estimated based on the method of lipases which were mainly from lipases methanol and electricity the recovery efficiency of the immobilized enzymes and methanol can reach 50 and 80 respectively so the cost of transesterification was 20 year m3 pbr the contributions to the inputs at different stages are shown in fig 8 it was found that the cultivation inputs occupied the majority of the total cost and electricity was the largest component for all cases in case of using solar energy as the power the input costs for biodiesel production would only be 2 7 kg in total for the purpose of algal biomass production the input costs of this algal system using s msgw as the medium would be 1542 year m3 pbr and would be 1635 year m3 pbr for the purpose of biodiesel production compared to the input costs for f bg11 these values would be 2231 and 2302 year m3 pbr showing that this technology would reduce about 30 of the total input for algal biomass and biodiesel production if using solar energy as the power the input costs would only be 92 year m3 pbr for biomass production and 163 year m3 pbr for biodiesel production therefore the total input cost would be 0 7 kg biomass for biomass production and 2 7 kg biodiesel for biodiesel production in addition previous study showed that seawater made the cell walls of microalgae fragile and the extraction efficiency of lipid was increased by 30 40 pei et al 2022 so the cost for biodiesel production would be finally estimated to be 2 2 kg biodiesel the outputs depend on the price of biodiesel and powdered biomass for biodiesel production though the recent price of biodiesel only ranges from 1 3 1 5 kg biodiesel lower than 2 2 kg in this system some by products during transesterification such as crude glycerine with the price of 0 5 1 5 kg glycerine according to its content can partly compensate the gap moreover the post extracted algal residues can also be multiply applied such as anaerobic fermentation for biogas production to further enhance the economic feasibility for biomass production because this algal powder of golenkinia sdec 16 was not commercialised yet the output was estimated according to the current prices 5 100 kg biomass of some commercialised microalgae such as chlorella spirulina euglena and haematococcus pluvialis based on this we specified a price of 50 kg biomass for which the output of our system would yield 5188 or 6179 year m3 pbr for s msgw or bg11 respectively therefore the oir for s msgw was 3 4 higher than the 2 8 estimated for bg11 for the photovoltaic system it comprises an inverter accumulator batteries and photovoltaic panels the required power and daily electricity demand of the light and aeration systems combined were 2100 w and 50 4 kwh respectively a high quality inverter is rated at more than 95 efficiency and we specified 95 here so the total power of the photovoltaic system p t would be 2210 w for the accumulator battery the common type of 300 ah 12v was selected and the depth of discharge dod was taken as 70 so the accumulator battery capacity c a p b and required input of electricity would be 6000 ah and 72 kwh respectively meaning that 20 units of the selected accumulator battery would be enough the output power of a photovoltaic system is related to the local daily sunshine duration which varied from 5 51 to 6 78 h in shandong china from 2014 to 2019 according to the shandong meteorological bureau http sd cma gov cn considering the power efficiency of the panels during electricity generation η p being generally 70 the output power p o would be 15 2 18 7 kw if the power density of sunlight and the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the panels were taken as 1000 w m2 and 16 respectively the power density would be 160 w m2 the required area then becomes 95 117 m2 which would result in a final specification of 120 m2 for actual construction in addition to the economic promise golenkinia sdec 16 achieved the maximum biomass concentrations of 1 99 within 7 days in s msgw corresponding to 103 76 kg of annual biomass production the established algal system would hence capture 186 77 kg co2 y m3 pbr within the sdec 16 biomass grown in s msgw 3 7 issues to focus on for practical implementation 3 7 1 wastewater recycling the treatment of wastewater from algal cultivation in seawater is a considerable issue due to its excessive salinity for common bacterial species used in wastewater treatment which needs to be considered more carefully recycling the wastewater after harvesting will reduce the discharge and the water demand for growth medium in this study the final contents of tn and tp were 201 6 and 0 2 mg l in s msgw achieving tn and tp removal efficiencies of 37 8 and 96 6 respectively the algal growth may consequently be limited by phosphorous and the key issue arising in recycling the medium was to supply with phosphorous in other studies tn and tp removal efficiencies greatly varied between 34 79 and 66 100 respectively for different microalgae including phaeodactylum tricornutum nannochloropsis oceanica and spirulina subsalsa vadiveloo et al 2022 díez montero et al 2020 therefore for effective recycling the wastewater the kinetics of n p assimilation should be established for different algal species microalgae excrete extracellular polymeric substances eps during their growth especially under high salinity yu et al 2020 the feasibility of wastewater recycling is a priority and needs detailed research to discover the eps excreted in seawater based medium and their effects on the algal growth 3 7 2 nutrient source selection wastewater selection is another important issue that needs to be discussed several studies focused only on culturing microalgae with wastewater amongst which the relatively mild domestic wastewater was preferred the high load industrial wastewater was undesirable because it generally needs large amounts of water to be diluted and contains heavy metals and toxic organics high ammonia and an imbalanced ratio of n p often reduce the biomass concentration the msgw is characterized as having a high level of nutrients and being free of heavy metals toxic organics its benefits for algal growth and metabolism have been demonstrated previously no matter whether in seawater or freshwater liu et al 2021 jiang et al 2019 consequently when considering wastewater based nutrients biotoxicity to microalgae must be tested to ensure survival of microalgae wastewater selection should also be based on the local economic and industrial conditions for easy collection and transportation 3 7 3 device development mariculture cannot exist without the topic of corrosion due to the high concentration of chloride ions especially in the oxygen enriched environments supporting algal photosynthesis though the core vessel of the bioreactor is made of glass or organic glass parts of the pipelines elbows or subsequent harvest devices are probably built with stainless steel so periodic cleaning and maintenance need to be conducted use of corrosion resistant plastics and highly passivated stainless steel is strongly recommended in summary while this study successfully established a large scale algal cultivation system based on s msgw and simultaneously achieved carbon reduction and algal biomass production the system is still faced with the above questions some aspects including bioreactor design environmental biological engineering and material science also need deeper multidisciplinary cooperation to make this system more practical and efficient 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that in the established pilot scale algal cultivation system golenkinia sp sdec 16 obtained a similar biomass productivity 0 26 g l d and a doubled lipid productivity 98 99 mg l d compared to bg11 medium carbohydrate content greatly increased following the initial salt shock but the carbohydrate contribution in metabolite percentage became less in favour of lipid production the fa profiles in s msgw were rich in c16 c18 98 and the biodiesel properties also met the biodiesel standards the mean carotenoid content in single cells was 7 58 10 4 ng cell which was higher than that for bg11 all of the electricity needed by this system can be supplied by 120 m2 of photovoltaic panels our pilot scale algal cultivation system would simultaneously achieve co2 sequestration and algal biomass production declaration of competing interest

15267,several countries including the united states plan to set an enforceable maximum contaminant level for certain per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas in drinking water among the available treatment options sorption by pyrogenic carbonaceous sorbents pcs is a practical and effective approach to remove pfas from water in pilot and full scale applications the two most important properties of pcs surface chemistry and pore structure were tailored in this study to understand their importance in the sorption of various anionic shorter chain and longer chain pfas brief thermal oxidation post pyrolysis air oxidation ppao of pcs including biochars at a moderate temperature 400 c was used to increase specific surface area and nanoporosity the sorption distribution ratio kd of individual pfas after ppao treatment increased by as much as three orders of magnitude compared to the unmodified pcs more effectively so for longer chain than shorter chain compounds pore reaming plays a major role in the sorption enhancement and an ion pair pfas counterions sorption mechanism is proposed in addition irreversible sorption of a quaternary ammonium cationic polymer poly dimethyldiallylammonium chloride pdadmac was employed to reverse the surface charge of biochar coating with pdadmac increased pfas sorption by a factor of 10 3000 predominantly by an anion exchange mechanism sorption enhancement was more effective for the sulfonate than the carboxylate with the same perfluoro chain length the results of this study are expected to inform the design of carbons

shorter chain homologues eu 2020 currently sorption methods using porous materials or ion exchange resins are among the few commercially available means of pfas removal from water in large scale operations belkouteb et al 2020 boyer et al 2021 li et al 2020 zeng et al 2020 at present granular activated carbon gac sorption treatment is a frequently used method in the industry herkert et al 2020 rahman et al 2014 xiao et al 2020 the u s national institute of standards and technology lists approximately 5 000 possible pfas in the database place 2021 many are anionic at typical environmental ph as they bear fully dissociated carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid groups others bear sulfonamide ph dependent negative charge amino ph dependent positive charge or quaternary ammonium permanent positive charge groups or are zwitterionic barzen hanson et al 2017 d agostino and mabury 2014 nickerson et al 2021 xiao et al 2017 sorption of anionic pfas by pyrogenic carbonaceous sorbents pcs is a function of the poly per fluoro chain length due to solvophobic effects hence shorter chain anionic pfas show poorer affinity for pcs zeng et al 2020 sorption to pcs is also influenced by the nature of the terminal anionic group whether carboxylate or sulfonate herkert et al 2020 as carbons typically have little anion exchange capacity the contributions of attractive and repulsive coulombic forces to anionic pfas sorption by carbons are unclear surface chemistry and pore structure are the two most important factors affecting the sorption of legacy organic compounds to gac and other porous pcs xiao et al 2018 the effect of surface chemistry and pore structure on pcs sorption of pfas is poorly known in this study we modified the surface chemistry and pore structure of pcs biochars in an attempt to understand the relative importance of these two factors on sorption of pfas the modifications include nanopore enlargement and incorporation of anion exchange capacity pore enlargement is achieved by briefly exposing the sample to hot air which reams pores by oxidizing away tarry deposits and etching pore walls the consequent increases in specific surface area and porosity lead to greater sorption of both nonpolar and polar compounds xiao and pignatello 2016 yang et al 2021a a preliminary report on the effects of thermal oxidation on pfas removal has appeared wang et al 2022 here we go into greater mechanistic detail additionally anion exchange capacity is introduced by binding a quaternary ammonium cationic polymer poly dimethyldiallylammonium chloride pdadmac a previous study of ours showed that coating an activated carbon with pdadmac accelerated base hydrolysis of sorbed alkyl halides by increasing hydroxide ion sorption hsieh and pignatello 2018 a second study showed that pdadmac coated biochar strongly retained orthophosphate ions wang et al 2020 a limited number of studies have reported using pdadmac to assist removal of pfas compounds aly et al 2019 injected pdadmac or another cationic polymer polyamine directly into vessels or columns of aquifer solids and observed sorption enhancement of several anionic pfas by up to 6 fold they suggested that the anion exchange capacity of the aquifer solids bestowed by the pdadmac coating contributed to pfas sorption enhancement liu et al 2020 found benefits of injecting pdadmac along with powdered activated carbon into batch and column aquifer solids for purposes of stabilizing the carbon suspension however they did not test whether pdadmac affected the sorption capacity or affinity of powdered activated carbon for pfas while the present manuscript was being prepared ramos et al 2022 reported that pdadmac coated filtrasorb 400 gac showed increased sorption capacity relative to the untreated gac by about 7 14 for pfbs pfhxs pfos and pfos and about 38 for pfba at 0 02 m ionic strength these values apparently represent capacities at very high concentrations percent levels by weight not affinities at environmentally realistic concentrations we too found only small changes in sorption of pfas with a pdadmac coated gac data not shown here we show that hot air treatment and cationic polymer coating separately and through different mechanisms increase sorption of anionic pfas to biochars made from woody feedstock by up to 1000 fold to our best knowledge this is a pioneering study that endows biochar with much higher pfas sorption affinity the findings of this study will facilitate the design of appropriate pcs for pfas removal from water 2 materials and methods 2 1 sorbent preparation and characterization from the porous pcs family we selected biochar as a candidate because of its cost effectiveness and the ready availability of feedstocks the pcs biochars were prepared by pyrolyzing softwood shavings mixed species at 300 400 500 or 600 c for 2 h under n2 flow wang et al 2020 the samples are named swxxx where sw is softwood feedstock and xxx the temperature portions were subjected to post pyrolysis air oxidation ppao by placing them contained in open 60 ml glass vials 0 10 g per vial into a muffle furnace at 400 c for 30 min in air yang et al 2021b the ppao treated products are named with the appendage ppao another portion of sw500 was coated with pdadmac sigma by equilibrating the raw biochar with a pdadmac solution and thoroughly rinsing the collected solid hsieh and pignatello 2018 it was labelled as sw500 pd previously we found that pdadmac sorption on an activated carbon was essentially irreversible hsieh and pignatello 2018 and the coated amount was 23 1 mg pdadmac per gram sw500 pd wang et al 2020 a portion of sw500 was first ppao treated and then coated with pdadmac this sample was labelled sw500 ppao pd gas

was measured using a malvern zetasizer nano zs90 data on elemental and physical properties reported previously wang et al 2022 wang et al 2020 are gathered in table s1 of the supplementary materials

except for genx and pfhpa which were from fisher scientific solutions were prepared in ultrapure water containing 1 mm nacl and buffered at ph 7 4 with 1 mm nahco3 ppao series and their controls or at ph 7 0 with 3 mm phosphate pd series and their controls the ppao series except for sw500 ppao were equilibrated with pfas mixtures sometimes including just the shorter chain compounds or the longer chain compounds the adsorption experiments with ppao series biochars were performed at the university of north dakoda the pd series were equilibrated with individual solutes pfpea pfna pfbs or pfos and the adsorption experiments were conducted at the connecticut agricultural experiment station our objective was to study pfas sorption mechanisms with biochars modified with two different methods not to compare the two nevertheless we appraised the sorption performance of sw500 ppao sw500 pd and sw500 ppao pd in the presence of 3 mm phosphate to compare the two treatments under the same conditions and to determine whether the two treatments performed on the same sample are additive see results in section 3 2 sorption was performed by placing 100 500 mg unmodified or modified biochar in contact with 10 15 or 25 ml pfas solution unless otherwise specified in 50 ml sterile polypropylene vials at prescribed initial pfas concentrations 0 0687 8 53 μm the vials were shaken end over end at 22 c for 2 4 or 14 days the aqueous phase was filtered through a 0 45 μm nylon membrane for analysis controls were prepared in the biocide added test solution sorbent free controls were spiked with a pfas at the same initial dose as in the corresponding test vials these control samples were manipulated in the same manner as test samples the sorbed level q μmol g was computed by subtracting the concentration in the test vial c aq μm from that in the corresponding control vial and then normalizing for the sorbent mass in the test vial the distribution ratio kd l kg 1 is defined as the ratio of sorbed concentration μg kg 1 to the solution concentration in the test vials sorption isotherms were fit to the freundlich model 1 q k f c aq n where kf is the affinity coefficient and n is the linearity exponent the kf and n were obtained by linear regression of the log transformed expression of eq 1 the kf equals the solid to solution distribution ratio kd l kg 1 at unit dissolved

are given in text s1 and tables s2 and s3 of the supplementary materials section 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of thermal oxidation on sorption an increase in pyrolysis temperature resulted in a decrease in o c 0 250 to 0 0553 decrease in h c 0 785 to 0 251 and increase in co2 specific surface area co2 ssa 219 to 698 m2 g of the unmodified biochar samples table s1 these trends are consistent with those of many other studies and reflect the progressive conversion of biochar to a more condensed aromatic structure budarin et al 2006 keiluweit et al 2010 pore reaming by ppao treatment as addressed in detail previously xiao and pignatello 2016 yang et al 2021a was confirmed by the increases in co2 pore volume and co2 ssa fig s1 and table s1 the increase in o c and the decrease in h c table s1 previous work found that ppao increased acidic functionality specifically carboxyl groups xiao and pignatello 2016 yang et al 2021a table 1 lists the single point 2 day kd values for individual pfas in a pfas mixture for samples before and after ppao treatment differences in pfas uptake between the 2 day and 14 day contact times were small and showed no trend samples pyrolyzed at 600 c sw600 and sw600 ppao showed correspondingly greater kd values than those pyrolyzed at lower temperatures consistent with their larger co2 ssa and porosity table s1 table 1 reveals that ppao treatment results in up to 103 fold increase in kd additional data were presented in the preliminary report wang et al 2022 the difference in log kd between the ppao treated and unmodified 600 c biochar which is proportional to the difference in sorption free energy could be computed for some compounds fig 1 shows that δlog kd tends to be smaller for shorter chain than for longer chain pfas our previous report noted that longer chain pfas are noticeably competitive against shorter chain pfas for sorption sites wang et al 2022 xiao et al 2011 3 2 effects of pdadmac treatment on sorption several researchers have emphasized the importance of pcs surface chemistry on sorption of pfas chen et al 2021 pauletto and bandosz 2022 wu et al 2020 zhi and liu 2015 zhou et al 2021 for example zhi and liu state that electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged carbon surface and pfas anions resulted in low sorption zhi and liu 2015 in this study sorption of pdadmac to carbons leads to charge reversal this is shown here by the experiment in fig 2 where addition of increasing amounts of pdadmac to an aqueous suspension of sw500 particles at ph 7 0 causes the zeta potential to progressively shift from 51 mv to 7 5 mv fig 3a b reveal that pdadmac coated biochar sw500 pd more effectively removes micromolar concentrations of pfna or pfos from solution than its uncoated counterpart sw500 furthermore sw500 pd more effectively removes pfos than pfna which have the same perfluorocarbon chain length 8 the shorter chain compounds pfbs and pfpea are much less effectively removed by sw500 pd than are the longer chain compounds pfos and pfna while the order sulfonate carboxylate for the same perfluorocarbon chain length 4 in this case is maintained fig 3c the shorter chain carboxylate pfpea is not noticeably sorbed by suspensions of sw500 pd up to 14 g sw500 pd l neither of the shorter chain compounds were appreciably sorbed by sw500 even at 8 g sw500 l not shown wesuppose that sorption of the shorter chain pfas would be inhibited in the presence of the longer chain as sw500 pd has higher affinity to the longer chain but this remains to be tested sorption of pfos or pfna increases as the amount of pdadmac added to the aqueous suspension of sw500 increases fig 4a or c respectively and the sorbed concentration in each case correlates with the zeta potential of the suspended particles fig 4b or 4d respectively these results indicate that sorption is a function of surface negative charge balance and the introduction of positively charged sites by pdadmac the isotherms on sw500 pd in fig 5 show that pfos sorption is more nonlinear and favorable than pfna sorption the freundlich n are 0 344 and 0 465 respectively and the kd i e kf at c aq 1 μm are 1204 and 714 l kg 1 respectively the isotherms in fig 5 also reveal that the difference between the sulfonate and the carboxylate for the same chain length diminishes as concentration increases it is possible that the kd for the pdadmac coated biochars are minimum values since the buffer ion phosphate present in large molar excess over the pfas compounds binds strongly to pdadmac coated biochar wang et al 2020 and may have been competitive competition is supported by the following with phosphate pfbs and pfpea did not show evidence of sorption to sw500 nor did pfpea to sw500 pd fig 3c yet without phosphate both pfbs and pfpea sorb to sw300 sw400 and sw600 albeit moderately table 1 the competitive effect of phosphate has also been observed on other materials including powdered activated carbon qian et al 2017 anion exchange resin boyer et al 2021 and ferrihydrite campos pereira et al 2020 it is possible that pdadmac blocks some pores the co2 ssas of sw500 and sw500 pd 579 and 571 m2 g respectively table s1 are quite close suggesting at first that it does not however co2 may not well represent pfas access because it is a much smaller molecule in addition gas porosimetry is carried out in the absence of water molecules which can assist pore obstruction by clustering around charged sites on the pdadmac strands nevertheless pdadmac coating greatly increases pfas sorption despite possible pore blockage single solute experiments on pfna and pfos sought to compare the effectiveness of thermal oxidation and quaternary ammonium derivatization i e sw500 ppao vs sw500 pd and to determine whether the two treatments are additive fig 6 shows that at ph 7 0 in 3 mm phosphate buffer quaternary ammonium derivatization is slightly more effective than thermal oxidation under the same conditions all in the presence of phosphate however the two treatments do not appear to be additive as the curves for sw500 pd and sw500 ppao pd practically overlap see explanations in mechanisms section table 2 compares the results of the present study with past attempts to increase pfas capacity or affinity by modification of psc physico chemical properties treatment of a mixture of coffee grounds biochar with 1 1 koh treatment item 1 resulted in a 286 fold increase in specific surface area and an increase in pfos langmuir capacity from negligible to 4 3 by weight steigerwald and ray 2021 saeidi et al 2021 treated activated carbon felts at 900 c under 5 h2 in n2 item 6 and observed up to three orders of magnitude increase in pfas sorption they ascribed enhancement to a reduction in surface polarity by removal of oxygen containing groups by h2 they also advocated method optimization for safety reasons due to h2 usage saeidi et al 2021 other attempts to enhance sorption by surface modification items 3 5 7 8 have been much less successful resulting in enhancement less than a factor of about 2 clearly regarding pfas removal from water the enhancement effect in this study is competitive if not superior to other modification methods of carbons or biochars table 2 notably we achieved the sorption enhancement at much milder conditions e g air thermal treatment at 400 c for 30 min 3 3 mechanisms for both the pfca and pfsa series kd increases as a function of perfluorocarbon chain length due to increasing solvophobicity and dispersion forces that the perfluorinated chain is capable of engaging in at the interface gregor et al 1955 park et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 for a given chain length the sulfonates sorb more strongly than the carboxylates consistent with previously reported trends in sorption to activated carbons herkert et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2017 and chromatographic retention time on ion exchange resins gregor et al 1955 as all test compounds are fully ionized under the conditions i e pka 1 goss 2008 goss and arp 2009 the preference of sulfonate over carboxylate reflects the difference in group properties of the charged so3 vs co2 units charge delocalization is greater in the sulfonate ion than the carboxylate ion leading to weaker solvation dispersion interactions with the surface are more favorable for the sulfonate as well since dispersion is proportional to polarizability and the sum of the ground state atomic polarizabilities lide 2004 of the so3 unit 5 31 10 24 cm3 exceeds that of the co2 unit 3 36 10 24 cm3 ppao treatment results in up to 1000 fold increase in sorption of pfas compounds table 1 sorption enhancement by ppao treatment has been observed for other non fluorinated carboxylic acids as well as neutral polar and nonpolar compounds xiao and pignatello 2016 yang et al 2021a ppao treatment frees up additional surface area and the space of both micropores and mesopores table s1 for incoming pfas molecules pore reaming may also explain why sorption of the shorter chain pfas is less sensitive to ppao treatment than the longer chain pfas fig 1 a cartoon illustrating the concept is given in scheme 1 a cylindrical pore shape is used for illustration but the principle is the same for the more realistic slit shape landers et al 2013 thommes et al 2015 in the unmodified biochar the shorter chain pfas can better access open smaller pores than the longer chain pfas whereas open larger pores are available to all pfas thus enlargement of the smaller pores by ppao has a greater impact on sorption of the longer chain than the shorter chain pfas compounds kinetic studies would shed further light on the hypothesis along the thermo series of biochars sw300 sw600 after ppao treatment the relative increases in both co2 ssa and microporosity declined whereas the relative increases in pfas sorption rose taking pfoa for example sw300 shows a 300 increase in co2 ssa a 270 increase in porosity and a 2 log unit increase in pfoa kd whereas sw600 shows only a 16 increase in co2 ssa only a 23 increase in porosity yet a 3 log unit increase in pfoa kd the opposing trends are also evident when considering the n2 surface and pore parameters however the n2 data are unreliable for the unmodified biochars because of diffusion limitation in the micropores wedler and span 2021 these seemingly disparate trends can be rationalized by noting that ppao treatment favors creation in sw600 of supermicroporosity 0 7 nm thommes et al 2015 whereas creation of ultramicroporosity 0 7 nm is about the same for all biochars in the thermo series fig s1 being wider supermicropores presumably can better accommodate pfas molecular flexing the same conclusion can be drawn by considering changes in the mesopore region upon ppao treatment fig s2 while mesoporosity between 3 and 8 nm is created for all biochars in the thermo series much more is created for sw600 ppao all of these observations further support the pore reaming effect it is possible that including a larger sample set for example a thermo series of biochars over a wider pyrolysis temperature range and ppao treatment temperature range would further help support this rationale thermal oxidation also increases the o content of the carbons including carboxylate o table s1 xiao and pignatello 2016 yang et al 2021a as many of the surface carboxyl groups will be dissociated under the experimental sorption conditions ph 7 thermal oxidation leads to increased negative charge density all pfas compounds studied here are fully dissociated pka 1 thus we must take into account coulombic interactions of the sorbed pfas anions both attractive and repulsive to preserve charge neutrality in the solid phase which is symbolized by sorption requires pfas anions either to undergo exchange with anions already associated with positive sites in pores x e g cl eq 2 or to undergo sorption as an ion pair with a counterion in solution m aq here mainly na aq eq 3 2 anion exchange sorption pfas aq x pfa s x aq 3 ion pair sorption pfas aq m aq pfa s m anion exchange is favorable because pfas anion sorption is far more hydrophobic and capable of engaging in van der waals interactions compared to inorganic anions such as cl however pcs made from woody feedstock typically have few positive anion exchange sites under non acidic conditions for example the zeta potential of unmodified sw500 at ph 7 0 is 51 mv fig 2 and declines to more negative potentials with thermal oxidation xiao and pignatello 2016 yang et al 2021a the cation exchange capacity ammonium ph 7 4 a measure of net surface negative charge of a series of maple wood biochars unmodified or oxidized by ppao or other thermal or chemical treatments increased linearly with the o c ratio yang et al 2021a thus it is reasonable to conclude that anion exchange sorption eq 2 is minor and that pfas anions bind mainly by ion pair sorption mechanism eq 3 for both unmodified and ppao treated biochars despite the growing negative charge density on the carbon due to thermal oxidation sorption of pfas by the ion pair mechanism is not diminished by charge repulsion between pfas anions and negatively charge sites because these are all balanced by cations ion pairs are known to partition from aqueous solution into non miscible solvents like n octanol jafvert et al 1990 lee et al 1990 from the above discussion it may be concluded that enhancement by anion exchange is minor or insignificant and that charge repulsion is not a significant factor we previously reported evidence for formation of very strong negative charge assisted hydrogen bonds cahb with surface carboxyl groups by virtue of their similar pka values such bond can be written rfco2 h o2c where represents the carbon formation of the cahb was suggested to partly explain sorption enhancement of carboxylate compounds e g 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid by ppao treatment xiao and pignatello 2016 however the difference in pka between pfas and surface carboxyl groups seems too large for them to engage in strong cahb based on the delta pka rule gilli and gilli 2009 gilli et al 2009 further research however is needed to explore this possible mechanism taken together these results support that the main driving force for sorption enhancement at ph 7 4 by thermal oxidation of the biochars is pore reaming quaternary ammonium units of the bound polymer pdadmac in excess of those needed to balance surface negative charges introduce positive charge sites to the biochar these sites may be near the carbonaceous surface or extend outward depending on how the polymer strands orient the net effect is enhanced sorption of pfas anions through anion exchange with in this case chloride or phosphate eq 2 again sulfonates are favored over carboxylates ion pair sorption eq 3 is not likely much influenced by the backbone of the quaternary ammonium polymer where comparison is possible sorption enhancement by pdadmac coating is slightly more effective than by ppao sw500 pd vs sw500 ppao fig 6 however the two effects are not additive fig 6 plausible explanations are a that pdadmac binding on the ppao treated biochar plugs some of the pores attenuating the reaming effect of ppao and b that carboxyl groups introduced by ppao treatment counterbalance positive charges of the bound pdadmac strands providing fewer anion exchange sites for pfas the co2 ssas of sw500 ppao and sw500 ppao pd are 691 and 621 m2 g respectively and the pore volumes are 0 197 and 0 170 cm3 g respectively these changes are not great but are larger than the respective changes for the non ppao pair sw500 and sw500 pd 579 and 571 m2 g and 0 158 and 0 152 cm3 g respectively this suggests a greater contribution to pore plugging by pdadmac in the ppao treated than the unmodified biochars moreover the zeta potential of sw500 ppao pd is 19 2 4 7 mv n 4 at ph 7 0 which is not significantly different from the zeta of sw500 pd 15 4 6 2 mv n 4 at ph 7 1 arguing against a strong role of counterbalancing thus explanation a seems more plausible but we cannot completely rule out b further studies are needed to determine the contributions of these or other possible mechanisms 4 conclusion this study demonstrates that certain modifications can improve the performance of biochars for sorption of pfas from water thermal oxidation in air or ppao can open nanoscale pores of biochars that generally benefit longer chain more than shorter chain pfas as the reamed enlarged pores become accessible to the longer chain pfas anions based on charge neutrality ion pair pfas counterions sorption reaction eq 3 is suggested to be a dominant process for ppao treated biochars this mechanism will be further investigated in pfas sorption with changed ionic strengths i e at different na concentrations using nacl to control ionic strength coating pdadmac on biochar can reverse the surface charge and increase the anion exchange capacity for a given chain length regardless of chain size the positively charged surface favors sorption of sulfonates over carboxylates due to the stronger hydrophobicity and polarizability of the sulfonate group competition by dissolved water components such as carbonate sulfate and dissolved organic matter still needs to be addressed for its relevance to practical application competitive sorption by phosphate may be an important consideration for researchers who use phosphate as a buffer in experiments the reason for the extraordinary enhancement of pfas sorption by pdadmac coating of the biochars of our study in comparison to the activated carbons of other reports ramos et al 2022 including our own preliminary results is unknown and deserves further study regenerability of the sorbent is an important issue pcss can be regenerated thermally an advantage for this family of materials after regenerating sw600 ppao in air at 500 c it sorbed more pfas than before regeneration wang et al 2022 we have not investigated the regenerability of pdadmac coated biochars it is possible that washing with a high ionic strength solution would be effective for removing pfas but it might displace pdadmac in summary this study clearly shows that pcs design for removing pfas from water should weigh carbon surface chemistry and or nanoscale pore structure future work can be focused on testing ppao treated and pdadmac coated biochars at the same condition for directly comparing the two modification methods and selecting a better one for

15267,several countries including the united states plan to set an enforceable maximum contaminant level for certain per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas in drinking water among the available treatment options sorption by pyrogenic carbonaceous sorbents pcs is a practical and effective approach to remove pfas from water in pilot and full scale applications the two most important properties of pcs surface chemistry and pore structure were tailored in this study to understand their importance in the sorption of various anionic shorter chain and longer chain pfas brief thermal oxidation post pyrolysis air oxidation ppao of pcs including biochars at a moderate temperature 400 c was used to increase specific surface area and nanoporosity the sorption distribution ratio kd of individual pfas after ppao treatment increased by as much as three orders of magnitude compared to the unmodified pcs more effectively so for longer chain than shorter chain compounds pore reaming plays a major role in the sorption enhancement and an ion pair pfas counterions sorption mechanism is proposed in addition irreversible sorption of a quaternary ammonium cationic polymer poly dimethyldiallylammonium chloride pdadmac was employed to reverse the surface charge of biochar coating with pdadmac increased pfas sorption by a factor of 10 3000 predominantly by an anion exchange mechanism sorption enhancement was more effective for the sulfonate than the carboxylate with the same perfluoro chain length the results of this study are expected to inform the design of carbons

sorbents pcs is a function of the poly per fluoro chain length due to solvophobic effects hence shorter chain anionic pfas show poorer affinity for pcs zeng et al 2020 sorption to pcs is also influenced by the nature of the terminal anionic group whether carboxylate or sulfonate herkert et al 2020 as carbons typically have little anion exchange capacity the contributions of attractive and repulsive coulombic forces to anionic pfas sorption by carbons are unclear surface chemistry and pore structure are the two most important factors affecting the sorption of legacy organic compounds to gac and other porous pcs xiao et al 2018 the effect of surface chemistry and pore structure on pcs sorption of pfas is poorly known in this study we modified the surface chemistry and pore structure of pcs biochars in an attempt to understand the relative importance of these two factors on sorption of pfas the modifications include nanopore enlargement and incorporation of anion exchange capacity pore enlargement is achieved by briefly exposing the sample to hot air which reams pores by oxidizing away tarry deposits and etching pore walls the consequent increases in specific surface area and porosity lead to greater sorption of both nonpolar and polar compounds xiao and pignatello 2016 yang et al 2021a a preliminary report on the effects of thermal oxidation on pfas removal has appeared wang et al 2022 here we go into greater mechanistic detail additionally anion exchange capacity is introduced by binding a quaternary ammonium cationic polymer poly dimethyldiallylammonium chloride pdadmac a previous study of ours showed that coating an activated carbon with pdadmac accelerated base hydrolysis of sorbed alkyl halides by increasing hydroxide ion sorption hsieh and pignatello 2018 a second study showed that pdadmac coated biochar strongly retained orthophosphate ions wang et al 2020 a limited number of studies have reported using pdadmac to assist removal of pfas compounds aly et al 2019 injected pdadmac or another cationic polymer polyamine directly into vessels or columns of aquifer solids and observed sorption enhancement of several anionic pfas by up to 6 fold they suggested that the anion exchange capacity of the aquifer solids bestowed by the pdadmac coating contributed to pfas sorption enhancement liu et al 2020 found benefits of injecting pdadmac along with powdered activated carbon into batch and column aquifer solids for purposes of stabilizing the carbon suspension however they did not test whether pdadmac affected the sorption capacity or affinity of powdered activated carbon for pfas while the present manuscript was being prepared ramos et al 2022 reported that pdadmac coated filtrasorb 400 gac showed increased sorption capacity relative to the untreated gac by about 7 14 for pfbs pfhxs pfos and pfos and about 38 for pfba at 0 02 m ionic strength these values apparently represent capacities at very high concentrations percent levels by weight not affinities at environmentally realistic concentrations we too found only small changes in sorption of pfas with a pdadmac coated gac data not shown here we show that hot air treatment and cationic polymer coating separately and through different mechanisms increase sorption of anionic pfas to biochars made from woody feedstock by up to 1000 fold to our best knowledge this is a pioneering study that endows biochar with much higher pfas sorption affinity the findings of this study will facilitate the design of appropriate pcs for pfas removal from water 2 materials and methods 2 1 sorbent preparation and characterization from the porous pcs family we selected biochar as a candidate because of its cost effectiveness and the ready availability of feedstocks the pcs biochars were prepared by pyrolyzing softwood shavings mixed species at 300 400 500 or 600 c for 2 h under n2 flow wang et al 2020 the samples are named swxxx where sw is softwood feedstock and xxx the temperature portions were subjected to post pyrolysis air oxidation ppao by placing them contained in open 60 ml glass vials 0 10 g per vial into a muffle furnace at 400 c for 30 min in air yang

rinsing the collected solid hsieh and pignatello 2018 it was labelled as sw500 pd previously we found that pdadmac sorption on an activated carbon was essentially irreversible hsieh and pignatello

ph 7 0 with 3 mm phosphate pd series and their controls the ppao series except for sw500 ppao were equilibrated with pfas mixtures sometimes including just the shorter chain compounds or the longer chain compounds the adsorption experiments with ppao series biochars were performed at the university of north dakoda the pd series were equilibrated with individual solutes pfpea pfna pfbs or pfos and the adsorption experiments were conducted at the connecticut agricultural experiment station our objective was to study pfas sorption mechanisms with biochars modified with two different methods not to compare the two nevertheless we appraised the sorption performance of sw500 ppao sw500 pd and sw500 ppao pd in the presence of 3 mm phosphate to compare the two treatments under the same conditions and to determine whether the two treatments performed on the same sample are additive see results in section 3 2 sorption was performed by placing 100 500 mg unmodified or modified biochar in contact with 10 15 or 25 ml pfas solution unless otherwise specified in 50 ml sterile polypropylene vials at prescribed initial pfas concentrations 0 0687 8 53 μm the vials were shaken end over end at 22 c for 2 4 or 14 days the aqueous phase was filtered through a 0 45 μm nylon membrane for analysis controls were prepared in the biocide added test solution sorbent free controls were spiked with a pfas at the same initial dose as in the corresponding test vials these control samples were manipulated in the same manner as test samples the sorbed level q μmol g was computed by subtracting the concentration in the test vial c aq μm from that in the corresponding control vial and then normalizing for the sorbent mass in the test vial the distribution ratio kd l kg 1 is defined as the ratio of sorbed concentration μg kg 1 to the solution concentration in the test vials sorption isotherms were fit to the freundlich model 1 q k f c aq n where kf is the affinity coefficient and n is the

are given in text s1 and tables s2 and s3 of the supplementary materials section 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of thermal oxidation on sorption an increase in pyrolysis temperature resulted in a decrease in o c 0 250 to 0 0553 decrease in h c 0 785 to 0 251 and increase in co2 specific surface area co2 ssa 219 to 698 m2 g of the unmodified biochar samples table s1 these trends are consistent with those of many other studies and reflect the progressive conversion of biochar to a more condensed aromatic structure budarin et al 2006 keiluweit et al 2010 pore reaming by ppao treatment as addressed in detail previously xiao and pignatello 2016 yang et al 2021a was confirmed by the increases in co2 pore volume and co2 ssa fig s1 and table s1 the increase in o c and the decrease in h c table s1 previous work found that ppao increased acidic functionality specifically carboxyl groups xiao and pignatello 2016 yang et al 2021a table 1 lists the single point 2 day kd values for individual pfas in a pfas mixture for samples before and after ppao treatment differences in pfas uptake between the 2 day and 14 day contact times were small and showed no trend samples pyrolyzed at 600 c sw600 and sw600 ppao showed correspondingly greater kd values than those pyrolyzed at lower temperatures consistent with their larger co2 ssa and porosity table s1 table 1 reveals that ppao treatment results in up to 103 fold increase in kd additional data were presented in the preliminary report wang et al 2022 the difference in log kd between the ppao treated and unmodified 600 c biochar which is proportional to the difference in sorption free energy could be computed for some compounds fig 1 shows that δlog kd tends to be smaller for shorter chain than for longer chain pfas our previous report noted that longer chain pfas are noticeably competitive against shorter chain pfas for sorption sites wang et al 2022 xiao et al 2011 3 2 effects of pdadmac treatment on sorption several researchers have emphasized the importance of pcs surface chemistry on sorption of pfas chen et al 2021 pauletto and bandosz 2022 wu et al 2020 zhi and liu 2015 zhou et al 2021 for example zhi and liu state that electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged carbon surface and pfas anions resulted in low sorption zhi and liu 2015 in this study sorption of pdadmac to carbons leads to charge reversal this is shown here by the experiment in fig 2 where addition of increasing amounts of pdadmac to an aqueous suspension of sw500 particles at ph 7 0 causes the zeta potential to progressively shift from 51 mv to 7 5 mv fig 3a b reveal that pdadmac coated biochar sw500 pd more effectively removes micromolar concentrations of pfna or pfos from solution than its uncoated counterpart sw500 furthermore sw500 pd more effectively removes pfos than pfna which have the same perfluorocarbon chain length 8 the shorter chain compounds pfbs and pfpea are much less effectively removed by sw500 pd than are the longer chain compounds pfos and pfna while the order sulfonate carboxylate for the same perfluorocarbon chain length 4 in this case is maintained fig 3c the shorter chain carboxylate pfpea is not noticeably sorbed by suspensions of sw500 pd up to 14 g sw500 pd l neither of the shorter chain compounds were appreciably sorbed by sw500 even at 8 g sw500 l not shown wesuppose that sorption of the shorter chain pfas would be inhibited in the presence of the longer chain as sw500 pd has higher affinity to the longer chain but this remains to be tested sorption of pfos or pfna increases as the amount of pdadmac added to the aqueous suspension of sw500 increases fig 4a or c respectively and the sorbed concentration in each case correlates with the zeta potential of the suspended particles fig 4b or 4d respectively these results indicate that sorption is a function of surface negative charge balance and the introduction of positively charged sites by pdadmac the isotherms on sw500 pd in fig 5 show that pfos sorption is more nonlinear and favorable than pfna sorption the freundlich n are 0 344 and 0 465 respectively and the kd i e kf at c aq 1 μm are 1204 and 714 l kg 1 respectively the isotherms in fig 5 also reveal that the difference between the sulfonate and the carboxylate for the same chain length diminishes as concentration increases it is possible that the kd for the pdadmac coated biochars are minimum values since the buffer ion phosphate present in large molar excess over the pfas compounds binds strongly to pdadmac coated biochar wang et al 2020 and may have been competitive competition is supported by the following with phosphate pfbs and pfpea did not show evidence of sorption to sw500 nor did pfpea to sw500 pd fig 3c yet without phosphate both pfbs and pfpea sorb to sw300 sw400 and sw600 albeit moderately table 1 the competitive effect of phosphate has also been observed on other materials including powdered activated carbon qian et al 2017 anion exchange resin boyer et al 2021 and ferrihydrite campos pereira et al 2020 it is possible that pdadmac blocks some pores the co2 ssas of sw500 and sw500 pd 579 and 571 m2 g respectively table s1 are quite close suggesting at first that it does not however co2 may not well represent pfas access because it is a much smaller molecule in addition gas porosimetry is carried out in the absence of water molecules which can assist pore obstruction by clustering around charged sites on the pdadmac strands nevertheless pdadmac coating greatly increases pfas sorption despite possible pore blockage single solute experiments on pfna and pfos sought to compare the effectiveness of thermal oxidation and quaternary ammonium derivatization i e sw500 ppao vs sw500 pd and to determine whether the two treatments are additive fig 6 shows that at ph 7 0 in 3 mm phosphate buffer quaternary ammonium derivatization is slightly more effective than thermal oxidation under the same conditions all in the presence of phosphate however the two treatments do not appear to be additive as the curves for sw500 pd and sw500 ppao pd practically overlap see explanations in mechanisms section table 2 compares the results of the present study with past attempts to increase pfas capacity or affinity by modification of psc physico chemical properties treatment of a mixture of coffee grounds biochar with 1 1 koh treatment item 1 resulted in a 286 fold increase in specific surface area and an increase in pfos langmuir capacity from negligible to 4 3 by weight steigerwald and ray 2021 saeidi et al 2021 treated activated carbon felts at 900 c under 5 h2 in n2 item 6 and observed up to three orders of magnitude increase in pfas sorption they ascribed enhancement to a reduction in surface polarity by removal of oxygen containing groups by h2 they also advocated method optimization for safety reasons due to h2 usage saeidi et al 2021 other attempts to enhance sorption by surface modification items 3 5 7 8 have been much less successful resulting in enhancement less than a factor of about 2 clearly regarding pfas removal from water the enhancement effect in this study is competitive if not superior to other modification methods of carbons or biochars table 2 notably we achieved the sorption enhancement at much milder conditions e g air thermal treatment at 400 c for 30 min 3 3 mechanisms for both the pfca and pfsa series kd increases as a function of perfluorocarbon chain length due to increasing solvophobicity and dispersion forces that the perfluorinated chain is capable of engaging in at the interface gregor et al 1955 park et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 for a given chain length the sulfonates sorb more strongly than the carboxylates consistent with previously reported trends in sorption to activated carbons herkert et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2017 and chromatographic retention time on ion exchange resins gregor et al 1955 as all test compounds are fully ionized under the conditions i e pka 1 goss 2008 goss and arp 2009 the preference of sulfonate over carboxylate reflects the difference in group properties of the charged so3 vs co2 units charge delocalization is greater in the sulfonate ion than the carboxylate ion leading to weaker solvation dispersion interactions with the surface are more favorable for the sulfonate as well since dispersion is proportional to polarizability and the sum of the ground state atomic polarizabilities lide 2004 of the so3 unit 5 31 10 24 cm3 exceeds that of the co2 unit 3 36 10 24 cm3 ppao treatment results in up to 1000 fold increase in sorption of pfas compounds table 1 sorption enhancement by ppao treatment has been observed for other non fluorinated carboxylic acids as well as neutral polar and nonpolar compounds xiao and pignatello 2016 yang et al 2021a ppao treatment frees up additional surface area and the space of both micropores and mesopores table s1 for incoming pfas molecules pore reaming may also explain why sorption of the shorter chain pfas is less sensitive to ppao treatment than the longer chain pfas fig 1 a cartoon illustrating the concept is given in scheme 1 a cylindrical pore shape is used for illustration but the principle is the same for the more realistic slit shape landers et al 2013 thommes et al 2015 in the unmodified biochar the shorter chain pfas can better access open smaller pores than the longer chain pfas whereas open larger pores are available to all pfas thus enlargement of the smaller pores by ppao has a greater impact on sorption of the longer chain than the shorter chain pfas compounds kinetic studies would shed further light on the hypothesis along the thermo series of biochars sw300 sw600 after ppao treatment the relative increases in both co2 ssa and microporosity declined whereas the relative increases in pfas sorption rose taking pfoa for example sw300 shows a 300 increase in co2 ssa a 270 increase in porosity and a 2 log unit increase in pfoa kd whereas sw600 shows only a 16 increase in co2 ssa only a 23 increase in porosity yet a 3 log unit increase in pfoa kd the opposing trends are also evident when considering the n2 surface and pore parameters however the n2 data are unreliable for the unmodified biochars because of diffusion limitation in the micropores wedler and span 2021 these seemingly disparate trends can be rationalized by noting that ppao treatment favors creation in sw600 of supermicroporosity 0 7 nm thommes et al 2015 whereas creation of ultramicroporosity 0 7 nm is about the same for all biochars in the thermo series fig s1 being wider supermicropores presumably can better accommodate pfas molecular flexing the same conclusion can be drawn by considering changes in the mesopore region upon ppao treatment fig s2 while mesoporosity between 3 and 8 nm is created for all biochars in the thermo series much more is created for sw600 ppao all of these observations further support the pore reaming effect it is possible that including a larger sample set for example a thermo series of biochars over a wider pyrolysis temperature range and ppao treatment temperature range would further help support this rationale thermal oxidation also increases the o content of the carbons including carboxylate o table s1 xiao and pignatello 2016 yang et al 2021a as many of the surface carboxyl groups will be dissociated under the experimental sorption conditions ph 7 thermal oxidation leads to increased negative charge density all pfas compounds studied here are fully dissociated pka 1 thus we must take into account coulombic interactions of the sorbed pfas anions both attractive and repulsive to preserve charge neutrality in the solid phase which is symbolized by sorption requires pfas anions either to undergo exchange with anions already associated with positive sites in pores x e g cl eq 2 or to undergo sorption as an ion pair with a counterion in solution m aq here mainly na aq eq 3 2 anion exchange sorption pfas aq x pfa s x aq 3 ion pair sorption pfas aq m aq pfa s m anion exchange is favorable because pfas anion sorption is far more hydrophobic and capable of engaging in van der waals interactions compared to inorganic anions such as cl however pcs made from woody feedstock typically have few positive anion exchange sites under non acidic conditions for example the zeta potential of unmodified sw500 at ph 7 0 is 51 mv fig 2 and declines to more negative potentials with thermal oxidation xiao and pignatello 2016 yang et al 2021a the cation exchange capacity ammonium ph 7 4 a measure of net surface negative charge of a series of maple wood biochars unmodified or oxidized by ppao or other thermal or chemical treatments increased linearly with the o c ratio yang et al 2021a thus it is reasonable to conclude that anion exchange sorption eq 2 is minor and that pfas anions bind mainly by ion pair sorption mechanism eq 3 for both unmodified and ppao treated biochars despite the growing negative charge density on the carbon due to thermal oxidation sorption of pfas by the ion pair mechanism is not diminished by charge repulsion between pfas anions and negatively charge sites because these are all balanced by cations ion pairs are known to partition from aqueous solution into non miscible solvents like n octanol jafvert et al 1990 lee et al 1990 from the above discussion it may be concluded that enhancement by anion exchange is minor or insignificant and that charge repulsion is not a significant factor we previously reported evidence for formation of very strong negative charge assisted hydrogen bonds cahb with surface carboxyl groups by virtue of their similar pka values such bond can be written rfco2 h o2c where represents the carbon formation of the cahb was suggested to partly explain sorption enhancement of carboxylate compounds e g 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid by ppao treatment xiao and pignatello 2016 however the difference in pka between pfas and surface carboxyl groups seems too large for them to engage in strong cahb based on the delta pka rule gilli and gilli 2009 gilli et al 2009 further research however is needed to explore this possible mechanism taken together these results support that the main driving force for sorption enhancement at ph 7 4 by thermal oxidation of the biochars is pore reaming quaternary ammonium units of the bound polymer pdadmac in excess of those needed to balance surface negative charges introduce positive charge sites to the biochar these sites may be near the carbonaceous surface or extend outward depending on how the polymer strands orient the net effect is enhanced sorption of pfas anions through anion exchange with in this case chloride or phosphate eq 2 again sulfonates are favored over carboxylates ion pair sorption eq 3 is not likely much influenced by the backbone of the quaternary ammonium polymer where comparison is possible sorption enhancement by pdadmac coating is slightly more effective than by ppao sw500 pd vs sw500 ppao fig 6 however the two effects are not additive fig 6 plausible explanations are a that pdadmac binding on the ppao treated biochar plugs some of the pores attenuating the reaming effect of ppao and b that carboxyl groups introduced by ppao treatment counterbalance positive charges of the bound pdadmac strands providing fewer anion exchange sites for pfas the co2 ssas of sw500 ppao and sw500 ppao pd are 691 and 621 m2 g respectively and the pore volumes are 0 197 and 0 170 cm3 g respectively these changes are not great but are larger than the respective changes for the non ppao pair sw500 and sw500 pd 579 and 571 m2 g and 0 158 and 0 152 cm3 g respectively this suggests a greater contribution to pore plugging by pdadmac in the ppao treated than the unmodified biochars moreover the zeta potential of sw500 ppao pd is 19 2 4 7 mv n 4 at ph 7 0 which is not significantly different from the zeta of sw500 pd 15 4 6 2 mv n 4 at ph 7 1 arguing against a strong role of counterbalancing thus explanation a seems more plausible but we cannot completely rule out b further studies are needed to determine the contributions of these or other possible mechanisms 4 conclusion this study demonstrates that certain modifications can improve the performance of biochars for sorption of pfas from water thermal oxidation in air or ppao can open nanoscale pores of biochars that generally benefit longer chain more than shorter chain pfas as the reamed enlarged pores become accessible to the longer chain pfas anions based on charge neutrality ion pair pfas counterions sorption reaction eq 3 is suggested to be a dominant process for ppao treated biochars this mechanism will be further investigated in pfas sorption with changed ionic strengths i e at different na concentrations using nacl to control ionic strength coating pdadmac on biochar can reverse the surface charge and increase the anion exchange capacity for a given chain length regardless of chain size the positively charged surface favors sorption of sulfonates over carboxylates due to the stronger hydrophobicity and polarizability of the sulfonate group competition by dissolved water components such as carbonate sulfate and dissolved organic matter still needs to be addressed for its relevance to practical application competitive sorption by phosphate may be an important consideration for researchers who use phosphate as a buffer in experiments the reason for the extraordinary enhancement of pfas sorption by pdadmac coating of the biochars of our study in comparison to the activated carbons of other reports ramos et al 2022 including our own preliminary results is unknown and deserves further study regenerability of the sorbent is an important issue pcss can be regenerated thermally an advantage for this family of materials after regenerating sw600 ppao in air at 500 c it sorbed more pfas than before regeneration wang et al 2022 we have not investigated the regenerability of pdadmac coated biochars it is possible that washing with a high ionic strength solution would be effective for removing pfas but it might displace pdadmac in summary this study clearly shows that pcs design for removing pfas from water should weigh carbon surface chemistry and or nanoscale pore structure future work can be focused on testing ppao treated and pdadmac coated biochars at the same condition for directly comparing the two modification methods and selecting a better one for

15268,understanding the composition and reactivity of dissolved organic matter dom at molecular level is vital for deciphering potential regulators or indicators relating to anaerobic process performance though it was hardly achieved by traditional analyses here the dom composition molecular reactivity and transformation in the enhanced sludge fermentation process were comprehensively elucidated using high resolution mass spectrometry measurement and data mining with machine learning and paired mass distance pmd based reactomics in the fermentation process for dewatered sludge persulfate pds pretreatment presented its highest performance in improving volatile fatty acids vfas production with the increase from 2 711 mg l to 3 869 mg l whereas its activation in the presence of fe as well as the hybrid of fe and activated carbon led to the decreased vfas production performance in addition to the conventional view of improved decomposition and solubilization of n containing structures from sludge under the sole pds pretreatment the improved vfas production was associated with the alternation of dom molecular compositions such as humification generating molecules with high o c n c s c and aromatic index aimod machine learning was capable of predicting the dom reactivity classes with 74 76 accuracy and found that these molecular parameters in addition to nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc were among the most important variables determining the generation or disappearance of bio resistant molecules in the pds pretreatment the constructed pmd based network suggested that highly connected molecular network with long path length and high diameter was in favor of vfas production especially nh related transformation was found to be active under the enhanced fermentation process moreover network topology analysis revealed that chons compounds e g c13h27o8n1s1 can be the keystone molecules suggesting that the presence of sulfur related molecules e g cysteine like compounds should be paid more attention as potential regulators or indicators for controlling sludge fermentation performance this study also proposed the non targeted dom molecular analysis and downstream data mining for extending our understanding of dom transformation at molecular level graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sludge fermentation dissolved organic matter fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms network machine learning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction though anaerobic process is a century old technique for the biomass treatment it is still one of the most frequently discussed negative emission methods in recent years farghali et al 2022 however the practical application of anaerobic process in industry still meets several limitations such as low efficiency and unstable performance cruz et al 2021 farghali et al 2022 developing new techniques and strategies to improve the performance and process monitoring are still the research hot spots for developing an advanced anaerobic process to fulfill this deep understanding what happens in anaerobically biological process especially the underling regulators and indicators relating to performance is quietly important wu et al 2021 but is still challenging indeed microbe can uptake the bioavailable organics for inner metabolism and also released some intermediates or functional organic molecules to maintain the whole metabolic activity of microbial community puig castellví et al 2022 the bioavailable organics intermediates from microbial metabolisms and also some recalcitrant organics compose the dissolved organic matters dom in anaerobic process deep understanding of the dom composition transformation and their underling relationship with performance is a promising way to explore the potential regulator and indicator sewage sludge is a kind of biowaste which is the byproduct of biological wastewater treatment process and its post treatment or disposal pose a great challenge all over the world dom from activated sludge is a heterogeneous mixture of organic substances such as those from the metabolites and cell lysis of microbes and some non biodegradable residues in influent wastewater xiao et al 2020 during the anaerobic process of sludge dom composition can be associated with microbes and their activities for example recent studies huang et al 2021 li et al 2021 proved that some fractions of dom especially humic like components showed toxic or inhibitory effects on anaerobes resulting in the decrease of methane production therefore it is major concern to understand the underlying mechanisms of how and why the performance changes in terms of dom composition undoubtedly more detailed characterization of the dom composition should be in the first place xiao et al 2020 recently some studies lu et al 2018a 2018b have characterized the refractory dom compounds in sludge anaerobic digestion with sludge pretreatment it was found that refractory humic substances and hydrophobic dom polycyclic steroid like matters alkanes and aromatics were the main components of residual after anaerobic digestion xiao et al 2022 investigated the effects of different pretreatments on the performance of anaerobic digestion of sludge showing that tryptophan protein aromatic protein i aromatic protein ii and cysteine were identified as the key dissolved organic nitrogen don responsible for methane production among those cysteine had bio resistant nature yet improved the degradation of acetic propionic and n butyric acids for methane production shakeri yekta et al 2022 also confirmed that even though cysteine was not degraded into methane its presence accelerated methane production these recent studies proved that the specific organic compounds in dom play important roles in anaerobic digestion process apart from these studies an emerging mass spectrometry ms technique namely ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry such as fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms which allows molecular formula identification due to its ultrahigh resolution and mass accuracy has revealed that dom from sludge was much complicated with the mixture of thousands of organic molecular formula s hao et al 2020 wu et al 2020 moreover s hao et al 2020 found that the carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules cram particularly those compounds containing 3 to 5 n atoms or 1 to 3 n atoms from different pretreated sludge were resistant in anaerobic digestion ft icr ms is potentially useful to unveil the information of thousands of dom compounds in a non target manner due to the high mass resolution and accuracy of ft icr ms it is possible to theoretically infer the potential microbial degradation pathways by which organic matter is produced or consumed cooper et al 2022 thus an emerging ft icr ms post analysis to decipher underling information from thousands of organic molecules is to identify the molecular connections potentially related to specific microbial transformations cooper et al 2022 based on the specific roles of dom molecules in the dom transformation it is reasonable to detect the most connected molecules as key roles for dom transformation these so called keystone molecules can be a potential regulators or indicators for controlling anaerobic process performance in detail based on the accurate mass of reactants and products in one reaction the paired mass distance pmd calculated by the mass difference of reactant and product between each reactant and product can be determined because the reactions generally occur with the loss or addition of some typical groups such as ch2 o nh etc the aggregate of pmds in one sample with complex dom molecules may present the overall reaction profiles called as pmd based reactomics yu and petrick 2020 by using this analysis microbially mediated reactions on dom was found to mainly include the oxidoreduction of ch nh2 groups transfer of nitrogenous groups and formation of the c n bond in wastewater treatment process wang et al 2021 however the pmd based reactomics is not yet used to decipher the dom transformation and further detecting potential regulators in the anaerobic process of biowaste therefore aiming at one of the enhanced anaerobic process of sludge this study focused on the anaerobic fermentation of sludge with activated peroxydisulfate pds treatments known as the novel advanced oxidation processes aops have been proved its ability in improving volatile fatty acids vfas production in the sludge fermentation zhou et al 2020 however the reasons for the improvement of vfas production possibly derived from the altered dom reactivity and some potential regulators have not been elucidated in literature furthermore combined with the molecular level information from ft icr ms analysis machine learning can be a powerful method to interpret the importance of molecular properties in determining dom reactivity biodegradable bio resistant and microbially derived product etc herzsprung et al 2020 to our knowledge though this new method has not been used in exploring dom reactivity in sludge treatment process it is a promising way to imply the potential relationship between dom molecular properties and their reactivity and also the impacts derived from pds pretreatment in such case this study employed ft icr ms pmd based reactomics and machine learning to comprehensively evaluate the dom composition and reactivity during anaerobic fermentation of sludge pretreated by persulfate oxidation and thus to provide a deep understanding of the transformation of molecules especially fate of bioavailable and recalcitrant compounds the changes of dom composition under the impacts of persulfate pretreatment and detecting the potential dom regulators from thousands of molecules this study gives further insights into the complex dom composition from pmd based reactomics which will be particularly important in extending our knowledge on the complex dom transformations and assisting process controlling to develop advanced anaerobic process 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge pretreatment and anaerobic fermentation dewatered excess sludge is commonly used in practical anaerobic digestion system with pretreatment for efficient digestion process therefore this study collected the dewatered excess sludge from a domestic wastewater treatment plant beijing china the sludge was diluted with deionized water to volatile solid vs of 5 26 and passed through 20 mesh sieve besides digested sludge vs of 2 63 from sludge anaerobic reactors was collected as inoculum in subsequent sludge fermentation a 100 ml sludge mixed with potassium persulfate pds pds and ferrous chloride fe pds fe or activated carbon pds fe ac was shaken at 180 rpm min and 35 c for 1 h the dosage of these chemicals was 120 mg pds g vs 150 mg ac g vs and the fe pds mass ratio of 1 25 after the pretreatment the treated sludge was mixed with inoculum sludge at the vs ratio of 1 2 and further incubated at shaker under 35 c before incubation nitrogen gas was injected into the bottles for 2 minutes to remove the air in head space of bottle during the anaerobic fermentation samples were collected every 2 days and injected nitrogen gas every time after the sampling 2 2 ft icr ms analysis the supernatants were separated from the samples of original sludge pretreated sludge named as raw pds fe and ac and fermented sludge at 8 d named as raw2 pds2 fe2 and ac2 by centrifuge at 6000 rpm for 15 min and filtered through 0 45 μm membrane the filtered supernatant was further diluted to toc 10 mg l with an ultrapure water avoiding protein precipitation then 50 ml of the diluted supernatant was acidified to ph 2 with formic acid and subjected to solid phase extraction spe using a ppl cartridge bondelute ppl 6 ml 1 g agilent technologies usa the spe steps were as follows 1 ppl cartridge was pre activated with 12 ml of methanol and acidified ultrapure water ph 2 in sequence 2 the samples were passed through ppl cartridge by gravity 3 the cartridge was rinsed with 12 ml of acidified ultrapure water ph 2 to remove salt and then dried with nitrogen gas 4 the cartridge was eluted with 12 ml of methanol and the eluate was stored at 20 c after freeze drying before ft icr ms analysis the dried eluate was solubilized by 1 ml 50 methanol aqueous solution as a classical spe method for dom this procedure using ppl cartridge had been optimized by dittmar et al 2008 and validated by hao et al 2017 z hao et al 2020 and obtained a relatively high extraction efficiency in terms of toc around 62 for water derived organic matter cao et al 2020 this method and ppl cartridge had also been frequently used for extracting dom from sludge samples cai et al 2022 hu et al 2022 dom composition was measured by using bruker s solarix type ft icr ms with the magnetic field strength of 15 0 t and esi negative ion mode a sodium formate solution 10 mm was used to externally calibrate the instrument and the known series of natural organic matter nom was used to internally recalibrate the spectra using quadratic mode in bruker dataanalysis 4 0 the mass spectrum peaks with a signal to noise ratio greater than 5 were used for molecular identification by using trfu algorithms and script fu et al 2020 in matlab mathworks inc natick ma the assigned formulae were categorized based on o c and h c ratios as follows i e lipids for h c 1 5 2 0 o c 0 0 3 aliphatic proteins for h c 1 5 2 2 o c 0 3 0 67 lignin cram like for h c 0 7 1 5 o c 0 1 0 67 carbohydrates for h c 1 5 2 4 o c 0 67 1 2 unsaturated hydrocarbons for h c 0 7 1 5 o c 0 0 1 aromatic structures for h c 0 2 0 7 o c 0 0 67 and tannin for h c 0 6 1 5 o c 0 67 1 0 liu et al 2021 2 3 machine learning and explanatory analysis machine learning was used to detect whether the molecule properties can determine their reactivity by using random forest and gradient boosting algorithm the dataset table s2 was split into training set and validation set randomly at the ratio of eight to two k fold cross validation k 5 was used to balance bias and variance between datasets baysian optimization method snoek et al 2012 was conducted to tune hyperparameters of the model which includes the number of trees maximum number of features maximum depth of each decision tree etc machine learning and baysian optimization were conducted by using scikit learn v1 1 in order to reveal the inner working of the model we apply game theory based method shapley additive explanation lundberg et al 2020 to interpret the machine learning results for all the molecules with different chemical fingerprint features we calculate shapley value of i t h feature which is defined by 1 ϕ i s x x i s x s 1 x δ i s where x is the set of all input features s is the subset of x exclusive of the feature x i and δ i s is the marginal contribution when x i is adopted back to s the shapley value is calculated to measure their individual contribution to the model for average impact on model output the feature importance is calculated by the mean shap value it is the absolute mean value of shap values of the i t h variable for all molecules which is defined as 2 mean shap k 1 n s ϕ i k n s where n s is the number of molecula the index mean shap is used to measure the average contribution of the input features on the model s categorization 2 4 pmd based network analysis pmd based network was built by searching for the specific pmd values existing in dom molecules in each sample for the lack of referenced pmds targeting the transformation reactions in anaerobic fermentation process which were firstly calculated as follows according to kegg database https www kegg jp we selected the pathways related to the metabolism of glycolysis and amino acid including ko00010 glycolysis gluconeogenesis ko00270 cysteine and methionine metabolism ko00280 valine leucine and isoleucine degradation ko00290 valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and ko00350 tyrosine metabolism in brief each reaction from these pathways was split into several reactant product pairs the paired mass distance was calculated from each reactant product pair besides we weighted each reactant product pair by calculating conserved atom ratio car as suggested by hafner and hatzimanikatis 2021 by this way we can screen the main reactant product pairs in each reaction with high car by ignoring the unimportant pairs containing some small molecule such as co ch4 h2o etc because these small molecules can not be detected from ft icr ms the reaction pairs containing these small molecules were not considered an in house r script was developed based on keggrest package v1 37 2 to find the reactions in each pathway and split into reactant product pairs we tested the robustness by reconstructing the reactions in pathway of ko00010 figure s3 b d if all of the generated pmds were used the whole connections can be fully reconstructed but screened the pmds by car such as car 0 22 or car 0 45 only the major reactant product connections were rebuilt by this way we selected the pmds from major reactant product pairs with 0 45 car 1 the resulted pmds in each pathway were provided in supporting information table s1 based on these referenced pmds the reactant product pairs in each sample were searched from mass difference between every two molecules with tolerance of 0 00001 the resulted reactant product pairs were further used to build the pmd based network by gephi 0 9 7 noticeably the referenced pmds also include the commonly considered pmds during general transformation ayala ortiz et al 2022 and oxidation process zhang et al 2021 therefore the selected pmds cover the general transformation reactions which are reasonably used in the raw sludge and pds pretreated sludge the network topology analysis including the results of network properties and roles of node was carried out by using microeco r package v0 10 1 liu et al 2021 details can be found in supporting information 2 5 other analysis chemical oxygen demand cod was determined by using the hach digestion and dr2800 spectrophotometer hach usa three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrices 3d eems of dom were collected using a fluorescence spectrometer hitachi japan the dreem and n way toolbox were used to perform eems analysis murphy et al 2013 vfas were determined by a gas chromatograph shimazu gc 2014 equipped with a flame ionization detector and a db ffap capillary column 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 μm the injector temperature was 220 c and the detector temperature was 250 c program of oven temperature was 70 c 1 min 20 c min to 180 c 3 min 20 c min to 210 c 3 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of pds pretreatment on vfas production persulfate is widely used as an oxidant in advanced oxidation using sulfate radicals so4 e 2 43 vnhe the transition metals including fe xiao et al 2020 and carbon based materials such as activated carbon ushani et al 2020 are the common catalysts to activate pds via so4 generation in this study by the single pds oxidation pretreatment vfas production from sludge fermentation was improved from 2711 mg l for the control to 3869 mg l for 6 d of anaerobic fermentation fig 1 pds activated by fe also showed the improved vfas production but the activation with fe ac decreased the vfas production compared to the control i e without pretreatment this improvement of vfas production was coincident with some previous studies luo et al 2020b zhou et al 2020 according to the changes of cod and soluble proteins after pretreatment table 1 it was found that single pds oxidation resulted in the increase of cod from 2870 mg l to 3610 mg l but under fe and fe ac activation cod was decreased to 2550 mg l and 1763 mg l respectively furthermore the results of soluble proteins clearly showed that upon the pds pretreatment with fe and fe ac activation soluble protein concentrations were decreased from 618 mg l of raw sludge to 485 mg l and 237 mg l respectively the impacts on dom under different pretreatments were also confirmed according to 3d eem analysis figure s1 in supporting information showing that pds oxidation obviously increased the release of soluble microbial products smp like protein but under fe and fe ac activation maximum fluorescence intensity of smp like protein was decreased these results suggested that single pds pretreatment is useful for improving vfas production from sludge anaerobic fermentation whereas over oxidation of pds pretreatment activated by fe especially fe ac seems to have the adverse impact the comparison of oxidative capacity of pds with that of activated pds further confirmed that pds treatment alone was unable to degrade soluble glucose phenol and bovine serum albumin whereas both phenol and bovine serum albumin were obviously degraded under ac activation though soluble glucose could not be degraded figure s2 supporting information therefore the results generally suggest that the single pds pretreatment was capable of solubilizing dom for improving vfas production but upon fe and fe ac activation over oxidation on the released soluble dom reversely decreased the vfas production noticeably the negative impacts from over oxidation of fe and fe ac activated pds pretreatment were inconsistent with some previous studies luo et al 2020a 2018 which found that pds under fe or other activators presented better performance for improving vfas production than single pds pretreatment this was possibly due to the different type of sludge used for example this study used the dewatered activated sludge while previous studies luo et al 2020a 2018 used the sludge from the secondary sedimentation tank without dewatering the dewatered sludge generally contained high concentration of soluble organic matters which can preferentially consume the generated so4 during pds activation thus leading to the oxidation of soluble organics which can be used for vfas production 3 2 overall insights into dom characters and their transformations 3 2 1 common characters of dom molecule compositions the examination of common dom compositional characteristics fig 2 indicated that the single pds pretreatment and its activation with fe and fe ac resulted in an increase in the proportion of chon compounds and a decrease for the cho compounds both in molecular numbers and relative intensities fig 2i j regarding the biochemical classes of dom molecules the proportion of aliphatic proteins was increased while proportion of lignin like cram compounds tended to be decreased after pds pretreatment as obvious from the relative intensities in fig 2l after anaerobic fermentation the aliphatic proteins were potentially converted into lignin like cram compounds due to the decreased proportion of aliphatic proteins and increased proportion of lignin like cram compounds these results suggested that pds pretreatment and its activation mainly resulted in the decomposition of n containing structures from microbial cell extracellular polymers and insoluble organics possibly into the smaller chon compounds while the other compounds especially cho containing organics were preferentially decomposed besides the pds pretreatment under fe and fe ac activation strongly reduced the numbers of detected dom molecules table 2 which was coincident with the results of decreased cod and vfas production performance the pds pretreatment facilitated the chemical decomposition of n containing structures prior to the anaerobic fermentation and this could overcome the rate limiting step for the biologically mediated hydrolysis of insoluble n containing organics wang et al 2021 the result was also consistent with our understanding that proteins are the main organic components in sludge with largest proportion 50 60 chen et al 2018 and can be the major organic components released from sludge chen et al 2019 furthermore another obvious impact from the pds pretreatment and its activation with fe was the formation of much higher o c compounds after anaerobic fermentation as shown in the van krevelen diagrams fig 2f for the generation of these high o c compounds the intensity weighted average for o c o cw was increased from 0 31 for the control to 0 42 for the pds pretreatment table 2 higher n cw and s cw were also observed under single pds oxidation compared to the anaerobic fermentation without pretreatment besides the pds pretreatment and its activation with fe tended to reduce aimodw while this index increased after anaerobic fermentation however pds pretreatment under fe ac activation did not influence o cw and aimodw these results suggest that the improved vfas production was coupled with the generation of dom compounds with high o c n c s c and aimod during anaerobic fermentation the high o c and aimod suggested that unsaturated like and aromatic like compounds were generated in agreement with the enhanced humification of dom during fermentation che et al 2021 furthermore tang et al 2020 pointed out that humification was an important process in reconstructing extracellular polymeric substances eps for aiding in energy metabolism involved in redox reactions during anaerobic digestion 3 2 2 classes of dom reactivity from the aforementioned results regarding the changes of overall dom characteristics pds pretreatment not only improved the release of soluble organics but also altered the molecular composition of released dom both of them were the main possible reasons for improving vfas production the pca result and upset diagram showed the overall difference and evolution of dom molecular composition in different samples fig 3 for the sludge fermentation without pretreatment about 928 unique molecules appeared before fermentation and about 2381 unique molecules were newly generated after fermentation the 928 unique molecules disappeared after fermentation implies that they were the potentially biodegradable organics while the newly generated 2381 unique molecules referred to the refractory bio resistant organics the pds pretreatment altered the dom molecules composition with 522 unique molecules in pretreated sludge and newly generated 603 unique molecules after the fermentation treatment suggesting that pds pretreatment could alter the dom reactivity by not only generating some new biodegradable or refractory organics but also leading to the removal of originally biodegradable or refractory organics as mentioned above pds pretreatment particularly led to the generation of organics with high o c n c s c and aimod can these molecule properties really infer the dom reactivity what kinds of molecules are biodegradable or refractory and what kinds of molecules tend to be newly generated or removed by pds pretreatment to answer these questions we classified the detected molecules into different classes according to the appearance and disappearance of molecules before and after anaerobic fermentation and also the difference after pds pretreatment as shown in figure s4 in supporting information the detected molecules from original sludge pds pretreated sludge and their fermented sludges were classified into 8 classes labeling as

formulas than releasing newly bio resistant compounds 841 formulas and removing originally biodegradable compounds 1205 formulas 3 2 3 distinct molecule properties related to dom reactivity to detect whether the molecule properties can determine their reactivity figure s4 we used machine learning to predict the dom reactivity classes from the molecule properties totally 23 molecule properties were selected to predict its reactivity labeled as four classes i e releasedbio releasedresist dismissbio and dismissresist data shown in table s2 by using random forest and gradient boosting algorithm both models showed 74 76 prediction accuracy and indicated that the classes of dom reactivity under pds pretreatment can be related to the molecule properties the feature i e molecule properties importance in predicting the classes of dom reactivity was ranked as shown in fig 4 consistent with aforementioned findings o c n c aimod s c and nosc were tightly associated properties with the classes of dom reactivity as shown in fig 4 c d the distribution of resistant molecules can be well separated as functions of o c and nosc values the disappeared bio resistant molecules due to pds pretreatment labeled as dismissresist mainly aggerated into cluster with low o c average 0 31 and low nosc average 0 58 values whereas the newly released bio resistant molecules were distinct with high o c average 0 51 nosc average 0 03 and higher proportion of molecules with high aimod values for the biodegradable molecules distributions of the disappeared and newly generated molecules were highly overlapped showing lower o c average 0 43 and nosc average 0 41 besides parts of these biodegradable molecules tended to have lower aimod value average 0 16 than the bio resistant molecules average 0 19 the removal of originally refractory compounds and release of some new compounds with high o c and nosc also implies that the pds pretreatment altered the molecular transformation pathways both in natural environment kellerman et al 2015 and the bio reactors qiu et al 2020 nosc varying from low to high can be an indicator that aliphatics are degraded and condensing aromatic structure and lignin like dom will be dominant the increase of nosc during biological process can suggest the improved maturity of organics with more stable humic like structures liu et al 2020 in this study the generated high nosc molecules after fermentation with pds pretreatment was perhaps the result of improved oxidative reductive potential orp in anaerobic fermentation which was proved according to luo et al 2019 who found that pds pretreatment significantly increased the orp from 285 mv of the control to 225 mv in anaerobic fermentation reactors 3 3 pmd based reactomics of dom 3 3 1 dom reactive networks the constructed pmd networks figure s5 presented the dom molecules involved in the reaction pairs with specific mass difference these highly connected dom molecules showed that the proportion of reactive dom molecules in raw sludge was in the order of cho chos chon chop chons chosp chonp after anaerobic fermentation chon and chons compounds became the dominantly reactive dom components the pds pretreatment and its activation with fe and fe ac obviously increased the proportion of chon compounds via the enhanced decomposition of n containing structures from sludge after subsequent anaerobic fermentation chon and chons also became the dominantly reactive dom components however the dom transformation under pds pretreatments with fe and fe ac activation was different for the fe activation although chon was the dominant dom component after anaerobic fermentation the proportion of cho and chop was also increased for fe ac activation fewer chon compounds were detected and proportion of chop compounds was high after anaerobic fermentation these results suggest that the overall dom transformation patterns during anaerobic fermentation was invariant between the control and single pds pretreatment except for the improved decomposition and solubilization of n containing organics however the fe activation especially its combination with ac not only directly degrade the solubilized dom molecules decrease molecule numbers but also interfered in the dom transformation fewer chon compounds generated while proportion of chop compounds was high during anaerobic fermentation this impact on dom transformation from different pretreatment process was also revealed according to the changes of biochemical classes of the reactive dom molecules as shown in fig 5 the aliphatic protein was the most dominant dom component and also some lignin cram like compounds were in high proportion in raw sludge and sludge after the pretreatments but after anaerobic fermentation transformation of dom from aliphatic protein to lignin cram like compounds was particularly observed in the control and with single pds treatment however in the retarded vfas generation process under the pds pretreatment with fe especially fe ac activation the transformation from aliphatic protein to lignin cram like compounds was prevented with less proportion of lignin cram like compounds being generated after fermentation although the direct relationship between this dom conversion and vfas production performance has not yet been verified this pmd based network could be a molecular fingerprint suggesting a potential relationship between doms and performance in the fermentation processes further research is expected to establish new performance metrics based on such a molecular fingerprint 3 3 2 network topological analysis showing the difference of pmd based reactomics to further decipher the underlying information on the relationship between dom transformation and the anaerobic fermentation performance the topological analysis of the dom reactive network was carried out and presented in figure s6 from the overall network properties details in table s3 the average network path length showed significant pearson correlation r 0 964 p value 0 036 to the vfas production according to the data from the control and single pds pretreatment network diameter also showed high correlation coefficient but not significant correlation r 0 942 p value 0 058 with vfas production results of both the path length and network diameter indicated that a large and long chain connected dom reactions was in favor of maintaining high performance of vfas production moreover network topology analysis can further help us to find the keystone molecules module hubs and connectors in networks in the dom reactive networks which can assist in finding potential regulators and indicators the key nodes were detected in the large networks from the raw sludge pds pretreated sludge and after their anaerobic fermentation table s4 in supporting information the distribution of these keystone molecules figure s8 in supporting information revealed that all of the pretreatments resulted in the release of keystone dom molecules with high n c value indicating that the chemical pretreatment was powerful tool in releasing high n c molecules from the decomposition of n containing structures in sludge noticeably some other keystone molecules with medium n c 0 05 0 2 were generated in the undisturbed without pretreatment and highly improved anaerobic fermentation system with single pds pretreatment however in the anaerobic fermentation under pds pretreatment with fe and fe ac activation no such keystone molecules were found even though it still needs to be experimentally proven and tested how these recognized keystone molecules determine the functionality this statistical way is still the mostly popular and important to strengthen the repertoire of keystone species such as in microbiome banerjee et al 2018 to give an insight into the difference of the specific keystone molecules in different dom reactive network the subnetwork around the keystone molecule e g c16h20o5n2 was presented fig 6 c16h20o5n2 was the module hub in the dom reactive network after anaerobic fermentation of both original sludge and single pds pretreated sludge c16h20o5n2 also occurred in the original sludge and the sludge after single pds pretreatment and the activation with fe but after the pds pretreatment with fe ac activation c16h20o5n2 was disappeared it is hard to identify the definite compound name of c16h20o5n2 formula due to the unknown isomers without structure information but by searching it in biologically related database chebi https www ebi ac uk chebi init do only three candidate compounds can be found basing on current knowledge they are potentially metabolites derived from the amino acids based on the description in chebi database it was found that complex connections around c16h20o5n2 were formed after anaerobic fermentation compared to the dom in original sludge single pds pretreatment increased the connections compared to the original sludge but reduced the complexity after anaerobic fermentation however under the pds pretreatment with fe and fe ac activation the connections around c16h20o5n2 became particularly fewer especially under the pretreatment with fe ac activation c16h20o5n2 was disappeared even though pds pretreatment activated by fe improved the vfas production compared with the control it still made the decreased vfas production compared to the single pds pretreatment therefore considering the reduced performance of vfas production under pds pretreatment with fe and fe ac activation the complex and stable dom reactive connections around the key molecules seem to be important the complex interactions among microbial populations is important for process stability in anaerobic digestion wu et al 2016 metabolites from different microbial populations should be one of the important link bridge to their interactions for example narihiro et al 2018 suggested that organisms from multiple niches orchestrated their metabolic capacity in multiple interaction networks to effectively degrade pta wastewater our findings also proposed that the dom highly connected networks were important for improving vfas production performance 3 3 3 difference in dom reactivity based on the pmd appearance since the pmd value represents the specific reaction its variation in appearance partly indicates the changes of dom reactivity interestingly similar pmd distribution was observed in each sample figure s7 in supporting information low pmd values were always the dominant in the pmd based dom networks the pmd distribution in anaerobic fermentation with single pds treatment was similar to the sludge fermentation without pretreatment the control figure s7 b c however the pds pretreatment under fe ac activation resulted in much fewer number of pmds figure s7 d the dominant pmds element groups detected were c 12 da ch2 14 01565 da o 15 994915 da co 1 3 994915 da h2o 18 010565 da h2o 1 13 979265 da c2h4 28 0313 da ch2o 30 010565 da co 27 994915 da nh 15 010899 da c2h2o 42 010565 da c2h4o 44 026215 da nh3 17 026549 da h3o 1 n 1 031634 da o2 31 98983 da table 3 among these element groups ch2 o h2o 1 h2o c c2h4 and c2h4o were the most dominant in all dom reactive networks even after the pretreatment with fe ac activation however the proportion of nh group which was high in both the control and anaerobic fermentation of single pds pretreated sludge was decreased in the anaerobic fermentation under pretreatment with fe ac activation this result was also consistent with the low chon molecules implying that the microbial transformation of n containing organics became weak tang et al 2020 ever illustrated that nh was involved in the eps transformation and construction during sludge anaerobic digestion relating to some special organics such as amide unsaturated materials and aromatic ring structures the reconstructed eps can play important role in stimulating energy metabolism involved in redox reactions during anaerobic digestion furthermore the single pds pretreatment led to the generation of many chons compounds with high o c including c13h27o8n1s1 c14h31o9n1s1 c14h27o9n1s1 c16h27o8n1s1 c16h29o10n1s1 c19h29o9n1s1 figure s8 although these compounds could not be identified from the databases the presence of n s and high o c suggested the potential groups of nh2 sh and c o and these compounds were most likely the intermediate metabolites of s containing amino acid including cysteine hs ch2ch nh2 cooh and methionine ch3s ch2 2ch nh2 cooh park et al 2014 both cysteine and methionine are resistant to degradation during anaerobic digestion park et al 2014 recent studies shakeri yekta et al 2022 xiao et al 2022 have demonstrated that presence of cysteine can increase biomass activity with improved methanogenesis our findings on the important role of these molecules in fermentation performance as recognized from the pmd based network were in also agreement with the recent findings these chons molecules most likely belonging to cysteine or methionine possibly be potential regulators or indicators for controlling performance of sludge anaerobic process overall this study provided comprehensive profiles on dom transformation and the potential relationship to vfas production performance in the presence and absence of sludge pretreatment we believe that the results presented here could extend our understanding on the complex dom characteristics including their reactivity the chemoinformatic analysis including machine learning pmd based network of ft icr ms results in this study found that the improvement of vfas production with single pds pretreatment were mainly due to the following the reasons the improved decomposition of insoluble n containing structures altered dom transformation pathways with the improved humification of organics altered organic compounds reactivity with removing much more bio resistant molecules stable and highly connected dom molecular network which maintained the multiple interactions and metabolic pathways of microbes and improved generation of cysteine like keystone molecules these results provide biologically significant insights into deciphering the underlying mechanisms that improve fermentation performance the results also suggest that the chemoinformatic analysis from pmd based dom networks not only provides indicators or molecular fingerprint of the overall dom transformation patterns but also helps to recognize the biologically meaningful keystone molecules which potentially play important roles in the improving performance of microbial metabolism therefore this study recommends that the non target dom analysis using ft icr ms and subsequent chemoinformatic analysis such as machine learning and pmd based reactomics will be much powerful tool to further explore the comprehensive transformation of dom at molecular level the constructed pmd based network representing the reactive dom compositions and transformation patterns could provide a new molecular fingerprint the recognized keystone molecules based on the network analysis also can provide a cost effective and time saving method to find the potential regulator or indicator related to the performance however we acknowledge that some limitations need to be considered and further efforts are necessary for example only parts of dom can be extractable and detected e g 1000 da using esi ft icr ms analysis zhang et al 2021 much more batch and multi parameter experiments should be implemented to confirm the clear correlation between network properties and performance besides how to validate the constructed network especially removing the false positive edges is still an issue which needs further efforts traquete et al 2022 4 conclusions the high resolution mass spectrometry measurement combined with data mining using machine learning and pmd based reactomics were conducted to improve our understanding of dom transformation and its role in enhancing sludge fermentation with pds pretreatment in addition to the improved solubilization of insoluble organics this study on the dom transformation indicated that stable and highly connected dom molecular network improved humification of organics with high o c nosc and aimod altered dom molecular reactivity and appearance of cysteine like keystone molecules were in favor of improving sludge fermentation performance this kind of dom molecular fingerprint is meaningful to decipher the underlying mechanisms and find potential regulators or indicators relating to the process performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15268,understanding the composition and reactivity of dissolved organic matter dom at molecular level is vital for deciphering potential regulators or indicators relating to anaerobic process performance though it was hardly achieved by traditional analyses here the dom composition molecular reactivity and transformation in the enhanced sludge fermentation process were comprehensively elucidated using high resolution mass spectrometry measurement and data mining with machine learning and paired mass distance pmd based reactomics in the fermentation process for dewatered sludge persulfate pds pretreatment presented its highest performance in improving volatile fatty acids vfas production with the increase from 2 711 mg l to 3 869 mg l whereas its activation in the presence of fe as well as the hybrid of fe and activated carbon led to the decreased vfas production performance in addition to the conventional view of improved decomposition and solubilization of n containing structures from sludge under the sole pds pretreatment the improved vfas production was associated with the alternation of dom molecular compositions such as humification generating molecules with high o c n c s c and aromatic index aimod machine learning was capable of predicting the dom reactivity classes with 74 76 accuracy and found that these molecular parameters in addition to nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc were among the most important variables determining the generation or disappearance of bio resistant molecules in the pds pretreatment the constructed pmd based network suggested that highly connected molecular network with long path length and high diameter was in favor of vfas production especially nh related transformation was found to be active under the enhanced fermentation process moreover network topology analysis revealed that chons compounds e g c13h27o8n1s1 can be the keystone molecules suggesting that the presence of sulfur related molecules e g cysteine like compounds should be paid more attention as potential regulators or indicators for controlling sludge fermentation performance this study also proposed the non targeted dom molecular analysis and downstream data mining for extending our understanding of dom transformation at molecular level graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sludge fermentation dissolved organic matter fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms network machine learning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction though anaerobic process is a century old technique for the biomass treatment it is still one of the most frequently discussed negative emission methods in recent years farghali et al 2022 however the practical application of anaerobic process in industry still meets several limitations such as low efficiency and unstable performance cruz et al 2021 farghali et al 2022 developing new techniques and strategies to improve the performance and process monitoring are still the research hot spots for developing an advanced anaerobic process to fulfill this deep understanding what happens in anaerobically biological process especially the underling regulators and indicators relating to performance is quietly important wu et al 2021 but is still challenging indeed microbe can uptake the bioavailable organics for inner metabolism and also released some intermediates or functional organic molecules to maintain the whole metabolic activity of microbial community puig castellví et al 2022 the bioavailable organics intermediates from microbial metabolisms and also some recalcitrant organics compose the dissolved organic matters dom in anaerobic process deep understanding of the dom composition transformation and their underling relationship with performance is a promising way to explore the potential regulator and indicator sewage sludge is a kind of biowaste which is the byproduct of biological wastewater treatment process and its post treatment or disposal pose a great challenge all over the world dom from activated sludge is a heterogeneous mixture of organic substances such as those from the metabolites and cell lysis of microbes and some non biodegradable residues in influent wastewater xiao et al 2020 during the anaerobic process of sludge dom composition can be associated with microbes and their activities for example recent studies huang et al 2021 li et al 2021 proved that some fractions of dom especially humic like components showed toxic or inhibitory effects on anaerobes resulting in the decrease of methane production therefore it is major concern to understand the underlying mechanisms of how and why the performance changes in terms of dom composition undoubtedly more detailed characterization of the dom composition should be in the first place xiao et al 2020 recently some studies lu et al 2018a 2018b have characterized the refractory dom compounds in sludge anaerobic digestion with sludge pretreatment it was found that refractory humic substances and hydrophobic dom polycyclic steroid like matters alkanes and aromatics were the main components of residual after anaerobic digestion xiao et al 2022 investigated the effects of different pretreatments on the performance of anaerobic digestion of sludge showing that tryptophan protein aromatic protein i aromatic protein ii and cysteine were identified as the key dissolved organic nitrogen don responsible for methane production among those cysteine had bio resistant nature yet improved the degradation of acetic propionic and n butyric acids for methane production shakeri yekta et al 2022 also confirmed that even though cysteine was not degraded into methane its presence accelerated methane production these recent studies proved that the specific organic compounds in dom play important roles in anaerobic digestion process apart from these studies an emerging mass spectrometry ms technique namely ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry such as fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms which allows molecular formula identification due to its ultrahigh resolution and mass accuracy has revealed that dom from sludge was much complicated with the mixture of thousands of organic molecular formula s hao et al 2020 wu et al 2020 moreover s hao et al 2020 found that the carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules cram particularly those compounds containing 3 to 5 n atoms or 1 to 3 n atoms from different pretreated sludge were resistant in anaerobic digestion ft icr ms is potentially useful to unveil the information of thousands of dom compounds in a non target manner due to the high mass resolution and accuracy of ft icr ms it is possible to theoretically infer the potential microbial degradation pathways by which organic matter is produced or consumed cooper et al 2022 thus an emerging ft icr ms post analysis to decipher underling information from thousands of organic molecules is to identify the molecular connections potentially related to specific microbial transformations cooper et al 2022 based on the specific roles of dom molecules in the dom transformation it is reasonable to detect the most connected molecules as key roles for dom transformation these so called keystone molecules can be a potential regulators or indicators for controlling anaerobic process performance in detail based on the accurate mass of reactants and products in one reaction the paired mass distance pmd calculated by the mass difference of reactant and product between each reactant and product can be determined because the reactions generally occur with the loss or addition of some typical groups such as ch2 o nh etc the aggregate of pmds in one sample with complex dom molecules may present the overall reaction profiles called as pmd based reactomics yu and petrick 2020 by using this analysis microbially mediated reactions on dom was found to mainly include the oxidoreduction of ch nh2 groups transfer of nitrogenous groups and formation of the c n bond in wastewater treatment process wang et al 2021 however the pmd based reactomics is not yet used to decipher the dom transformation and further detecting potential regulators in the anaerobic process of biowaste therefore aiming at one of the enhanced anaerobic process of sludge this study focused on the anaerobic fermentation of sludge with activated peroxydisulfate pds treatments known as the novel advanced oxidation processes aops have been proved its ability in improving volatile fatty acids vfas production in the sludge fermentation zhou et al 2020 however the reasons for the improvement of vfas production possibly derived from the altered dom reactivity and some potential regulators have not been elucidated in literature furthermore combined with the molecular level information from ft icr ms analysis machine learning can be a powerful method to interpret the importance of molecular properties in determining dom reactivity biodegradable bio resistant and microbially derived product etc herzsprung et al 2020 to our knowledge though this new method has not been used in exploring dom reactivity in sludge treatment process it is a promising way to imply the potential relationship between dom molecular properties and their reactivity and also the impacts derived from pds pretreatment in such case this study employed ft icr ms pmd based reactomics and machine learning to comprehensively evaluate the dom composition and reactivity during anaerobic fermentation of sludge pretreated by persulfate oxidation and thus to provide a deep understanding of the transformation of molecules especially fate of bioavailable and recalcitrant compounds the changes of dom composition under the impacts of persulfate pretreatment and detecting the potential dom regulators from thousands of molecules this study gives further insights into the complex dom composition from pmd based reactomics which will be particularly important in extending our knowledge on the complex dom transformations and assisting process controlling to develop advanced anaerobic process 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge pretreatment and anaerobic fermentation dewatered excess sludge is commonly used in practical anaerobic digestion system with pretreatment for efficient digestion process therefore this study collected the dewatered excess sludge from a domestic wastewater treatment plant beijing china the sludge was diluted with deionized water to volatile solid vs of 5 26 and passed through 20 mesh sieve besides digested sludge vs of 2 63 from sludge anaerobic reactors was collected as inoculum in subsequent sludge fermentation a 100 ml sludge mixed with potassium persulfate pds pds and ferrous chloride fe pds fe or activated carbon pds fe ac was shaken at 180 rpm min and 35 c for 1 h the dosage of these chemicals was 120 mg pds g vs 150 mg ac g vs and the fe pds mass ratio of 1 25 after the pretreatment the treated sludge was mixed with inoculum sludge at the vs ratio of 1 2 and further incubated at shaker under 35 c before incubation nitrogen gas was injected into the bottles for 2 minutes to remove the air in head space of bottle during the anaerobic fermentation samples were collected every 2 days and injected nitrogen gas every time after the sampling 2 2 ft icr ms analysis the supernatants were separated from the samples of original sludge pretreated sludge named as raw pds fe and ac and fermented sludge at 8 d named as raw2 pds2 fe2 and ac2 by centrifuge at 6000 rpm for 15 min and filtered through 0 45 μm membrane the filtered supernatant was further diluted to toc 10 mg l with an ultrapure water avoiding protein precipitation then 50 ml of the diluted supernatant was acidified to ph 2 with formic acid and subjected to solid phase extraction spe using a ppl cartridge bondelute ppl 6 ml 1 g agilent technologies usa the spe steps were as follows 1 ppl cartridge was pre activated with 12 ml of methanol and acidified ultrapure water ph 2 in sequence 2 the samples were passed through ppl cartridge by gravity 3 the cartridge was rinsed with 12 ml of acidified ultrapure water ph 2 to remove salt and then dried with nitrogen gas 4 the cartridge was eluted with 12 ml of methanol and the eluate was stored at 20 c after freeze drying before ft icr ms analysis the dried eluate was solubilized by 1 ml 50 methanol aqueous solution as a classical spe method for dom this procedure using ppl cartridge had been optimized by dittmar et al 2008 and validated by hao et al 2017 z hao et al 2020 and obtained a relatively high extraction efficiency in terms of toc around 62 for water derived organic matter cao et al 2020 this method and ppl cartridge had also been frequently used for extracting dom from sludge samples cai et al 2022 hu et al 2022 dom composition was measured by using bruker s solarix type ft icr ms with the magnetic field strength of 15 0 t and esi negative ion mode a sodium formate solution 10 mm was used to externally calibrate the instrument and the known series of natural organic matter nom was used to internally recalibrate the spectra using quadratic mode in bruker dataanalysis 4 0 the mass spectrum peaks with a signal to noise ratio greater than 5 were used for molecular identification by using trfu algorithms and script fu et al 2020 in matlab mathworks inc natick ma the assigned formulae were categorized based on o c and h c ratios as follows i e lipids for h c 1 5 2 0 o c 0 0 3 aliphatic proteins for h c 1 5 2 2 o c 0 3 0 67 lignin cram like for h c 0 7 1 5 o c 0 1 0 67 carbohydrates for h c 1 5 2 4 o c 0 67 1 2 unsaturated hydrocarbons for h c 0 7 1 5 o c 0 0 1 aromatic structures for h c 0 2 0 7 o c 0 0 67 and tannin for h c 0 6 1 5 o c 0 67 1 0 liu et al 2021 2 3 machine learning and explanatory analysis machine learning was used to detect whether the molecule properties can determine their reactivity by using random forest and gradient boosting algorithm the dataset table s2 was split into training set and validation set randomly at the ratio of eight to two k fold cross validation k 5 was used to balance bias and variance between datasets baysian optimization method snoek et al 2012 was conducted to tune hyperparameters of the model which includes the number of trees maximum number of features maximum depth of each decision tree etc machine learning and baysian optimization were conducted by using scikit learn v1 1 in order to reveal the inner working of the model we apply game theory based method shapley additive explanation lundberg et al 2020 to interpret the machine learning results for all the molecules with different chemical fingerprint features we calculate shapley value of i t h feature which is defined by 1 ϕ i s x x i s x s 1 x δ i s where x is the set of all input features s is the subset of x exclusive of the feature x i and δ i s is the marginal contribution when x i is adopted back to s the shapley value is calculated to measure their individual contribution to the model for average impact on model output the feature importance is calculated by the mean shap value it is the absolute mean value of shap values of the i t h variable for all molecules which is defined as 2 mean shap k 1 n s ϕ i k n s where n s is the number of molecula the index mean shap is used to measure the average contribution of the input features on the model s categorization 2 4 pmd based network analysis pmd based network was built by searching for the specific pmd values existing in dom molecules in each sample for the lack of referenced pmds targeting the transformation reactions in anaerobic fermentation process which were firstly calculated as follows according to kegg database https www kegg jp we selected the pathways related to the metabolism of glycolysis and amino acid including ko00010 glycolysis gluconeogenesis ko00270 cysteine and methionine metabolism ko00280 valine leucine and isoleucine degradation ko00290 valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and ko00350 tyrosine metabolism in brief each reaction from these pathways was split into several reactant product pairs the paired mass distance was calculated from each reactant product pair besides we weighted each reactant product pair by calculating conserved atom ratio car as suggested by hafner and hatzimanikatis 2021 by this way we can screen the main reactant product pairs in each reaction with high car by ignoring the unimportant pairs containing some small molecule such as co ch4 h2o etc because these small molecules can not be detected from ft icr ms the reaction pairs containing these small molecules were not considered an in house r script was developed based on keggrest package v1 37 2 to find the reactions in each pathway and split into reactant product pairs we tested the robustness by reconstructing the reactions in pathway of ko00010 figure s3 b d if all of the generated pmds were used the whole connections can be fully reconstructed but screened the pmds by car such as car 0 22 or car 0 45 only the major reactant product connections were rebuilt by this way we selected the pmds from major reactant product pairs with 0 45 car 1 the resulted pmds in each pathway were provided in supporting information table s1 based on these referenced pmds the reactant product pairs in each sample were searched from mass difference between every two molecules with tolerance of 0 00001 the resulted reactant product pairs were further used to build the pmd based network by gephi 0 9 7 noticeably the referenced pmds also include the commonly considered pmds during general transformation ayala ortiz et al 2022 and oxidation process zhang et al 2021 therefore the selected pmds cover the general transformation reactions which are reasonably used in the raw sludge and pds pretreated sludge the network topology analysis including the results of network properties and roles of node was carried out by using microeco r package v0 10 1 liu et al 2021 details can be found in supporting information 2 5 other analysis chemical oxygen demand cod was determined by using the hach digestion and dr2800 spectrophotometer hach usa three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrices 3d eems of dom were collected using a fluorescence spectrometer hitachi japan the dreem and n way toolbox were used to perform eems

materials such as activated carbon ushani et al 2020 are the common catalysts to activate pds via so4 generation in this study by the single pds oxidation pretreatment vfas production from sludge fermentation was improved from 2711 mg l for the control to 3869 mg l for 6 d of anaerobic fermentation fig 1 pds activated by fe also showed the improved vfas production but the activation with fe ac decreased the vfas production compared to the control i e without pretreatment this improvement of vfas production was coincident with some previous studies luo et al 2020b zhou et al 2020 according to the changes of cod and soluble proteins after pretreatment table 1 it was found that single pds oxidation resulted in the increase of cod from 2870 mg l to 3610 mg l but under fe and fe ac activation cod was decreased to 2550 mg l and 1763 mg l respectively furthermore the results of soluble proteins clearly showed that upon the pds pretreatment with fe and fe ac activation soluble protein concentrations were decreased from 618 mg l of raw sludge to 485 mg l and 237 mg l respectively the impacts on dom under different pretreatments were also confirmed according to 3d eem analysis figure s1 in supporting information showing that pds oxidation obviously increased the release of soluble microbial products smp like protein but under fe and fe ac activation maximum fluorescence intensity of smp like protein was decreased these results suggested that single pds pretreatment is useful for improving vfas production from sludge anaerobic fermentation whereas over oxidation of pds pretreatment activated by fe especially fe ac seems to have the adverse impact the comparison of oxidative capacity of pds with that of activated pds further confirmed that pds treatment alone was unable to degrade soluble glucose phenol and bovine serum albumin whereas both phenol and bovine serum albumin were obviously degraded under ac activation though soluble glucose could not be degraded figure s2 supporting information therefore the results generally suggest that the single pds pretreatment was capable of solubilizing dom for improving vfas production but upon fe and fe ac activation over oxidation on the released soluble dom reversely decreased the vfas production noticeably the negative impacts from over oxidation of fe and fe ac activated pds pretreatment were inconsistent with some previous studies luo et al 2020a 2018 which found that pds under fe or other activators presented better performance for improving vfas production than single pds pretreatment this was possibly due to the different type of sludge used for example this study used the dewatered activated sludge while previous studies luo et al 2020a 2018 used the sludge from the secondary sedimentation tank without dewatering the dewatered sludge generally contained high concentration of soluble organic matters which can preferentially consume the generated so4 during pds activation thus leading to the oxidation of soluble organics which can be used for vfas production 3 2 overall insights into dom characters and their transformations 3 2 1 common characters of dom molecule compositions the examination of common dom compositional characteristics fig 2 indicated that the single pds pretreatment and its activation with fe and fe ac resulted in an increase in the proportion of chon compounds and a decrease for the cho compounds both in molecular numbers and relative intensities fig 2i j regarding the biochemical classes of dom molecules the proportion of aliphatic proteins was increased while proportion of lignin like cram compounds tended to be decreased after pds pretreatment as obvious from the relative intensities in fig 2l after anaerobic fermentation the aliphatic proteins were potentially converted into lignin like cram compounds due to the decreased proportion of aliphatic proteins and increased proportion of lignin like cram compounds these results suggested that pds pretreatment and its activation mainly resulted in the decomposition of n containing structures from microbial cell extracellular polymers and insoluble organics possibly into the smaller chon compounds while the other compounds especially cho containing organics were preferentially decomposed besides the pds pretreatment under fe and fe ac activation strongly reduced the numbers of detected dom molecules table 2 which was coincident with the results of decreased cod and vfas production performance the pds pretreatment facilitated the chemical decomposition of n containing structures prior to the anaerobic fermentation and this could overcome the rate limiting step for the biologically mediated hydrolysis of insoluble n containing organics wang et al 2021 the result was also consistent with our understanding that proteins are the main organic components in sludge with largest proportion 50 60 chen et al 2018 and can be the major organic components released from sludge chen et al 2019 furthermore another obvious impact from the pds pretreatment and its activation with fe was the formation of much higher o c compounds after anaerobic fermentation as shown in the van krevelen diagrams fig 2f for the generation of these high o c compounds the intensity weighted average for o c o cw was increased from 0 31 for the control to 0 42 for the pds pretreatment table 2 higher n cw and s cw were also observed under single pds oxidation compared to the anaerobic fermentation without pretreatment besides the pds pretreatment and its activation with fe tended to reduce aimodw while this index increased after anaerobic fermentation however pds pretreatment under fe ac activation did not influence o cw and aimodw these results suggest that the improved vfas production was coupled with the generation of dom compounds with high o c n c s c and aimod during anaerobic fermentation the high o c and aimod suggested that unsaturated like and aromatic like compounds were generated in agreement with the enhanced humification of dom during fermentation che et al 2021 furthermore tang et al 2020 pointed out that humification was an important process in reconstructing extracellular polymeric substances eps for aiding in energy metabolism involved in redox reactions during anaerobic digestion 3 2 2 classes of dom reactivity from the aforementioned results regarding the changes of overall dom characteristics pds pretreatment not only improved the release of soluble organics but also altered the molecular composition of released dom both of them were the main possible reasons for improving vfas production the pca result and upset diagram showed the overall difference and evolution of dom molecular composition in different samples fig 3 for the sludge fermentation without pretreatment about 928 unique molecules appeared before fermentation and about 2381 unique molecules were newly generated after fermentation the 928 unique molecules disappeared after fermentation implies that they were the potentially biodegradable organics while the newly generated 2381 unique molecules referred to the refractory bio resistant organics the pds pretreatment altered the dom molecules composition with 522 unique molecules in pretreated sludge and newly generated 603 unique molecules after the fermentation treatment suggesting that pds pretreatment could alter the dom reactivity by not only generating some new biodegradable or refractory organics but also leading to the removal of originally biodegradable or refractory organics as mentioned above pds pretreatment particularly led to the generation of organics with high o c n c s c and aimod can these molecule properties really infer the dom reactivity what kinds of molecules are biodegradable or refractory and what kinds of molecules tend to be newly generated or removed by pds pretreatment to answer these questions we classified the detected molecules into different classes according to the appearance and disappearance of molecules before and after anaerobic fermentation and also the difference after pds pretreatment as shown in figure s4 in supporting information the detected molecules from original sludge pds pretreated sludge and their fermented sludges were classified into 8 classes labeling as commonbio biodegraded molecules in both control and pds pretreatment process dismissbio biodegraded molecules appeared in the control but disappeared in pds pretreatment process releasedbio

pretreatment process commonresist bio resistant molecules in both control and pds pretreatment process and releasedresist bio resistant molecules not existed in the control but appeared in pds pretreatment process it was found that pds pretreatment could reduce originally bio resistant molecules at higher degree 3254 formulas releasing higher number of newly biodegradable compounds 1318 formulas than releasing newly bio resistant compounds 841 formulas and removing originally biodegradable compounds 1205 formulas 3 2 3 distinct molecule properties related to dom reactivity to detect whether the molecule properties can determine their reactivity figure s4 we used machine learning to predict the dom reactivity classes from the molecule properties totally 23 molecule properties were selected to predict its reactivity labeled as four classes i e releasedbio releasedresist dismissbio and dismissresist data shown in table s2 by using random forest and gradient boosting algorithm both models showed 74 76 prediction accuracy and indicated that the classes of dom reactivity under pds pretreatment can be related to the molecule properties the feature i e molecule properties importance in predicting the classes of dom reactivity was ranked as shown in fig 4 consistent with aforementioned findings o c n c aimod s c and nosc were tightly associated properties with the classes of dom reactivity as shown in fig 4 c d the distribution of resistant molecules can be well separated as functions of o c and nosc values the disappeared bio resistant molecules due to pds pretreatment labeled as dismissresist mainly aggerated into cluster with low o c average 0 31 and low nosc average 0 58 values whereas the newly released bio resistant molecules were distinct with high o c average 0 51 nosc average 0 03 and higher proportion of molecules with high aimod values for the biodegradable molecules distributions of the disappeared and newly generated molecules were highly overlapped showing lower o c average 0 43 and nosc average 0 41 besides parts of these biodegradable molecules tended to have lower aimod value average 0 16 than the bio resistant molecules average 0 19 the removal of originally refractory compounds and release of some new compounds with high o c and nosc also implies that the pds pretreatment altered the molecular transformation pathways both in natural environment kellerman et al 2015 and the bio reactors qiu et al 2020 nosc varying from low to high can be an indicator that aliphatics are degraded and condensing aromatic structure and lignin like dom will be dominant the increase of nosc during biological process can suggest the improved maturity of organics with more stable humic like structures liu et al 2020 in this study the generated high nosc molecules after fermentation with pds pretreatment was perhaps the result of improved oxidative reductive potential orp in anaerobic fermentation which was proved according to luo et al 2019 who found that pds pretreatment significantly increased the orp from 285 mv of the control to 225 mv in anaerobic fermentation reactors 3 3 pmd based reactomics of dom 3 3 1 dom reactive networks the constructed pmd networks figure s5 presented the dom molecules involved in the reaction pairs with specific mass difference these highly connected dom molecules showed that the proportion of reactive dom molecules in raw sludge was in the order of cho chos chon chop chons chosp chonp after anaerobic fermentation chon and chons compounds became the dominantly reactive dom components the pds pretreatment and its activation with fe and fe ac obviously increased the proportion of chon compounds via the enhanced decomposition of n containing structures from sludge after subsequent anaerobic fermentation chon and chons also became the dominantly reactive dom components however the dom transformation under pds pretreatments with fe and fe ac activation was different for the fe activation although chon was the dominant dom component after anaerobic fermentation the proportion of cho and chop was also increased for fe ac activation fewer chon compounds were detected and proportion of chop compounds was high after anaerobic fermentation these results suggest that the overall dom transformation patterns during anaerobic fermentation was invariant between the control and single pds pretreatment except for the improved decomposition and solubilization of n containing organics however the fe activation especially its combination with ac not only directly degrade the solubilized dom molecules decrease molecule numbers but also interfered in the dom transformation fewer chon compounds generated while proportion of chop compounds was high during anaerobic fermentation this impact on dom transformation from different pretreatment process was also revealed according to the changes of biochemical classes of the reactive dom molecules as shown in fig 5 the aliphatic protein was the most dominant dom component and also some lignin cram like compounds were in high proportion in raw sludge and sludge after the pretreatments but after anaerobic fermentation transformation of dom from aliphatic protein to lignin cram like compounds was particularly observed in the control and with single pds treatment however in the retarded vfas generation process under the pds pretreatment with fe especially fe ac activation the transformation from aliphatic protein to lignin cram like compounds was prevented with less proportion of lignin cram like compounds being generated after fermentation although the direct relationship between this dom conversion and vfas production performance has not yet been verified this pmd based network could be a molecular fingerprint suggesting a potential relationship between doms and performance in the fermentation processes further research is expected to establish new performance metrics based on such a molecular fingerprint 3 3 2 network topological analysis showing the difference of pmd based reactomics to further decipher the underlying information on the relationship between dom transformation and the anaerobic fermentation performance the topological analysis of the dom reactive network was carried out and presented in figure s6 from the overall network properties details in table s3 the average network path length showed significant pearson correlation r 0 964 p value 0 036 to the vfas production according to the data from the control and single pds pretreatment network diameter also showed high correlation coefficient but not significant correlation r 0 942 p value 0 058 with vfas production results of both the path length and network diameter indicated that a large and long chain connected dom reactions was in favor of maintaining high performance of vfas production moreover network topology analysis can further help us to find the keystone molecules module hubs and connectors in networks in the dom reactive networks which can assist in finding potential regulators and indicators the key nodes were detected in the large networks from the raw sludge pds pretreated sludge and after their anaerobic fermentation table s4 in supporting information the distribution of these keystone molecules figure s8 in supporting information revealed that all of the pretreatments resulted in the release of keystone dom molecules with high n c value indicating that the chemical pretreatment was powerful tool in releasing high n c molecules from the decomposition of n containing structures in sludge noticeably some other keystone molecules with medium n c 0 05 0 2 were generated in the undisturbed without pretreatment and highly improved anaerobic fermentation system with single pds pretreatment however in the anaerobic fermentation under pds pretreatment with fe and fe ac activation no such keystone molecules were found even though it still needs to be experimentally proven and tested how these recognized keystone molecules determine the functionality this statistical way is still the mostly popular and important to strengthen the repertoire of keystone species such as in microbiome banerjee et al 2018 to give an insight into the difference of the specific keystone molecules in different dom reactive network the subnetwork around the keystone molecule e g c16h20o5n2 was presented fig 6 c16h20o5n2 was the module hub in the dom reactive network after anaerobic fermentation of both original sludge and single pds pretreated sludge c16h20o5n2 also occurred in the original sludge and the sludge after single pds pretreatment and the activation with fe but after the pds pretreatment with fe ac activation c16h20o5n2 was disappeared it is hard to identify the definite compound name of c16h20o5n2 formula due to the unknown isomers without structure information but by searching it in biologically related database chebi https www ebi ac uk chebi init do only three candidate compounds can be found basing on current knowledge they are potentially metabolites derived from the amino acids based on the description in chebi database it was found that complex connections around c16h20o5n2 were formed after anaerobic fermentation compared to the dom in original sludge single pds pretreatment increased the connections compared to the original sludge but reduced the complexity after anaerobic fermentation however under the pds pretreatment with fe and fe ac activation the connections around c16h20o5n2 became particularly fewer especially under the pretreatment with fe ac activation c16h20o5n2 was disappeared even though pds pretreatment activated by fe improved the vfas production compared with the control it still made the decreased vfas production compared to the single pds pretreatment therefore considering the reduced performance of vfas production under pds pretreatment with fe and fe ac activation the complex and stable dom reactive connections around the key molecules seem to be important the complex interactions among microbial populations is important for process stability in anaerobic digestion wu et al 2016 metabolites from different microbial populations should be one of the important link bridge to their interactions for example narihiro et al 2018 suggested that organisms from multiple niches orchestrated their metabolic capacity in multiple interaction networks to effectively degrade pta wastewater our findings also proposed that the dom highly connected networks were important for improving vfas production performance 3 3 3 difference in dom reactivity based on the pmd appearance since the pmd value represents the specific reaction its variation in appearance partly indicates the changes of dom reactivity interestingly similar pmd distribution was observed in each sample figure s7 in supporting information low pmd values were always the dominant in the pmd based dom networks the pmd distribution in anaerobic fermentation with single pds treatment was similar to the sludge fermentation without pretreatment the control figure s7 b c however the pds pretreatment under fe ac activation resulted in much fewer number of pmds figure s7 d the dominant pmds element groups detected were c 12 da ch2 14 01565 da o 15 994915 da co 1 3 994915 da h2o 18 010565 da h2o 1 13 979265 da c2h4 28 0313 da ch2o 30 010565 da co 27 994915 da nh 15 010899 da c2h2o 42 010565 da c2h4o 44 026215 da nh3 17 026549 da h3o 1 n 1 031634 da o2 31 98983 da table 3 among these element groups ch2 o h2o 1 h2o c c2h4 and c2h4o were the most dominant in all dom reactive networks even after the pretreatment with fe ac activation however the proportion of nh group which was high in both the control and anaerobic fermentation of single pds pretreated sludge was decreased in the anaerobic fermentation under pretreatment with fe ac activation this result was also consistent with the low chon molecules implying that the microbial transformation of n containing organics became weak tang et al 2020 ever illustrated that nh was involved in the eps transformation and construction during sludge anaerobic digestion relating to some special organics such as amide unsaturated materials and aromatic ring structures the reconstructed eps can play important role in stimulating energy metabolism involved in redox reactions during anaerobic digestion furthermore the single pds pretreatment led to the generation of many chons compounds with high o c including c13h27o8n1s1 c14h31o9n1s1 c14h27o9n1s1 c16h27o8n1s1 c16h29o10n1s1 c19h29o9n1s1 figure s8 although these compounds could not be identified from the databases the presence of n s and high o c suggested the potential groups of nh2 sh and c o and these compounds were most likely the intermediate metabolites of s containing amino acid including cysteine hs ch2ch nh2 cooh and methionine ch3s ch2 2ch nh2 cooh park et al 2014 both cysteine and methionine are resistant to degradation during anaerobic digestion park et al 2014 recent studies shakeri yekta et al 2022 xiao et al 2022 have demonstrated that presence of cysteine can increase biomass activity with improved methanogenesis our findings on the important role of these molecules in fermentation performance as recognized from the pmd based network were in also agreement with the recent findings these chons molecules most likely belonging to cysteine or methionine possibly be potential regulators or indicators for controlling performance of sludge anaerobic process overall this study provided comprehensive profiles on dom transformation and the potential relationship to vfas production performance in the presence and absence of sludge pretreatment we believe that the results presented here could extend our understanding on the complex dom characteristics including their reactivity the chemoinformatic analysis including machine learning pmd based network of ft icr ms results in this study found that the improvement of vfas production with single pds pretreatment were mainly due to the following the reasons the improved decomposition of insoluble n containing structures altered dom transformation pathways with the improved humification of organics altered organic compounds reactivity with removing much more bio resistant molecules stable and highly connected dom molecular network which maintained the multiple interactions and metabolic pathways of microbes and improved generation of cysteine like keystone molecules these results provide biologically significant insights into deciphering the underlying mechanisms that improve fermentation performance the results also suggest that the chemoinformatic analysis from pmd based dom networks not only provides indicators or molecular fingerprint of the overall dom transformation patterns but also helps to recognize the biologically meaningful keystone molecules which potentially play important roles in the improving performance of microbial metabolism therefore this study recommends that the non target dom analysis using ft icr ms and subsequent chemoinformatic analysis such as machine learning and pmd based reactomics will be much powerful tool to further explore the comprehensive transformation of dom at molecular level the constructed pmd based network representing the reactive dom compositions and transformation patterns could provide a new molecular fingerprint the recognized keystone molecules based on the network analysis also can provide a cost effective and time saving method to find the potential regulator or indicator related to the performance however we acknowledge that some limitations need to be considered and further efforts are necessary for example only parts of dom can be extractable and detected e g 1000 da using esi ft icr ms analysis zhang et al 2021 much more batch and multi parameter experiments should be implemented to confirm the clear correlation between network properties and performance besides how to validate the constructed network especially removing the false positive edges is still an issue which needs further efforts traquete et al 2022 4 conclusions the high resolution mass spectrometry measurement combined with data mining using machine learning and pmd based reactomics were conducted to improve our understanding of dom transformation and its role in enhancing sludge fermentation with pds pretreatment in addition to the improved solubilization of insoluble organics this study on the dom transformation indicated that stable and highly connected dom molecular network improved humification of organics with high o c nosc and aimod altered dom molecular reactivity and appearance of cysteine like keystone molecules were in favor of improving sludge fermentation performance this kind of dom molecular fingerprint is meaningful to decipher the underlying mechanisms and find potential regulators or indicators relating to the process performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15269,rain induced surface runoff and seasons lead to short to medium term anomalies in combined storm and wastewater flows and temperatures and influence treatment processes in wastewater resource recovery facilities wrrf additionally the implementation of decentralized heat recovery hr technologies for energy reuse in buildings affect energy related processes across the urban water cycle and wrrfs heat inflows however quantitative insights on thermal hydraulic dynamics in sewers at network scale and across different scales are very rare to enhance the understanding of thermal hydraulic dynamics and the water energy nexus across the urban water cycle we present a modular framework that couples thermal hydraulic processes i on the surface ii in the public sewer network iii in households including in building hr systems and iv in lateral connections we validate the proposed framework using field measurements at full network scale present modelling results of extended time periods to illustrate the effect of seasons and precipitation events simultaneously and quantify the impact of decentralized hr devices on thermal hydraulics simulation results suggest that the presented framework can predict temperature dynamics consistently all year long including short to long term variability of in sewer temperature the study provides quantitative evidence that the impact of household hr technologies on wrrf inflow heat budgets is reduced by approximately 20 during wet weather periods in comparison to dry weather conditions the presented framework has potential to support multiple research initiatives that will improve the understanding of the water energy nexus pollutant dispersion and degradation and support maintenance campaigns at network scale graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability supplementary data can be found online at https doi xxxxx xxxxx 1 introduction rain induced surface runoff and seasons significantly influence the hydraulic loading but also water temperature dynamics in combined sewers treatment processes in wastewater resource recovery facilities wrrfs and consequently the water energy nexus across the urban water cycle therefore it is important to improve the understanding of thermal hydraulic dynamics across seasons including weather events such as precipitation in order to inform state authorities and support i common practices towards carbon neutral wastewater treatment 90 of wastewater contained energy is thermal energy hao et al 2019 ii the reuse of energy for building heating e g with the implementation of decentralized heat recovery technologies and iii consequently a reduction of energy consumption across the urban water cycle frijns et al 2013 elías maxil et al 2014 rainwater lead to fluctuations in the temperature of combined storm and wastewater flows caused by stormwater discharges in sewers montserrat et al 2013 these occasionally abrupt changes in temperature i e thermal shocks propagate through the sewer system and in case of sewer overflows may considerably affect receiving streams and their aquatic organisms caissie 2006 herb et al 2008 cao et al 2016 ketabchy et al 2019 tsang et al 2021 in addition temperature fluctuations can affect pollutant dispersion of heavy metals li et al 2013 and illicit drug degradation thai et al 2014 in sewer systems in order to predict thermal shocks in sewer and drainage systems a model that couples thermal hydraulic processes on the surface and subsurface is required ketabchy et al 2018 2019 proposed an approach to model the routing of stormwater and heat load through urbanized watersheds however the main drawback of the coupling approach presented by ketabchy et al is that it does not maintain heat load balances across urbanized watersheds other available models for modelling thermal loading of stormwater runoff are trmpave van buren et al 2000 and the thermal urban heat export tool roa espinosa et al 2003 however these models have not been extensively validated decentralized heat recovery hr technologies are an inexpensive and easy to implement solution for energy reuse in buildings hadengue et al 2022c they include systems such as vertical and horizontal water heat exchangers in showers or sinks and heat pumps amongst other systems nagpal et al 2021 hadengue et al 2022 and their performance can be affected by climate conditions and seasons hadengue et al 2022c for instance during warm seasons there are less hot showers which are events with a large energy consumption share in households hadengue et al 2020 compared against cold seasons the implementation of decentralized hr devices impact not only energy related processes across the urban water cycle such as the efficiency of heat pumps installed in precincts or subcatchments golzar and silveira 2021 but also wrrf heat inflows sitzenfrei et al 2017 in their research the authors developed modelling tools based on data driven algorithms stochastic demand approaches and mathematical modelling to quantify the effect of heat recovery technologies these studies concluded that there are competitive interactions between in building and urban level heat recovery systems and shared their growing concern about these practices and the impact on wrrfs and suggested that further legislation is needed to achieve improved energy efficiency at the city level however the authors did not consider important elements such as private lateral connections pipes connecting buildings to the public sewers and topographic conditions a different approach has been presented by hadengue et al 2021 where physical and stochastic processes were coupled to estimate the thermal hydraulic dynamics of coupled sewer networks households and lateral connections hadengue et al 2021 identified thermal damping mechanisms due to the existence of lateral connections and hypothesized about the impact of decentralized heat recovery strategies on wrrf heat inflows across seasons however it remains unclear how during wet weather periods in building heat recovery systems affect the wastewater temperature at the wrrf furthermore there is a lack of investigations on the simultaneous effect of stormwater seasons and decentralized hr technologies on wrrf inflow heat budgets lower temperatures in sewers imply potential nitrification deficiencies wanner et al 2005 and temperature layering in the sludge settling winkler et al 2012 liao et al 2011 in addition seasonal characteristics such as ambient and soil temperature influence domestic wastewater treatment as well for instance gruber et al 2020 detected a strong seasonal profile of nitrous oxide n2o emission from wastewater treatment at wrrfs furthermore arora kazmi 2015 concluded that the highest biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency and the best performance of pathogen removal indicators were accomplished during seasons with high temperature therefore the accurate prediction of influent temperature dynamics coupled with wrrf wide energy modelling concepts arnell et al 2021 would thus enable wrrf operators to optimize treatment capacity management in the present study we aim at quantifying the simultaneous effect of precipitation seasons and decentralized heat recovery technologies on combined storm wastewater temperatures across sewer networks up to the inflow into the wrrf therefore we present a framework that models the complex coupling of thermal hydraulic processes on the surface across pervious and impervious surfaces the subsurface sewer networks households including in building heat recovery systems and lateral connections linking households to the public sewer network the novelty of this framework lies in the technical integration of surface subsurface thermal hydraulic processes with stochastic water consumption models and domestic hot water systems kenway et al 2013 hadengue et al 2020 to simulate extended periods i e more than a few days and illustrate the combined effect of seasons and precipitation events on in sewer temperatures in addition we validate the proposed framework against field measurements at full network scale present modelling results of extended time periods including precipitation events and investigate the thermal hydraulic influence of decentralized heat recovery devices in sewer networks under both wet and dry weather conditions the manuscript is structured as follows section 2 describes the proposed framework including details on each modelling module and how the different components of the framework are coupled section 3 details the validation case the specifics of the validation method and how the impact of heat recovery during wet weather has been evaluated the section also provides details on reference measurements and performance indicators utilized section 4 presents the validation results and a critical discussion of the limitations of the proposed modelling framework section 5 encompasses the results and discussion of the performed analysis on the impact of decentralized heat recovery devices on wrrf heat inflows during wet weather section 6 includes detailed references for potential uses and future work of the modelling framework 2 model framework with the aim of modelling thermal shocks on wastewater from stormwater runoff and seasonal variations with high spatiotemporal discretization we developed a python matlab based modelling framework that computes thermal hydraulics of stormwater runoff wastewater produced in domestic hot water systems wastewater transported in lateral connections and routed through main sewers the masterfile of the framework is written in python and launches all the different modelling tools and matlab executable files required to perform simulations the framework integrates several calculation modules minuhet waterhub and swmm heat minuhet is a fortran computational tool designed with the purpose of simulating flow and heat content of stormwater surface runoff through a watershed and drainage networks herb et al 2008a b 2009 janke et al 2009 2013 waterhub is a stochastic water demand model and thermal hydraulic simulation tool of domestic hot water systems hadengue et al 2019 2020 written in python and the modelica language mattsson and elmqvist 1997 swmm heat is an open source code that enhances the epa swmm model with the necessary thermal components to simulate the evolution of temperature in drainage networks during dry and wet weather conditions figueroa et al 2021 the matlab executable files developed for this framework perform tasks related to synchronization of time series mixing of flows and temperature and post processing of i o files 2 1 the waterhub minuhet swmm heat framework the established framework couples automatic modelling of household water consumption time series household lateral connections and thermal hydraulic processes of stormwater runoff and routing across combined sewer systems the framework can simulate various scenarios at households or sewer level including the implementation of decentralized or centralized heat recovery devices fig 1 shows how the modelling of various compartments of the water urban cycle from households to the inflow into the wrrf are coupled in the framework in the next subsections we detail the processes in each of the framework s modules and how they are connected as part of a larger simulation workflow 2 2 modelling household thermal hydrographs the waterhub framework we use the waterhub modelling framework hadengue et al 2019 2020 to obtain thermal hydrographs of household water consumption behaviours i e wastewater temperature and flow resolved time series of single households the coupling between waterhub and swmm heat is already validated in hadengue et al 2021 as part of a study aiming at assessing the thermal impact of private lateral connections and the implementation of decentralized heat recovery strategies at catchment scale the main limitation of waterhub is the inability to adapt water demand patterns depending on the season and day of the week i e weekdays and weekends in previous studies the maximum time period studied was five days in the present investigation we extend the temporal scope of thermal hydraulic simulations to one month in hadengue et al 2021 the modelling of hot water systems within households was simulated using stochastic water demand patterns as input to a first principle thermodynamic model the longer simulation time periods of the present study though do not allow repeating the procedure due to the much larger overall computation time in order to generate monthly flow and temperature time series for a large number of households we implemented a new procedure original five day simulations from hadengue et al 2021 were split and merged into a dataset of daily time series monthly time series are then produced by stitching together daily time series randomly selected from the dataset thereby largely reducing the computation time further details about the implementation and reproducibility of the results obtained with this approach are described in the supplementary information si section a and in the framework validation section section 3 3 2 3 from a swmm heat input file to surface thermal runoff simulations with minuhet aiming at minimal parametrization work for future users we developed a matlab routine which performs automatic set up and execution of minuhet simulations based on a typical swmm swmm heat input file inp file here we summarize the main steps implemented in the matlab routine 1 information regarding subcatchment properties e g area width percentage of pervious and impervious surfaces slope land use and outlet node is collected from the swmm swmm heat input file 2 the extracted information is processed and individual files representing pervious and impervious areas with dat format required by minuhet are created for each subcatchment 3 air temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed precipitation and cloud cover fraction datasets are collected and synchronized and a storm file utilized by minuhet for the simulations is generated herb et al 2010 4 a batch file is created for each subcatchment to automatically launch minuhet pervious impervious and mixing simulations the batch file is then executed and runoff flow and temperature information of each subcatchment is stored in individual files 5 simultaneously a runoff only simulation is performed with swmm heat in order to obtain the outflows of each subcatchment during precipitation events 6 once all simulations are finished a final step merges thermal hydraulic flows from minuhet and swmm heat since different subcatchments could have the same outlet node it is necessary to combine flows swmm heat and temperature minuhet datasets generated in the previous steps into a unique flow temperature time series for each node the process above generates two files for each subcatchment outlet containing flow and temperature time series these files represent the surface runoff compartment in the final catchment simulation with swmm heat a detailed representation of the framework folder structure is shown in si fig 3 2 4 merging water and heat flows from surface runoff and households the last step before the final routing simulation includes the synchronization and aggregation of previously generated temperature and flow time series of household lateral connections with surface runoff based on the information provided in the swmm heat input file consequently two time series files are obtained that represent total heat flow temperature and flow that enters the sewer network at each inflow node in addition swmm heat has the ability to include groundwater heat flow infiltration into the system as time patterns the mixing process of different inflows i e time series and time patterns at the network node scale is handled internally by swmm heat 3 material and methods 3 1 network description 3 1 1 the fehraltorf swmm heat model in this investigation we focus on the reproduction of wastewater temperature dynamics along the main collector in the sewer network of the swiss municipality of fehraltorf located 12 km northeast of zurich switzerland which comprises 27 1 km of sewer pipes in this network system the wastewater from fehraltorf and two neighbouring municipalities is conveyed to the central wrrf design capacity 12 000 pe for more information regarding the implementation of the infrastructure data in swmm heat inflows from neighbouring municipalities groundwater infiltration and industrial wastewater inflows we refer to hadengue et al 2021 and figueroa et al 2021 during dry weather conditions transfer flows from the two adjacent municipalities account for 36 of the total wastewater inflow at the treatment plant groundwater infiltration contributes up to 15 not considering seasonal fluctuations industrial wastewater to about 21 and residential wastewater from households located within the municipality of fehraltorf up to 28 3 1 2 field measurements and climate data reference data were collected during a long term monitoring campaign that operates measurement stations with dual in sewer sensors for the simultaneous recording of wastewater and sewer headspace temperature at multiple locations across the fehraltorf catchment further details including sensor distribution within the network are described in blumensaat et al 2021 and figueroa et al 2021 minuhet and swmm heat coupled simulations require information regarding solar radiation relative humidity cloud cover wind speed atmospheric temperature and precipitation these data are collected from sensors deployed in the subcatchment and in the surrounding areas precipitation measurements with a frequency report of one minute are collected using a weight based all weather precipitation gauge fa ott pluvio ii that measures the amount and intensity of rain solar radiation wind speed air temperature and relative humidity data are recorded with a one minute resolution employing a compact weather station fa luftt ws 700 that allows measuring multiple parameters cloud cover information is provided by meteoswiss and collected with a ten minutes resolution from the surrounding area of kloten zurich app 10 km west of fehraltorf after collecting the data the data are aggregated and synchronized with a one minute resolution and all inconsistencies are filtered with a hampel filter si fig 4 a storm data file required by minuhet is then automatically generated and utilized to perform thermal hydraulic runoff simulations 3 1 3 soil characteristics and soil temperature month long simulations require adequate soil temperatures values reflecting seasonal dynamics throughout the year since swmm heat requires a monthly soil temperature pattern we determined average monthly soil temperature from soil temperature measurements and simulation studies from a location near fehraltorf si fig 6 the soil type is sandy clay loam and soil thermal hydraulic properties values required by swmm heat and minuhet are presented in table 1 the green ampt infiltration method rossman and huber 2016 was used in the swmm heat and minuhet simulations 3 2 performance indicators the modelling results considered for the comparison with field measurements are the bulk liquid temperature and the flow at different locations in the main sewer the metrics used for the assessment of the simulation results include the maximum average root mean square error rmse and the ratio of the rmse to the standard deviation of measured data also named rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr 1 r s r i 1 n y i o b s y i s i m 2 i 1 n y i o b s y i m e a n 2 rsr is a metric proposed by moriasi et al 2007 for hydrologic simulations that incorporates the benefits of rmse error index statistics and includes a normalization factor 3 3 framework validation the validation study focused on four different periods of 20 30 days in 2019 see table 2 the selection of these periods is distinct and motivated to reflect both different seasonal characteristics and representative rainfall events we compare modelling results with stationary measurements at five different locations see sensor location in si fig 7 in addition three analyses are performed to provide insights regarding i the impact of weekdays and weekends on rsr and rsme metrics ii the effect of short and long term precipitation events on combined waste and stormwater temperature in sewers and iii the spatial distribution of temperatures in sewers during wet weather in addition in order to accurately estimate monthly flow and temperature time series for all households in fehraltorf we implemented the stitching procedure described in section 2 2 for each simulated scenario detailed in hadengue et al 2021 we produced a dataset of around 20 000 different daily time series 32 000 for the reference scenario to account for the number of inhabitants in a single household each dataset was further split into five separate categories of ascending total flow volumes representing systems from one person up to five people households each of the 4046 households in fehraltorf was then simulated by selecting a number of inhabitants based on the swiss household distribution bundesamt für statistik 2018 and randomly selecting daily time series from the corresponding category in the dataset in this study we selected a time resolution of three seconds for the household lateral connection system a value found as a good compromise to minimize computation time while retaining information from high frequency short water draw offs minuhet simulations are performed with a time resolution of 1 min during wet conditions and 5 min during dry conditions swmm heat simulations of the fehraltorf sewer network are conducted with a time step of 15 s we tested the new procedure thoroughly to guarantee the statistical significance of the generated time series with data from hadengue et al 2021 we studied the convergence of the 95 interval and median of the heat budget curve for various dataset sizes 250 500 1000 and 2000 available daily time series full results are shown in si section a even with a low number of available daily time series 250 time series convergence was acceptable compared to larger datasets we thus conclude that the size of our datasets are adequate to represent the thermodynamics of single households over monthly time periods 3 4 wet weather implications on heat recovery following the framework validation concept we study the impact of decentralized heat recovery hr technologies during wet weather this investigation aims to evaluate the influence of different household market penetration of hr technologies on temperatures and heat budgets at the wrrf the hr device included in our analyses is a shower drain heat exchanger that is modelled as a spatially discretized counter flow heat exchanger and behaves relatively similarly to commercial heat exchangers with a power of around 7 5 kw hadengue et al 2021 two consecutive weekday periods of 5 days and market penetration shares of 0 reference scenario 25 h r 25 50 h r 50 75 h r 75 and 100 h r 100 of all households located in fehraltorf are studied the first weekday period encompasses the dry days between 4 march 2019 and 9 march 2019 where a small number of precipitation events are detected and the second period includes the wet days between 11 march 2019 and 16 march 2019 that has numerous precipitation occurrences the study includes the analysis of inflow temperatures at the wrrf for the different market penetration scenarios of hr systems installed in households in addition we compare results with available guidelines for the introduction of centralized heat recovery systems as a reference maximum temperature reduction due to the introduction of centralized hr devices recommended by the literature is defined as reference temperature minus 1 k müller et al 2009 and additionally temperatures are not allowed to fall below 10 ⁰c as required by authorities in switzerland awel 2010 lastly in order to quantify the thermal dampening effect of wet weather conditions we compute the difference in heat budgets received by wrrf for all heat recovery scenarios during dry and wet days in this study heat budget hb is calculated as 2 h b t 0 t m t t r e f c p d t with m the mass flux k g s t the fluid temperature at the inflow of the wrrf k t r e f the reference temperature 273 15 k c p the water heat capacity k j k g k and t the time secs 4 validation process results and discussion 4 1 modelling the impact of rain and seasonal soil temperatures on in sewer temperature dynamics four periods described in table 2 are simulated and their performance indicators calculated fig 2 shows the observed and modelled temperature dynamics across several locations during period 1 with weekends and precipitation events clearly identified simulation results show that the model adequately reproduces observed in sewer temperature dynamics during the months of february 2019 and march 2019 and captures the notable temperatures changes generated by precipitation events further comparisons between field measurements and simulated flows and temperatures in additional periods are presented in si figures 8 14 rsr and rmse values are similar in all periods analysed suggesting that the proposed network enables the simultaneous modelling of seasonal soil temperatures and thermal shocks in order to enhance our understanding of the main sources of discrepancies between measurements and simulation results we differentiate between weekend and weekdays table 3 presents the obtained rsr and rmse values for temperature values during weekdays wd weekends we and overall for period 1 across five distinct locations in the catchment results suggest that the simulation framework represents temperatures dynamics during weekdays with higher precision than during weekends tables with the same characteristic i e better performance of the model for weekdays compared with weekends for flow and temperature for the three remaining periods are presented in si table 2 8 one of the main characteristics of the proposed framework is its ability to estimate thermal shocks at the wrrf due to precipitation events across sewer networks as exemplified by two wet periods shown in fig 3 the figure shows how short and long term precipitations episodes influence wrrf inflow temperatures i during 13 march 2019 several short term rainfalls reduce inflow temperatures at the wrrf rapidly by several degrees while returning to normal temperatures in approximately 1 hour ii long term precipitations are observed through 15 march 2019 and 8 may 2019 reducing temperatures across the network for several hours when compared with dry weekdays while daily dry weather patterns are very similar for the two periods the globally different temperature levels reflect seasonal differences lower in march higher in may in order to capture the spatial distribution of thermal hydraulic processes during a dry and wet day at similar times we introduce the network heat maps in fig 4 it represents the hourly average of temperature and flow at 12pm for two close weekdays i 12 march 2019 a typical dry day and ii 15 march 2019 a weekday that includes a rainfall event we notice that large amounts of cold surface runoff is routed through the network it increases the flow across the sewer network line thickness but reduces the temperature considerably colour coding this representation exemplifies that next to increase of hydraulic loading a drop in inflow temperatures at the wrrf can be expected 4 2 discussion the validation study presented in the section 4 1 allows for the identification of the main assets and limitations of the developed framework while comparing with field measurements in a real world setting simulated flow and temperature dynamics in sewers were in good agreement with reference measurements in fehraltorf during weekdays in addition similar performance indicator values were obtained across all studied periods suggesting that the modelling framework can predict temperature dynamics consistently all year long furthermore the effects of short and long term precipitation events in temperature dynamics in sewer networks are well captured as shown in fig 3 lastly since swmm heat is a distributed heat transfer model for sewer networks the prospect of obtaining heat maps e g fig 4 during all seasons and weather events could be of large interest for utility managers to optimize the operation and maintenance of the sewer infrastructure and treatment performance at the wrrf the results of the validation study also assist in the identification of the main limitations of the presented framework the detected main sources of discrepancies between simulated and observed thermal dynamics and their potential solutions are weekends and national local holidays water consumption behaviours during weekends and holidays is significantly different from working days weekends holidays measurements exhibit an increased deviation and a shift in time of morning peak values i e people take morning showers later and the peak is more diffuse in comparison with weekdays which is in agreement with the literature butler 1993 friedler et al 1996 in addition waterhub does not adapt water demand patterns depending on the season e g it does not take in account that there are less hot showers in summer compared with winter since waterhub does not differentiate between workings days weekends and national local holidays it is recommended that future implementations include algorithms that adjust consumption behaviours depending on the day of the week and the season soil temperature soil temperatures in swmm heat are defined as monthly patterns i e soil temperatures are the same across the whole month this is somehow coarse and does not account for intra monthly variations of soil temperatures which could result in low flow e g during night time temperatures being considerable different across the same month for instance soil temperatures in february varies from 6⁰c to 7 8⁰c increasing considerably towards the end of the month si fig 6 afterwards during the month of march soil temperatures are updated and a much better agreement is obtained between simulation and observations values of nigh time temperatures future developments in swmm heat will include the option to define soil temperatures as time series morning peaks during the morning large differences between measured and simulated temperatures are observed this artefact can be explained by an underestimation of the number of lateral connections and the use of showering habits of a different spatio temporal context and its potential solutions have been discussed in depth in hadengue et al 2021 5 wet weather implications on heat recovery 5 1 impact of decentralized heat recovery technologies on wrrf heat budgets during wet weather conditions fig 5 shows temperature dynamics at the wrrf inlet for different market penetration of decentralized heat recovery technologies of the two five day periods previously selected results reveal that temperature differences between the hr scenarios analysed are larger during the morning peak and negligible during overnight time periods there are no clear differences on combined waste and stormwater temperature amidst the dry and wet periods suggesting that a more detailed analysis is required in order to quantify their impact on temperatures and heat budgets at the wrrf which we present hereafter average inflow temperatures at the wrrf during the selected dry and wet weekdays were clustered in four daily time periods overnight 12am 6am morning 6am 12pm afternoon 12pm 6pm and evening 6pm 12am and market penetration of household hr technologies as displayed in fig 6 in this figure we observe that there exist larger temperature reductions between the reference scenario and hr scenarios during the morning and overnight periods than in the afternoon and evening periods a temperature limit line is used as a reference and illustrates the maximum temperature reduction allowed by literature recommendations and governmental policies for centralized hr technologies even in the 100 market penetration scenario average temperatures are never below the temperature limit threshold during dry and wet periods a similar figure that considers maximum inflow temperature values instead of average values is displayed in si figure 15 and shows that maximum temperatures in certain hr scenarios and specific daily time periods are below the recommended temperature limit however it is important to note that the temperature limit threshold usually refers to average temperature not to instantaneous temperature and maximum temperatures are always well above the 10⁰c limit considering that average temperatures are in all situations above the temperature limit threshold we proceed to quantify the impact on the total heat budget received by the wrrf during selected dry and wet weekdays we expect that the effect of decentralised hr devices on the inflow heat budget at wrrfs will be attenuated during wet weather conditions in contrast with dry weather periods due to the large volume of stormwater introduced into the drainage system in this analysis we compute the difference in total heat budget at the wrrf between the reference scenario and each hr scenario across the two time periods considered fig 7 results suggest that during wet weather conditions the impact of household hr technologies is reduced by approximately 20 in comparison with dry weather conditions for each scenario analysed for a more comprehensive analysis of heat losses across households lateral connections and sewer networks during dry conditions see hadengue et al 2021 5 2 discussion stormwater in combined sewers dampens the thermal effect of household hr technologies at the inlet of the wrrf daily average temperature values show that during the afternoon and evening periods and wet weather no significant temperatures differences between the hr and reference scenarios are detected therefore no negative effect on water treatment processes at the wrrf is expected overnight and morning periods display larger temperature differences at the wrrf due to the introduction of decentralized hr devices in comparison with the reference scenario however these drops are less noticeable during wet weather than during dry weather due to the dampening effect of stormwater in the system despite this dampening effect is expected it has not been quantified in the literature and the results obtained shed some light on this very important aspect overall our study shows that the implementation of decentralized heat recovery technologies have a lower influence on the wrrf heat budget inflows during wet weather in comparison with dry weather however further studies investigating different network topography characteristics seasons climates combination of decentralized heat recovery technologies and consumption habits should be performed to extend the validity of the previous statement 6 potential applications and future work the coupled framework between waterhub minuhet swmm heat enables deeper and long term investigations of thermal hydraulic dynamics in sewers in the following examples we foster synergies between this framework and additional areas of application high temperatures increase the release rates of heavy metals e g zinc copper chromium lead from stormwater sediments li et al 2013 the proposed simulation framework has the ability to predict thermal hydraulic dynamics of sewers systems during precipitation events for instance simulation results can enhance pollutant dispersion modelling of heavy metals from storm sewer sediment across the sewer network in addition the framework offers a strong support for the investigation of illicit drug degradation in sewers due to temperature thai et al 2014 mccall et al 2016 and the degradation of wastewater compounds warith et al 1998 the presented framework has the potential to support detection campaigns of infiltration and inflow i i of extraneous water in sewer systems beheshti sægrov 2018 2019 performed fibre optic distributed temperature sensing dts to identify i i sources in trondheim norway in the study the authors observed the effect of rainfall derived i i during warm and cold days since dts requires high initial costs and installation and operation performed by highly qualified worker we suggest to complement dts with thermal hydraulic simulations performed by swmm heat comparing temperature data from sensors with simulation results will support and offer robust evidence for i i detection in addition the waterhub minuhet swmm heat framework will assist in the assessment of rainfall derived i i effects and inform stakeholders prior to develop future sewer rehabilitation plans furthermore swmm heat has the ability to model thermal shocks in sewer systems and in consequence enables practitioners to design adequate campaigns towards mitigations of biofilm growth and biofilm thermal resistance thermal shocks have been identified as a successful technique to prevent biofilm formation and their adverse effect on plate heat exchanges of treated sewage source heat pump systems chang et al 2017 the waterhub minuhet swmm heat framework reproduces consistently temperatures throughout seasons and weather events and offers a strong platform to pursue optimization studies for heat recovery placement in networks optimal placement of heat recovery systems in the sewer network requires a detailed examination of heat losses across the sewer network surrounding soil of a sewer pipe and headspace temperature are two major sources of heat loss for sewer wastewater nagpal et al 2021 figueroa et al 2021 hadengue et al 2021 and of the impact of local wastewater heat recovery using heat exchangers across different seasons golzar and silveira 2021 saagi et al 2022 the proposed simulation framework can assists stakeholders and practitioners to make inform decisions regarding optimal investment planning strategies since it allows the creation of scenarios to determine financial feasibility depending on the market penetration of decentralized hr systems simulation results obtained with the proposed framework could update wrrf wide energy modelling concepts arnell et al 2021 with influent heat fluxes in order to quantify the effect of wastewater heat recovery systems precipitation events and seasons in nitrogen removal processes and n2o emissions hanaki et al 1992 aeration requirements and operative costs furthermore in combination with strategies to increase the process performance during low wastewater temperature periods e g regulation of operational parameters bioaugmentation biofilm technology chemical phosphorus precipitation and novel process technologies zhou et al 2018 negative impacts of cold thermal shocks on wastewater treatment processes could be attenuated pursuing these investigations requires close collaborative research between different sectors of the urban water cycle energy urban infrastructure and policy makers the waterhub minuhet swmm heat framework has the capacity to inform these sectors with details regarding the thermal hydraulic processes in the subsurface and surface of the built environment however further advancements are needed for instance modelling the influence of low impact developments on the temperature in urban drainage systems or the introduction of soil temperatures as time series is not possible with the presented framework in the current status further developments include the addition of a surface thermal model in swmm heat that maintains heat budget and a simplification of the simulation framework i e minuhet will not be needed in addition economical aspects of heat recovery are outside the scope of this investigation but will be the subject of future research initiatives 7 conclusions the main findings can be summarized as follows a framework for automatic modelling of stochastic household water consumption time series household private lateral connections and thermal hydraulic processes of stormwater runoff and routing across combined sewer systems is presented the framework couples three modelling tools waterhub minuhet swmm heat embedded in a hybrid python matlab environment thus it enables the simulation of various management scenarios at households and sewer level including the implementation of decentralized or centralized heat recovery devices the validation shows a similarly high model performance across all seasons suggesting that the presented framework can predict temperature dynamics consistently all year long the effects of short and long term precipitation events on thermal hydraulic dynamics in the sewer network are well captured a study of the impact of household hr technologies on thermal hydraulic inflows at wrrfs during dry and wet weather is presented results suggest that the burden of household hr technologies on wrrf heat budget inflows is reduced by approximately 20 during wet weather periods in comparison with dry weather conditions the presented framework exhibits

15269,rain induced surface runoff and seasons lead to short to medium term anomalies in combined storm and wastewater flows and temperatures and influence treatment processes in wastewater resource recovery facilities wrrf additionally the implementation of decentralized heat recovery hr technologies for energy reuse in buildings affect energy related processes across the urban water cycle and wrrfs heat inflows however quantitative insights on thermal hydraulic dynamics in sewers at network scale and across different scales are very rare to enhance the understanding of thermal hydraulic dynamics and the water energy nexus across the urban water cycle we present a modular framework that couples thermal hydraulic processes i on the surface ii in the public sewer network iii in households including in building hr systems and iv in lateral connections we validate the proposed framework using field measurements at full network scale present modelling results of extended time periods to illustrate the effect of seasons and precipitation events simultaneously and quantify the impact of decentralized hr devices on thermal hydraulics simulation results suggest that the presented framework can predict temperature dynamics consistently all year long including short to long term variability of in sewer temperature the study provides quantitative evidence that the impact of household hr technologies on wrrf inflow heat budgets is reduced by approximately 20 during wet weather periods in comparison to dry weather conditions the presented framework has potential to support multiple research initiatives that will improve the understanding of the water energy nexus pollutant dispersion and degradation and support maintenance campaigns at network scale graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability supplementary data can be found online at https doi xxxxx xxxxx 1 introduction rain induced surface runoff and seasons significantly influence the hydraulic loading but also water temperature dynamics in combined sewers treatment processes in wastewater resource recovery facilities wrrfs and consequently the water energy nexus across the urban water cycle therefore it is important to improve the understanding of thermal hydraulic dynamics across seasons including weather events such as precipitation in order to inform state authorities and support i common practices towards carbon neutral wastewater treatment 90 of wastewater contained energy is thermal energy hao et al 2019 ii the reuse of energy for building heating e g with the implementation of decentralized heat recovery technologies and iii consequently a reduction of energy consumption across the urban water cycle frijns et al 2013 elías maxil et al 2014 rainwater lead to fluctuations in the temperature of combined storm and wastewater flows caused by stormwater discharges in sewers montserrat et al 2013 these occasionally abrupt changes in temperature i e thermal shocks propagate through the sewer system and in case of sewer overflows may considerably affect receiving streams and their aquatic organisms caissie 2006 herb et al 2008 cao et al 2016 ketabchy et al 2019 tsang et al 2021 in addition temperature fluctuations can affect pollutant dispersion of heavy metals li et al 2013 and illicit drug degradation thai et al 2014 in sewer systems in order to predict thermal shocks in sewer and drainage systems a model that couples thermal hydraulic processes on the surface and subsurface is required ketabchy et al 2018 2019 proposed an approach to model the routing of stormwater and heat load through urbanized watersheds however the main drawback of the coupling approach presented by ketabchy et al is that it does not maintain heat load balances across urbanized watersheds other available models for modelling thermal loading of stormwater runoff are trmpave van buren et al 2000 and the thermal urban heat export tool roa espinosa et al 2003 however these models have not been extensively validated decentralized heat recovery hr technologies are an inexpensive and easy to implement solution for energy reuse in buildings hadengue et al 2022c they include systems such as vertical and horizontal water heat exchangers in showers or sinks and heat pumps amongst other systems nagpal et al 2021 hadengue et al 2022 and their performance can be affected by climate conditions and seasons hadengue et al 2022c for instance during warm seasons there are less hot showers which are events with a large energy consumption share in households hadengue et al 2020 compared against cold seasons the implementation of decentralized hr devices impact not only energy related processes across the urban water cycle such as the efficiency of heat pumps installed in precincts or subcatchments golzar and silveira 2021 but also wrrf heat inflows sitzenfrei et al 2017 in their research the authors developed modelling tools based on data driven algorithms stochastic demand approaches and mathematical modelling to quantify the effect of heat recovery technologies these studies concluded that there are competitive interactions between in building and urban level heat recovery systems and shared their growing concern about these practices and the impact on wrrfs and suggested that further legislation is needed to achieve improved energy efficiency at the city level however the authors did not consider important elements such as private lateral connections pipes connecting buildings to the public sewers and topographic conditions a different approach has been presented by hadengue et al 2021 where physical and stochastic processes were coupled to estimate the thermal hydraulic dynamics of coupled sewer networks households and lateral connections hadengue et al 2021 identified thermal damping mechanisms due to the existence of lateral connections and hypothesized about the impact of decentralized heat recovery strategies on wrrf heat inflows across seasons however it remains unclear how during wet weather periods in building heat recovery systems affect the wastewater temperature at the wrrf furthermore there is a lack of investigations on the simultaneous effect of stormwater seasons and decentralized hr technologies on wrrf inflow heat budgets lower temperatures in sewers imply potential nitrification deficiencies wanner et al 2005 and temperature layering in the sludge settling winkler et al 2012 liao et al 2011 in addition seasonal characteristics such as ambient and soil temperature influence domestic wastewater treatment as well for instance gruber et al 2020 detected a strong seasonal profile of nitrous oxide n2o emission from wastewater treatment at wrrfs furthermore arora kazmi 2015 concluded that the highest biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency and the best performance of pathogen removal indicators were accomplished during seasons with high temperature therefore the accurate prediction of influent temperature dynamics coupled with wrrf wide energy modelling concepts arnell et al 2021 would thus enable wrrf operators to optimize treatment capacity management in the present study we aim at quantifying the simultaneous effect of precipitation seasons and decentralized heat recovery technologies on combined storm wastewater temperatures across sewer networks up to the inflow into the wrrf therefore we present a framework that models the complex coupling of thermal hydraulic processes on the surface across pervious and impervious surfaces the subsurface sewer networks households including in building heat recovery systems and lateral connections linking households to the public sewer network the novelty of this framework lies in the technical integration of surface subsurface thermal hydraulic processes with stochastic water consumption models and domestic hot water systems kenway et al 2013 hadengue et al 2020 to simulate extended periods i e more than a few days and illustrate the combined effect of seasons and precipitation events on in sewer temperatures in addition we validate the proposed framework against field measurements at full network scale present modelling results of extended time periods including precipitation events and investigate the thermal hydraulic influence of decentralized heat recovery devices in sewer networks under both wet and dry weather conditions the manuscript is structured as follows section 2 describes the proposed framework including details on each modelling module and how the different components of the framework are coupled section 3 details the validation case the specifics of the validation method and how the impact of heat recovery during wet weather has been evaluated the section also provides details on reference measurements and performance indicators utilized section 4 presents the validation results and a critical discussion of the limitations of the proposed modelling framework section 5 encompasses the results and discussion of the performed analysis on the impact of decentralized heat recovery devices on wrrf heat inflows during wet weather section 6 includes detailed references for potential uses and future work of the modelling framework 2 model framework with the aim of modelling thermal shocks on wastewater from stormwater runoff and seasonal variations with high spatiotemporal discretization we developed a python matlab based modelling framework that computes thermal hydraulics of stormwater runoff wastewater produced in domestic hot water systems wastewater transported in lateral connections and routed through main sewers the masterfile of the framework is written in python and launches all the different modelling tools and matlab executable files required to perform simulations the framework integrates several calculation modules minuhet waterhub and swmm heat minuhet is a fortran computational tool designed with the purpose of simulating flow and heat content of stormwater surface runoff through a watershed and drainage networks herb et al 2008a b 2009 janke et al 2009 2013 waterhub is a stochastic water demand model and thermal hydraulic simulation tool of domestic hot water systems hadengue et al 2019 2020 written in python and the modelica language mattsson and elmqvist 1997 swmm heat is an open source code that enhances the epa swmm model with the necessary thermal components to simulate the evolution of temperature in drainage networks during dry and wet weather conditions figueroa et al 2021 the matlab executable files developed for this framework perform tasks related to synchronization of time series mixing of flows and temperature and post processing of i o files 2 1 the waterhub minuhet swmm heat framework the established framework couples automatic modelling of household water consumption time series household lateral connections and thermal hydraulic processes of stormwater runoff and routing across combined sewer systems the framework can simulate various scenarios at households or sewer level including the implementation of decentralized or centralized heat recovery devices fig 1 shows how the modelling of various compartments of the water urban cycle from households to the inflow into the wrrf are coupled in the framework in the next subsections we detail the processes in each of the framework s modules and how they are connected as part of a larger simulation workflow 2 2 modelling household thermal hydrographs the waterhub framework we use the waterhub modelling framework hadengue et al 2019 2020 to obtain thermal hydrographs of household water consumption behaviours i e wastewater temperature and flow resolved time series of single households the coupling between waterhub and swmm heat is already validated in hadengue et al 2021 as part of a study aiming at assessing the thermal impact of private lateral connections and the implementation of decentralized heat recovery strategies at catchment scale the main limitation of waterhub is the inability to adapt water demand patterns depending on the season and day of the week i e weekdays and weekends in previous studies the maximum time period studied was five days in the present investigation we extend the temporal scope of thermal hydraulic simulations to one month in hadengue et al 2021 the modelling of hot water systems within households was simulated using stochastic water demand patterns as input to a first principle thermodynamic model the longer simulation time periods of the present study though do not allow repeating the procedure due to the much larger overall computation time in order to generate monthly flow and temperature time series for a large number of households we implemented a new procedure original five day simulations from hadengue et al 2021 were split and merged into a dataset of daily time series monthly time series are then produced by stitching together daily time series randomly selected from the dataset thereby largely reducing the computation time further details about the implementation and reproducibility of the results obtained with this approach are described in the supplementary information si section a and in the framework validation section section 3 3 2 3 from a swmm heat input file to surface thermal runoff simulations with minuhet aiming at minimal parametrization work for future users we developed a matlab routine which performs automatic set up and execution of minuhet simulations based on a typical swmm swmm heat input file inp file here we summarize the main steps implemented in the matlab routine 1 information regarding subcatchment properties e g area width percentage of pervious and impervious surfaces slope land use and outlet node is collected from the swmm swmm heat input file 2 the extracted information is processed and individual files representing pervious and impervious areas with dat format required by minuhet are created for each subcatchment 3 air temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed precipitation and cloud cover fraction datasets are collected and synchronized and a storm file utilized by minuhet for the simulations is generated herb et al 2010 4 a batch file is created for each subcatchment to automatically launch minuhet pervious impervious and mixing simulations the batch file is then executed and runoff flow and temperature information of each subcatchment is stored in individual files 5 simultaneously a runoff only simulation is performed with swmm heat in order to obtain the outflows of each subcatchment during precipitation events 6 once all simulations are finished a final step merges thermal hydraulic flows from minuhet and swmm heat since different subcatchments could have the same outlet node it is necessary to combine flows swmm heat and temperature minuhet datasets generated in the previous steps into a unique flow temperature time series for each node the process above generates two files for each subcatchment outlet containing flow and temperature time series these files represent the surface runoff compartment in the final catchment simulation with swmm heat a detailed representation of the framework folder structure is shown in si fig 3 2 4 merging water and heat flows from surface runoff and households the last step before the final routing simulation includes the synchronization and aggregation of previously generated temperature and flow time series of household lateral connections with surface runoff based on the information provided in the swmm heat input file consequently two time series files are obtained that represent total heat flow temperature and flow that enters the sewer network at each inflow node in addition swmm heat has the ability to include groundwater heat flow infiltration into the system as time patterns the mixing process of different inflows i e time series and time patterns at the network node scale is handled internally by swmm heat 3 material and methods 3 1 network description 3 1 1 the fehraltorf swmm heat model in this investigation we focus on the reproduction of wastewater temperature dynamics along the main collector in the sewer network of the swiss municipality of fehraltorf located 12 km northeast of zurich switzerland which comprises 27 1 km of sewer pipes in this network system the wastewater from fehraltorf and two neighbouring municipalities is conveyed to the central wrrf design capacity 12 000 pe for more information regarding the implementation of the infrastructure data in swmm heat inflows from neighbouring municipalities groundwater infiltration and industrial wastewater inflows we refer to hadengue et al 2021 and figueroa et al 2021 during dry weather conditions transfer flows from the two adjacent municipalities account for 36 of the total wastewater inflow at the treatment plant groundwater infiltration contributes up to 15 not considering seasonal fluctuations industrial wastewater to about 21 and residential wastewater from households located within the municipality of fehraltorf up to 28 3 1 2 field measurements and climate data reference data were collected during a long term monitoring campaign that operates measurement stations with dual in sewer sensors for the simultaneous recording of wastewater and sewer headspace temperature at multiple locations across the fehraltorf catchment further details including sensor distribution within the network are described in blumensaat et al 2021 and figueroa et al 2021 minuhet and swmm heat coupled simulations require information regarding solar radiation relative humidity cloud cover wind speed atmospheric temperature and precipitation these data are collected from sensors deployed in the subcatchment and in the surrounding areas precipitation measurements with a frequency report of one minute are collected using a weight based all weather precipitation gauge fa ott pluvio ii that measures the amount and intensity of rain solar radiation wind speed air temperature and relative humidity data are recorded with a one minute resolution employing a compact weather station fa luftt ws 700 that allows measuring multiple parameters cloud cover information is provided by meteoswiss and collected with a ten minutes resolution from the surrounding area of kloten zurich app 10 km west of fehraltorf after collecting the data the data are aggregated and synchronized with a one minute resolution and all inconsistencies are filtered with a hampel filter si fig 4 a storm data file required by minuhet is then automatically generated and utilized to perform thermal hydraulic runoff simulations 3 1 3 soil characteristics and soil temperature month long simulations require adequate soil temperatures values reflecting seasonal dynamics throughout the year since swmm heat requires a monthly soil temperature pattern we determined average monthly soil temperature from soil temperature measurements and simulation studies from a location near fehraltorf si fig 6 the soil type is sandy clay loam and soil thermal hydraulic properties values required by swmm heat and minuhet are presented in table 1 the green ampt infiltration method rossman and huber 2016 was used in the swmm heat and minuhet simulations 3 2 performance indicators the modelling results considered for the comparison with field measurements are the bulk liquid temperature and the flow at different locations in the main sewer the metrics used for the assessment of the simulation results include the maximum average root mean square error rmse and the ratio of the rmse to the standard deviation of measured data also named rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr 1 r s r i 1 n y i o b s y i s i m 2 i 1 n y i o b s y i m e a n 2 rsr is a metric proposed by moriasi et al 2007 for hydrologic simulations that incorporates the benefits of rmse error index statistics and includes a normalization factor 3 3 framework validation the validation study focused on four different periods of 20 30 days in 2019 see table 2 the selection of these periods is distinct and motivated to reflect both different seasonal characteristics and representative rainfall events we compare modelling results with stationary measurements at five different locations see sensor location in si fig 7 in addition three analyses are performed to provide insights regarding i the impact of weekdays and weekends on rsr and rsme metrics ii the effect of short and long term precipitation events on combined waste and stormwater temperature in sewers and iii the spatial distribution of temperatures in sewers during wet weather in addition in order to accurately estimate monthly flow and temperature time series for all households in fehraltorf we implemented the stitching procedure described in section 2 2 for each simulated scenario detailed in hadengue et al 2021 we produced a dataset of around 20 000 different daily time series 32 000 for the reference scenario to account for the number of inhabitants in a single household each dataset was further split into five separate categories of ascending total flow volumes representing systems from one person up to five people households each of the 4046 households in fehraltorf was then simulated by selecting a number of inhabitants based on the swiss household distribution bundesamt für statistik 2018 and randomly selecting daily time series from the corresponding category in the dataset in this study we selected a time resolution of three seconds for the household lateral connection system a value found as a good compromise to minimize computation time while retaining information from high frequency short water draw offs minuhet simulations are performed with a time resolution of 1 min during wet conditions and 5 min during dry conditions swmm heat simulations of the fehraltorf sewer network are conducted with a time step of 15 s we tested the new procedure thoroughly to guarantee the statistical significance of the generated time series with data from hadengue et al 2021 we studied the convergence of the 95 interval and median of the heat budget curve for various dataset sizes 250 500 1000 and 2000 available daily time series full results are shown in si section a even with a low number of available daily time series 250 time series convergence was acceptable compared to larger datasets we thus conclude that the size of our datasets are adequate to represent the thermodynamics of single households over monthly time periods 3 4 wet weather implications on heat recovery following the framework validation concept we study the impact of decentralized heat recovery hr technologies during wet weather this investigation aims to evaluate the influence of different household market penetration of hr technologies on temperatures and heat budgets at the wrrf the hr device included in our analyses is a shower drain heat exchanger that is modelled as a spatially discretized counter flow heat exchanger and behaves relatively similarly to commercial heat exchangers with a power of around 7 5 kw hadengue et al 2021 two consecutive weekday periods of 5 days and market penetration shares of 0 reference scenario 25 h r 25 50 h r 50 75 h r 75 and 100 h r 100 of all households located in fehraltorf are studied the first weekday period encompasses the dry days between 4 march 2019 and 9 march 2019 where a small number of precipitation events are detected and the second period includes the wet days between 11 march 2019 and 16 march 2019 that has numerous precipitation occurrences the study includes the analysis of inflow temperatures at the wrrf for the different market penetration scenarios of hr systems installed in households in addition we compare results with available guidelines for the introduction of centralized heat recovery systems as a reference maximum temperature reduction due to the introduction of centralized hr devices recommended by the literature is defined as reference temperature minus 1 k müller et al 2009 and additionally temperatures are not allowed to fall below 10 ⁰c as required by authorities in switzerland awel 2010 lastly in order to quantify the thermal dampening effect of wet weather conditions we compute the difference in heat budgets received by wrrf for all heat recovery scenarios during dry and wet days in this study heat budget hb is calculated as 2 h b t 0 t m t t r e f c p d t with m the mass flux k g s t the fluid temperature at the inflow of the wrrf k t r e f the reference temperature 273 15 k c p the water heat capacity k j k g k and t the time secs 4 validation process results and discussion 4 1 modelling the impact of rain and seasonal soil temperatures on in sewer temperature dynamics four periods described in table 2 are simulated and their performance indicators calculated fig 2 shows the observed and modelled temperature dynamics across several locations during period 1 with weekends and precipitation events clearly identified simulation results show that the model adequately reproduces observed in sewer temperature dynamics during the months of february 2019 and march 2019 and captures the notable temperatures changes generated by precipitation events further comparisons between field measurements and simulated flows and temperatures in additional periods are presented in si figures 8 14 rsr and rmse values are similar in all periods analysed suggesting that the proposed network enables the simultaneous modelling of seasonal soil temperatures and thermal shocks in order to enhance our understanding of the main sources of discrepancies between measurements and simulation results we differentiate between weekend and weekdays table 3 presents the obtained rsr and rmse values for temperature values during weekdays wd weekends we and overall for period 1 across five distinct locations in the catchment results suggest that the simulation framework represents temperatures dynamics during weekdays with higher precision than during weekends tables with the same characteristic i e better performance of the model for weekdays compared with weekends for flow and temperature for the three remaining periods are presented in si table 2 8 one of the main characteristics of the proposed framework is its ability to estimate thermal shocks at the wrrf due to precipitation events across sewer networks as exemplified by two wet periods shown in fig 3 the figure shows how short and long term precipitations episodes influence wrrf inflow temperatures i during 13 march 2019 several short term rainfalls reduce inflow temperatures at the wrrf rapidly by several degrees while returning to normal temperatures in approximately 1 hour ii long term precipitations are observed through 15 march 2019 and 8 may 2019 reducing temperatures across the network for several hours when compared with dry weekdays while daily dry weather patterns are very similar for the two periods the globally different temperature levels reflect seasonal differences lower in march higher in may in order to capture the spatial distribution of thermal hydraulic processes during a dry and wet day at similar times we introduce the network heat maps in fig 4 it represents the hourly average of temperature and flow at 12pm for two close weekdays i 12 march 2019 a typical dry day and ii 15 march 2019 a weekday that includes a rainfall event we notice that large amounts of cold surface runoff is routed through the network it increases the flow across the sewer network line thickness but reduces the temperature considerably colour coding this representation exemplifies that next to increase of hydraulic loading a drop in inflow temperatures at the wrrf can be expected 4 2 discussion the validation study presented in the section 4 1 allows for the identification of the main assets and limitations of the developed framework while comparing with field measurements in a real world setting simulated flow and temperature dynamics in sewers were in good agreement with reference measurements in fehraltorf during weekdays in addition similar performance indicator values were obtained across all studied periods suggesting that the modelling framework can predict temperature dynamics consistently all year long furthermore the effects of short and long term precipitation events in temperature dynamics in sewer networks are well captured as shown in fig 3 lastly since swmm heat is a distributed heat transfer model for sewer networks the prospect of obtaining heat maps e g fig 4 during all seasons and weather events could be of large interest for utility managers to optimize the operation and maintenance of the sewer infrastructure and treatment performance at the wrrf the results of the validation study also assist in the identification of the main limitations of the presented framework the detected main sources of discrepancies between simulated and observed thermal dynamics and their potential solutions are weekends and national local holidays water consumption behaviours during weekends and holidays is significantly different from working days weekends holidays measurements exhibit an increased deviation and a shift in time of morning peak values i e people take morning showers later and the peak is more diffuse in comparison with weekdays which is in agreement with the literature butler 1993 friedler et al 1996 in addition waterhub does not adapt water demand patterns depending on the season e g it does not take in account that there are less hot showers in summer compared with winter since waterhub does not differentiate between workings days weekends and national local holidays it is recommended that future implementations include algorithms that adjust consumption behaviours depending on the day of the week and the season soil temperature soil temperatures in swmm heat are defined as monthly patterns i e soil temperatures are the same across the whole month this is somehow coarse and does not account for intra monthly variations of soil temperatures which could result in low flow e g during night time temperatures being considerable different across the same month for instance soil temperatures in february varies from 6⁰c to 7 8⁰c increasing considerably towards the end of the month si fig 6 afterwards during the month of march soil temperatures are updated and a much better agreement is obtained between simulation and observations values of nigh time temperatures future developments in swmm heat will include the option to define soil temperatures as time series morning peaks during the morning large differences between measured and simulated temperatures are observed this artefact can be explained by an underestimation of the number of lateral connections and the use of showering habits of a different spatio temporal context and its potential solutions have been discussed in depth in hadengue et al 2021 5 wet weather implications on heat recovery 5 1 impact of decentralized heat recovery technologies on wrrf heat budgets during wet weather conditions fig 5 shows temperature dynamics at the wrrf inlet for different market penetration of decentralized heat recovery technologies of the two five day periods previously selected results reveal that temperature differences between the hr scenarios analysed are larger during the morning peak and negligible during overnight time periods there are no clear differences on combined waste and stormwater temperature amidst the dry and wet periods suggesting that a more detailed analysis is required in order to quantify their impact on temperatures and heat budgets at the wrrf which we present hereafter average inflow temperatures at the wrrf during the selected dry and wet weekdays were clustered in four daily time periods overnight 12am 6am morning 6am 12pm afternoon 12pm 6pm and evening 6pm 12am and market penetration of household hr technologies as displayed in fig 6 in this figure we observe that there exist larger temperature reductions between the reference scenario and hr scenarios during the morning and overnight periods than in the afternoon and evening periods a temperature limit line is used as a reference and illustrates the maximum temperature reduction allowed by literature recommendations and governmental policies for centralized hr technologies even in the 100 market penetration scenario average temperatures are never below the temperature limit threshold during dry and wet periods a similar figure that considers maximum inflow temperature values instead of average values is displayed in si figure 15 and shows that maximum temperatures in certain hr scenarios and specific daily time periods are below the recommended temperature limit however it is important to note that the temperature limit threshold usually refers to average temperature not to instantaneous temperature and maximum temperatures are always well above the 10⁰c limit considering that average temperatures are in all situations above the temperature limit threshold we proceed to quantify the impact on the total heat budget received by the wrrf during selected dry and wet weekdays we expect that the effect of decentralised hr devices on the inflow heat budget at wrrfs will be attenuated during wet weather conditions in contrast with dry weather periods due to the large volume of stormwater introduced into the drainage system in this analysis we compute the difference in total heat budget at the wrrf between the reference scenario and each hr scenario across the two time periods considered fig 7 results suggest that during wet weather conditions the impact of household hr technologies is reduced by approximately 20 in comparison with dry weather conditions for each scenario analysed for a more comprehensive analysis of heat losses across households lateral connections and sewer networks during dry conditions see hadengue et al 2021 5 2 discussion stormwater in combined sewers dampens the thermal effect of household hr technologies at the inlet of the wrrf daily average temperature values show that during the afternoon and evening periods and wet weather no significant temperatures differences between the hr and reference scenarios are detected therefore no negative effect on water treatment processes at the wrrf is expected overnight and morning periods display larger temperature differences at the wrrf due to the introduction of decentralized hr devices in comparison with the reference scenario however these drops are less noticeable during wet weather than during dry weather due to the dampening effect of stormwater in the system despite this dampening effect is expected it has not been quantified in the literature and the results obtained shed some light on this very important aspect overall our study shows that the implementation of decentralized heat recovery technologies have a lower influence on the wrrf heat budget inflows during wet weather in comparison with dry weather however further studies investigating different network topography characteristics seasons climates combination of decentralized heat recovery technologies and consumption habits should be performed to extend the validity of the previous statement 6 potential applications and future work the coupled framework between waterhub minuhet swmm heat enables deeper and long term investigations of thermal hydraulic dynamics in sewers in the following examples we foster synergies between this framework and additional areas of application high temperatures increase the release rates of heavy metals e g zinc copper chromium lead from stormwater sediments li et al 2013 the proposed simulation framework has the ability to predict thermal hydraulic dynamics of sewers systems during precipitation events for instance simulation results can enhance pollutant dispersion modelling of heavy metals from storm sewer sediment across the sewer network in addition the framework offers a strong support for the investigation of illicit drug degradation in sewers due to temperature thai et al 2014 mccall et al 2016 and the degradation of wastewater compounds warith et al 1998 the presented framework has the potential to support detection campaigns of infiltration and inflow i i of extraneous water in sewer systems beheshti sægrov 2018 2019 performed fibre optic distributed temperature sensing dts to identify i i sources in trondheim norway in the study the authors observed the effect of rainfall derived i i during warm and cold days since dts requires high initial costs and installation and operation performed by highly qualified worker we suggest to complement dts with thermal hydraulic simulations performed by swmm heat comparing temperature data from sensors with simulation results will support and offer robust evidence for i i detection in addition the waterhub minuhet swmm heat framework will assist in the assessment of rainfall derived i i effects and inform stakeholders prior to develop future sewer rehabilitation plans furthermore swmm heat has the ability to model thermal shocks in sewer systems and in consequence enables practitioners to design adequate campaigns towards mitigations of biofilm growth and biofilm thermal resistance thermal shocks have been identified as a successful technique to prevent biofilm formation and their adverse effect on plate heat exchanges of treated sewage source heat pump systems chang et al 2017 the waterhub minuhet swmm heat framework reproduces consistently temperatures throughout seasons and weather events and offers a strong platform to pursue optimization studies for heat recovery placement in networks optimal placement of heat recovery systems in the sewer network requires a detailed examination of heat losses across the sewer network surrounding soil of a sewer pipe and headspace temperature are two major sources of heat loss for sewer wastewater nagpal et al 2021 figueroa et al 2021 hadengue et al 2021 and of the impact of local wastewater heat recovery using heat exchangers across different seasons golzar and silveira 2021 saagi et al 2022 the proposed simulation framework can assists stakeholders and practitioners to make inform decisions regarding optimal investment planning strategies since it allows the creation of scenarios to determine financial feasibility depending on the market penetration of decentralized hr systems simulation results obtained with the proposed framework could update wrrf wide energy modelling concepts arnell et al 2021 with influent heat fluxes in order to quantify the effect of wastewater heat recovery systems precipitation events and seasons in nitrogen removal processes and n2o emissions hanaki et al 1992 aeration requirements and operative costs furthermore in combination with strategies to increase the process performance during low wastewater temperature periods e g regulation of operational parameters bioaugmentation biofilm technology chemical phosphorus precipitation and novel process technologies zhou et al 2018 negative impacts of cold thermal shocks on wastewater treatment processes could be attenuated pursuing these investigations requires close collaborative research between different sectors of the urban water cycle energy urban infrastructure and policy makers the waterhub minuhet swmm heat framework has the capacity to inform these sectors with details regarding the thermal hydraulic processes in the subsurface and surface of the built environment however further advancements are needed for instance modelling the influence of low impact developments on the temperature in urban drainage systems or the introduction of soil temperatures as time series is not possible with the presented framework in the current status further developments include the addition of a surface thermal model in swmm heat that maintains heat budget and a simplification of the simulation framework i e minuhet will not be needed in addition economical aspects of heat recovery are outside the scope of this investigation but will be the subject of future research initiatives 7 conclusions the main findings can be summarized as follows a framework for automatic modelling of stochastic household water consumption time series household private lateral connections and thermal hydraulic processes of stormwater runoff and routing across combined sewer systems is presented the framework couples three modelling tools waterhub minuhet swmm heat embedded in a hybrid python matlab environment thus it enables the simulation of various management scenarios at households and sewer level including the implementation of decentralized or centralized heat recovery devices the validation shows a similarly high model performance across all seasons suggesting that the presented framework can predict temperature dynamics consistently all year long the effects of short and long term precipitation events on thermal hydraulic dynamics in the sewer network are well captured a study of the impact of household hr technologies on thermal hydraulic inflows at wrrfs during dry and wet weather is presented results suggest that the burden of household hr technologies on wrrf heat budget inflows is reduced by approximately 20 during wet weather periods in comparison with dry weather conditions the presented framework exhibits
