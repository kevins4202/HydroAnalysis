8115,study region the chaohe watershed is a meso scale watershed in northern china and the primary reservoir watershed for beijing s drinking water supply study focus this research aims to evaluate the effects of climate change on future seasonal streamflow regimes and understand the challenges to watershed management the regional hydro ecological simulation system rhessys was applied to investigate the watershed s future hydrographic characteristics under the forcing of the downscaled precipitation and temperature projected by general circulation models gcms under three emissions scenarios new hydrological insights for the region the future climate exhibits a drier and warmer trend in the summer monsoon period contrasting with other seasons in the watershed precipitation will decrease by 47 5 57 2 mm during the summer monsoon period while increasing annually future summer streamflow will decrease accordingly which is also driven by increased evapotranspiration due to rising temperature an increased dispersion coefficient of streamflow also indicates more dramatic variations in summer the annual streamflow magnitude with a 5 year return period increases significantly p 0 01 indicating a reduced risk for future water shortages however the magnitude of streamflow will decrease with the prolonged return periods p 0 01 this study emphasizes the critical significance of predicting the seasonal variability of streamflow and other hydrological property changes at the local scale to provide valuable information for developing adaptive resource management and hazard relief strategies graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change hydrological regime rhessys summer season return period watershed management 1 introduction climate change accelerates the global water cycle alters flow regime induces more extreme events lópez ballesteros et al 2020 and modifies regional and global water resource distributions piao et al 2010 gizaw et al 2017 however there are significant discrepancies in climate change between different geographical regions and time scales blöschl et al 2019 more complex heterogeneous precipitation changes than the consistent warming trend will cause divergent fluctuations within hydrological processes across the scales donat et al 2016 for instance precipitation substantially increased in the southwestern china but declined by 5 per decade in the northern region zhai et al 2005 extreme flows such as high flows and low flows are expected to rise within northern europe and the high latitude regions of north america whereas a decrease in the southern regions of europe and north america dai et al 2009 hirabayashi et al 2013 streamflow is projected to decrease over the southwestern north america in the next 100 years while the opposite trend is predicted over the eastern north america due to the increased precipitation reynolds et al 2015 the discrepancies in climate change and its hydrological impacts make it hard to develop adaptive watershed management without localized projections the east asian summer monsoon easm transfers moisture to land from the ocean facilitating temporal heterogeneity in precipitation the easm has been weakening for the last half century leading to drier conditions over northern china s semi arid areas shen et al 2018 since the late 1990s a significant trend towards drier parts of northern china has been noticed which played an essential role in modifying the drought pattern xu et al 2018 more importantly the monsoon system generates seasonal changes in climate and thus hydrological regimes for instance significant decreasing trends in the summer precipitation were detected over northern china while the opposite trend was found for the same area in the winter months zhai et al 2005 temporal variability in climate and streamflow have significant consequences for regional water resources management seddon et al 2016 climatic change induced seasonal fluctuations in climate and hydrological regimes pose severe challenges to disaster avoidance in northern china it is estimated that extreme drought in northwest china has caused major ecological and economic consequences ouyang et al 2015 therefore it is important to detect the variations in the hydrological regime driven by climate change at different temporal scales i e both annual and seasonal at the watershed scale to achieve sustainable water resources management and adaptation strategies in the future the effects of climate change on water resources can be investigated by incorporating climate change projections e g air temperature and precipitation into models that reliably quantify the spatio temporal variations of water fluxes in a watershed under different socioeconomic pathways aloysius and saiers 2017 general circulation models gcms are applied to provide estimates of the climate response and future climate scenarios over large regions asseng et al 2013 the number of gcms available for climate change projections is increased from 25 with the coupled model inter comparison project cmip phase 3 to 61 with cmip phase 5 however uncertainties in predicting the future climate remain large and might even increase with the increasing number of climate models available hargreaves 2010 lutz et al 2016 additionally the performance of gcms varies within geographic regions ahmadalipour et al 2017 therefore it is vital to select the appropriate gcms to capture and forecast the climatological patterns and variations for a specific region at regional and watershed scales gcms must be downscaled to generate the accurate high resolution climate variables used for hydrological simulation and prediction although gcms could generate hydrological variables directly the simulated hydrological processes and regimes are inadequate xu and singh 2004 for example gcms do not represent the lateral transfer of water fluxes very well kite et al 1994 physical processes based distributed hydrological models could dynamically simulate the transfer of horizontal and vertical water fluxes by dividing watershed into grids or sub catchments and incorporating watershed physical characteristics fatichi et al 2016 tegegne et al 2017 hence such models have been used in hydrological simulations under various scenarios including changes in land use and land cover and climate change zheng et al 2018 this study aims to predict the future hydrological regimes in the chaohe watershed situated in the temperate east asian monsoon climate region of northern china we used downscaled gcms data to forecast future climate change and drive the process based distributed eco hydrological model rhessys our specific objectives are to 1 project the annual and monthly variations in precipitation and air temperature 2 simulate the responses of annual and seasonal streamflow dynamics under future climate scenarios and 3 evaluate the hydrological regime changes and forecast the risks for hydrological management at the study watershed 2 study region data and methods 2 1 the chaohe watershed the chaohe watershed located in northern china 116 08 117 28 e 40 34 41 37 n fig 1a has a drainage area of 4854 8 km2 elevated between 159 and 2218 m above the sea level this watershed the essential water source region of miyun reservoir provides more than 70 of the drinking water for the urban population in beijing tang et al 2011 the watershed is dominated by brown loam and luvic cinnamon soils li et al 2010 in addition more than 80 of the watershed is covered by forests shrubs and grass fig 1c while the rest is used for crop and construction or as bared areas the mean annual temperature mat and precipitation map during 1961 2015 is 12 3 and 509 2 mm respectively as a unique feature of the monsoon climate the summer is warm and wet contributing more than 80 of the annual precipitation 2 2 data daily precipitation series 1961 2015 from eight precipitation monitoring sites fig 1b were attained by the haihe river water conservancy commission beijing water authority and hydrology and water resource survey bureau of hebei province the thiessen polygon method was used to calculate the annual average precipitation thiessen 1911 in addition daily minimum mean and maximum temperature during 1961 2015 representing the historical period were obtained from three national meteorological stations miyun fengning and chengde maintained by the state meteorological administration china daily streamflow data at xiahui hydrological station the outlet station of the watershed fig 1b were obtained from the same source for daily precipitation data cao et al 2018 lou et al 2015 the digital elevation model dem and land use maps for 1979 1989 1999 and 2009 with 30 m resolution were derived from the computer network information center and institute of remote sensing and digital earth http www ceode cas cn sjyhfw chinese academy of sciences respectively the river network was built up by calculating flow direction from the dem data using the eight flow directions d8 algorithm o callaghan and mark 1984 the dem specified flow directions by assigning flow from each pixel to one of its eight neighbors in the direction with the steepest downward slope soil information was derived from the environmental and ecological science data center for western china wang et al 2013 finally land use data were reclassified into the evergreen forest deciduous forest shrub grass agriculture land and undeveloped land according to rhessys land cover database requirements 2 3 scenario datasets and downscaling the present and future daily precipitation and temperature projected by gcms were obtained from the earth system grid federation esgf http esgf node llnl gov search cmip5 an increasing number of climate models are available predicting important climatic variables for example the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 involves outputs from 61 different gcms lutz et al 2016 many gcms such as canesm2 cnrm cm5 and gfdl cm3 can realistically capture china s climatological patterns and spatial variations yang 2014 the canesm2 model is widely used because readily available daily predictor variables can be directly fed into the statistical downscaling model sdsm thus a decision support tool for assessing local climate change effects and the model outputs can be applied for further impact analysis with a high degree of certainty under new sets of emission scenarios downscaled by the sdsm getachew et al 2021 previous evaluation studies indicated that the canesm2 and gfdl cm3 could realistically reproduce the observed seasonal precipitation by national weather stations over northern china chen and frauenfeld 2014 in addition the cnrm cm5 also shows higher accuracy than the other models in simulating spatial patterns in the decadal change of climate zones over china he et al 2019 the selected cmip5 gcms including gfdl cm3 canesm2 and cnrm cm5 fig 2 were found to be able to reproduce climate variability i e statistical methods of annual average monthly average correlation coefficient and percent bias fig s1 and s2 in the study area during calibration and validation moreover three representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios i e rcp8 5 rcp4 5 and rcp2 6 representing distinct radiative forcing levels were applied to reflect the high medium stabilization and mitigation emission scenario respectively moss et al 2010 all data were uniformly interpolated to identical resolution with the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration national centers for environmental prediction reanalysis data the sdsm was used to generate the regional climate data for our study area the sdsm was selected based on the model s excellent climate downscaling techniques liu et al 2021 first long term and high quality observation data 1961 2015 was used to establish the robust statistical relationship between large scale downscaling predictor variables i e gcms predictors and local climate variables i e observed temperature and precipitation over the study area this step was needed to develop the statistical downscaling method second the sdsm combined two primary statistical downscaling transfer function generators that relate large area climate to local weather or from the upper air to the ground weather wilby and wigley 1997 the first method includes applying efficient regression analysis and the second is used to produce a temporary series of local variables such as precipitation with high stochastic fluctuations thirdly the sdsm is especially effective for hydrological research wilby 2002 as indicated in many evaluation studies this method replicated the main features of the observed hydrometeorology liu et al 2021 the goal of the sdsm is to establish the empirical relationship between the local climate variables and large scale variables this study selected different predictors including mean temperature relative and specific humidity near the ground surface and mean sea level pressure for temperature downscaling table 1 and s1 meanwhile we chose the 500 hpa geopotential height divergence and zonal velocity for precipitation downscaling table s1 we used the conventional bias correction method within the sdsm to inflate the variance of the downscaled time series finally we split the historical period of 1961 2015 into a calibration period i e 1961 1990 and the validation period i e 1991 2015 the detailed downscaling process was implemented in the following steps 1 quality control and transformation for observed temperature and precipitation data enable the diagnosis of missing data and outliers in observed precipitation and temperature data before running the sdsm 2 selecting suitable downscaling predictors the observed temperature and precipitation data were used to screen the preferred predictors for precipitation minimum and maximum temperature in the chaohe watershed respectively finally we selected ten predictors mean temperature relative and specific humidity near the ground surface mean sea level pressure and geopotential height the details are described in table s1 3 calibrating and validating the sdsm the daily temperature and precipitation data and selected predictors were used to construct downscaling multiple regression equations 4 generating the daily weather series for the next eighty years based on the selected gcms under the three emission scenarios although 2020 is no longer a future year it is included in the future period for the convenience of analysis 2 4 regional hydro ecological simulation system model 2 4 1 model construction and parameterization the regional hydro ecological simulation system rhessys a process based distributed model was used in our study to project the future streamflow variation the rhessys represents watersheds in a spatially nested hierarchical structure with a range of meteorological and hydrological processes associated with different hierarchy levels fig s3 the rhessys model includes an explicit hillslope hydrology model linking the ecosystem patches in a catena resolving coupled water carbon and nitrogen cycling with spatially varying topo climate drivers tague et al 2008 specifically the soil water profile is depicted in a vertically three layer model covering a saturated zone an unsaturated zone and a surface detention zone tague and band 2004 the standard penman monteith approach is used to calculate evaporation and transpiration rates stomatal conductance is used for surface conductance in a multiplicative model jarvis 1976 stomatal conductance is driven by solar radiation vapor pressure deficit rooting zone soil moisture air co2 concentration and air temperature controls the rhessys further scales leaf level transpiration to canopy transpiration by integrating over the leaf area index lai canopy interception is a function of the water holding capacity of the vegetation net throughfall from the canopy is first added to surface detention storage and then allowed to infiltrate into the soil following phillip s infiltration philip 1957 a condensed description of the hydrological processes including interception transpiration and evaporation is shown in the following equation a more detailed description of the rhessys can be found in the literature band et al 1996 tague et al 2004 infiltration in rhessys is calculated by phillip equation 1 q infil i t p s p t d t p k sat t d t p

with depth s p is sorptivity φ ae is air entry pressure φ is porosity and θ 0 is initial soil moisture content evaporation and transpiration rates are computed using the standard penman monteith equation evapotranspiration rates are computed for rainy and dry periods of each day and the vapor pressure deficit is adjusted accordingly total daily evaporation e is computed as 6 e min θ i e vpd 0 g s d rain e vpd vpd g s d day d rain where θ i is the interception storage vpd is the daily vapor pressure deficit d rain is the rain duration d day is the day length g s is the nonvascular stratum conductance total transpiration t c is computed as t c e vpd 0 gs sun e vpd 0 gs shade d rain 7 e vpd vpd gs sun e vpd vpd gs shade d day d rain where gs sun and gs shade are the canopy conductance for sun and shaded leaves 2 4 2 model calibration and validation the rhessys was run with a daily time step based on available meteorological data our previous studies indicated an abrupt change in streamflow in the late 1980 s occurred due to implementing large scale afforestation programs zheng et al 2015 wang et al 2013 therefore we chose streamflow data from 1961 to 1979 and land use data of 1979 to calibrate the rhessys model to avoid influence from human activities first two years i e 1961 1962 of data were selected to spin up this model the model was validated using the calibrated parameters land use data in 2009 and hydro meteorological data from 2000 to 2015 the rhessys relies on parameters to describe typical soil vegetation and land use characteristics literature based estimates and the rhessys parameter database https github com rhessys rhessys wiki parameter definition files have been used to modify values for the vegetation and soil types in our study area seven key hydrologic parameters reflecting drainage efficiency and storage capacity of soils required calibration and validation including vertical and horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat v and k sat h decay of saturated hydraulic conductivity with depth m percentage of infiltrated water bypass to the deeper groundwater store gw1 drainage rate of the groundwater gw2 and soil depth tague et al 2004 a monte carlo simulation was implemented to sample 3000 initial parameter sets from recommended ranges in the rhessys parameter database and finally the optimum parameter set was calibrated and validated table 2 in addition the relative bias b ias coefficient of determination r 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency n se nash and sutcliffe 1970 were applied to evaluate the model performances legates and mccabe 1999 tong et al 2014 8 b ias t 1 n o t s t t 1 n s t 100 9 r 2 t 1 n s t s o t o 2 t 1 n s t s 2 t 1 n o t o 2 10 n se 1 t 1 n s t o t 2 t 1 n o t o 2 where s t is the simulated data o t is the observed data s and o are the average of the simulated and observed respectively n is the length of the time series in days the closer to 1 n se and r 2 are the better the rhessys model performs model performance is reliable when n se and r 2 are larger than 0 5 and 0 6 and b ias is within 25 respectively moriasi et al 2013 2 5 analysis of streamflow changes the dispersion coefficient d c of streamflow was used to depict the stability of streamflow and calculated as follows zhang et al 2016 11 d c 75 th 25 th 50 th 100 where 25th 50th 75th are the annual streamflow percentiles the flow duration curve was estimated to depict the frequency distribution of streamflow from high flow to drought events for 2020 2100 under the three rcps return periods under five levels including 100 year 50 year 20 year 10 year and 5 year were applied to analyze streamflow frequency s temporal variation during the historical and future periods 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of gcm downscaling and rhessys to run the sdsm we need to calibrate and validate the relationship between observed temperature precipitation and large scale predictors before future climate scenarios with the gcm outputs could be effectively downscaled the scatter plots between downscaled and observed daily maximum minimum temperature and precipitation for the calibration and validation period are depicted in fig 3 the downscaled temperature data has been assessed to be generally consistent with observed historical data although it somewhat overestimated the observed maximum figs 3a and 3d and minimum figs 3b and 3e temperatures in the upper end in addition downscaled precipitation was close to the observed values except for extreme conditions monthly precipitation was under predicted for the values close to zero but over predicted for large values during the calibration fig 3c and validation fig 3f periods the downscaled maximum temperature minimum temperature and precipitation produced r 2 of 0 94 0 95 and 0 83 during the calibration period the values exhibited a little better than those in the verification period i e 0 94 0 91 and 0 65 respectively overall the sdsm model was very capable of generating projected climate scenarios over the chaohe watershed the values of r 2 n se and b ias during the rhessys model calibration period were 0 87 0 86 and 13 31 respectively indicating that the model performed exceptionally well to capture the hydrograph for the watershed fig 4a calibrated soil parameters governing the hydrological processes include horizontal and vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity i e ksat h and ksat v respectively decay of horizontal and vertical k with depth i e m h and m v respectively groundwater bypass flow i e gw1 and groundwater drainage rate i e gw2 in addition soil depth a critical parameter for the hydrological process in the rocky mountain area of northern china was also calibrated table 2 model validation further confirmed the modeling system s capacity to simulate the watershed s hydrological processes although the values of r 2 n se and b ias declined slightly in the validation period to 0 76 0 74 and 18 46 respectively fig 4b as a result there was a slight overestimate in the monthly streamflow with the rhessys for the watershed however overall the modeling system was able to reproduce the observed streamflow satisfactorily 3 2 future climate changes under three rcps 3 2 1 projected future temperature and precipitation changes the projected annual temperature compared with the historical measurement is presented in fig 5a under all rcp scenarios across the study area the mat will increase significantly by 0 8 c until 2100 under the rcp2 6 scenario which is within one of the long term temperature increase targets i e below 1 5 c from the pre industrial era until 2100 the temperature under the medium stabilization scenario is expected to increase by 1 6 c crossing the 1 5 c threshold mat will rise by 3 8 c under the high baseline emission pathway which is beyond the threshold for keeping global warming below 2 0 c with the radiative forcing increasing mat under the rcp8 5 scenario shows the most significant warming change by 31 2 compared with the historical period than that increase under the medium 13 3 and low level 6 8 emission scenarios moreover an increasing trend of annual precipitation is projected for all three scenarios over the chaohe watershed fig 5b d relative to the mean annual precipitation map for the historical period 1961 2015 future map will increase by 10 3 9 6 and 8 0 under the high medium and low level emission pathways respectively in addition among the three rcps there is an upward trend detected in rcp8 5 and rcp 4 5 scenarios while there has less variation in the low level emission scenario 3 2 2 monthly temperature and precipitation changes in the future global climate change has also altered the intra annual distribution of precipitation and temperature the same is true for annual and monthly temperatures that also show notable warming trends although there are slight differences between the three emission pathways fig 5e specifically mean monthly temperature change is sensitive to radiation forcing and increases with intensifying radiation conditions from scenario rcp2 6 to rcp8 5 as a result future temperature increases during summer exceed the mean annual change by 1 2 rcp8 5 0 6 rcp4 5 and 0 4 rcp2 6 in addition a majority of the future monthly precipitation is higher than the historical level reflected by observed data for the period 1961 2015 significant differences in intra annual precipitation variation between the summer monsoon and other seasons are also projected although mean annual precipitation is projected to increase figs 5b d the precipitation decrease was forecasted in the summer months i e july to september in the chaohe watershed fig 5f hereinto the rates of summer precipitation variation were 18 3 14 2 and 13 3 below the low level medium level and high level emission pathways respectively relative to the summer precipitation for the historical period 1961 2015 3 3 future streamflow and evapotranspiration change under climate change 3 3 1 streamflow and evapotranspiration variations at the annual scale the increasing trend of annual streamflow agrees well with the projected annual precipitation under all three rcps conditions fig 6a hereinto the increase of annual streamflow is more dramatic under the rcp8 5 scenario increase by 4 6 compared with the historical period than that under the medium 3 7 and low 1 3 emission scenarios until the end of the 21st century moreover similar to the annual precipitation variation there will be a small change in the low and medium emission conditions but a significant upward under the rcp8 5 pathway as critical information for risk assessment streamflow return levels of the historical and future periods are illustrated in fig 6c under three warming scenarios the 5 year streamflow return period will increase by 10 5 21 9 p 0 01 until the end of this century the streamflow under 20 year 50 year or 100 year return scenarios are all projected to decrease p 0 01 for example streamflow with the return period of 100 years will decrease by 14 1 22 8 conversely the difference in streamflow with a 10 year return period is insignificant p 0 46 moreover no significant differences are found among the three future climate scenarios with all return period levels p 0 41 a similar long term rising trend of annual evapotranspiration et will occur among the different rcp pathways from the early 2020 s to the late 2100 s fig 7a from 2020 2100 the watershed et is expected to increase by 13 1 p 0 25 9 6 p 0 12 and 5 3 p 0 11 compared with the historical annual average 461 1 mm under the high medium and low emission scenarios respectively 3 3 2 streamflow and evapotranspiration variations at the seasonal scale the monthly dispersion coefficient d c of streamflow will increase overall from the historical period under the three rcps and will be the largest under the high level emission pathway than the other two scenarios in most months fig 8 notably monthly d c from july to september shows a sizeable increase of up to 200 manifesting an apparent unstable streamflow variation during the summer monsoon months in the future large differences in streamflow are found between seasons caused by seasonal differences in precipitation and temperature changes fig 6 mean monthly streamflow projection during 2020 2100 shows the maximum in summer 27 3 mm 28 4 mm and 29 1 mm under the scenario rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively consistent with the timing of the observed mean monthly streamflow in the historical period in addition a negative trend of mean monthly streamflow is projected during the summer monsoon period for all the rcp scenarios by a range of 21 3 30 5 in july 16 9 31 7 in august and 28 1 37 0 in september compared with the historical period respectively the streamflow trends are contrary to the increase projected for all other months throughout the year the seasonal variations in et for three pathways are shown in fig 7b minimum cumulative et in the winter months from december to february et is lower than other seasons because of low evaporation demand afterwards et increases gradually due to canopy emergence monthly et exhibits a single peak at the watershed per year with the maximum value appeared in july 113 2 124 1 mm under the three rcps in spring and autumn the cumulative et ranges from 130 5 to 145 3 mm and 58 5 64 7 mm under the scenario rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 7b additionally the distribution of the change rate cr mm per year of monthly et differs under the three rcps the positive monthly et trend is consistent with the expected acceleration of the hydrological cycle caused by an increased evaporative demand associated with rising radiative forcing and temperatures fig 7c for instance a relatively high cr of et from the early 2020 s to the late 2090 s in summer has the values of 5 5 mm 6 3 mm and 6 9 mm per year without a significant variation under low medium and high emission scenarios respectively fig 9 depicts the relationships between streamflow and precipitation variations at monthly and annual scales under the three rcps from 2020 to 2100 respectively overall the correlation coefficients between monthly streamflow and monthly precipitation are 0 91 in rcp2 6 p 0 001 0 86 in rcp4 5 p 0 001 and 0 89 in rcp8 5 p 0 001 which indicate the monthly streamflow change under all the rcps scenarios corresponds to the precipitation variation very well fig 9a annual streamflow and precipitation variations are significantly correlated i e correlation coefficients 0 77 0 72 and 0 67 under three pathways respectively p 0 001 fig 9b correlation coefficients between summer streamflow and precipitation variations are as high as 0 99 under the rcp4 5 p 0 01 fig 9c and 0 76 under the rcp2 6 p 0 01 fig 9c the correlation coefficients between non summer streamflow variations and the monthly precipitation fluctuations are significant fig 9d p 0 001 and p 0 01 under the rcp2 6 the rcp4 5 and the rc8 5 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 climate differences between summer monsoon and other seasons projected annual precipitation and temperature under all the emission scenarios indicated that the watershed is likely to be wetter and warmer until the end of this century the projected future temperature for the watershed will increase by 0 8 3 8 c by 2100 under the three representative concentration pathways in line with the projected future warming over china particularly in northern china and an even more significant warming trend compared with the annual mean temperature increase by 0 4 1 3 c per century from 1906 to 2005 chen and frauenfeld 2014 wu and ma 2012 in northern china the warming and its consequences for the water cycle are related to the northwards shift of climate zones litschi et al 2006 although there is some inter annual and decadal fluctuation the wetting trend is consistent with most global model predictions alfieri et al 2015 aloysius and saiers 2017 decreased precipitation forecasted in this watershed during the summer monsoon period contrary to other seasons is mainly driven by a weakening of the easm in northern china the easm delivers around 60 70 of yearly precipitation lei et al 2010 reduced sea surface temperature gradients hinder the asian summer monsoon thus preventing ocean moisture from reaching northern china jiang et al 2017 moreover el niño s strongly impact on summer precipitation is also responsible for the northern china droughts ouyang et al 2014 summer precipitation in northern china might be reduced by up to 30 in reaction to a 1 c el niño sea surface temperature anomaly wen et al 2015 beyond that other reasons such as surface cooling caused by aerosol forcing also facilitate the weakening of the easm song et al 2014 4 2 changes in annual streamflow characteristics precipitation is fundamental for the sustainable development of terrestrial ecosystems as a vital natural water resource precipitation influences streamflow directly while evapotranspiration is also constrained by other environmental factors such as temperature humidity and radiation qi et al 2019 previous studies indicated that the precipitation changes are the dominant cause of streamflow variations zhang et al 2011 a strong positive correlation p 0 001 existed between precipitation and streamflow over this water limited watershed at both annual and monthly scales fig 9 and increasing precipitation provides more available water besides the water supply increasing evapotranspiration caused by surface warming is also a critical driver of streamflow variation and drought risk prediction evapotranspiration affects streamflow similarly in different seasons though having different magnitudes the positive et variation trend until 2100 is expected to increase by 13 1 9 6 and 5 3 compared with the historical annual average 461 1 mm under high medium and low emission scenarios respectively previous studies also verified a persistent increase in evapotranspiration over china for both target warming scenarios yao et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 hereinto the positive changes in evapotranspiration are more significant for the 2 0 c warming in the parts of northern china than those at the 1 5 c warming su et al 2018 meanwhile significant increases in potential evapotranspiration are also projected throughout china for both target periods the percentage increase in precipitation averaged over land is around 1 7 per degree celsius rise in mean surface air temperature while the increase in potential evapotranspiration is 5 3 per degree celsius fu and feng 2014 it is vital to weigh the increasing precipitation and the intensifying water consumption under climate warming studied suggested that under the 1 5 c global warming scenario increasing trends of evapotranspiration and precipitation are projected across china the scenario also suggests a trend toward wetter conditions in north china caused by a more substantial impact of increases in precipitation than in evapotranspiration su et al 2018 nevertheless the opposite tendency is also found in arid northwestern china caused by high evapotranspiration the rate of et increases would be two or three times larger than that of precipitation at the end of the 21st century yao et al 2019 moreover soil moisture and groundwater recharge are likely to decrease due to the warming induced increase in vapor pressure deficit and the increase in evaporative demand of the atmosphere i e potential evapotranspiration berg and sheffield 2018 these changes will substantially impact the terrestrial ecosystem structure and function xu et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 4 3 changes in seasonal streamflow characteristics as climate variability primarily refers the variations in air temperature and precipitation control the response of the watershed s flow to changing climate yang et al 2014 and studies across china did exhibit this response and also projected that varied hydrological responses of seasonal climate change patterns shi et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 streamflow from october to february increases in all rcps due to the combined effects of increasing precipitation in winter and low evapotranspiration demand figs 5f and 6b consistent with other studies that increasing streamflow is mainly caused by the combined effects of increasing precipitation in winter and spring and therefore warmer watersheds that experience flood events throughout this period are predominately projected to show increases in peak monthly flow byun et al 2019 while higher evapotranspiration stimulated by rising temperature fig 5e with declining precipitation fig 5f contributed substantially to the streamflow decreased during the summer monsoon season fig 6 although the higher available water for plants could mitigate the effects of higher temperatures to some extent because of diminished precipitation and subsequent reductions in available water will limit the response of et at the watershed to increases in air temperature diminished precipitation during the growing season increases water stress on vegetation and decreases the photosynthetic rate which causes a decrease in et pourmokhtarian et al 2017 therefore reduced available moisture supply and drought risks driven by a warmer and drier summer climate would negatively affect vegetation and further increase the carbon emission for terrestrial ecosystems undoubtedly streamflow fluctuation caused by climate change poses more difficult challenges to dealing with extreme hydrological events and watershed ecosystem management rana et al 2014 on the positive side increased precipitation in spring fall and winter would reduce the drought risks and provide more available water for terrestrial vegetation gherardi and sala 2015 in addition alterations in the magnitude of characteristic flows identify potential threats from global warming and have critical implications for future water resource management soriano et al 2020 yazdandoost et al 2020 an upward trend in the annual streamflow with a short term return period is projected under all scenarios fig 6c increased precipitation across the watershed could favor mitigation of water scarcity and drought in the water limited regions during the non summer monsoon months fig 5f while the opposite trend is also revealed in parts of northern china where may experience warmer annual temperatures and have drier springs and early summers march june under 1 5 and 2 c global warming liu et al 2017 moreover streamflow with long term return periods such as 20 year 50 year or 100 year return levels is expected to decrease in the future fig 6c to some extent the study catchment may benefit from the warming environment during the drier summers to early autumns july september which would potentially lead to fewer floods during the rainy season consequently it is critical to establish appropriate adaptation strategies to mitigate climate change s adverse effects on streamflow and increase watershed resilience to extreme climate events hongxing et al 2007 one of the critical challenges in assessing the effects of climate change on the hydrological regimes is determining how vegetation changes with increasing carbon dioxide concentration and variations in precipitation and temperature novick et al 2016 because ecological processes are inextricably linked to hydrological processes and both of which are subject to climate change jiao et al 2017 specifically changes in ecological processes regulate hydrological processes e g streamflow and infiltration through altering precipitation interception interception soil evaporation and plant transpiration asbjornsen et al 2011 therefore future climate change can indirectly modulate hydrological regimes by affecting vegetation dynamics vegetation growth induced by increasing carbon dioxide concentration will consume more available water through transpiration in the future resulting in local streamflow reduction despite the fact that they accelerate the water cycle at a large scale hunt et al 2020 sun et al 2020 future studies should focus on incorporating and quantifying the interactions and feedbacks among climate change vegetation dynamics and hydrological regimes 5 conclusions variations in climate and streamflow in the future at annual and seasonal scales are forecasted for the most critical drinking water reservoir watershed for metropolitan beijing located in the temperate monsoon climate region of northern china overall the watershed is likely to become warmer and wetter while the summer monsoon period experiences a drier and warmer trend until the end of this century consequently future monthly streamflow during the summer will decrease due to reduced precipitation and increased evapotranspiration while increasing in other seasons moreover climate change also affects watershed water resources and extreme hydrological events on one hand the predicted increase in the short term return period annual streamflow could ease the water shortage and reduce the drought risks in the non summer monsoon seasons on the other hand the projected variations in streamflow with return periods of 20 year 50 year or 100 year will be reduced due to the decrease in summer precipitation which could reduce flood risks during the summer monsoon period credit authorship contribution statement wenxu cao conceptualization writing original draft methodology formal analysis zhiqiang zhang

8115,study region the chaohe watershed is a meso scale watershed in northern china and the primary reservoir watershed for beijing s drinking water supply study focus this research aims to evaluate the effects of climate change on future seasonal streamflow regimes and understand the challenges to watershed management the regional hydro ecological simulation system rhessys was applied to investigate the watershed s future hydrographic characteristics under the forcing of the downscaled precipitation and temperature projected by general circulation models gcms under three emissions scenarios new hydrological insights for the region the future climate exhibits a drier and warmer trend in the summer monsoon period contrasting with other seasons in the watershed precipitation will decrease by 47 5 57 2 mm during the summer monsoon period while increasing annually future summer streamflow will decrease accordingly which is also driven by increased evapotranspiration due to rising temperature an increased dispersion coefficient of streamflow also indicates more dramatic variations in summer the annual streamflow magnitude with a 5 year return period increases significantly p 0 01 indicating a reduced risk for future water shortages however the magnitude of streamflow will decrease with the prolonged return periods p 0 01 this study emphasizes the critical significance of predicting the seasonal variability of streamflow and other hydrological property changes at the local scale to provide valuable information for developing adaptive resource management and hazard relief strategies graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change hydrological regime rhessys summer season return period watershed management 1 introduction climate change accelerates the global water cycle alters flow regime induces more extreme events lópez ballesteros et al 2020 and modifies regional and global water resource distributions piao et al 2010 gizaw et al 2017 however there are significant discrepancies in climate change between different geographical regions and time scales blöschl et al 2019 more complex heterogeneous precipitation changes than the consistent warming trend will cause divergent fluctuations within hydrological processes across the scales donat et al 2016 for instance precipitation substantially increased in the southwestern china but declined by 5 per decade in the northern region zhai et al 2005 extreme flows such as high flows and low flows are expected to rise within northern europe and the high latitude regions of north america whereas a decrease in the southern regions of europe and north america dai et al 2009 hirabayashi et al 2013 streamflow is projected to decrease over the southwestern north america in the next 100 years while the opposite trend is predicted over the eastern north america due to the increased precipitation reynolds et al 2015 the discrepancies in climate change and its hydrological impacts make it hard to develop adaptive watershed management without localized projections the east asian summer monsoon easm transfers moisture to land from the ocean facilitating temporal heterogeneity in precipitation the easm has been weakening for the last half century leading to drier conditions over northern china s semi arid areas shen et al 2018 since the late 1990s a significant trend towards drier parts of northern china has been noticed which played an essential role in modifying the drought pattern xu et al 2018 more importantly the monsoon system generates seasonal changes in climate and thus hydrological regimes for instance significant decreasing trends in the summer precipitation were detected over northern china while the opposite trend was found for the same area in the winter months zhai et al 2005 temporal variability in climate and streamflow have significant consequences for regional water resources management seddon et al 2016 climatic change induced seasonal fluctuations in climate and hydrological regimes pose severe challenges to disaster avoidance in northern china it is estimated that extreme drought in northwest china has caused major ecological and economic consequences ouyang et al 2015 therefore it is important to detect the variations in the hydrological regime driven by climate change at different temporal scales i e both annual and seasonal at the watershed scale to achieve sustainable water resources management and adaptation strategies in the future the effects of climate change on water resources can be investigated by incorporating climate change projections e g air temperature and precipitation into models that reliably quantify the spatio temporal variations of water fluxes in a watershed under different socioeconomic pathways aloysius and saiers 2017 general circulation models gcms are applied to provide estimates of the climate response and future climate scenarios over large regions asseng et al 2013 the number of gcms available for climate change projections is increased from 25 with the coupled model inter comparison project cmip phase 3 to 61 with cmip phase 5 however uncertainties in predicting the future climate remain large and might even increase with the increasing number of climate models available hargreaves 2010 lutz et al 2016 additionally the performance of gcms varies within geographic regions ahmadalipour et al 2017 therefore it is vital to select the appropriate gcms to capture and forecast the climatological patterns and variations for a specific region at regional and watershed scales gcms must be downscaled to generate the accurate high resolution climate variables used for hydrological simulation and prediction although gcms could generate hydrological variables directly the simulated hydrological processes and regimes are inadequate xu and singh 2004 for example gcms do not represent the lateral transfer of water fluxes very well kite et al 1994 physical processes based distributed hydrological models could dynamically simulate the transfer of horizontal and vertical water fluxes by dividing watershed into grids or sub catchments and incorporating watershed physical characteristics fatichi et al 2016 tegegne et al 2017 hence such models have been used in hydrological simulations under various scenarios including changes in land use and land cover and climate change zheng et al 2018 this study aims to predict the future hydrological regimes in the chaohe watershed situated in the temperate east asian monsoon climate region of northern china we used downscaled gcms data to forecast future climate change and drive the process based distributed eco hydrological model rhessys our specific objectives are to 1 project the annual and monthly variations in precipitation and air temperature 2 simulate the responses of annual and seasonal streamflow dynamics under future climate scenarios and 3 evaluate the hydrological regime changes and forecast the risks for hydrological management at the study watershed 2 study region data and methods 2 1 the chaohe watershed the chaohe watershed located in northern china 116 08 117 28 e 40 34 41 37 n fig 1a has a drainage area of 4854 8 km2 elevated between 159 and 2218 m above the sea level this watershed the essential water source region of miyun reservoir provides more than 70 of the drinking water for the urban population in beijing tang et al 2011 the watershed is dominated by brown loam and luvic cinnamon soils li et al 2010 in addition more than 80 of the watershed is covered by forests shrubs and grass fig 1c while the rest is used for crop and construction or as bared areas the mean annual temperature mat and precipitation map during 1961 2015 is 12 3 and 509 2 mm respectively as a unique feature of the monsoon climate the summer is warm and wet contributing more than 80 of the annual precipitation 2 2 data daily precipitation series 1961 2015 from eight precipitation monitoring sites fig 1b were attained by the haihe river water conservancy commission beijing water authority and hydrology and water resource survey bureau of hebei province the thiessen polygon method was used to calculate the annual average precipitation thiessen 1911 in addition daily minimum mean and maximum temperature during 1961 2015 representing the historical period were obtained from three national meteorological stations miyun fengning and chengde maintained by the state meteorological administration china daily streamflow data at xiahui hydrological station the outlet station of the watershed fig 1b were obtained from the same source for daily precipitation data cao et al 2018 lou et al 2015 the digital elevation model dem and land use maps for 1979 1989 1999 and 2009 with 30 m resolution were derived from the computer network information center and institute of remote sensing and digital earth http www ceode cas cn sjyhfw chinese academy of sciences respectively the river network was built up by calculating flow direction from the dem data using the eight flow directions d8 algorithm o callaghan and mark 1984 the dem specified flow directions by assigning flow from each pixel to one of its eight neighbors in the direction with the steepest downward slope soil information was derived from the environmental and ecological science data center for western china wang et al 2013 finally land use data were reclassified into the evergreen forest deciduous forest shrub grass agriculture land and undeveloped land according to rhessys land cover database requirements 2 3 scenario datasets and downscaling the present and future daily precipitation and temperature projected by gcms were obtained from the earth system grid federation esgf http esgf node llnl gov search cmip5 an increasing number of climate models are available predicting important climatic variables for example the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 involves outputs from 61 different gcms lutz et al 2016 many gcms such as canesm2 cnrm cm5 and gfdl cm3 can realistically capture china s climatological patterns and spatial variations yang 2014 the canesm2 model is widely used because readily available daily predictor variables can be directly fed into the statistical downscaling model sdsm thus a decision support tool for assessing local climate change effects and the model outputs can be applied for further impact analysis with a high degree of certainty under new sets of emission scenarios downscaled by the sdsm getachew et al 2021 previous evaluation studies indicated that the canesm2 and gfdl cm3 could realistically reproduce the observed seasonal precipitation by national weather stations over northern china chen and frauenfeld 2014 in addition the cnrm cm5 also shows higher accuracy than the other models in simulating spatial patterns in the decadal change of climate zones over china he et al 2019 the selected cmip5 gcms including gfdl cm3 canesm2 and cnrm cm5 fig 2 were found to be able to reproduce climate variability i e statistical methods of annual average monthly average correlation coefficient and percent bias fig s1 and s2 in the study area during calibration and validation moreover three representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios i e rcp8 5 rcp4 5 and rcp2 6 representing distinct radiative forcing levels were applied to reflect the high medium stabilization and mitigation emission scenario respectively moss et al 2010 all data were uniformly interpolated to identical resolution with the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration national centers for environmental prediction reanalysis data the sdsm was used to generate the regional climate data for our study area the sdsm was selected based on the model s excellent climate downscaling techniques liu et al 2021 first long term and high quality observation data 1961 2015 was used to establish the robust statistical relationship between large scale downscaling predictor variables i e gcms predictors and local climate variables i e observed temperature and precipitation over the study area this step was needed to develop the statistical downscaling method second the sdsm combined two primary statistical downscaling transfer function generators that relate large area climate to local weather or from the upper air to the ground weather wilby and wigley 1997 the first method includes applying efficient regression analysis and the second is used to produce a temporary series of local variables such as precipitation with high stochastic fluctuations thirdly the sdsm is especially effective for hydrological research wilby 2002 as indicated in many evaluation studies this method replicated the main features of the observed hydrometeorology liu et al 2021 the goal of the sdsm is to establish the empirical relationship between the local climate variables and large scale variables this study selected different predictors including mean temperature relative and specific humidity near the ground surface and mean sea level pressure for temperature downscaling table 1 and s1 meanwhile we chose the 500 hpa geopotential height divergence and zonal velocity for precipitation downscaling table s1 we used the conventional bias correction method within the sdsm to inflate the variance of the downscaled time series finally we split the historical period of 1961 2015 into a calibration period i e 1961 1990 and the validation period i e 1991 2015 the detailed downscaling process was implemented in the following steps 1 quality control and transformation for observed temperature and precipitation data enable the diagnosis of missing data and outliers in observed precipitation and temperature data before running the sdsm 2 selecting suitable downscaling predictors the observed temperature and precipitation data were used to screen the preferred predictors for precipitation minimum and maximum temperature in the chaohe watershed respectively finally we selected ten predictors mean temperature relative and specific humidity near the ground surface mean sea level pressure and geopotential height the details are described in table s1 3 calibrating and validating the sdsm the daily temperature and precipitation data and selected predictors were used to construct downscaling multiple regression equations 4 generating the daily weather series for the next eighty years based on the selected gcms under the three emission scenarios although 2020 is no longer a future year it is included in the future period for the convenience of analysis 2 4 regional hydro ecological simulation system model 2 4 1 model construction and parameterization the regional hydro ecological simulation system rhessys a process based distributed model was used in our study to project the future streamflow variation the rhessys represents watersheds in a spatially nested hierarchical structure with a range of meteorological and hydrological processes associated with different hierarchy levels fig s3 the rhessys model includes an explicit hillslope hydrology model linking the ecosystem patches in a catena resolving coupled water carbon and nitrogen cycling with spatially varying topo climate drivers tague et al 2008 specifically the soil water profile is depicted in a vertically three layer model covering a saturated zone an unsaturated zone and a surface detention zone tague and band 2004 the standard penman monteith approach is used to calculate evaporation and transpiration rates stomatal conductance is used for surface conductance in a multiplicative model jarvis 1976 stomatal conductance is driven by solar radiation vapor pressure deficit rooting zone soil moisture air co2 concentration and air temperature controls the rhessys further scales leaf level transpiration to canopy transpiration by integrating over the leaf area index lai canopy interception is a function of the water holding capacity of the vegetation net throughfall from the canopy is first added to surface detention storage and then allowed to infiltrate into the soil following phillip s infiltration philip 1957 a condensed description of the hydrological processes including interception transpiration and evaporation is shown in the following equation a more detailed description of the rhessys can be found in the literature band et al 1996 tague et al 2004 infiltration in rhessys is calculated by phillip equation 1 q infil i t p s p t d t p k sat t d t p

with depth s p is sorptivity φ ae is air entry pressure φ is porosity and θ 0 is initial soil moisture content evaporation and transpiration rates are computed using the standard penman monteith equation evapotranspiration rates are computed for rainy and dry periods of each day and the vapor pressure deficit is adjusted accordingly total daily evaporation e is computed as 6 e min θ i e vpd 0

for sun and shaded leaves 2 4 2 model calibration and validation the rhessys was run with a daily time step based on available meteorological data our previous studies indicated an abrupt change in streamflow in the late 1980 s occurred due to implementing large scale afforestation programs zheng et al 2015 wang et al 2013 therefore we chose streamflow data from 1961 to 1979 and land use data of 1979 to calibrate the rhessys model to avoid influence from human activities first two years i e 1961 1962 of data were selected to spin up this model the model was validated using the calibrated parameters land use data in 2009 and hydro meteorological data from 2000 to 2015 the rhessys relies on parameters to describe typical soil vegetation and land use characteristics literature based estimates and the rhessys parameter database https github com rhessys rhessys wiki parameter definition files have been used to modify values for the vegetation and soil types in our study area seven key hydrologic parameters reflecting drainage efficiency and storage capacity of soils required calibration and validation including vertical and horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat v

et al 2004 a monte carlo simulation was implemented to sample 3000 initial parameter sets from recommended ranges in the rhessys parameter database and finally the optimum parameter set was calibrated and validated table 2 in addition the relative bias b ias coefficient of determination r 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency n se nash and sutcliffe 1970 were applied to evaluate the model performances

model performs model performance is reliable when n se and r 2 are larger than 0 5 and 0 6 and b ias is within 25 respectively moriasi et al 2013 2 5 analysis of streamflow changes the dispersion coefficient d c of streamflow was used to depict the stability of streamflow and calculated as follows zhang et al 2016 11 d c 75 th 25 th 50 th 100 where 25th 50th 75th are the annual streamflow percentiles the flow duration curve was estimated to depict the frequency distribution of streamflow from high flow to drought events for 2020 2100 under the three rcps return periods under five levels including 100 year 50 year 20 year 10 year and 5 year were applied to analyze streamflow frequency s temporal variation during the historical and future periods 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of gcm downscaling and rhessys to run the sdsm we need to calibrate and validate the relationship between observed temperature precipitation and large scale predictors before future climate scenarios with the gcm outputs could be effectively downscaled the scatter plots between downscaled and observed daily maximum minimum temperature and precipitation for the calibration and validation period are depicted in fig 3 the downscaled temperature data has been assessed to be generally consistent with observed historical data although it somewhat overestimated the observed maximum figs 3a and 3d and minimum figs 3b and 3e temperatures in the upper end in addition downscaled precipitation was close to the observed values except for extreme conditions monthly precipitation was under predicted for the values close to zero but over predicted for large values during the calibration fig 3c and validation fig 3f periods the downscaled maximum temperature minimum temperature and precipitation produced r 2 of 0 94 0 95 and 0 83 during the calibration period the values exhibited a little better than those in the verification period i e 0 94 0 91 and 0 65 respectively overall the sdsm model was very capable of generating projected climate scenarios over the chaohe watershed the values of r 2 n se and b ias during the rhessys model calibration period were 0 87 0 86 and 13 31 respectively indicating that the model performed exceptionally well to capture the hydrograph for the watershed fig 4a calibrated soil parameters governing the hydrological processes include horizontal and vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity i e ksat h and ksat v respectively decay of horizontal and vertical k with depth i e m h and m v respectively groundwater bypass flow i e gw1 and groundwater drainage rate i e gw2 in addition soil depth a critical parameter for the hydrological process in the rocky mountain area of northern china was also calibrated table 2 model validation further confirmed the modeling system s capacity to simulate the watershed s hydrological processes although the values of r 2 n se and b ias declined slightly in the validation period to 0 76 0 74 and 18 46 respectively fig 4b as a result there was a slight overestimate in the monthly streamflow with the rhessys for the watershed however overall the modeling system was able to reproduce the observed streamflow satisfactorily 3 2 future climate changes under three rcps 3 2 1 projected future temperature and precipitation changes the projected annual temperature compared with the historical measurement is presented in fig 5a under all rcp scenarios across the study area the mat will increase significantly by 0 8 c until 2100 under the rcp2 6 scenario which is within one of the long term temperature increase targets i e below 1 5 c from the pre industrial era until 2100 the temperature under the medium stabilization scenario is expected to increase by 1 6 c crossing the 1 5 c threshold mat will rise by 3 8 c under the high baseline emission pathway which is beyond the threshold for keeping global warming below 2 0 c with the radiative forcing increasing mat under the rcp8 5 scenario shows the most significant warming change by 31 2 compared with the historical period than that increase under the medium 13 3 and low level 6 8 emission scenarios moreover an increasing trend of annual precipitation is projected for all three scenarios over the chaohe watershed fig 5b d relative to the mean annual precipitation map for the historical period 1961 2015 future map will increase by 10 3 9 6 and 8 0 under the high medium and low level emission pathways respectively in addition among the three rcps there is an upward trend detected in rcp8 5 and rcp 4 5 scenarios while there has less variation in the low level emission scenario 3 2 2 monthly temperature and precipitation changes in the future global climate change has also altered the intra annual distribution of precipitation and temperature the same is true for annual and monthly temperatures that also show notable warming trends although there are slight differences between the three emission pathways fig 5e specifically mean monthly temperature change is sensitive to radiation forcing and increases with intensifying radiation conditions from scenario rcp2 6 to rcp8 5 as a result future temperature increases during summer exceed the mean annual change by 1 2 rcp8 5 0 6 rcp4 5 and 0 4 rcp2 6 in addition a majority of the future monthly precipitation is higher than the historical level reflected by observed data for the period 1961 2015 significant differences in intra annual precipitation variation between the summer monsoon and other seasons are also projected although mean annual precipitation is projected to increase figs 5b d the precipitation decrease was forecasted in the summer months i e july to september in the chaohe watershed fig 5f hereinto the rates of summer precipitation variation were 18 3 14 2 and 13 3 below the low level medium level and high level emission pathways respectively relative to the summer precipitation for the historical period 1961 2015 3 3 future streamflow and evapotranspiration change under climate change 3 3 1 streamflow and evapotranspiration variations at the annual scale the increasing trend of annual streamflow agrees well with the projected annual precipitation under all three rcps conditions fig 6a hereinto the increase of annual streamflow is more dramatic under the rcp8 5 scenario increase by 4 6 compared with the historical period than that under the medium 3 7 and low 1 3 emission scenarios until the end of the 21st century moreover similar to the annual precipitation variation there will be a small change in the low and medium emission conditions but a significant upward under the rcp8 5 pathway as critical information for risk assessment streamflow return levels of the historical and future periods are illustrated in fig 6c under three warming scenarios the 5 year streamflow return period will increase by 10 5 21 9 p 0 01 until the end of this century the streamflow under 20 year 50 year or 100 year return scenarios are all projected to decrease p 0 01 for example streamflow with the return period of 100 years will decrease by 14 1 22 8 conversely the difference in streamflow with a 10 year return period is insignificant p 0 46 moreover no significant differences are found among the three future climate scenarios with all return period levels p 0 41 a similar long term rising trend of annual evapotranspiration et will occur among the different rcp pathways from the early 2020 s to the late 2100 s fig 7a from 2020 2100 the watershed et is expected to increase by 13 1 p 0 25 9 6 p 0 12 and 5 3 p 0 11 compared with the historical annual average 461 1 mm under the high medium and low emission scenarios respectively 3 3 2 streamflow and evapotranspiration variations at the seasonal scale the monthly dispersion coefficient d c of streamflow will increase overall from the historical period under the three rcps and will be the largest under the high level emission pathway than the other two scenarios in most months fig 8 notably monthly d c from july to september shows a sizeable increase of up to 200 manifesting an apparent unstable streamflow variation during the summer monsoon months in the future large differences in streamflow are found between seasons caused by seasonal differences in precipitation and temperature changes fig 6 mean monthly streamflow projection during 2020 2100 shows the maximum in summer 27 3 mm 28 4 mm and 29 1 mm under the scenario rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively consistent with the timing of the observed mean monthly streamflow in the historical period in addition a negative trend of mean monthly streamflow is projected during the summer monsoon period for all the rcp scenarios by a range of 21 3 30 5 in july 16 9 31 7 in august and 28 1 37 0 in september compared with the historical period respectively the streamflow trends are contrary to the increase projected for all other months throughout the year the seasonal variations in et for three pathways are shown in fig 7b minimum cumulative et in the winter months from december to february et is lower than other seasons because of low evaporation demand afterwards et increases gradually due to canopy emergence monthly et exhibits a single peak at the watershed per year with the maximum value appeared in july 113 2 124 1 mm under the three rcps in spring and autumn the cumulative et ranges from 130 5 to 145 3 mm and 58 5 64 7 mm under the scenario rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 7b additionally the distribution of the change rate cr mm per year of monthly et differs under the three rcps the positive monthly et trend is consistent with the expected acceleration of the hydrological cycle caused by an increased evaporative demand associated with rising radiative forcing and temperatures fig 7c for instance a relatively high cr of et from the early 2020 s to the late 2090 s in summer has the values of 5 5 mm 6 3 mm and 6 9 mm per year without a significant variation under low medium and high emission scenarios respectively fig 9 depicts the relationships between streamflow and precipitation variations at monthly and annual scales under the three rcps from 2020 to 2100 respectively overall the correlation coefficients between monthly streamflow and monthly precipitation are 0 91 in rcp2 6 p 0 001 0 86 in rcp4 5 p 0 001 and 0 89 in rcp8 5 p 0 001 which indicate the monthly streamflow change under all the rcps scenarios corresponds to the precipitation variation very well fig 9a annual streamflow and precipitation variations are significantly correlated i e correlation coefficients 0 77 0 72 and 0 67 under three pathways respectively p 0 001 fig 9b correlation coefficients between summer streamflow and precipitation variations are as high as 0 99 under the rcp4 5 p 0 01 fig 9c and 0 76 under the rcp2 6 p 0 01 fig 9c the correlation coefficients between non summer streamflow variations and the monthly precipitation fluctuations are significant fig 9d p 0 001 and p 0 01 under the rcp2 6 the rcp4 5 and the rc8 5 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 climate differences between summer monsoon and other seasons projected annual precipitation and temperature under all the emission scenarios indicated that the watershed is likely to be wetter and warmer until the end of this century the projected future temperature for the watershed will increase by 0 8 3 8 c by 2100 under the three representative concentration pathways in line with the projected future warming over china particularly in northern china and an even more significant warming trend compared with the annual mean temperature increase by 0 4 1 3 c per century from 1906 to 2005 chen and frauenfeld 2014 wu and ma 2012 in northern china the warming and its consequences for the water cycle are related to the northwards shift of climate zones litschi et al 2006 although there is some inter annual and decadal fluctuation the wetting trend is consistent with most global model predictions alfieri et al 2015 aloysius and saiers 2017 decreased precipitation forecasted in this watershed during the summer monsoon period contrary to other seasons is mainly driven by a weakening of the easm in northern china the easm delivers around 60 70 of yearly precipitation lei et al 2010 reduced sea surface temperature gradients hinder the asian summer monsoon thus preventing ocean moisture from reaching northern china jiang et al 2017 moreover el niño s strongly impact on summer precipitation is also responsible for the northern china droughts ouyang et al 2014 summer precipitation in northern china might be reduced by up to 30 in reaction to a 1 c el niño sea surface temperature anomaly wen et al 2015 beyond that other reasons such as surface cooling caused by aerosol forcing also facilitate the weakening of the easm song et al 2014 4 2 changes in annual streamflow characteristics precipitation is fundamental for the sustainable development of terrestrial ecosystems as a vital natural water resource precipitation influences streamflow directly while evapotranspiration is also constrained by other environmental factors such as temperature humidity and radiation qi et al 2019 previous studies indicated that the precipitation changes are the dominant cause of streamflow variations zhang et al 2011 a strong positive correlation p 0 001 existed between precipitation and streamflow over this water limited watershed at both annual and monthly scales fig 9 and increasing precipitation provides more available water besides the water supply increasing evapotranspiration caused by surface warming is also a critical driver of streamflow variation and drought risk prediction evapotranspiration affects streamflow similarly in different seasons though having different magnitudes the positive et variation trend until 2100 is expected to increase by 13 1 9 6 and 5 3 compared with the historical annual average 461 1 mm under high medium and low emission scenarios respectively previous studies also verified a persistent increase in evapotranspiration over china for both target warming scenarios yao et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 hereinto the positive changes in evapotranspiration are more significant for the 2 0 c warming in the parts of northern china than those at the 1 5 c warming su et al 2018 meanwhile significant increases in potential evapotranspiration are also projected throughout china for both target periods the percentage increase in precipitation averaged over land is around 1 7 per degree celsius rise in mean surface air temperature while the increase in potential evapotranspiration is 5 3 per degree celsius fu and feng 2014 it is vital to weigh the increasing precipitation and the intensifying water consumption under climate warming studied suggested that under the 1 5 c global warming scenario increasing trends of evapotranspiration and precipitation are projected across china the scenario also suggests a trend toward wetter conditions in north china caused by a more substantial impact of increases in precipitation than in evapotranspiration su et al 2018 nevertheless the opposite tendency is also found in arid northwestern china caused by high evapotranspiration the rate of et increases would be two or three times larger than that of precipitation at the end of the 21st century yao et al 2019 moreover soil moisture and groundwater recharge are likely to decrease due to the warming induced increase in vapor pressure deficit and the increase in evaporative demand of the atmosphere i e potential evapotranspiration berg and sheffield 2018 these changes will substantially impact the terrestrial ecosystem structure and function xu et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 4 3 changes in seasonal streamflow characteristics as climate variability primarily refers the variations in air temperature and precipitation control the response of the watershed s flow to changing climate yang et al 2014 and studies across china did exhibit this response and also projected that varied hydrological responses of seasonal climate change patterns shi et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 streamflow from october to february increases in all rcps due to the combined effects of increasing precipitation in winter and low evapotranspiration demand figs 5f and 6b consistent with other studies that increasing streamflow is mainly caused by the combined effects of increasing precipitation in winter and spring and therefore warmer watersheds that experience flood events throughout this period are predominately projected to show increases in peak monthly flow byun et al 2019 while higher evapotranspiration stimulated by rising temperature fig 5e with declining precipitation fig 5f contributed substantially to the streamflow decreased during the summer monsoon season fig 6 although the higher available water for plants could mitigate the effects of higher temperatures to some extent because of diminished precipitation and subsequent reductions in available water will limit the response of et at the watershed to increases in air temperature diminished precipitation during the growing season increases water stress on vegetation and decreases the photosynthetic rate which causes a decrease in et pourmokhtarian et al 2017 therefore reduced available moisture supply and drought risks driven by a warmer and drier summer climate would negatively affect vegetation and further increase the carbon emission for terrestrial ecosystems undoubtedly streamflow fluctuation caused by climate change poses more difficult challenges to dealing with extreme hydrological events and watershed ecosystem management rana et al 2014 on the positive side increased precipitation in spring fall and winter would reduce the drought risks and provide more available water for terrestrial vegetation gherardi and sala 2015 in addition alterations in the magnitude of characteristic flows identify potential threats from global warming and have critical implications for future water resource management soriano et al 2020 yazdandoost et al 2020 an upward trend in the annual streamflow with a short term return period is projected under all scenarios fig 6c increased precipitation across the watershed could favor mitigation of water scarcity and drought in the water limited regions during the non summer monsoon months fig 5f while the opposite trend is also revealed in parts of northern china where may experience warmer annual temperatures and have drier springs and early summers march june under 1 5 and 2 c global warming liu et al 2017 moreover streamflow with long term return periods such as 20 year 50 year or 100 year return levels is expected to decrease in the future fig 6c to some extent the study catchment may benefit from the warming environment during the drier summers to early autumns july september which would potentially lead to fewer floods during the rainy season consequently it is critical to establish appropriate adaptation strategies to mitigate climate change s adverse effects on streamflow and increase watershed resilience to extreme climate events hongxing et al 2007 one of the critical challenges in assessing the effects of climate change on the hydrological regimes is determining how vegetation changes with increasing carbon dioxide concentration and variations in precipitation and temperature novick et al 2016 because ecological processes are inextricably linked to hydrological processes and both of which are subject to climate change jiao et al 2017 specifically changes in ecological processes regulate hydrological processes e g streamflow and infiltration through altering precipitation interception interception soil evaporation and plant transpiration asbjornsen et al 2011 therefore future climate change can indirectly modulate hydrological regimes by affecting vegetation dynamics vegetation growth induced by increasing carbon dioxide concentration will consume more available water through transpiration in the future resulting in local streamflow reduction despite the fact that they accelerate the water cycle at a large scale hunt et al 2020 sun et al 2020 future studies should focus on incorporating and quantifying the interactions and feedbacks among climate change vegetation dynamics and hydrological regimes 5 conclusions variations in climate and streamflow in the future at annual and seasonal scales are forecasted for the most critical drinking water reservoir watershed for metropolitan beijing located in the temperate monsoon climate region of northern china overall the watershed is likely to become warmer and wetter while the summer monsoon period experiences a drier and warmer trend until the end of this century consequently future monthly streamflow during the summer will decrease due to reduced precipitation and increased evapotranspiration while increasing in other seasons moreover climate change also affects watershed water resources and extreme hydrological events on one hand the predicted increase in the short term return period annual streamflow could ease the water shortage and reduce the drought risks in the non summer monsoon seasons on the other hand the projected variations in streamflow with return periods of 20 year 50 year or 100 year will be reduced due to the decrease in summer precipitation which could reduce flood risks during the summer monsoon period credit authorship contribution statement wenxu cao conceptualization writing original draft methodology formal analysis zhiqiang zhang

8116,study region the lake tana sub basin upper blue nile ethiopia study focus the lake tana sub basin is one of the agricultural growth corridors for ethiopia s ambitious plan to expand irrigation despite the booming irrigation activities in the sub basin limited information exists on the rate of irrigation expansion and its impact on the water balance of the sub basin this study collected and organized smallholder irrigation data in the sub basin to identify the actual irrigated area the abstracted irrigation water and its implications on seasonal water availability the area under small scale irrigation was estimated through data obtained from woredas districts databases crop patterns were obtained through field surveys irrigation water abstracted at daily timescale was measured new hydrological insights for the region in the sub basin 38 694 ha was under small scale irrigation in 2020 21 surface water is the dominant water source and it supplies about 80 of irrigation withdrawal water abstraction for small scale irrigation is about 430 mcm per dry season 50 of dry season flow the eastern side of the sub basin faces water shortages as the dry season flow is not sufficient for irrigation with the prospects of more irrigation expansion small scale irrigation water withdrawals pose concerns of water scarcity at local level and to the water balance of the sub basin hence there is urgent need for adaptive management of the small scale irrigation effect on the sub basin s hydrology keywords small scale irrigation dry season flow water abstraction lake tana sub basin water balance 1 introduction globally irrigation water withdrawal accounts for 70 of the total freshwater withdrawal and 90 of the consumptive water use shiklomanov 2000 fao 2011 irrigated lands contribute 40 of the world s crop production alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 this contribution is increasing over time globally the land area equipped for irrigation more than doubled between 1961 and 2018 faostat in east africa there are opportunities for irrigation expansion such as the unrealized irrigation potential the large scope for farming intensification and the increased promotion of irrigation by governments donors and farmers nakawuka et al 2018 however irrigation water use information is inadequate on the estimates of consumptive use from surface groundwater sources anderson et al 2012 there is also limited information on historical and current irrigation practices pena arancibia et al 2016 actual irrigated area at different scales is not known in most areas especially in less developed countries or basins the absence of irrigation water use monitoring despite the rapid expansion of irrigation water withdrawal will hinder adaptive water resources management irrigation development is considered key for reducing food insecurity and poverty in ethiopia awulachew et al 2007 hagos et al 2009 oates et al 2015 indicated that the desire to deal with climate change and transform the country s economy are among the main drivers for the increased irrigation developments in ethiopia as such increasing smallholder irrigated crop production and promotion of high value crops production are among the key strategies of the agriculture development led industrialization policy of ethiopia fdre federal democratic republic of ethiopia 2011 mofed 2010 npc 2015 however the realization of such developmental strategies is increasing the consumptive water use of irrigation industrialization and urbanization remote sensing analysis indicated that smallholder irrigation in ethiopia consumes on average 28 of the excess water precipitation evapotranspiration whereas large scale irrigation consumes 63 of the excess water vogels et al 2020 the combination of smallholder and large scale irrigation can therefore alter the water balance of ethiopian catchments one of the locations chosen as agricultural growth corridors of ethiopia is the lake tana sub basin worqlul et al 2015 due to its suitable water and land for irrigation development lake tana is the largest freshwater lake in ethiopia the lake tana sub basin is the source of the blue nile river and it feeds more than 60 of the nile river setegn et al 2008 this sub basin has undergone several changes in line with various developmental activities including development of large scale irrigation projects and hydropower plants alemayehu et al 2010 mequanent and mingist 2019 yenehun et al 2021 over the years major developmental projects that have been undertaken in the lake tana sub basin have caused hydrological changes the first one is the chara chara weir that was constructed at the outlet of lake tana for a small hydropower plant at tis ababy in 1996 kebede et al 2006 it was upgraded in 2001 alemayehu et al 2010 the second is the tana beles hydropower plant that was constructed in 2010 to generate 460 mw of electricity through diversion of water from lake tana it significantly decreased the outflow of lake tana sub basin yenehun et al 2021 the construction of the koga irrigation scheme that was completed in 2010 marked the third major hydrological change in the sub basin koga irrigation scheme has a reservoir of total storage of 83 1 106 m3 that can irrigate 7000 ha mott macdonald 2004 the expansion of pump irrigation in the gumara catchment of the sub basin is another developmental activity that is causing decreased dry season flow of the river abebe et al 2020 in recent years the sub basin is experiencing booming small scale irrigation for dry season production community managed and farmer led irrigations schemes are common in the sub basin with surface water irrigation being dominant in the uplands and groundwater use dominating the plains around lake tana worqlul et al 2015 however there is limited information on how this irrigation expansion impacts the water balance of the sub basin at present and in the future in the ethiopian context a scheme or farm is termed as a small scale irrigation when it is less than 200 ha a medium scale scheme when its acreage lies between 200 ha and 3000 ha and a large scale scheme when the acreage is greater than 3000 ha hagos et al 2009 previous water balance studies in the sub basin provided a range of estimations of inflows and outflows based on limited in situ data dessie et al 2015 alemu et al 2020 yenehun et al 2021 however they did not account for water abstractions for irrigation except one by dessie et al 2015 studies that looked at the impacts of planned medium and large scale irrigation projects in the sub basin show potential adverse ecological effects alemayehu et al 2010 mccartney et al 2010 mccartney and girma 2012 and yet all of them ignored the impact of small scale irrigation development given that smallholder farmers are spatially dispersed having accurate estimation of smallholder irrigated area and its expansion over the years is a challenge rate of smallholder irrigation expansion and water use is not well known in this sub basin and generally in ethiopia due to limited regular monitoring however such information is important for a country and a sub basin that is massively investing in irrigation and aiming to develop through agricultural led industrialization it is against this background that this study sought to i assess the actual irrigated area in lake tana sub basin ii quantify the volume of water currently being abstracted for irrigation and iii evaluate how the current water abstractions compare with the existing seasonal water availability 2 study site lake tana sub basin is located at the headwater of the blue nile abbay river basin in the northwestern ethiopia highlands in amhara region of ethiopia fig 1 the geographical location extends from 36 8 to 38 2 east and from 11 to 12 8 north covering drainage area land surface lake of about 15 321 km2 tigabu et al 2020a the lake covers about 3000 km2 20 of the drainage area the mean elevation is 2024 m varying from 1782 m at the point of outflow into the blue nile at bahir dar to 4083 m in the eastern part of the basin around mountain guna the slope ranges from 0 to 167 with an average slope of 8 6 worqlul et al 2015 the lake has mean depth of 9 m and maximum depth of 14 m and is located at an altitude of 1786 masl the plains surrounding the lake form extensive wetlands during the rainy season these include the fogera dembia and kunzila in the east north and southwest respectively alemayehu et al 2010 the sub basin provides extensive ecosystem services including fishing hydropower navigation agriculture and tourism most of the population in the sub basin live in rural areas and their livelihood depends on agriculture about 67 of the sub basin is used by smallholder farmers for rain fed crop production abera et al 2020 in these agricultural lands the dominant soil types can be generalized as clay and clay loam the planned and currently operational large irrigation schemes on the major rivers in the sub basin and those that use water directly from the lake are shown in fig 1 the currently operational schemes are koga which is fully operational and megech seraba which is partially operational whereas the ribb dam is currently under construction the mean annual rainfall of the sub basin is 1280 mm setegn et al 2008 with one main rainy season from june to september that accounts for more than 80 of the annual rainfall the rest of the year is dry except for some short rains during the march to may period the temperature of the sub basin is on average about 20 c with small seasonal changes unlike the rainfall the diurnal temperature changes on the other hand are large setegn et al 2008 there are four major rivers that feed lake tana these rivers account for 93 of the inflow to the lake kebede et al 2006 these include gilgel abay gumara ribb and megech rivers gilgel abay and gumara rivers account for about 70 of inflow to the lake tigabu et al 2020b in addition to these major rivers lake tana receives runoff from more than 40 rivers most of which are concentrated in the western part of the lake with small catchments and intermittent flows dessie et al 2015 rientjes et al 2011 3 methodology 3 1 hydro climatological analysis to provide the long term hydro climatic context of the sub basin monthly spatial rainfall over the lake tana sub basin was taken from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations v2 0 chirps chirps is a blend of satellite based rainfall estimates and gauge data available at a 0 05 x 0 05 horizontal resolution from 1981 to present http chg geog ucsb edu data chirps funk et al 2015 accuracy of chirps data was tested with rain gauges and found to be good for ethiopia dinku et al 2018 for the period 1981 2020 the presence of long term linear trend for moving average of three months period starting from january was estimated for temperature and potential evapotranspiration pet spatial mean temperature data over the lake tana sub basin was downloaded from climate research unit cru harris et al 2020 and the long term trend was estimated river flow data at the four major rivers was obtained from ministry of water irrigation and energy mowie recent river flow data from 2015 onwards was unavailable as the stage depths were not yet converted to discharge in ethiopia the period before the early 2000 s represents a time where withdrawals from the rivers were minimal thus data for the period 1990 2005 was used to analyze natural flow and its seasonality 3 2 irrigated area estimation scoping field visits were conducted in the lake tana sub basin lower administrative units woredas were visited and data on irrigated areas in each unit obtained woredas are comprised of on average 15 kebeles the lowest administrative units data for the kebeles is stored in the woredas databases seventeen woredas of the lake tana sub basin were visited selected kebeles data were obtained during the field visits the data obtained focused on small scale irrigation schemes information and individual farmers irrigating outside of formal schemes this data included river names irrigated area type of scheme water diversion method gps coordinates and major crop types grown in the selected kebeles the quality of data differed from woreda to woreda most woredas though use gps tracking method to determine the irrigated area making recorded data relatively accurate in most locations each kebele s data obtained from a particular woreda was then organized and formatted for this study s purposes 3 3 water abstraction estimation from the seventeen woredas larger areas of more than 1500 ha total area under irrigation were selected for daily data collection on irrigation water abstraction fifteen locations were selected in southern and eastern part of the basin where smallholder farmers use river diversions to irrigate their land fig 2a these 15 locations are found in five woredas of dangila mecha bahirdar zuria fogera and farta the selected locations are rivers with constructed weirs to divert water from rivers to canals and then straight to the fields individual command areas in these locations range from 20 ha to 200 ha table 1 water diversion was measured twice per day for a period from december 2020 to may 2021 at the fifteen locations in these locations farmers use furrow irrigation method for water application over application of water was witnessed in most fields water is commonly diverted for 24 h during the dry season some farmers mentioned they prefer to water during nighttime than daytime and thus the continuous diversion of water most farmers mentioned the water diverted is not enough for their land and that they use a scheduling system to be able to accommodate all farmers who use the diverted water the discharge of the diverted water in cubic meters per second was estimated by multiplying the depth of flow in the main canals with the velocity of flow the velocity of was estimated using the float method the time for a float to travel a certain distance in the main canal was measured the wetted area of the canal and the depth of flow in the canal were also measured these measurements were conducted twice a day during morning and evening hours these daily water abstraction measurements were conducted from december 2020 may 2021 the float method generally overestimates the average velocities the surface velocities obtained from this method were therefore multiplied with a correction factor of 0 85 salazar et al 1994 to obtain representative canal velocities average water diversion for the 15 sites was estimated for the command areas in liters per second per hectare this value was then used to estimate the irrigation water abstraction per woreda in the lake tana sub basin 3 4 crop water requirement a survey was conducted to obtain crop pattern data from eight selected woredas of lake tana sub basin this survey included three more woredas dera gondor zuira and libokemkem in addition to the five woredas considered in the daily water abstraction measurement this was done to ensure that some of the northeastern parts are included in the study fig 2b the main data collected in this survey included crop type irrigation area in hectare gps coordinate of irrigated plot water source for irrigation and approximate planting and harvesting dates of each crop more than 800 farms were covered in this survey this information was used to estimate the dominant crops per woreda in different parts of the sub basin and the percentage area coverage of each crop per woreda the data was also used to estimate crop water requirement cwr for comparison with the continuous water abstraction estimation cwr was estimated using cropwat software of fao smith 1992 climatic data that was required for cwr calculation was obtained from the national meteorology agency of ethiopia for the period from 2000 to 2017 this data was used to represent the current climate when estimating the associated water need for irrigation rainfall stations from 18 locations were used to estimate the monthly rainfall for each woreda for the other weather parameters four principal weather stations located at dangila debre tabor bahir dar and gondor were used weather parameters from these stations were used to calculate the reference crop evapotranspiration eto as per the penman monteith equation in allen et al 1998 the number of days for different stages of crop development kc values rooting depth depletion fraction and yield response fraction were taken from fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1988 the crop evapotranspiration etc was determined by multiplying eto with a crop coefficient kc the cwr was then estimated by subtracting effective rainfall estimated using usda method from etc etc eto kc where etc is the crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions mm month and kc is the crop coefficient nir etc pe if etc pe otherwise nir 0 due to enough rainfall where nir is the net irrigation requirement mm month and pe is the effective rainfall mm month farmers in the eastern part of the sub basin indicated that they have two irrigation seasons while those in the rest of the sub basin indicated that there have only one irrigation season in the eastern side of the sub basin the first irrigation season starts from mid october to early february and then the second irrigation season runs from mid february to may in the rest of the sub basin the irrigation season runs from december to april as such nir for identified crop types was estimated using two irrigation seasons for eastern part of the sub basin in fogera dera and libokemkem woredas one irrigation season was used for the rest of the woredas in the sub basin for woredas where the crop pattern survey was not conducted the neighboring woredas nir was adopted due to use of furrow irrigation method in farmers fields the canals being unlined and the over application of water in the fields water losses are big to account for such losses we used 45 overall irrigation efficiency in the estimation of total gross irrigation requirement gir in all woredas the 45 irrigation efficiency was applied after reviewing different studies in ethiopia on application efficiency canal efficiency and overall efficiency for example the average application efficiency of meki ziway irrigation scheme is 58 haile et al 2020 whereas abera et al 2020 used 65 application efficiency for lake tana sub basin the application efficiency accounts for losses in the irrigated plots but does not take into account losses in the canals in the awash basin strategic document 44 overall irrigation efficiency was used for the awash basin awash basin authority 2017 for woredas on the eastern side for their second season gir was estimated for half of the irrigated area for each crop in the woreda the length of growing period was used as per the standard estimated by fao for different regions in allen et al 1998 for consistency the water demand of each woreda was therefore calculated using the irrigated area coverage of each crop and its gir 3 5 seasonal water availability the total inflow to lake tana from gauged and ungauged catchments is estimated at 5426 106 m3 year as per rientjes et al 2011 in this study this annual estimate was used for two reasons firstly the data used in their study was for the period of 1994 2003 which is assumed to be a period before extensive irrigation started in the sub basin this period therefore is assumed to reflect natural flow of the rivers secondly they used a regionalization method to account for flows from ungauged rivers that produced satisfactory results the total dry season flow from the four major rivers plus the remaining rivers was categorized into four groups to simplify the seasonal water availability analysis the southern side of the basin is represented by the gilgel abay river contribution the eastern side is represented by the gumara and ribb rivers megech river represents the northern side whereas the western side has most of the small rivers dessie et al 2015 estimated the contribution of these inflows to the total inflow to lake tana as 58 from the southern side 30 from the eastern side 10 from the northern side and 2 from the western side in this current study the above estimation was adopted to divide the 5426 106 m3 year inflow into lake tana into contributions from the four sides the woredas were also categorized into the four sides as shown in table 2 comparisons between seasonal flows and irrigation water abstraction were done for each side 4 results 4 1 hydro climatology based on chirps data there was no statistically significant long term rainfall trend over the lake tana sub basin in the different seasons fig 3a this result of statistically non significant trend is similar with tigabu et al 2020a who used station data to detect trends although not statistically significant during this period the trend showed seasonal increment of rainfall in the range of 0 15 0 30 mm year although also hydrologically insignificant the months of may and june showed the highest increasing trend at monthly scale of up to 0 8 mm year during the period of 1981 2020 this might be related to late cessation of the march to may mam rainy season the early onset of the june to september jjas rainy season or the rainfall in that season being of high intensity in contrast seasonal temperatures showed a statistically significant increasing trend fig 3b in the range of 0 01 0 05 c year except for the period between june and august the peak irrigation period january to march had the highest temperature increase of 0 04 0 05 c year similar analysis for pet showed an increasing trend in the range of 0 05 0 3 mm year fig 3c the irrigation seasons had statistically significant increasing pet trends of more than 0 25 mm year based on the 1990 2005 river flow data the june to september period river flow accounted for 82 88 of annual flow whereas the dry season flow was only 12 18 of annual flow fig 4 it is during this dry season that farmers divert water from rivers to irrigate their fields 4 2 irrigated area data from the seventeen woredas in the lake tana sub basin showed that there were a total 38 694 ha under small scale irrigation fig 5 the woredas in the eastern and southern parts had larger irrigated areas nine woredas had total irrigated areas greater than 2000 ha fogera woreda had by far the largest area under irrigation 7361 ha in one season followed by libokemeken 5290 ha and gonder zuria 4134 ha woredas in terms of sources of water for irrigation 80 of the irrigation water in the sub basin during the study period was from surface water while the remaining 20 was from groundwater fig 6 the use of groundwater was mostly observed in the eastern part of the basin especially in fogera and dera woredas in areas that are closer to the lake and in the wetland areas hand dug wells were being used for backyard cultivation of vegetables there are large numbers of hand dug wells in fogera s achefer and mecha woredas however the area irrigated from these wells was very small on average 0 0625 ha of land per farmer during the survey it was noted that two large scale irrigation schemes are operational koga 6508 ha and megech seraba 566 ha with these two schemes the total irrigated area in the 2020 21 dry season in the sub basin was 45 768 ha most farmers in the eastern part of the sub basin indicated that they irrigate twice per year while in the rest of the sub basin farmers irrigate only once in a year water diversion methods to farms were commonly diversion by gravity and using diesel motor pumps to abstract water from rivers 4 3 irrigation water abstraction the irrigation abstraction measurements were conducted from december 2020 to may 2021 for about 149 days from the 15 sites in all locations water is diverted for 24 h and farmers irrigate in shifts both day and night we assumed no return flow for this study since farmers indicated that the water received in their fields was not sufficient the twice per day measurements at the 15 sites revealed the diverse amounts of water diverted in the woredas fig 7 the amount of water diverted ranged from 560 m3 day to 17 823 m3 day the water diverted largely depended on the size of irrigated area and to the size of the rivers table 3 and fig 7 table 3 provides the variations of measured flow in the channels with summarized statistics the average water abstraction which was estimated based on these 15 sites was 0 90 l s ha this average water abstraction rate was used to estimate the total water abstraction for each woreda the growing period for identified crops per each woreda was determined in order to estimate the days water is diverted during an irrigation season these days ranged from 130 to 149 depending on the woreda and the crop type for a single irrigation season for all woredas the total irrigated area was multiplied by the average abstraction rate to give the total water diversion of 430 106 m3 per dry season from rivers given that in the eastern part of the sub basin farmers irrigate twice in a year additional water is required for the second season in the second season half of the irrigated area was used and water was diverted for 90 days since farmers grow crops of short growing periods with this additional season the total water abstraction considering two irrigation seasons for the eastern part and a single season for the rest of the sub basin was 489 106 m3 per dry season result show that woredas in the east e g fogera and libokemkem abstracted the largest amounts of water as a result of having the largest irrigated area and two dry season cropping seasons fig 8a 4 4 gross irrigation requirement based on the crop pattern survey conducted in eight woredas it was found that farmers grow both cash crops such as onion garlic potatoes tomatoes and other cereal crops like wheat teff and maize they also grow fruit trees such as avocado in some places onion and garlic were found to be the most dominant crops grown in the lake tana sub basin during the irrigation season of october to may 2020 21 for each woreda the distribution of crops and percentage of area coverage per crop was different table 3 shows the crops and their area coverage per woreda during 2020 21 irrigation season the total irrigation water requirement was found to be 335 106 m3 per dry season for the 38 694 ha under small scale irrigation fig 8b this value is lower than the estimated abstracted water by about 150 106 m3 results showed that the eastern side of the sub basin required and abstracted larger amounts of water as can be seen in fig 8b this was expected since the eastern side had a larger irrigated area and two dry season cropping seasons table 4 4 5 seasonal water availability the four major rivers that account for 93 of inflow to the lake tana kebede et al 2006 had about 12 18 of their flow during the dry season as estimated from the 1990 2005 data this estimate was based on fig 4 for the period of october to may dry season from the total inflow of 5426 106 m3 year by rientjes et al 2011 the total dry season flow for the period october to may was therefore estimated to be about 889 106 m3 this dry season flow was categorized into the four sides of the sub basin as given in table 5 using 58 30 10 and 2 from southern eastern northern western side respectively dessie et al 2015 in general the estimated irrigation water abstraction for the dry season of 2020 21 accounted for about 50 of the total dry season flow however the eastern side abstracted the largest amount of water 85 of its dry season flow for its first irrigation season the northern and western sides of the sub basin abstracted more than half of their dry season flows table 5 whereas abstractions by the southern sides were lower these results show that in the eastern side water is insufficient if both irrigation seasons use only the rivers as sources of irrigation water for the eastern side two irrigation seasons required about 253 106 m3 water which cannot be supplied by the rivers inflow given that the area also uses groundwater sources these groundwater sources could supply the extra water needed nevertheless further investigations are needed to understand how farmers cope with water shortages including quantification of groundwater resources in the area considering only one irrigation season for all sides of the sub basin the water balance components of the lake tana sub basin were as shown in fig 9 the dry season rainfall and evaporation over the lake were estimated at 18 and 73 of the annual lake areal rainfall and lake evaporation estimated by rientjes et al 2011 respectively water transfer from lake tana to beles hydropower plant was estimated at 2424 106 m3 per year mccartney et al 2009 using linear interpolation to the dry season water transfer from lake tana to beles hydropower plant becomes 1616 106 m3 this indicates that water transfer to beles hydropower is larger than the water abstraction by small scale irrigation the concerns of water scarcity and damage to the environment are expected to be pronounced during the dry season when water in the rivers is limited the above estimation of irrigation water abstraction was based on only 38 694 ha of land under small scale irrigation the potential area that can be irrigated in the sub basin is huge some estimates from abbay basin development office abdo for small scale irrigation exceed 100 000 ha personal communication with abdo staff this big figure might be as a result of counting the same area twice with the assumption that that area is irrigated both in the first and second irrigation seasons the other reason might be due to the method of data collection that is based on administrative regions the estimated irrigated area might include areas that are not part of the lake tana sub basin other studies estimated approximately 130 000 ha 11 of the lake tana sub basin as potentially suitable for medium and large scale surface irrigation worqlul et al 2015 while bceom 1998 identified a net irrigation area of 121 260 ha considering these potentials if the current area of irrigated land is increased by 25 75 48 368 67 715 ha of the lake tana sub basin water abstraction would go up to about 782 106 m3 dry season table 6 for small scale irrigation which cannot be supplied by the dry season flow of the rivers 5 discussion 5 1 irrigated area and water abstraction arguably changes in irrigation use in lake tana sub basin are a more recent phenomena especially in the last 10 15 years where irrigation activities are increasingly getting attention and are being accepted by farmers small scale irrigation promotion and support by donors ngos and local governments are also considerable in the sub basin communities are benefiting from the expanding irrigation use and their livelihoods are being improved ayele et al 2013 nevertheless converting the increased household income as a result of irrigation activities to household food security is still a challenge kasie and alemu 2021 there is also a challenge of minimizing the negative impacts of the expanding irrigation use on the environment using remote sensing abera et al 2020 estimated that the irrigated area in the lake tana sub basin increased from 84 900 ha in 2006 121 400 ha in 2016 although the estimated area coverage requires verification it shows the undeniable expansion of irrigation in the sub basin in the last decade worqlul et al 2015 estimated that about 20 of the lake tana sub basin 130 508 ha is suitable for surface irrigation they indicated that whereas the average flow of gilgel abay and gumara rivers is sufficient to irrigate the potential irrigable land in the dry season that the flows of ribb and megech rivers are not sufficient and can only cover 50 and 35 of potential irrigable area respectively they reported that the gilgel abay had the largest potential area for surface irrigation and megech has the smallest potential area worqlul et al 2015 in this current study the estimation of actual irrigated area under small scale irrigation was based on recorded information at woreda level the total area under irrigation in the 2020 21 irrigation season was 45 768 ha with 38 694 ha under smallholder irrigation 6508 ha at koga irrigation scheme and 566 ha at megech seraba irrigation scheme it was found that the total area of 45 768 ha is lower than other estimates based on remote sensing methods abera et al 2020 for example estimated 121 400 ha as the actually irrigated land using 2016 landsat 8 30 m x 30 m image analysis they used the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the soil adjusted vegetation index savi methods to verify the image analysis they used ground control points gcp from 10 irrigation schemes located in the southern and eastern part of the basin in each irrigation scheme they took 13 points from irrigated area and 7 points from non irrigated area in total 200 points were used as gcp in their study for the entire lake tana sub basin they found the overall accuracy of the image analysis to be 87 the gcp coverage was mostly in the southern and eastern part of the basin number of gcp per crop was not justified given that the large irrigation projects were still under construction except koga irrigation scheme 7000 ha during the study period the estimated irrigated area in abera et al 2020 was about 114 000 ha which was largely gravity fed community managed irrigation schemes and irrigation from pumping of water from rivers for the irrigation water consumption they applied the crop water requirement method for onion and maize with field application efficiency of 65 with this assumption the irrigation water withdrawal was estimated at 798 106 m3 per year the international water management institute mapped irrigated and rainfed agriculture of ethiopia for the period 2015 2016 using landsat 8 images using normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and normalized difference moisture index ndmi methods chandrasekharan et al 2021 they indicated that they first took out forest and wetland areas before they divided the agricultural land into rainfed and irrigated they used gcp points although the number of points used is not specified as this data was collected from different government sources clipping out the lake tana sub basin showed an actual irrigated area of 132 958 ha for the sub basin fig 10a given that the analysis period of abera et al 2020 and iwmi are similar the image analysis results are expected to produce similar values for actual irrigated areas however the iwmi study showed most of the northern wetland areas and areas around the lake as irrigated on the contrary abera et al 2020 indicated that the southern and eastern parts of the sub basin had widespread irrigated areas and the northern part did not have concentrated irrigation refer to fig 10a in abera et al 2020 this shows that different remote sensing estimation methods provide different results we also checked the fao water productivity wapor 250 m resolution land cover classification data https wapor apps fao org catalog wapor 2 1 l1 lcc a from which actual irrigated area can be extracted the results show about 45 000 ha as actual irrigated area fig 10b this estimate is closer to this current study s estimate the greenness of wetland areas due to presence of water as seen in fig 10a can be wrongly picked up by image analysis as irrigated areas additional factors might also exaggerate the estimates of irrigated areas by the remote sensing methods thus the differences observed in the remote sensing products call for verification of remote sensing outputs before using them to plan effective water management this current study s estimate has good spatial coverage but can be further improved through better data organization and collection at woreda level this highlights the need to i build capacities of government units ii place systems in the woredas and iii improve existing methods for collecting and organize data training and showing the importance of such information to local level experts is important in the managing of the limited water resources in their respective localities for the irrigation water abstraction estimates this current study estimated that 430 106 m3 was abstracted during the 2020 21 dry season abera et al 2020 estimated 798 106 m3 year for the irrigated area that is three folds larger than this current study s estimate the estimated abstracted amount by abera et al 2020 is too large to be supplied by the dry season flow of the lake tana sub basin rivers dessie et al 2015 estimated irrigation water abstraction from ungauged rivers at 133 106 m3 per year using 2012 2013 data they used 7 mm day of total irrigation demand for the october to may irrigation period and assumed that 15 of the irrigable potential was actually irrigated in the ungauged catchments of the sub basin if the 7 mm day irrigation demand is used in this current study for the small scale irrigated area of 38 694 ha the irrigation water abstraction becomes 403 106 m3 year for the 149 days of irrigation and 650 106 m3 year for the 240 days of the october to may season which dessie et al 2015 considered if the currently irrigated area of the sub basin is more than 120 000 ha as previous remote sensing results showed the irrigation water abstraction would be more than 1250 106 m3 dry season with 7 mm day irrigation demand given that such large amount of water cannot be supplied by dry season flow water scarcity and associated conflicts would be expected to be common in the area if only rivers are used for irrigation however the total gir estimated by this current study was 335 106 m3 per dry season a value lower by about 150 106 m3 from the estimated water abstraction amount this implies that a large amount of water is lost and is not used for productive purposes this calls for better water management approaches at field and also lining of the main and secondary canals when all the proposed large scale irrigation projects become operational the irrigation water requirement will be huge if the 516 106 m3 estimate by mccartney et al 2009 for large scale irrigation and the 489 106 m3 of this current study s small scale irrigation abstraction are summed up the total abstraction will be 1005 106 m3 which is a huge amount although large scale irrigation mostly depends on the storage of water from excess rainfall during the peak rainfall seasons whereas the major water sources for small scale irrigation sources are the rivers there are also allowances for maintaining environmental flows for the large scale irrigation projects unlike in smallholder irrigation that divert or pump water until the rivers dry up 5 2 seasonal water availability during field visits in gumara watershed it was observed that water was being pumped from the rivers with several pumps installed in one location fig 11 shows multiple pumps being used for irrigating about 40 ha of land fig 12a shows a picture taken on 10th march 2021 when the gumara river had some water in it after 10 days on 20th march 2021 the same river had almost completely dried up fig 12b this river stayed like that until the onset of the next rainy season in june 2021 this pictorial evidence of change in water quantity in gumara river in the dry season demonstrates the impact of irrigation water abstraction by the large number of pumps and irrigation sites upstream of this location in terms of ecosystem damage mequanent et al 2021 indicated that excessive water abstraction for irrigation in gumara and ribb rivers resulted in mass fish killing hence unwise use of water resources for irrigation is concerning at different scales there were differences in the southern and eastern watersheds during the field visits in the eastern parts water scarcity was raised as a main issue and we witnessed dried up rivers and streams farmers complained about conflicts due to water sharing between users of the upstream and downstream parts of the streams rivers in contrast in the southern part of the sub basin most farmers did not complain about water shortage their concerns were on other issues such as high pump maintenance costs and high diesel cost this is in line with the amounts of water available for irrigation in the different sides given that the gilgel abay watershed has the highest amount of water and receives high rainfall the irrigation water abstraction was not yet to the level that can create water shortages on the contrary the eastern side receives lower rainfall amounts and subsequently has low river flows also since farmers on the eastern side have two irrigation seasons the likelihood of water shortages is high in that part of the sub basin comparing our results with those of the measured river flows during the dry season of 2020 21 was not successful river flow data was not available from the government organizations as gauge stage measurements had not yet been converted to discharge data 5 3 hydrological data quality historical trends on the flows of the major rivers of the sub basin vary depending on the time used for the analysis and the studies decrease in the mean annual stream flows of gilgel abay and ribb was observed for the period 1973 2005 and 1973 2003 respectively by tekleab et al 2013 the decreasing trend in gilgel abay dry season flow low flow for 1982 2005 was shown by rientjes et al 2011 for 1964 2005 by taye and willems 2012 and for 1960 2004 by gebrehiwot et al 2014 however recent studies show extremely high increase in dry season flow of gilgel abay after 2006 by about 200 when compared to 1980 2005 average worqlul et al 2018 this might be due to changes in the location of the gauging station personal communication with local people many aspects change when the measurement location changes such as the datum cross section channel slope and thus the rating curve also needs to be changed on the contrary tigabu et al 2020a reported decreasing trend for the wet season and no siginficant trend for dry season of gilgel abay using the period of 1973 2009 the same study showed significant increasing trend for gumara and megech dry and wet season flows for the period 1960 2015 and 1980 2015 respectively for gumar river abebe et al 2020 developed their own rating curve to calculate its discharge for the period of 1973 2018 with this updated data both the low flow and wet season flow showed decreasing trends the decrease in low flow was statistically significant and the trend was attributed to expansion of pump irrigation and plantations tigabu et al 2020a attributed the increasing flow trends to land use changes and high intensity rainfall with decreased rainy days in a year this flow data needs to be checked as there is no siginficant increasing trend in rainfall and the river dries up during the irrigation season due to the pump irrigation expansion in the gumara catchment dry season data especially after the year 2006 thus requires quality check assessments with updated rating curves for the lake tana sub basin 6 conclusions ethiopia s water resources are historically under pressure due to high climate variability taye et al 2021 occurrence of extreme cases of droughts and floods conway and schipper 2011 and environmental degradation woldesenbet et al 2018 the planned developmental activities may increase pressure on water if not managed properly currently irrigation is becoming the main water user during the dry season since most water for irrigation is abstracted directly from rivers streams and springs monitoring irrigation water use from surface and groundwater is important in order to manage water resources properly and avoid water scarcity and associated conflicts although small scale irrigation is booming in the lake tana sub basin its area coverage is not known this study sought to bridge this gap in knowledge the results of this study show the actual irrigated area in the sub basin for small scale irrigation and two large scale schemes the water abstraction for such irrigation activities is high and need to be considered in water management plans and decisions actual irrigated area estimates in the sub basin varies from the different methods used in the various studies consequently the water abstraction for irrigation also varies depending on the study this study found that the water abstraction by small scale irrigation for one irrigation season is currently at 430 106 m3 year given that water storage mechanisms are not yet fully developed in the sub basin the irrigation water withdrawals during the dry season are causing water scarcity and environmental damage assuming irrigation from rivers only water is more of a constraint than land for irrigation in the lake tana sub basin especially in the eastern part of the sub basin additionally water losses without productive use are high with the current type of irrigation methods and irrigation infrastructure this calls for better water management practices since there is no database that collects such studies and attempts to create consolidated information database development for water abstraction by different sectors is needed in the sub basin if the abbay basin development office takes the lead on data management and establishing reliable estimation methods it will be useful when making water management decisions as ethiopia is working to achieve the sustainable development goals sdgs one of the targets is on water use and scarcity sdg 6 4 this target states by 2030 substantially increase water use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity to achieve this target and if the country is to efficiently use and manage the scarce water resources available water water use and environmental flows need to be monitored since agriculture accounts for most of the water abstraction giving attention to the booming small scale irrigation water withdrawal is very crucial

8116,study region the lake tana sub basin upper blue nile ethiopia study focus the lake tana sub basin is one of the agricultural growth corridors for ethiopia s ambitious plan to expand irrigation despite the booming irrigation activities in the sub basin limited information exists on the rate of irrigation expansion and its impact on the water balance of the sub basin this study collected and organized smallholder irrigation data in the sub basin to identify the actual irrigated area the abstracted irrigation water and its implications on seasonal water availability the area under small scale irrigation was estimated through data obtained from woredas districts databases crop patterns were obtained through field surveys irrigation water abstracted at daily timescale was measured new hydrological insights for the region in the sub basin 38 694 ha was under small scale irrigation in 2020 21 surface water is the dominant water source and it supplies about 80 of irrigation withdrawal water abstraction for small scale irrigation is about 430 mcm per dry season 50 of dry season flow the eastern side of the sub basin faces water shortages as the dry season flow is not sufficient for irrigation with the prospects of more irrigation expansion small scale irrigation water withdrawals pose concerns of water scarcity at local level and to the water balance of the sub basin hence there is urgent need for adaptive management of the small scale irrigation effect on the sub basin s hydrology keywords small scale irrigation dry season flow water abstraction lake tana sub basin water balance 1 introduction globally irrigation water withdrawal accounts for 70 of the total freshwater withdrawal and 90 of the consumptive water use shiklomanov 2000 fao 2011 irrigated lands contribute 40 of the world s crop production alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 this contribution is increasing over time globally the land area equipped for irrigation more than doubled between 1961 and 2018 faostat in east africa there are opportunities for irrigation expansion such as the unrealized irrigation potential the large scope for farming intensification and the increased promotion of irrigation by governments donors and farmers nakawuka et al 2018 however irrigation water use information is inadequate on the estimates of consumptive use from surface groundwater sources anderson et al 2012 there is also limited information on historical and current irrigation practices pena arancibia et al 2016 actual irrigated area at different scales is not known in most areas especially in less developed countries or basins the absence of irrigation water use monitoring despite the rapid expansion of irrigation water withdrawal will hinder adaptive water resources management irrigation development is considered key for reducing food insecurity and poverty in ethiopia awulachew et al 2007 hagos et al 2009 oates et al 2015 indicated that the desire to deal with climate change and transform the country s economy are among the main drivers for the increased irrigation developments in ethiopia as such increasing smallholder irrigated crop production and promotion of high value crops production are among the key strategies of the agriculture development led industrialization policy of ethiopia fdre federal democratic republic of ethiopia 2011 mofed 2010 npc 2015 however the realization of such developmental strategies is increasing the consumptive water use of irrigation industrialization and urbanization remote sensing analysis indicated that smallholder irrigation in ethiopia consumes on average 28 of the excess water precipitation evapotranspiration whereas large scale irrigation consumes 63 of the excess water vogels et al 2020 the combination of smallholder and large scale irrigation can therefore alter the water balance of ethiopian catchments one of the locations chosen as agricultural growth corridors of ethiopia is the lake tana sub basin worqlul et al 2015 due to its suitable water and land for irrigation development lake tana is the largest freshwater lake in ethiopia the lake tana sub basin is the source of the blue nile river and it feeds more than 60 of the nile river setegn et al 2008 this sub basin has undergone several changes in line with various developmental activities including development of large scale irrigation projects and hydropower plants alemayehu et al 2010 mequanent and mingist 2019 yenehun et al 2021 over the years major developmental projects that have been undertaken in the lake tana sub basin have caused hydrological changes the first one is the chara chara weir that was constructed at the outlet of lake tana for a small hydropower plant at tis ababy in 1996 kebede et al 2006 it was upgraded in 2001 alemayehu et al 2010 the second is the tana beles hydropower plant that was constructed in 2010 to generate 460 mw of electricity through diversion of water from lake tana it significantly decreased the outflow of lake tana sub basin yenehun et al 2021 the construction of the koga irrigation scheme that was completed in 2010 marked the third major hydrological change in the sub basin koga irrigation scheme has a reservoir of total storage of 83 1 106 m3 that can irrigate 7000 ha mott macdonald 2004 the expansion of pump irrigation in the gumara catchment of the sub basin is another developmental activity that is causing decreased dry season flow of the river abebe et al 2020 in recent years the sub basin is experiencing booming small scale irrigation for dry season production community managed and farmer led irrigations schemes are common in the sub basin with surface water irrigation being dominant in the uplands and groundwater use dominating the plains around lake tana worqlul et al 2015 however there is limited information on how this irrigation expansion impacts the water balance of the sub basin at present and in the future in the ethiopian context a scheme or farm is termed as a small scale irrigation when it is less than 200 ha a medium scale scheme when its acreage lies between 200 ha and 3000 ha and a large scale scheme when the acreage is greater than 3000 ha hagos et al 2009 previous water balance studies in the sub basin provided a range of estimations of inflows and outflows based on limited in situ data dessie et al 2015 alemu et al 2020 yenehun et al 2021 however they did not account for water abstractions for irrigation except one by dessie et al 2015 studies that looked at the impacts of planned medium and large scale irrigation projects in the sub basin show potential adverse ecological effects alemayehu et al 2010 mccartney et al 2010 mccartney and girma 2012 and yet all of them ignored the impact of small scale irrigation development given that smallholder farmers are spatially dispersed having accurate estimation of smallholder irrigated area and its expansion over the years is a challenge rate of smallholder irrigation expansion and water use is not well known in this sub basin and generally in ethiopia due to limited regular monitoring however such information is important for a country and a sub basin that is massively investing in irrigation and aiming to develop through agricultural led industrialization it is against this background that this study sought to i assess the actual irrigated area in lake tana sub basin ii quantify the volume of water currently being abstracted for irrigation and iii evaluate how the current water abstractions compare with the existing seasonal water availability 2 study site lake tana sub basin is located at the headwater of the blue nile abbay river basin in the northwestern ethiopia highlands in amhara region of ethiopia fig 1 the geographical location extends from 36 8 to 38 2 east and from 11 to 12 8 north covering drainage area land surface lake of about 15 321 km2 tigabu et al 2020a the lake covers about 3000 km2 20 of the drainage area the mean elevation is 2024 m varying from 1782 m at the point of outflow into the blue nile at bahir dar to 4083 m in the eastern part of the basin around mountain guna the slope ranges from 0 to 167 with an average slope of 8 6 worqlul et al 2015 the lake has mean depth of 9 m and maximum depth of 14 m and is located at an altitude of 1786 masl the plains surrounding the lake form extensive wetlands during the rainy season these include the fogera dembia and kunzila in the east north and southwest respectively alemayehu et al 2010 the sub basin provides extensive ecosystem services including fishing hydropower navigation agriculture and tourism most of the population in the sub basin live in rural areas and their livelihood depends on agriculture about 67 of the sub basin is used by smallholder farmers for rain fed crop production abera et al 2020 in these agricultural lands the dominant soil types can be generalized as clay and clay loam the planned and currently operational large irrigation schemes on the major rivers in the sub basin and those that use water directly from the lake are shown in fig 1 the currently operational schemes are koga which is fully operational and megech seraba which is partially operational whereas the ribb dam is currently under construction the mean annual rainfall of the sub basin is 1280 mm setegn et al 2008 with one main rainy season from june to september that accounts for more than 80 of the annual rainfall the rest of the year is dry except for some short rains during the march to may period the temperature of the sub basin is on average about 20 c with small seasonal changes unlike the rainfall the diurnal temperature changes on the other hand are large setegn et al 2008 there are four major rivers that feed lake tana these rivers account for 93 of the inflow to the lake kebede et al 2006 these include gilgel abay gumara ribb and megech rivers gilgel abay and gumara rivers account for about 70 of inflow to the lake tigabu et al 2020b in addition to these major rivers lake tana receives runoff from more than 40 rivers most of which are concentrated in the western part of the lake with small catchments and intermittent flows dessie et al 2015 rientjes et al 2011 3 methodology 3 1 hydro climatological analysis to provide the long term hydro climatic context of the sub basin monthly spatial rainfall over the lake tana sub basin was taken from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations v2 0 chirps chirps is a blend of satellite based rainfall estimates and gauge data available at a 0 05 x 0 05 horizontal resolution from 1981 to present http chg geog ucsb edu data chirps funk et al 2015 accuracy of chirps data was tested with rain gauges and found to be good for ethiopia dinku et al 2018 for the period 1981 2020 the presence of long term linear trend for moving average of three months period starting from january was estimated for temperature and potential evapotranspiration pet spatial mean temperature data over the lake tana sub basin was downloaded from climate research unit cru harris et al 2020 and the long term trend was estimated river flow data at the four major rivers was obtained from ministry of water irrigation and energy mowie recent river flow data from 2015 onwards was unavailable as the stage depths were not yet converted to discharge in ethiopia the period before the early 2000 s represents a time where withdrawals from the rivers were minimal thus data for the period 1990 2005 was used to analyze natural flow and its seasonality 3 2 irrigated area estimation scoping field visits were conducted in the lake tana sub basin lower administrative units woredas were visited and data on irrigated areas in each unit obtained woredas are comprised of on average 15 kebeles the lowest administrative units data for the kebeles is stored in the woredas databases seventeen woredas of the lake tana sub basin were visited selected kebeles data were obtained during the field visits the data obtained focused on small scale irrigation schemes information and individual farmers irrigating outside of formal schemes this data included river names irrigated area type of scheme water diversion method gps coordinates and major crop types grown in the selected kebeles the quality of data differed from woreda to woreda most woredas though use gps tracking method to determine the irrigated area making recorded data relatively accurate in most locations each kebele s data obtained from a particular woreda was then organized and formatted for this study s purposes 3 3 water abstraction estimation from the seventeen woredas larger areas of more than 1500 ha total area under irrigation were selected for daily data collection on irrigation water abstraction fifteen locations were selected in southern and eastern part of the basin where smallholder farmers use river diversions to irrigate their land fig 2a these 15 locations are found in five woredas of dangila mecha bahirdar zuria fogera and farta the selected locations are rivers with constructed weirs to divert water from rivers to canals and then straight to the fields individual command areas in these locations range from 20 ha to 200 ha table 1 water diversion was measured twice per day for a period from december 2020 to may 2021 at the fifteen locations in these locations farmers use furrow irrigation method for water application over application of water was witnessed in most fields water is commonly diverted for 24 h during the dry season some farmers mentioned they prefer to water during nighttime than daytime and thus the continuous diversion of water most farmers mentioned the water diverted is not enough for their land and that they use a scheduling system to be able to accommodate all farmers who use the diverted water the discharge of the diverted water in cubic meters per second was estimated by multiplying the depth of flow in the main canals with the velocity of flow the velocity of was estimated using the float method the time for a float to travel a certain distance in the main canal was measured the wetted area of the canal and the depth of flow in the canal were also measured these measurements were conducted twice a day during morning and evening hours these daily water abstraction measurements were conducted from december 2020 may 2021 the float method generally overestimates the average velocities the surface velocities obtained from this method were therefore multiplied with a correction factor of 0 85 salazar et al 1994 to obtain representative canal velocities average water diversion for the 15 sites was estimated for the command areas in liters per second per hectare this value was then used to estimate the irrigation water abstraction per woreda in the lake tana sub basin 3 4 crop water requirement a survey was conducted to obtain crop pattern data from eight selected woredas of lake tana sub basin this survey included three more woredas dera gondor zuira and libokemkem in addition to the five woredas considered in the daily water abstraction measurement this was done to ensure that some of the northeastern parts are included in the study fig 2b the main data collected in this survey included crop type irrigation area in hectare gps coordinate of irrigated plot water source for irrigation and approximate planting and harvesting dates of each crop more than 800 farms were covered in this survey this information was used to estimate the dominant crops per woreda in different parts of the sub basin and the percentage area coverage of each crop per woreda the data was also used to estimate crop water requirement cwr for comparison with the continuous water abstraction estimation cwr was estimated using cropwat software of fao smith 1992 climatic data that was required for cwr calculation was obtained from the national meteorology agency of ethiopia for the period from 2000 to 2017 this data was used to represent the current climate when estimating the associated water need for irrigation rainfall stations from 18 locations were used to estimate the monthly rainfall for each woreda for the other weather parameters four principal weather stations located at dangila debre tabor bahir dar and gondor were used weather parameters from these stations were used to calculate the reference crop evapotranspiration eto as per the penman monteith equation in allen et al 1998 the number of days for different stages of crop development kc values rooting depth depletion fraction and yield response fraction were taken from fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1988 the crop evapotranspiration etc was determined by multiplying eto with a crop coefficient kc the cwr was then estimated by subtracting effective rainfall estimated using usda method from etc etc eto kc where etc is the crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions mm month and kc is the crop coefficient nir etc pe if etc pe otherwise nir 0 due to enough rainfall where nir is the net irrigation requirement mm month and pe is the effective rainfall mm month farmers in the eastern part of the sub basin indicated that they have two irrigation seasons while those in the rest of the sub basin indicated that there have only one irrigation season in the eastern side of the sub basin the first irrigation season starts from mid october to early february and then the second irrigation season runs from mid february to may in the rest of the sub basin the irrigation season runs from december to april as such nir for identified crop types was estimated using two irrigation seasons for eastern part of the sub basin in fogera dera and libokemkem woredas one irrigation season was used for the rest of the woredas in the sub basin for woredas where the crop pattern survey was not conducted the neighboring woredas nir was adopted due to use of furrow irrigation method in farmers fields the canals being unlined and the over application of water in the fields water losses are big to account for such losses we used 45 overall irrigation efficiency in the estimation of total gross irrigation requirement gir in all woredas the 45 irrigation efficiency was applied after reviewing different studies in ethiopia on application efficiency canal efficiency and overall efficiency for example the average application efficiency of meki ziway irrigation scheme is 58 haile et al 2020 whereas abera et al 2020 used 65 application efficiency for lake tana sub basin the application efficiency accounts for losses in the irrigated plots but does not take into account losses in the canals in the awash basin strategic document 44 overall irrigation efficiency was used for the awash basin awash basin authority 2017 for woredas on the eastern side for their second season gir was estimated for half of the irrigated area for each crop in the woreda the length of growing period was used as per the standard estimated by fao for different regions in allen et al 1998 for consistency the water demand of each woreda was therefore calculated using the irrigated area coverage of each crop and its gir 3 5 seasonal water availability the total inflow to lake tana from gauged and ungauged catchments is estimated at 5426 106 m3 year as per rientjes et al 2011 in this study this annual estimate was used for two reasons firstly the data used in their study was for the period of 1994 2003 which is assumed to be a period before extensive irrigation started in the sub basin this period therefore is assumed to reflect natural flow of the rivers secondly they used a regionalization method to account for flows from ungauged rivers that produced satisfactory results the total dry season flow from the four major rivers plus the remaining rivers was categorized into four groups to simplify the seasonal water availability analysis the southern side of the basin is represented by the gilgel abay river contribution the eastern side is represented by the gumara and ribb rivers megech river represents the northern side whereas the western side has most of the small rivers dessie et al 2015 estimated the contribution of these inflows to the total inflow to lake tana as 58 from the southern side 30 from the eastern side 10 from the northern side and 2 from the western side in this current study the above estimation was adopted to divide the 5426 106 m3 year inflow into lake tana into contributions from the four sides the woredas were also categorized into the four sides as shown in table 2 comparisons between seasonal flows and irrigation water abstraction were done for each side 4 results 4 1 hydro climatology based on chirps data there was no statistically significant long term rainfall trend over the lake tana sub basin in the different seasons fig 3a this result of statistically non significant trend is similar with tigabu et al 2020a who used station data to detect trends although not statistically significant during this period the trend showed seasonal increment of rainfall in the range of 0 15 0 30 mm year although also hydrologically insignificant the months of may and june showed the highest increasing trend at monthly scale of up to 0 8 mm year during the period of 1981 2020 this might be related to late cessation of the march to may mam rainy season the early onset of the june to september jjas rainy season or the rainfall in that season being of high intensity in contrast seasonal temperatures showed a statistically significant increasing trend fig 3b in the range of 0 01 0 05 c year except for the period between june and august the peak irrigation period january to march had the highest temperature increase of 0 04 0 05 c year similar analysis for pet showed an increasing trend in the range of 0 05 0 3 mm year fig 3c the irrigation seasons had statistically significant increasing pet trends of more than 0 25 mm year based on the 1990 2005 river flow data the june to september period river flow accounted for 82 88 of annual flow whereas the dry season flow was only 12 18 of annual flow fig 4 it is during this dry season that farmers divert water from rivers to irrigate their fields 4 2 irrigated area data from the seventeen woredas in the lake tana sub basin showed that there were a total 38 694 ha under small scale irrigation fig 5 the woredas in the eastern and southern parts had larger irrigated areas nine woredas had total irrigated areas greater than 2000 ha fogera woreda had by far the largest area under irrigation 7361 ha in one season followed by libokemeken 5290 ha and gonder zuria 4134 ha woredas in terms of sources of water for irrigation 80 of the irrigation water in the sub basin during the study period was from surface water while the remaining 20 was from groundwater fig 6 the use of groundwater was mostly observed in the eastern part of the basin especially in fogera and dera woredas in areas that are closer to the lake and in the wetland areas hand dug wells were being used for backyard cultivation of vegetables there are large numbers of hand dug wells in fogera s achefer and mecha woredas however the area irrigated from these wells was very small on average 0 0625 ha of land per farmer during the survey it was noted that two large scale irrigation schemes are operational koga 6508 ha and megech seraba 566 ha with these two schemes the total irrigated area in the 2020 21 dry season in the sub basin was 45 768 ha most farmers in the eastern part of the sub basin indicated that they irrigate twice per year while in the rest of the sub basin farmers irrigate only once in a year water diversion methods to farms were commonly diversion by gravity and using diesel motor pumps to abstract water from rivers 4 3 irrigation water abstraction the irrigation abstraction measurements were conducted from december 2020 to may 2021 for about 149 days from the 15 sites in all locations water is diverted for 24 h and farmers irrigate in shifts both day and night we assumed no return flow for this study since farmers indicated that the water received in their fields was not sufficient the twice per day measurements at the 15 sites revealed the diverse amounts of water diverted in the woredas fig 7 the amount of water diverted ranged from 560 m3 day to 17 823 m3 day the water diverted largely depended on the size of irrigated area and to the size of the rivers table 3 and fig 7 table 3 provides the variations of measured flow in the channels with summarized statistics the average water abstraction which was estimated based on these 15 sites was 0 90 l s ha this average water abstraction rate was used to estimate the total water abstraction for each woreda the growing period for identified crops per each woreda was determined in order to estimate the days water is diverted during an irrigation season these days ranged from 130 to 149 depending on the woreda and the crop type for a single irrigation season for all woredas the total irrigated area was multiplied by the average abstraction rate to give the total water diversion of 430 106 m3 per dry season from rivers given that in the eastern part of the sub basin farmers irrigate twice in a year additional water is required for the second season in the second season half of the irrigated area was used and water was diverted for 90 days since farmers grow crops of short growing periods with this additional season the total water abstraction considering two irrigation seasons for the eastern part and a single season for the rest of the sub basin was 489 106 m3 per dry season result show that woredas in the east e g fogera and libokemkem abstracted the largest amounts of water as a result of having the largest irrigated area and two dry season cropping seasons fig 8a 4 4 gross irrigation requirement based on the crop pattern survey conducted in eight woredas it was found that farmers grow both cash crops such as onion garlic potatoes tomatoes and other cereal crops like wheat teff and maize they also grow fruit trees such as avocado in some places onion and garlic were found to be the most dominant crops grown in the lake tana sub basin during the irrigation season of october to may 2020 21 for each woreda the distribution of crops and percentage of area coverage per crop was different table 3 shows the crops and their area coverage per woreda during 2020 21 irrigation season the total irrigation water requirement was found to be 335 106 m3 per dry season for the 38 694 ha under small scale irrigation fig 8b this value is lower than the estimated abstracted water by about 150 106 m3 results showed that the eastern side of the sub basin required and abstracted larger amounts of water as can be seen in fig 8b this was expected since the eastern side had a larger irrigated area and two dry season cropping seasons table 4 4 5 seasonal water availability the four major rivers that account for 93 of inflow to the lake tana kebede et al 2006 had about 12 18 of their flow during the dry season as estimated from the 1990 2005 data this estimate was based on fig 4 for the period of october to may dry season from the total inflow of 5426 106 m3 year by rientjes et al 2011 the total dry season flow for the period october to may was therefore estimated to be about 889 106 m3 this dry season flow was categorized into the four sides of the sub basin as given in table 5 using 58 30 10 and 2 from southern eastern northern western side respectively dessie et al 2015 in general the estimated irrigation water abstraction for the dry season of 2020 21 accounted for about 50 of the total dry season flow however the eastern side abstracted the largest amount of water 85 of its dry season flow for its first irrigation season the northern and western sides of the sub basin abstracted more than half of their dry season flows table 5 whereas abstractions by the southern sides were lower these results show that in the eastern side water is insufficient if both irrigation seasons use only the rivers as sources of irrigation water for the eastern side two irrigation seasons required about 253 106 m3 water which cannot be supplied by the rivers inflow given that the area also uses groundwater sources these groundwater sources could supply the extra water needed nevertheless further investigations are needed to understand how farmers cope with water shortages including quantification of groundwater resources in the area considering only one irrigation season for all sides of the sub basin the water balance components of the lake tana sub basin were as shown in fig 9 the dry season rainfall and evaporation over the lake were estimated at 18 and 73 of the annual lake areal rainfall and lake evaporation estimated by rientjes et al 2011 respectively water transfer from lake tana to beles hydropower plant was estimated at 2424 106 m3 per year mccartney et al 2009 using linear interpolation to the dry season water transfer from lake tana to beles hydropower plant becomes 1616 106 m3 this indicates that water transfer to beles hydropower is larger than the water abstraction by small scale irrigation the concerns of water scarcity and damage to the environment are expected to be pronounced during the dry season when water in the rivers is limited the above estimation of irrigation water abstraction was based on only 38 694 ha of land under small scale irrigation the potential area that can be irrigated in the sub basin is huge some estimates from abbay basin development office abdo for small scale irrigation exceed 100 000 ha personal communication with abdo staff this big figure might be as a result of counting the same area twice with the assumption that that area is irrigated both in the first and second irrigation seasons the other reason might be due to the method of data collection that is based on administrative regions the estimated irrigated area might include areas that are not part of the lake tana sub basin other studies estimated approximately 130 000 ha 11 of the lake tana sub basin as potentially suitable for medium and large scale surface irrigation worqlul et al 2015 while bceom 1998 identified a net irrigation area of 121 260 ha considering these potentials if the current area of irrigated land is increased by 25 75 48 368 67 715 ha of the lake tana sub basin water abstraction would go up to about 782 106 m3 dry season table 6 for small scale irrigation which cannot be supplied by the dry season flow of the rivers 5 discussion 5 1 irrigated area and water abstraction arguably changes in irrigation use in lake tana sub basin are a more recent phenomena especially in the last 10 15 years where irrigation activities are increasingly getting attention and are being accepted by farmers small scale irrigation promotion and support by donors ngos and local governments are also considerable in the sub basin communities are benefiting from the expanding irrigation use and their livelihoods are being improved ayele et al 2013 nevertheless converting the increased household income as a result of irrigation activities to household food security is still a challenge kasie and alemu 2021 there is also a challenge of minimizing the negative impacts of the expanding irrigation use on the environment using remote sensing abera et al 2020 estimated that the irrigated area in the lake tana sub basin increased from 84 900 ha in 2006 121 400 ha in 2016 although the estimated area coverage requires verification it shows the undeniable expansion of irrigation in the sub basin in the last decade worqlul et al 2015 estimated that about 20 of the lake tana sub basin 130 508 ha is suitable for surface irrigation they indicated that whereas the average flow of gilgel abay and gumara rivers is sufficient to irrigate the potential irrigable land in the dry season that the flows of ribb and megech rivers are not sufficient and can only cover 50 and 35 of potential irrigable area respectively they reported that the gilgel abay had the largest potential area for surface irrigation and megech has the smallest potential area worqlul et al 2015 in this current study the estimation of actual irrigated area under small scale irrigation was based on recorded information at woreda level the total area under irrigation in the 2020 21 irrigation season was 45 768 ha with 38 694 ha under smallholder irrigation 6508 ha at koga irrigation scheme and 566 ha at megech seraba irrigation scheme it was found that the total area of 45 768 ha is lower than other estimates based on remote sensing methods abera et al 2020 for example estimated 121 400 ha as the actually irrigated land using 2016 landsat 8 30 m x 30 m image analysis they used the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the soil adjusted vegetation index savi methods to verify the image analysis they used ground control points gcp from 10 irrigation schemes located in the southern and eastern part of the basin in each irrigation scheme they took 13 points from irrigated area and 7 points from non irrigated area in total 200 points were used as gcp in their study for the entire lake tana sub basin they found the overall accuracy of the image analysis to be 87 the gcp coverage was mostly in the southern and eastern part of the basin number of gcp per crop was not justified given that the large irrigation projects were still under construction except koga irrigation scheme 7000 ha during the study period the estimated irrigated area in abera et al 2020 was about 114 000 ha which was largely gravity fed community managed irrigation schemes and irrigation from pumping of water from rivers for the irrigation water consumption they applied the crop water requirement method for onion and maize with field application efficiency of 65 with this assumption the irrigation water withdrawal was estimated at 798 106 m3 per year the international water management institute mapped irrigated and rainfed agriculture of ethiopia for the period 2015 2016 using landsat 8 images using normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and normalized difference moisture index ndmi methods chandrasekharan et al 2021 they indicated that they first took out forest and wetland areas before they divided the agricultural land into rainfed and irrigated they used gcp points although the number of points used is not specified as this data was collected from different government sources clipping out the lake tana sub basin showed an actual irrigated area of 132 958 ha for the sub basin fig 10a given that the analysis period of abera et al 2020 and iwmi are similar the image analysis results are expected to produce similar values for actual irrigated areas however the iwmi study showed most of the northern wetland areas and areas around the lake as irrigated on the contrary abera et al 2020 indicated that the southern and eastern parts of the sub basin had widespread irrigated areas and the northern part did not have concentrated irrigation refer to fig 10a in abera et al 2020 this shows that different remote sensing estimation methods provide different results we also checked the fao water productivity wapor 250 m resolution land cover classification data https wapor apps fao org catalog wapor 2 1 l1 lcc a from which actual irrigated area can be extracted the results show about 45 000 ha as actual irrigated area fig 10b this estimate is closer to this current study s estimate the greenness of wetland areas due to presence of water as seen in fig 10a can be wrongly picked up by image analysis as irrigated areas additional factors might also exaggerate the estimates of irrigated areas by the remote sensing methods thus the differences observed in the remote sensing products call for verification of remote sensing outputs before using them to plan effective water management this current study s estimate has good spatial coverage but can be further improved through better data organization and collection at woreda level this highlights the need to i build capacities of government units ii place systems in the woredas and iii improve existing methods for collecting and organize data training and showing the importance of such information to local level experts is important in the managing of the limited water resources in their respective localities for the irrigation water abstraction estimates this current study estimated that 430 106 m3 was abstracted during the 2020 21 dry season abera et al 2020 estimated 798 106 m3 year for the irrigated area that is three folds larger than this current study s estimate the estimated abstracted amount by abera et al 2020 is too large to be supplied by the dry season flow of the lake tana sub basin rivers dessie et al 2015 estimated irrigation water abstraction from ungauged rivers at 133 106 m3 per year using 2012 2013 data they used 7 mm day of total irrigation demand for the october to may irrigation period and assumed that 15 of the irrigable potential was actually irrigated in the ungauged catchments of the sub basin if the 7 mm day irrigation demand is used in this current study for the small scale irrigated area of 38 694 ha the irrigation water abstraction becomes 403 106 m3 year for the 149 days of irrigation and 650 106 m3 year for the 240 days of the october to may season which dessie et al 2015 considered if the currently irrigated area of the sub basin is more than 120 000 ha as previous remote sensing results showed the irrigation water abstraction would be more than 1250 106 m3 dry season with 7 mm day irrigation demand given that such large amount of water cannot be supplied by dry season flow water scarcity and associated conflicts would be expected to be common in the area if only rivers are used for irrigation however the total gir estimated by this current study was 335 106 m3 per dry season a value lower by about 150 106 m3 from the estimated water abstraction amount this implies that a large amount of water is lost and is not used for productive purposes this calls for better water management approaches at field and also lining of the main and secondary canals when all the proposed large scale irrigation projects become operational the irrigation water requirement will be huge if the 516 106 m3 estimate by mccartney et al 2009 for large scale irrigation and the 489 106 m3 of this current study s small scale irrigation abstraction are summed up the total abstraction will be 1005 106 m3 which is a huge amount although large scale irrigation mostly depends on the storage of water from excess rainfall during the peak rainfall seasons whereas the major water sources for small scale irrigation sources are the rivers there are also allowances for maintaining environmental flows for the large scale irrigation projects unlike in smallholder irrigation that divert or pump water until the rivers dry up 5 2 seasonal water availability during field visits in gumara watershed it was observed that water was being pumped from the rivers with several pumps installed in one location fig 11 shows multiple pumps being used for irrigating about 40 ha of land fig 12a shows a picture taken on 10th march 2021 when the gumara river had some water in it after 10 days on 20th march 2021 the same river had almost completely dried up fig 12b this river stayed like that until the onset of the next rainy season in june 2021 this pictorial evidence of change in water quantity in gumara river in the dry season demonstrates the impact of irrigation water abstraction by the large number of pumps and irrigation sites upstream of this location in terms of ecosystem damage mequanent et al 2021 indicated that excessive water abstraction for irrigation in gumara and ribb rivers resulted in mass fish killing hence unwise use of water resources for irrigation is concerning at different scales there were differences in the southern and eastern watersheds during the field visits in the eastern parts water scarcity was raised as a main issue and we witnessed dried up rivers and streams farmers complained about conflicts due to water sharing between users of the upstream and downstream parts of the streams rivers in contrast in the southern part of the sub basin most farmers did not complain about water shortage their concerns were on other issues such as high pump maintenance costs and high diesel cost this is in line with the amounts of water available for irrigation in the different sides given that the gilgel abay watershed has the highest amount of water and receives high rainfall the irrigation water abstraction was not yet to the level that can create water shortages on the contrary the eastern side receives lower rainfall amounts and subsequently has low river flows also since farmers on the eastern side have two irrigation seasons the likelihood of water shortages is high in that part of the sub basin comparing our results with those of the measured river flows during the dry season of 2020 21 was not successful river flow data was not available from the government organizations as gauge stage measurements had not yet been converted to discharge data 5 3 hydrological data quality historical trends on the flows of the major rivers of the sub basin vary depending on the time used for the analysis and the studies decrease in the mean annual stream flows of gilgel abay and ribb was observed for the period 1973 2005 and 1973 2003 respectively by tekleab et al 2013 the decreasing trend in gilgel abay dry season flow low flow for 1982 2005 was shown by rientjes et al 2011 for 1964 2005 by taye and willems 2012 and for 1960 2004 by gebrehiwot et al 2014 however recent studies show extremely high increase in dry season flow of gilgel abay after 2006 by about 200 when compared to 1980 2005 average worqlul et al 2018 this might be due to changes in the location of the gauging station personal communication with local people many aspects change when the measurement location changes such as the datum cross section channel slope and thus the rating curve also needs to be changed on the contrary tigabu et al 2020a reported decreasing trend for the wet season and no siginficant trend for dry season of gilgel abay using the period of 1973 2009 the same study showed significant increasing trend for gumara and megech dry and wet season flows for the period 1960 2015 and 1980 2015 respectively for gumar river abebe et al 2020 developed their own rating curve to calculate its discharge for the period of 1973 2018 with this updated data both the low flow and wet season flow showed decreasing trends the decrease in low flow was statistically significant and the trend was attributed to expansion of pump irrigation and plantations tigabu et al 2020a attributed the increasing flow trends to land use changes and high intensity rainfall with decreased rainy days in a year this flow data needs to be checked as there is no siginficant increasing trend in rainfall and the river dries up during the irrigation season due to the pump irrigation expansion in the gumara catchment dry season data especially after the year 2006 thus requires quality check assessments with updated rating curves for the lake tana sub basin 6 conclusions ethiopia s water resources are historically under pressure due to high climate variability taye et al 2021 occurrence of extreme cases of droughts and floods conway and schipper 2011 and environmental degradation woldesenbet et al 2018 the planned developmental activities may increase pressure on water if not managed properly currently irrigation is becoming the main water user during the dry season since most water for irrigation is abstracted directly from rivers streams and springs monitoring irrigation water use from surface and groundwater is important in order to manage water resources properly and avoid water scarcity and associated conflicts although small scale irrigation is booming in the lake tana sub basin its area coverage is not known this study sought to bridge this gap in knowledge the results of this study show the actual irrigated area in the sub basin for small scale irrigation and two large scale schemes the water abstraction for such irrigation activities is high and need to be considered in water management plans and decisions actual irrigated area estimates in the sub basin varies from the different methods used in the various studies consequently the water abstraction for irrigation also varies depending on the study this study found that the water abstraction by small scale irrigation for one irrigation season is currently at 430 106 m3 year given that water storage mechanisms are not yet fully developed in the sub basin the irrigation water withdrawals during the dry season are causing water scarcity and environmental damage assuming irrigation from rivers only water is more of a constraint than land for irrigation in the lake tana sub basin especially in the eastern part of the sub basin additionally water losses without productive use are high with the current type of irrigation methods and irrigation infrastructure this calls for better water management practices since there is no database that collects such studies and attempts to create consolidated information database development for water abstraction by different sectors is needed in the sub basin if the abbay basin development office takes the lead on data management and establishing reliable estimation methods it will be useful when making water management decisions as ethiopia is working to achieve the sustainable development goals sdgs one of the targets is on water use and scarcity sdg 6 4 this target states by 2030 substantially increase water use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity to achieve this target and if the country is to efficiently use and manage the scarce water resources available water water use and environmental flows need to be monitored since agriculture accounts for most of the water abstraction giving attention to the booming small scale irrigation water withdrawal is very crucial

8117,study region the kaidu river basin krb is located on the central southern slope of the tianshan mountain in northwest china study focus this work aimed to assess changes and main drivers of snowmelt driven runoff in krb associated with three future climate scenarios six versions of the cemaneige snowmelt module embedded in the hydrological model gr4j were calibrated and evaluated the bias corrected climate datasets from cmip5 models were used to drive the optimal snowmelt hydrological model for runoff prediction the factors that lead to runoff variations were also assessed new hydrological insights the significant declining trends of runoff were only predicted in the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the declining trends of runoff were found in all the seasons for the annual and summer runoff compared to the historical period both the rcp2 6 and rcp 4 5 periods showed a decline in the mid century and a rise in the end century however rcp8 5 showed a continuous decline during this period precipitation and evapotranspiration were ranked as the two most important factors regulating future runoff variations in all rcps in contrast snowmelt timing is the second factor in the historical period and its importance decreases in the warmer rcp scenarios these results highlighted that the importance of snowmelt and snowmelt timing to the future runoff depends on the runoff responses to the trajectory of future changes in temperature and precipitation keywords snowmelt timing isimip2b tarim river basin hydrological modeling china 1 introduction climate change may affect the atmospheric and surface radiation budget and thus alter variabilities of the global hydrological cycle potentially increasing the risk of hydrological hazards pachauri et al 2014 alfieri et al 2015 in addition continuous global warming will likely redistribute precipitation and water resources between regions according to climate topography land cover type and human management of water resources chen 2014 as an essential component in the hydrological cycle runoff may respond to climate change via its impact on water resource availability and distribution yuan et al 2015 azmat et al 2018 jahandideh tehrani et al 2019 experimental data based evidence has demonstrated that global warming may intensify the global hydrological cycle leading to an increase in global continental runoff labat et al 2004 floods in many tributary regions like the tarim river basin were found amplified at annual and seasonal scales after the 1980s and their amplification was associated with the occurrence of rainstorms glacier and snowmelt and climatic warming zhang et al 2016a 2016b gu et al 2016 2017 sun et al 2016 therefore the assessment of seasonal and inter annual variations of runoff under climate change is vital for water resources provision that sustains ecosystem function and services and human social economic developments deng et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 pradhanang et al 2013 snowmelt is one of the primary sources of river runoff in the alpine regions a robust estimate of snowmelt driven runoff is critical to alpine flood forecasting drought control and other aspects associated with water resource planning zhang et al 2006 coppola et al 2018 as warmer spring may lead to earlier snowmelt a combination of snowmelt and extreme precipitation can easily cause flooding sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2006 therefore snowmelt driven runoff is particularly sensitive to climate change kundzewicz et al 2015 zhang et al 2014a 2014b the challenge in predicting snowmelt driven runoff is to understand the underlying causes of snowmelt and its relationship with the catchment water balance mccabe and clark 2005 zampieri et al 2015 dahri et al 2021 employed the variable infiltration capacity vic macroscale hydrologic model to simulate runoff based on snowmelt and precipitation in the high altitude indus river basin they pointed out that the improvement of input temperature and precipitation data is critical to obtaining robust simulations as temperature is one of the controlling factors that determine the timing and magnitude of snowmelt and runoff zhang et al 2006 zhang et al 2016 fang et al 2018 the degree day model based on the temperature threshold degree day factor and radiation coefficient could get comparable accuracies as energy balance models for simulating snowmelt but with less demand of input data liu et al 2017 troin et al 2018 the gr4j model a daily lumped rainfall runoff model has been widely applied to simulate catchment hydrology due to its simple four parameter structure compared to the gr3j model the gr4j model showed improved performance particularly in simulating low flows edijatno et al 1999 perrin et al 2003 valéry et al 2014a 2014b presented a comparison of six snowmelt models associated with two hydrological models gr4j and hbv and concluded that the most complex model did not yield the best performance in simulating runoff many snowmelt models such as cemaneige valéry et al 2010 mohyse fortin and turcotte 2007 hydrotel turcotte et al 2007 etc have been developed to explore the relationship between snowmelt and runoff climate change may cause significant impacts on water flow and water resources in the arid and semi arid regions in northwest china sun et al 2015 bao et al 2017 santos et al 2019 the tianshan mountain known as the water tower of central asia is an important freshwater resource in china and a major source of rivers in northwest china chen et al 2016 sorg et al 2012 wang et al 2019 the kaidu river basin one of four headwaters of the tarim river basin is located on the southern slope of tianshan mountain and connects the bayanbulak swan lake and finally flows into the bosten lake the kaidu river bears the important task of water transport to the lower reaches of the tarim river chen et al 2017 however runoff of the four river basins that are situated in the south of tianshan mountain showed distinct responses to precipitation and temperature runoff in the kaidu river basin and the huangshuigou basin was co regulated by both precipitation and temperature which however were the dominant factor for regulating runoff in the toxkon basin and kunmalik basin respectively shen et al 2018 and luo et al 2017 have found that river streamflow was more sensitive to temperature change than precipitation change in hotan river basin and the model structure strongly affected the hydrological response of climate change robust projection of hydrological responses can help achieve sustainable social economic development an effective climate change adaptation strategy can be discovered by predicting runoff under future climate warming scenarios associated with different representative concentration pathways rcps climate scenario projections are often used to drive hydrological models to quantify the future climate change impact on the watershed runoff in this study we aim to estimate future changes in seasonal and inter annual runoff under the 21st century rcp scenarios and investigate the principal climate factors that regulate the trends and variability of runoff based on an optimized snowmelt streamflow model four climate models from phase 2b of the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip2b frieler et al 2017 were selected and these climate projections have been bias corrected using historical observational datasets we chose three rcp scenarios to predict future runoff rcp2 6 controlling global average temperature rise below 2 rcp4 5 forcing the climate system with steady radiation artificially and rcp8 5 which has no climate change policy van vuuren et al 2011 thomson et al 2011 riahi et al 2011 accordingly this study mainly addresses the following research questions a how can we improve a combined snowmelt and streamflow model to simulate runoff of the kaidu river basin b what are the impacts of three rcp scenarios on inter annual and seasonal variations of runoff c what are the major climate related factors that control the trend and variability of future runoff and how does their relative importance vary across different rcp scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the kaidu river basin is situated on the central southern slope of the tianshan mountain in northwest china bordering the tarim basin in the south the entire river basin is enclosed between a longitude of 82 58 86 05 e and a latitude of 42 14 43 21 n comprising an area of 19 012 km2 above the dashankou hydrological station fig 1 the elevation for the bottom of the basin ranges from 2304 to 2565 m above sea level the terrain is flat surrounded by mountains with an altitude of 3928 4794 m as the basin is located in the hinterland of the eurasian continent far from the sea close to the taklamakan desert its climate type is continental temperate arid however due to its topographical characteristics compared with the surrounding areas the temperature is lower and the precipitation is higher in the basin the annual mean temperature is 1 82 0 61 and the annual total precipitation is 328 8 31 mm during 1961 2005 precipitation shows a distinct seasonal pattern with spring of 44 7 mm and summer of 127 1 mm the runoff of the kaidu river comes from snow and icemelt and rainfall the accumulation of snow begins in november and ends in march of the following year with the increase of temperature in april and may seasonal snowmelt supplies rivers the snowmelt induced floods are commonly found in this region such as the spring flood on april 24 2011 exceeding the summer flood in summer the mountain snowmelt and rainfall are the main sources of the river 2 2 data sources 2 2 1 meteorological and hydrological data sets for model calibration to calibrate the hydrological model the meteorological and hydrological observation data sets were used the daily precipitation and temperature observations during 1961 2011 used the cn05 1 gridded observation data set with a resolution of 0 25 0 25 this dataset was generated by interpolating the field data at more than 2400 stations across china using the approaches of anusplin the australian national university spline and adw angular distance weighting respectively wu and gao 2013 because the basin was divided into three sub basins through archydro tools in arcgis and two meteorological stations in the basin could not meet the data needs of the three sub basins we decided to use the cn05 1 gridded data set as the model climate input the daily radiation used the net radiation data set from the nasa global land data assessment system glads 2 0 dataset https disc gsfc nasa gov which was estimated from cloud and snow product combined with the algorithm by the air force weather agency agricultural meteorological modeling system agrmet the hydrological data used the daily observed runoff data of the dashankou hydrological station from 2005 to 2011 located at the outlet of the basin fig 1 2 2 2 climate scenario data sets historical 1961 2005 and future 2006 2099 climate scenario data sets at daily temporal and 0 5 horizontal resolution from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project project isimip2b frieler et al 2017 were used to run scenario simulations based on the optimized model these climate scenario data sets consist of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip 5 taylor et al 2012 outputs from four global climate models gdfl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc5 shortened as gdfl hadgem2 ipsl miroc5 for low to high warming scenarios i e the representative concentration pathway rcp 2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 moss et al 2010 even though only four gcmss may not be sufficient to represent the entire spread of regional climate change projected by the cmip5 ensemble we still note that for the china region only one cmip5 model projection is out of the range spanning across the four gcms we selected frieler et al 2017 to ensure the isimip2b historical climate data sets consistent with the cn05 1 data set in the trends and variabilities of temperature and precipitation a bias correction see section 2 4 for temperature and precipitation based on the cn05 1 data set was done for the isimip2b historical climate datasets for the study area 2 3 runoff simulation the hydrological model gr4j and the snowmelt module cemaneige have been successfully applied to simulate runoff in mountainous areas which can meet the needs of our study valéry et al 2010 troin et al 2018 arsenault et al 2018 a brief description of the snowmelt module cemaneige and the hydrological model gr4j model are given below 2 3 1 snowmelt module the cemaneige module simulates snow accumulation and melts using a snowpack to represent snow storage snow water equivalent and the thermal state of the snow the snow storage can be added with the solid fraction of the precipitation the thermal state of the snowpack determines the onset of the snowmelt after calculation of the snow storage and thermal state the potential snowmelt can be determined using the degree day method finally the actual snowmelt is the multiplication of the areal fraction of snow cover and the potential snowmelt two critical hydrological processes related to snowmelt rain snow division and snowmelt computation were tested in this study to get a robust simulation of snowmelt runoff as there are two different functions of rain snow division and three different methods of snowmelt computation available in the cemaneige module six combinations of these functions table 1 had been coupled into the hydrological model to identify the optimized model which was used in the future projection of snowmelt runoff 2 3 1 1 rain snow division functions both single temperature threshold yang et al 1997 and double temperature threshold wigmosta et al 1994 fuchs et al 2001 functions are

modules can be referred to valéry et al 2014a b in this study we only focus on the description of six versions of the cemaneigh modules 2 3 2 potential evapotranspiration method the potential evapotranspiration was estimated using the oudin formulas based on extraterrestrial radiation oudin et al 2005 the oudin formula is expressed as etp r e t mean 5 λ ρ 100 if t mean 5 0 10 etp 0 otherwise where etp is the potential evapotranspiration mm d 1 re is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 calculated in detail by morton 1983 λ is the latent heat flux mj m 2 and ρ is the water density kg m 3 2 3 3 hydrological model the modèle du génie ruralà 4 paramètres journalier gr4j is a daily scaled lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model with four parameters perrin et al 2003 in this study it has been amended to a semi distributed model to cooperate with the snowmelt model the gr4j model employs a production store and a routing store to calculate the daily streamflow generated by precipitation model input requires precipitation data and temperature data the gr4j model cooperates with the cemaneige model and performs pretty well in the daily streamflow simulation over many watersheds poissant et al 2017 troin et al 2015 velázquez et al 2015 zeng et al 2019 several hydrological model parameters are listed in table 2 including gr4j and six versions of cemaneige parameters 2 4 model calibration the shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm was applied to constrain the model parameters duan et al 1994 duan 2021 the sce ua algorithm has been widely used in hydrological modeling for global optimization of parameters and it has integrated deterministic search strategies and random element sampling approaches rahnamay naeini et al 2019 we carried out a 10 000 multi run and set the runoff as the single objective variable in our application the simulation with the highest king gupta efficiency kge value in the multi runs was used to identify the optimal parameterization in each model we have put 2005 2008 as the calibration period and 2009 2011 as the validation period the performance of each optimized model in simulating runoff for 2005 2008 is shown in fig s1 to validate the model we selected three metrics to evaluate the performance of the six optimized models identified in the model calibration these metrics include kge percentage bias pbias nash sutcliff efficiency nse the kge metric with statistical nature comprehensively measure model performance from three aspects i e correlation variability bias and mean bias the correlation component represents the hydrological aspects of the model such as peak flow times the closer kge is to 1 the better the model performance is obtained gupta et al 2009 knoben et al 2019 pbias measures the average of simulated sequences moriasi et al 2007 pbias 0 indicates no bias and the value below above 0 indicates an underestimation overestimation of the model nse matric reflects the similarity between observed and simulated runoff nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse 0 indicates the simulation corresponds to the observed mean runoff and nse 1 indicates the simulated runoff has perfect performance the formulas for the calculation of kge pbias and nse are listed as follows 11 kge 1 r q obs q sim 1 2 μ q obs μ q sim 1 2 σ q obs σ q sim 1 2 12 pbias t 1 t q t sim t 1 t q t obs 1 13 nse 1 t 1 t q t

13 q t sim and q t obs are the observed and simulated runoff at time t t is the number of runoff samples 2 5 climate bias correction to make historical baseline conditions of gcm data be in line with the observation data sets a linear scaling approach with multiplication and addition lenderink et al 2007 was applied to precipitation and temperature respectively for their time series of 1961 2005 the linear scaling approach is formulated as follows 14 p t adj p t ori p avg obs p avg ori 15 t t adj t t ori t avg obs t avg ori where p t adj and p t ori are the adjusted and original precipitation series of gcm data t t adj and t t ori are the adjusted and original temperature series of gcm data to evaluate how well the gcm dataset have been bias corrected another three indices i e coefficient of determination r2 root mean square deviation rmsd and bias were calculated based on the individual gcm dataset or mean of the multi model ensemble mme and the cn05 1 data for the historical period 1961 2005 r2 reflects the fitting degree between the gcm dataset and observations rmsd quantifies the dispersion between the gcm dataset and observations bias reflects the gcm dataset overestimation and underestimation relative to observations these indices are formulated as follows 16 r 2 1 i 1 n m i o i 2 i 1 n o i o avg 2 17 rmsd 1 n i 1 n m i o i 2 1 2 18 bias m avg o avg in eqs 16 18 m i and o i are the gcm dataset and observation respectively m avg and o avg are the average of the gcm dataset and observation respectively and n is the number of samples 2 6 center of mass date for snowmelt the center of mass date cmd was used to estimate the impact of climate change on the timing of snowmelt when 50 of the total annual snowmelt occurred this method was used in previous studies to calculate the time center of snowmelt runoff the annual snowmelt centers are calculated as follows 19 cmd i 1 t sm i t i i 1 t t i where t i represents the number of days in a year and smi represents the snowmelt on the corresponding date 2 7 relative importance of dominant factors to identify the dominant factors that regulate the inter annual variations of runoff in the future plausible climate change scenarios we used a random forest algorithm from the statistics and machine learning toolbox of matlab loh 2002 to assess the relative importance of predictive factors that can explain the variance of runoff this analysis selected temperature precipitation evapotranspiration snowmelt and snowmelt timing as the predictive factors the daily streamflow was the response factor the tree based methods construct hierarchical binary decision trees which can avoid model over fitting predictor importance is estimated by computing the out of bag accuracy before and after permutation and the accuracy differences mean the influence of a predictor variable on the response variable nicodemus et al 2010 the average of accuracy changes of all trees represents the final importance scores the importance of the variable increases with the value of this measure the split predictor at each node is specified using an interaction curvature test to grow unbiased trees and the total dataset was used to train a regression tree the workflows of the entire study are illustrated in the schematic diagram fig 2 3 results 3 1 validation of daily runoff simulation the performances of the hydrological model with six different snowmelt modules in simulating runoff were validated based on three indices i e kge pbias and nse during the period 2009 2011 fig 3 for kge values all six models showed reasonable simulations with the values of kge ranging from 0 62 to 0 73 however both m1 the version with single threshold function and temperature exponential function as shown in table 1 and m5 the version with double threshold function and seasonal variation degree factor as shown in table 1 showed relatively lower pbias values 2 64 m1 and 4 96 m5 besides m5 also had the highest nse value nse 0 58 and thus was selected to project runoff in the future the seasonal variations of daily runoff for the model simulations and observations during 2009 2011 were illustrated fig 4 the calibrated models can generally capture seasonal variations of the runoff particularly for the hydrological responses to summer and autumn rainfall however the models also showed larger deviations from the observed runoff during the early snowmelt period the snowmelt period in the kaidu river basin often starts from april to may as temperature rises snowmelt runoff increases and spring floods may occur the discrepancy between simulations and observations was more evident in 2010 and 2011 during which the larger snowmelt induced peaks were observed than that in previous years for the timing of spring flood arrivals the model with either the stt or dtt method can efficiently simulate it however when it comes to the larger spring floods like 2010 and 2011 all the snowmelt models showed less efficiency in capturing the magnitude of floods than their performance in the calibration period fig s1 and fig 4 among the six models the m5 snowmelt model simulated a relatively better variation of spring runoff than other models in 2010 however it also overestimated the magnitude of the first runoff peak as many other models as the m5 snowmelt model used a degree day factor accounting for the day number of the year it can better represent the effects of seasonal variations in the solar radiation on snowmelt the albedo of the snow also has a seasonal variation because fresh snow is commonly found in the mid winter and aged snow is found in the late winter and spring the possible reasons to explain the model s inefficiency in capturing the magnitude of spring runoff peaks can be 1 the reliabilities of snowfall measurements 2 large variabilities of spring temperature which may cause several rapid snow melting or refreezing events 3 the spatial effects for instance the topography of catchment and alpine snow distribution on the catchment snowmelt during the occurrence of larger spring floods which can be a major challenge for these temperature index based models to simulate the magnitude of spring floods 3 2 bias correction evaluation for precipitation and temperature before running scenario simulations with the optimal hydrological model four gcms data were bias corrected based on the observational data set three indices were used to assess the bias corrected precipitation and temperature in each gcm dataset and mme against the cn05 1 dataset for the historical period 1961 2005 table 3 the mean bias between simulated precipitation and temperature and observed data was basically eliminated through the linear scaling approach it is evident that the bias correction improved both r 2 and rmsd after correction the r2 and rmse value of mme is 0 60 0 56 for precipitation while 0 94 3 27 for temperature respectively moreover mme showed better performance than individual gcm in table 3 with the results of the correction analysis shown in fig s2 the inter annual variations also indicated that the adjusted data of four gcms could capture the magnitude and variabilities of precipitation and temperature in the study area in contrast mme had better performance than the individual model during the historical period 1961 2005 fig 5 3 3 snowmelt driven runoff under climate change the results of hydrological simulation under three different rcps rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 with input data from four gcms were studied in order to explore the variations of runoff in the future periods we mainly focused on the results based on the ensemble mean of simulations the changes in future runoff were analyzed during mid century 2036 2065 and the end century 2070 2099 relative to the baseline period 1976 2005 under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 fig 6 for mid century there was little difference in the proportion of runoff reduction among the three rcps compared with the reference period decreases in the mean annual runoff for the mid century period were 12 81 25 44 m³ s 1 17 19 34 14 m³ s 1 and 13 50 26 83 m³ s 1 under three rcps respectively however for the end century the runoff of rcp8 5 had declined by about two times than that in mid century while the runoff of rcp4 5 fluctuated steadily and the runoff of rcp2 6 recovered basically to the level of the baseline period the runoff simulation under rcp 2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 showed decreases of 3 38 6 72 m³ s 1 15 82 31 41 m³ s 1 and 24 26 48 21 m³ s 1 as compared with the reference period as shown in fig 6 the simulated annual and seasonal except spring runoff showed declining trends p 0 05 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 table 4 on the other hand the simulated evapotranspiration showed a significant increasing trend p 0 05 under different rcps at the same time the precipitation and runoff illustrate an insignificant trend in rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 which was similar to a previous study li et al 2019 the increase of water vapor in the atmosphere did not produce sufficient precipitation due to temperature rising in the study area precipitation and temperature induced the decrease of runoff together besides the change of annual runoff the variations of seasonal runoff during the whole period were projected and evaluated as shown in fig 6 the projection of runoff values shows large variations in seasons the runoff in summer under three rcps shows the largest decrease among the four seasons the details of the trends are shown in table 4 followed by autumn and winter while that in spring rises slowly at the same time the summer runoff decrease is similar to the annual runoff under three pcrs during mid century the proportion of summer runoff in rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 decreased by 15 74 64 32 m³ s 18 87 77 10 m³ s and 15 33 62 69 m³ s compared with that in the baseline period while decrease by 3 20 13 08 m³ s 19 74 80 67 m³ s and 29 70 121 46 m³ s during end century as shown in fig 6 the largest variabilities were found in summer for inter annual variabilities of annual and seasonal runoff during three periods historical mid century and end century from three rcps fig 7 in summer compared to the historical period both rcp2 6 and rcp 4 5 showed a decline in mid century and a rise in end century for the seasonal mean runoff however rcp8 5 showed a continuous decline from mid to end century for the range of variabilities both rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 predicted an increase from mid to end century suggesting that the year to year fluctuation of summer runoff was enhanced as the climate warms nevertheless rcp8 5 showed an opposite tendency of change the spring runoff showed a general increase with time in three rcps especially in rcp8 5 indicating the future climate impact on snowmelt meanwhile the inter annual variabilities of evapotranspiration did not show a large shift for the range and magnitude among three rcps whereas the variability of precipitation decreases sharply in the larger future warming scenario fig s3 therefore precipitation is inferred to be the principal factor that causes changes in the runoff variability 4 discussions 4 1 runoff responses to climate change this study studies the future change of runoff for the kaidu river basin under plausible future warming scenarios and provides new insights on understanding the hydrological responses to climate change the causes of runoff changes are largely associated with different hydrological processes under climate change evapotranspiration is a vital hydrological process for the water cycle yang et al 2021 previous studies show that there is inconformity between the simulated runoff and evapotranspiration based on the simulations using the swat model forced by rcms gcms under different concentration scenarios some researchers concluded that the main factor leading to decreased runoff in the future is increased evapotranspiration ba et al 2018 fang et al 2018 however we also observed that future precipitation and temperature trends might differ between gcms in this study area as the precipitation varies largely among different climate models and these differences may affect the accuracy of runoff simulation in this area zhang et al 2006 tian et al 2017 precipitation may introduce large uncertainty in the projection of runoff and complicate the understanding of underlying drivers of hydrological responses of runoff previous studies also showed the reliability of the gridded climate dataset applied for this study area luo et al 2020 similar to those studies to bias correct the isimip2b climate trajectories based on the best available historical observation data i e cn05 1 can improve the robustness of our predictions of future climate change impacts on regional hydrological processes the model structure and snowmelt modules are also important factors to cause uncertainties of the runoff projection najafi et al 2011 feng beighley 2020 in the snowmelt model the temperature index method often depends on the mean air temperature however zhang et al 2006 found that using the daily maximum temperature multiplied by 0 5 as one of the model inputs improved snow cover mapping than the simulations with daily mean temperature as the model input therefore the temperature index method could consider the daily maximum air temperature as one of the climatic inputs to estimate snowmelt thus the optimization of the hydrological model offers fairness in the model choice using the maximized kge values as an optimized object in the calibration stage we evaluated the models performances by nse and pbias values we studied the effects of climate change under the assumption that the best set of parameters found during the calibration process in historical periods will remain valid in the future the responses of runoff on climate change can imply a potential water shortage in the future to quantify the trends of runoff we adopted a 30 year moving average to smooth the runoff fluctuations and detect how the change in the trends of runoff is in response to climate warming fig 8 in general the annual runoff showed different tendencies of changes in the three rcps the inter annual patterns of these changes were mostly dependent on summer time runoff we found the trends with a strong fluctuation in rcp2 6 a slow increase in rcp4 5 and both of them end with a small positive trend however rcp8 5 runoff trends went up generally before 2057 but then dropped rapidly to 0 79 m3s 1a 1 in 2099 meanwhile the runoff trend in autumn was consistent with each other among three rcps before 2050 while that of rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 both turned positive and reach 0 39 m3s 1a 1 and 0 69 m3s 1a 1 respectively in 2099 similar to that in winter which reached 0 10 m3s 1a 1 and 0 12 m3s 1a 1 respectively the spring runoff trend distinguished obviously from the other three seasons and it showed lasting positive under rcp8 5 whereas dramatic fluctuation under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 by the time almost disappeared at the end of the 21st century the absolute value of the trend under rcp8 5 was larger than that under other scenarios for both annual and seasonal runoff 4 2 timing of snowmelt another issue related to the snowmelt runoff simulation is the timing of the snowmelt compared to studies in other countries like the united states canada japan etc the timing of snowmelt in china is less studied mccabe and clark 2004 dyer 2008 we used snowmelt cmd to describe the variations in the snowmelt s timing and fitted the cmd trends using the least square method the general trend for cmd was a linear decline over the historical period but continued with different directions of polynomial trends under three rcps suggesting how early snowmelt advances depended on the level of future warming the changes in snowmelt time was significantly different under different scenarios and the fitting curve formula is shown in fig 9 compared with the historical period 1976 2005 the cmd decline trend of the three rcp scenarios before the mid century was similar to that of the historical period however after the mid century the rcp8 5 cmd continued the trend in the historical period and the rcp4 5 cmd slowed down significantly while the trend of cmd under rcp2 6 showed the snowmelt time started to recover gradually after 2055 compared with the historical period 1976 2005 the timing of snowmelt under three warming scenarios at the end of this century 2070 2099 was 8 2 13 9 and 25 5 days earlier respectively this suggests that the effects of different anthropogenic warming scenarios on snowmelt cmd have similar effects in the short term and distinct effects in the long term 4 3 relative importance of climate related drivers on future runoff the relative importance of predictive factors i e precipitation temperature evapotranspiration snowmelt timing and snowmelt to the response variable runoff was explored based on a random forest model and the historical and three rcp simulation data sets fig 10 and fig s4 to better compare the relative importance of drivers in different scenario runs we rescale the importance of individual drivers by dividing it with the total importance the sum of the importance of all individual factors precipitation was the predominant factor for the spring to autumn runoff and evapotranspiration was the second important factor in all three rcp scenarios fig 10 however during the historical period snowmelt timing was the second important factor the importance of snowmelt timing declined in the warmer rcp scenarios indicating that earlier advance of snowmelt may reduce its contribution to the total runoff from spring to autumn on the contrary the importance of temperature and precipitation increased in a warmer rcp scenario however for the spring runoff snowmelt is the second important factor in the historical and rcp2 6 scenario fig s4 the effects of evapotranspiration in spring runoff are less important than its effects on summer and autumn runoff in the meantime with the increase of concentration scenarios the importance of snowmelt timing strengthens relatively but snowmelt reduces its importance while temperature importance basically was equivalent to evapotranspiration importance in the higher rcp scenarios our results partly agree with the conclusion of previous studies for instance chen et al 2014 2015 which suggest that precipitation and temperature are the main factors regulating the runoff variations in the kaidu river basin unlike other alpine river basins e g the kunmalik and hotan river basins the major influential factor of the runoff variation is the temperature shen et al 2018 luo et al 2017 chen et al 2017 has highlighted the importance of including glacier melt in the hydrological modeling of the glacierized catchments which can be a critical perspective that should be accounted for in the study of hydrological responses to future climate change higher climatic warming may enhance glacier melt and increase the contribution of headwater to streamflow compensating for the negative response of runoff to warming we speculate that if our model considers the effects of the glacier or ice melt they will become more important factors to determine runoff similar to what our historical simulation has indicated 4 4 future study although the regional coverage of the kaidu river basin is mostly in mountainous areas vegetation types can still be an important factor to affect the change of runoff some studies e g mamat et al 2021 wang et al 2021 have shown that the response of vegetation to climate change may substantially impact the soil moisture in the ecosystem and total evapotranspiration moreover human activities can be another important factor to be considered in the projection of future runoff chen et al 2013 found that during 1994 2009 despite that runoff in kaidu river basin is more sensitive to climate variability than human activities which had already contributed 9 5 of the increase in runoff therefore accounting for future changes in the potential natural vegetation distribution land use and land cover change human activities topographical features associated with snow distribution and glacier melt the importance of dominant climatic drivers of runoff in the kaidu river basin can be more explicitly represented 5 conclusions this study evaluated the simulations of outlet observed runoff under the observed gridded climate data sets based on a hydrological model with six versions of the cemaneige snowmelt module first after bias correction of future climate data sets how runoff was in response to climate change under three rcp scenarios was quantified then the 30 year moving average runoff was used to analyze the trend change every 30 years and the cmd was used to indicate the timing of the snowmelt finally we analyzed the importance of variables that determine the trend and variations of runoff in summer using the random forest algorithm through kge calibration and pbias and nse evaluation the m5 combined by single threshold function and seasonal snowmelt factor was more suitable for runoff simulation in the study area with three index values are 0 73 4 96 and 0 58 respectively therefore the difference of simulation and observation sequence during the calibrated period was particularly manifest in the early stage of snowmelt under the rcp scenarios annual runoff responded to global warming trends with about a 15 reduction during the mid century for the end century rcp8 5 runoff declined by about two times that in mid century while rcp4 5 fluctuated steadily and rcp2 6 recovered basically to that in the baseline period which is mainly determined by summer runoff meanwhile the magnitude of the trend under rcp8 5 is more significant than that of other rcps for both annual and seasonal runoff the timing of the snowmelt in the future showed a distinct pattern of temporal change in three rcps suggesting that the timing of the snowmelt was also associated with the extent of warming precipitation and evapotranspiration were the two most important factors contributing to future runoff from spring to autumn which partly agrees with previous studies but with the increase of warming the timing of snowmelt turned to be less important while the importance of precipitation increased relatively overall our results have revealed the potentially important drivers in controlling future trends of runoff in the kaidu river basin and also highlighted that the runoff prediction in this region should not only account for the processes related to snowmelt but also other factors like glacier melt

8117,study region the kaidu river basin krb is located on the central southern slope of the tianshan mountain in northwest china study focus this work aimed to assess changes and main drivers of snowmelt driven runoff in krb associated with three future climate scenarios six versions of the cemaneige snowmelt module embedded in the hydrological model gr4j were calibrated and evaluated the bias corrected climate datasets from cmip5 models were used to drive the optimal snowmelt hydrological model for runoff prediction the factors that lead to runoff variations were also assessed new hydrological insights the significant declining trends of runoff were only predicted in the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the declining trends of runoff were found in all the seasons for the annual and summer runoff compared to the historical period both the rcp2 6 and rcp 4 5 periods showed a decline in the mid century and a rise in the end century however rcp8 5 showed a continuous decline during this period precipitation and evapotranspiration were ranked as the two most important factors regulating future runoff variations in all rcps in contrast snowmelt timing is the second factor in the historical period and its importance decreases in the warmer rcp scenarios these results highlighted that the importance of snowmelt and snowmelt timing to the future runoff depends on the runoff responses to the trajectory of future changes in temperature and precipitation keywords snowmelt timing isimip2b tarim river basin hydrological modeling china 1 introduction climate change may affect the atmospheric and surface radiation budget and thus alter variabilities of the global hydrological cycle potentially increasing the risk of hydrological hazards pachauri et al 2014 alfieri et al 2015 in addition continuous global warming will likely redistribute precipitation and water resources between regions according to climate topography land cover type and human management of water resources chen 2014 as an essential component in the hydrological cycle runoff may respond to climate change via its impact on water resource availability and distribution yuan et al 2015 azmat et al 2018 jahandideh tehrani et al 2019 experimental data based evidence has demonstrated that global warming may intensify the global hydrological cycle leading to an increase in global continental runoff labat et al 2004 floods in many tributary regions like the tarim river basin were found amplified at annual and seasonal scales after the 1980s and their amplification was associated with the occurrence of rainstorms glacier and snowmelt and climatic warming zhang et al 2016a 2016b gu et al 2016 2017 sun et al 2016 therefore the assessment of seasonal and inter annual variations of runoff under climate change is vital for water resources provision that sustains ecosystem function and services and human social economic developments deng et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 pradhanang et al 2013 snowmelt is one of the primary sources of river runoff in the alpine regions a robust estimate of snowmelt driven runoff is critical to alpine flood forecasting drought control and other aspects associated with water resource planning zhang et al 2006 coppola et al 2018 as warmer spring may lead to earlier snowmelt a combination of snowmelt and extreme precipitation can easily cause flooding sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2006 therefore snowmelt driven runoff is particularly sensitive to climate change kundzewicz et al 2015 zhang et al 2014a 2014b the challenge in predicting snowmelt driven runoff is to understand the underlying causes of snowmelt and its relationship with the catchment water balance mccabe and clark 2005 zampieri et al 2015 dahri et al 2021 employed the variable infiltration capacity vic macroscale hydrologic model to simulate runoff based on snowmelt and precipitation in the high altitude indus river basin they pointed out that the improvement of input temperature and precipitation data is critical to obtaining robust simulations as temperature is one of the controlling factors that determine the timing and magnitude of snowmelt and runoff zhang et al 2006 zhang et al 2016 fang et al 2018 the degree day model based on the temperature threshold degree day factor and radiation coefficient could get comparable accuracies as energy balance models for simulating snowmelt but with less demand of input data liu et al 2017 troin et al 2018 the gr4j model a daily lumped rainfall runoff model has been widely applied to simulate catchment hydrology due to its simple four parameter structure compared to the gr3j model the gr4j model showed improved performance particularly in simulating low flows edijatno et al 1999 perrin et al 2003 valéry et al 2014a 2014b presented a comparison of six snowmelt models associated with two hydrological models gr4j and hbv and concluded that the most complex model did not yield the best performance in simulating runoff many snowmelt models such as cemaneige valéry et al 2010 mohyse fortin and turcotte 2007 hydrotel turcotte et al 2007 etc have been developed to explore the relationship between snowmelt and runoff climate change may cause significant impacts on water flow and water resources in the arid and semi arid regions in northwest china sun et al 2015 bao et al 2017 santos et al 2019 the tianshan mountain known as the water tower of central asia is an important freshwater resource in china and a major source of rivers in northwest china chen et al 2016 sorg et al 2012 wang et al 2019 the kaidu river basin one of four headwaters of the tarim river basin is located on the southern slope of tianshan mountain and connects the bayanbulak swan lake and finally flows into the bosten lake the kaidu river bears the important task of water transport to the lower reaches of the tarim river chen et al 2017 however runoff of the four river basins that are situated in the south of tianshan mountain showed distinct responses to precipitation and temperature runoff in the kaidu river basin and the huangshuigou basin was co regulated by both precipitation and temperature which however were the dominant factor for regulating runoff in the toxkon basin and kunmalik basin respectively shen et al 2018 and luo et al 2017 have found that river streamflow was more sensitive to temperature change than precipitation change in hotan river basin and the model structure strongly affected the hydrological response of climate change robust projection of hydrological responses can help achieve sustainable social economic development an effective climate change adaptation strategy can be discovered by predicting runoff under future climate warming scenarios associated with different representative concentration pathways rcps climate scenario projections are often used to drive hydrological models to quantify the future climate change impact on the watershed runoff in this study we aim to estimate future changes in seasonal and inter annual runoff under the 21st century rcp scenarios and investigate the principal climate factors that regulate the trends and variability of runoff based on an optimized snowmelt streamflow model four climate models from phase 2b of the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip2b frieler et al 2017 were selected and these climate projections have been bias corrected using historical observational datasets we chose three rcp scenarios to predict future runoff rcp2 6 controlling global average temperature rise below 2 rcp4 5 forcing the climate system with steady radiation artificially and rcp8 5 which has no climate change policy van vuuren et al 2011 thomson et al 2011 riahi et al 2011 accordingly this study mainly addresses the following research questions a how can we improve a combined snowmelt and streamflow model to simulate runoff of the kaidu river basin b what are the impacts of three rcp scenarios on inter annual and seasonal variations of runoff c what are the major climate related factors that control the trend and variability of future runoff and how does their relative importance vary across different rcp scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the kaidu river basin is situated on the central southern slope of the tianshan mountain in northwest china bordering the tarim basin in the south the entire river basin is enclosed between a longitude of 82 58 86 05 e and a latitude of 42 14 43 21 n comprising an area of 19 012 km2 above the dashankou hydrological station fig 1 the elevation for the bottom of the basin ranges from 2304 to 2565 m above sea level the terrain is flat surrounded by mountains with an altitude of 3928 4794 m as the basin is located in the hinterland of the eurasian continent far from the sea close to the taklamakan desert its climate type is continental temperate arid however due to its topographical characteristics compared with the surrounding areas the temperature is lower and the precipitation is higher in the basin the annual mean temperature is 1 82 0 61 and the annual total precipitation is 328 8 31 mm during 1961 2005 precipitation shows a distinct seasonal pattern with spring of 44 7 mm and summer of 127 1 mm the runoff of the kaidu river comes from snow and icemelt and rainfall the accumulation of snow begins in november and ends in march of the following year with the increase of temperature in april and may seasonal snowmelt supplies rivers the snowmelt induced floods are commonly found in this region such as the spring flood on april 24 2011 exceeding the summer flood in summer the mountain snowmelt and rainfall are the main sources of the river 2 2 data sources 2 2 1 meteorological and hydrological data sets for model calibration to calibrate the hydrological model the meteorological and hydrological observation data sets were used the daily precipitation and temperature observations during 1961 2011 used the cn05 1 gridded observation data set with a resolution of 0 25 0 25 this dataset was generated by interpolating the field data at more than 2400 stations across china using the approaches of anusplin the australian national university spline and adw angular distance weighting respectively wu and gao 2013 because the basin was divided into three sub basins through archydro tools in arcgis and two meteorological stations in the basin could not meet the data needs of the three sub basins we decided to use the cn05 1 gridded data set as the model climate input the daily radiation used the net radiation data set from the nasa global land data assessment system glads 2 0 dataset https disc gsfc nasa gov which was estimated from cloud and snow product combined with the algorithm by the air force weather agency agricultural meteorological modeling system agrmet the hydrological data used the daily observed runoff data of the dashankou hydrological station from 2005 to 2011 located at the outlet of the basin fig 1 2 2 2 climate scenario data sets historical 1961 2005 and future 2006 2099 climate scenario data sets at daily temporal and 0 5 horizontal resolution from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project project isimip2b frieler et al 2017 were used to run scenario simulations based on the optimized model these climate scenario data sets consist of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip 5 taylor et al 2012 outputs from four global climate models gdfl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc5 shortened as gdfl hadgem2 ipsl miroc5 for low to high warming scenarios i e the representative concentration pathway rcp 2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 moss et al 2010 even though only four gcmss may not be sufficient to represent the entire spread of regional climate change projected by the cmip5 ensemble we still note that for the china region only one cmip5 model projection is out of the range spanning across the four gcms we selected frieler et al 2017 to ensure the isimip2b historical climate data sets consistent with the cn05 1 data set in the trends and variabilities of temperature and precipitation a bias correction see section 2 4 for temperature and precipitation based on the cn05 1 data set was done for the isimip2b historical climate datasets for the study area 2 3 runoff simulation the hydrological model gr4j and the snowmelt module cemaneige have been successfully applied to simulate runoff in mountainous areas which can meet the needs of our study valéry et al 2010 troin et al 2018 arsenault et al 2018 a brief description of the snowmelt module cemaneige and the hydrological model gr4j model are given below 2 3 1 snowmelt module the cemaneige module simulates snow accumulation and melts using a snowpack to represent snow storage snow water equivalent and the thermal state of the snow the snow storage can be added with the solid fraction of the precipitation the thermal state of the snowpack determines the onset of the snowmelt after calculation of the snow storage and thermal state the potential snowmelt can be determined using the degree day method finally the actual snowmelt is the multiplication of the areal fraction of snow cover and the potential snowmelt two critical hydrological processes related to snowmelt rain snow division and snowmelt computation were tested in this study to get a robust simulation of snowmelt runoff as there are two different functions of rain snow division and three different methods of snowmelt computation available in the cemaneige module six combinations of these functions table 1 had been coupled into the hydrological model to identify the optimized model which was used in the future projection of snowmelt runoff 2 3 1 1 rain snow division functions both single temperature threshold yang et al 1997 and double temperature threshold wigmosta et al 1994 fuchs et al 2001 functions are considered the equations for these functions are as follows a single threshold function stt 1 s p 1 t mean t 0 0 t 0 t mean where sp is the percentage of solids in precipitation t0 is a threshold

modules can be referred to valéry et al 2014a b in this study we only focus on the description of six versions of the cemaneigh modules 2 3 2 potential evapotranspiration method the potential evapotranspiration was estimated using the oudin formulas based on extraterrestrial radiation oudin et al 2005 the oudin formula is expressed as etp r e t mean 5 λ ρ 100 if t mean 5 0 10 etp 0 otherwise where etp is the potential evapotranspiration mm d 1 re is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 calculated in detail by morton 1983 λ is the latent heat flux mj m 2 and ρ is the water density kg m 3 2 3 3 hydrological model the modèle du génie ruralà 4 paramètres journalier gr4j is a daily scaled lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model with four parameters perrin et al 2003 in this study it has been amended to a semi distributed model to cooperate with the snowmelt model the gr4j model employs a production store and a routing store to calculate the daily streamflow generated by precipitation model input requires precipitation data and temperature data the gr4j model cooperates with the cemaneige model and performs pretty well in the daily streamflow simulation over many watersheds poissant et al 2017 troin et al 2015 velázquez et al 2015 zeng et al 2019 several hydrological model parameters are listed in table 2 including gr4j and six versions of cemaneige parameters 2 4 model calibration the shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm was applied to constrain the model parameters duan et al 1994 duan 2021 the sce ua algorithm has been widely used in hydrological modeling for global optimization of parameters and it has integrated deterministic search strategies and random element sampling approaches rahnamay naeini et al 2019 we carried out a 10 000 multi run and set the runoff as the single objective variable in our application the simulation with the highest king gupta efficiency kge value in the multi runs was used to identify the optimal parameterization in each model we have put 2005 2008 as the calibration period and 2009 2011 as the validation period the performance of each optimized model in simulating runoff for 2005 2008 is shown in fig s1 to validate the model we selected three metrics to evaluate the performance of the six optimized models identified in the model calibration these metrics include kge percentage bias pbias nash sutcliff efficiency nse the kge metric with statistical nature comprehensively measure model performance from three aspects i e correlation variability bias and mean bias the correlation component represents the hydrological aspects of the model such as peak flow times the closer kge is to 1 the better the model performance is obtained gupta et al 2009 knoben et al 2019 pbias measures the average of simulated sequences moriasi et al 2007 pbias 0 indicates no bias and the value below above 0 indicates an underestimation overestimation of the model nse matric reflects the similarity between observed and simulated runoff nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse 0 indicates the simulation corresponds to the observed mean runoff and nse 1 indicates the simulated runoff has perfect performance the formulas for the calculation of kge pbias and nse are listed as follows 11 kge 1 r q obs q sim 1 2 μ q obs μ q sim 1 2 σ q obs σ q sim 1 2 12 pbias t 1 t q t sim t 1 t q t obs 1 13 nse 1 t 1 t q t

runoff series μ q obs and μ q sim are the average of the observed and simulated runoff series σ q obs and σ q sim are the standard deviation of the observed and simulated runoff series in eqs 12 and 13 q t sim and q t obs are the observed and simulated runoff at time t t is the number of runoff samples 2 5 climate bias correction to make historical baseline conditions of gcm data be in line with the observation data sets a linear scaling approach with multiplication and addition lenderink et al 2007 was applied to precipitation and temperature respectively for their time series of 1961 2005 the linear scaling approach is formulated as follows 14 p t adj p t ori p avg obs p avg ori 15 t t adj t t ori t avg obs t avg ori where p t adj and p t ori are the adjusted and original precipitation series of gcm data t t adj and t t ori are the adjusted and original temperature series of gcm data to evaluate how well the gcm dataset have been bias corrected another three indices i e coefficient of determination r2 root mean square deviation rmsd and bias were calculated based on the individual gcm dataset or mean of the multi model ensemble mme and the cn05 1 data for the historical period 1961 2005 r2 reflects the fitting degree between the gcm dataset and observations rmsd quantifies the dispersion between the gcm dataset and observations bias reflects the gcm dataset overestimation and underestimation relative to observations these indices are formulated as follows 16 r 2 1 i 1 n m i o i 2 i 1 n o i o avg 2 17 rmsd 1 n i 1 n m i o i 2 1 2 18 bias m avg o avg in eqs 16 18 m i and o i are the gcm dataset and observation respectively m avg and o avg are the average of the gcm dataset and observation respectively and n is the number of samples 2 6 center of mass date for snowmelt the center of mass date cmd was used to estimate the impact of climate change on the timing of snowmelt when 50 of the total annual snowmelt occurred this method was used in previous studies to calculate the time center of snowmelt runoff the annual snowmelt centers are calculated as follows 19 cmd i 1 t sm i t i i 1 t t i where t i represents the number of days in a year and smi represents the snowmelt on the corresponding date 2 7 relative importance of dominant factors to identify the dominant factors that regulate the inter annual variations of runoff in the future plausible climate change scenarios we used a random forest algorithm from the statistics and machine learning toolbox of matlab loh 2002 to assess the relative importance of predictive factors that can explain the variance of runoff this analysis selected temperature precipitation evapotranspiration snowmelt and snowmelt timing as the predictive factors the daily streamflow was the response factor the tree based methods construct hierarchical binary decision trees which can avoid model over fitting predictor importance is estimated by computing the out of bag accuracy before and after permutation and the accuracy differences mean the influence of a predictor variable on the response variable nicodemus et al 2010 the average of accuracy changes of all trees represents the final importance scores the importance of the variable increases with the value of this measure the split predictor at each node is specified using an interaction curvature test to grow unbiased trees and the total dataset was used to train a regression tree the workflows of the entire study are illustrated in the schematic diagram fig 2 3 results 3 1 validation of daily runoff simulation the performances of the hydrological model with six different snowmelt modules in simulating runoff were validated based on three indices i e kge pbias and nse during the period 2009 2011 fig 3 for kge values all six models showed reasonable simulations with the values of kge ranging from 0 62 to 0 73 however both m1 the version with single threshold function and temperature exponential function as shown in table 1 and m5 the version with double threshold function and seasonal variation degree factor as shown in table 1 showed relatively lower pbias values 2 64 m1 and 4 96 m5 besides m5 also had the highest nse value nse 0 58 and thus was selected to project runoff in the future the seasonal variations of daily runoff for the model simulations and observations during 2009 2011 were illustrated fig 4 the calibrated models can generally capture seasonal variations of the runoff particularly for the hydrological responses to summer and autumn rainfall however the models also showed larger deviations from the observed runoff during the early snowmelt period the snowmelt period in the kaidu river basin often starts from april to may as temperature rises snowmelt runoff increases and spring floods may occur the discrepancy between simulations and observations was more evident in 2010 and 2011 during which the larger snowmelt induced peaks were observed than that in previous years for the timing of spring flood arrivals the model with either the stt or dtt method can efficiently simulate it however when it comes to the larger spring floods like 2010 and 2011 all the snowmelt models showed less efficiency in capturing the magnitude of floods than their performance in the calibration period fig s1 and fig 4 among the six models the m5 snowmelt model simulated a relatively better variation of spring runoff than other models in 2010 however it also overestimated the magnitude of the first runoff peak as many other models as the m5 snowmelt model used a degree day factor accounting for the day number of the year it can better represent the effects of seasonal variations in the solar radiation on snowmelt the albedo of the snow also has a seasonal variation because fresh snow is commonly found in the mid winter and aged snow is found in the late winter and spring the possible reasons to explain the model s inefficiency in capturing the magnitude of spring runoff peaks can be 1 the reliabilities of snowfall measurements 2 large variabilities of spring temperature which may cause several rapid snow melting or refreezing events 3 the spatial effects for instance the topography of catchment and alpine snow distribution on the catchment snowmelt during the occurrence of larger spring floods which can be a major challenge for these temperature index based models to simulate the magnitude of spring floods 3 2 bias correction evaluation for precipitation and temperature before running scenario simulations with the optimal hydrological model four gcms data were bias corrected based on the observational data set three indices were used to assess the bias corrected precipitation and temperature in each gcm dataset and mme against the cn05 1 dataset for the historical period 1961 2005 table 3 the mean bias between simulated precipitation and temperature and observed data was basically eliminated through the linear scaling approach it is evident that the bias correction improved both r 2 and rmsd after correction the r2 and rmse value of mme is 0 60 0 56 for precipitation while 0 94 3 27 for temperature respectively moreover mme showed better performance than individual gcm in table 3 with the results of the correction analysis shown in fig s2 the inter annual variations also indicated that the adjusted data of four gcms could capture the magnitude and variabilities of precipitation and temperature in the study area in contrast mme had better performance than the individual model during the historical period 1961 2005 fig 5 3 3 snowmelt driven runoff under climate change the results of hydrological simulation under three different rcps rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 with input data from four gcms were studied in order to explore the variations of runoff in the future periods we mainly focused on the results based on the ensemble mean of simulations the changes in future runoff were analyzed during mid century 2036 2065 and the end century 2070 2099 relative to the baseline period 1976 2005 under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 fig 6 for mid century there was little difference in the proportion of runoff reduction among the three rcps compared with the reference period decreases in the mean annual runoff for the mid century period were 12 81 25 44 m³ s 1 17 19 34 14 m³ s 1 and 13 50 26 83 m³ s 1 under three rcps respectively however for the end century the runoff of rcp8 5 had declined by about two times than that in mid century while the runoff of rcp4 5 fluctuated steadily and the runoff of rcp2 6 recovered basically to the level of the baseline period the runoff simulation under rcp 2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 showed decreases of 3 38 6 72 m³ s 1 15 82 31 41 m³ s 1 and 24 26 48 21 m³ s 1 as compared with the reference period as shown in fig 6 the simulated annual and seasonal except spring runoff showed declining trends p 0 05 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 table 4 on the other hand the simulated evapotranspiration showed a significant increasing trend p 0 05 under different rcps at the same time the precipitation and runoff illustrate an insignificant trend in rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 which was similar to a previous study li et al 2019 the increase of water vapor in the atmosphere did not produce sufficient precipitation due to temperature rising in the study area precipitation and temperature induced the decrease of runoff together besides the change of annual runoff the variations of seasonal runoff during the whole period were projected and evaluated as shown in fig 6 the projection of runoff values shows large variations in seasons the runoff in summer under three rcps shows the largest decrease among the four seasons the details of the trends are shown in table 4 followed by autumn and winter while that in spring rises slowly at the same time the summer runoff decrease is similar to the annual runoff under three pcrs during mid century the proportion of summer runoff in rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 decreased by 15 74 64 32 m³ s 18 87 77 10 m³ s and 15 33 62 69 m³ s compared with that in the baseline period while decrease by 3 20 13 08 m³ s 19 74 80 67 m³ s and 29 70 121 46 m³ s during end century as shown in fig 6 the largest variabilities were found in summer for inter annual variabilities of annual and seasonal runoff during three periods historical mid century and end century from three rcps fig 7 in summer compared to the historical period both rcp2 6 and rcp 4 5 showed a decline in mid century and a rise in end century for the seasonal mean runoff however rcp8 5 showed a continuous decline from mid to end century for the range of variabilities both rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 predicted an increase from mid to end century suggesting that the year to year fluctuation of summer runoff was enhanced as the climate warms nevertheless rcp8 5 showed an opposite tendency of change the spring runoff showed a general increase with time in three rcps especially in rcp8 5 indicating the future climate impact on snowmelt meanwhile the inter annual variabilities of evapotranspiration did not show a large shift for the range and magnitude among three rcps whereas the variability of precipitation decreases sharply in the larger future warming scenario fig s3 therefore precipitation is inferred to be the principal factor that causes changes in the runoff variability 4 discussions 4 1 runoff responses to climate change this study studies the future change of runoff for the kaidu river basin under plausible future warming scenarios and provides new insights on understanding the hydrological responses to climate change the causes of runoff changes are largely associated with different hydrological processes under climate change evapotranspiration is a vital hydrological process for the water cycle yang et al 2021 previous studies show that there is inconformity between the simulated runoff and evapotranspiration based on the simulations using the swat model forced by rcms gcms under different concentration scenarios some researchers concluded that the main factor leading to decreased runoff in the future is increased evapotranspiration ba et al 2018 fang et al 2018 however we also observed that future precipitation and temperature trends might differ between gcms in this study area as the precipitation varies largely among different climate models and these differences may affect the accuracy of runoff simulation in this area zhang et al 2006 tian et al 2017 precipitation may introduce large uncertainty in the projection of runoff and complicate the understanding of underlying drivers of hydrological responses of runoff previous studies also showed the reliability of the gridded climate dataset applied for this study area luo et al 2020 similar to those studies to bias correct the isimip2b climate trajectories based on the best available historical observation data i e cn05 1 can improve the robustness of our predictions of future climate change impacts on regional hydrological processes the model structure and snowmelt modules are also important factors to cause uncertainties of the runoff projection najafi et al 2011 feng beighley 2020 in the snowmelt model the temperature index method often depends on the mean air temperature however zhang et al 2006 found that using the daily maximum temperature multiplied by 0 5 as one of the model inputs improved snow cover mapping than the simulations with daily mean temperature as the model input therefore the temperature index method could consider the daily maximum air temperature as one of the climatic inputs to estimate snowmelt thus the optimization of the hydrological model offers fairness in the model choice using the maximized kge values as an optimized object in the calibration stage we evaluated the models performances by nse and pbias values we studied the effects of climate change under the assumption that the best set of parameters found during the calibration process in historical periods will remain valid in the future the responses of runoff on climate change can imply a potential water shortage in the future to quantify the trends of runoff we adopted a 30 year moving average to smooth the runoff fluctuations and detect how the change in the trends of runoff is in response to climate warming fig 8 in general the annual runoff showed different tendencies of changes in the three rcps the inter annual patterns of these changes were mostly dependent on summer time runoff we found the trends with a strong fluctuation in rcp2 6 a slow increase in rcp4 5 and both of them end with a small positive trend however rcp8 5 runoff trends went up generally before 2057 but then dropped rapidly to 0 79 m3s 1a 1 in 2099 meanwhile the runoff trend in autumn was consistent with each other among three rcps before 2050 while that of rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 both turned positive and reach 0 39 m3s 1a 1 and 0 69 m3s 1a 1 respectively in 2099 similar to that in winter which reached 0 10 m3s 1a 1 and 0 12 m3s 1a 1 respectively the spring runoff trend distinguished obviously from the other three seasons and it showed lasting positive under rcp8 5 whereas dramatic fluctuation under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 by the time almost disappeared at the end of the 21st century the absolute value of the trend under rcp8 5 was larger than that under other scenarios for both annual and seasonal runoff 4 2 timing of snowmelt another issue related to the snowmelt runoff simulation is the timing of the snowmelt compared to studies in other countries like the united states canada japan etc the timing of snowmelt in china is less studied mccabe and clark 2004 dyer 2008 we used snowmelt cmd to describe the variations in the snowmelt s timing and fitted the cmd trends using the least square method the general trend for cmd was a linear decline over the historical period but continued with different directions of polynomial trends under three rcps suggesting how early snowmelt advances depended on the level of future warming the changes in snowmelt time was significantly different under different scenarios and the fitting curve formula is shown in fig 9 compared with the historical period 1976 2005 the cmd decline trend of the three rcp scenarios before the mid century was similar to that of the historical period however after the mid century the rcp8 5 cmd continued the trend in the historical period and the rcp4 5 cmd slowed down significantly while the trend of cmd under rcp2 6 showed the snowmelt time started to recover gradually after 2055 compared with the historical period 1976 2005 the timing of snowmelt under three warming scenarios at the end of this century 2070 2099 was 8 2 13 9 and 25 5 days earlier respectively this suggests that the effects of different anthropogenic warming scenarios on snowmelt cmd have similar effects in the short term and distinct effects in the long term 4 3 relative importance of climate related drivers on future runoff the relative importance of predictive factors i e precipitation temperature evapotranspiration snowmelt timing and snowmelt to the response variable runoff was explored based on a random forest model and the historical and three rcp simulation data sets fig 10 and fig s4 to better compare the relative importance of drivers in different scenario runs we rescale the importance of individual drivers by dividing it with the total importance the sum of the importance of all individual factors precipitation was the predominant factor for the spring to autumn runoff and evapotranspiration was the second important factor in all three rcp scenarios fig 10 however during the historical period snowmelt timing was the second important factor the importance of snowmelt timing declined in the warmer rcp scenarios indicating that earlier advance of snowmelt may reduce its contribution to the total runoff from spring to autumn on the contrary the importance of temperature and precipitation increased in a warmer rcp scenario however for the spring runoff snowmelt is the second important factor in the historical and rcp2 6 scenario fig s4 the effects of evapotranspiration in spring runoff are less important than its effects on summer and autumn runoff in the meantime with the increase of concentration scenarios the importance of snowmelt timing strengthens relatively but snowmelt reduces its importance while temperature importance basically was equivalent to evapotranspiration importance in the higher rcp scenarios our results partly agree with the conclusion of previous studies for instance chen et al 2014 2015 which suggest that precipitation and temperature are the main factors regulating the runoff variations in the kaidu river basin unlike other alpine river basins e g the kunmalik and hotan river basins the major influential factor of the runoff variation is the temperature shen et al 2018 luo et al 2017 chen et al 2017 has highlighted the importance of including glacier melt in the hydrological modeling of the glacierized catchments which can be a critical perspective that should be accounted for in the study of hydrological responses to future climate change higher climatic warming may enhance glacier melt and increase the contribution of headwater to streamflow compensating for the negative response of runoff to warming we speculate that if our model considers the effects of the glacier or ice melt they will become more important factors to determine runoff similar to what our historical simulation has indicated 4 4 future study although the regional coverage of the kaidu river basin is mostly in mountainous areas vegetation types can still be an important factor to affect the change of runoff some studies e g mamat et al 2021 wang et al 2021 have shown that the response of vegetation to climate change may substantially impact the soil moisture in the ecosystem and total evapotranspiration moreover human activities can be another important factor to be considered in the projection of future runoff chen et al 2013 found that during 1994 2009 despite that runoff in kaidu river basin is more sensitive to climate variability than human activities which had already contributed 9 5 of the increase in runoff therefore accounting for future changes in the potential natural vegetation distribution land use and land cover change human activities topographical features associated with snow distribution and glacier melt the importance of dominant climatic drivers of runoff in the kaidu river basin can be more explicitly represented 5 conclusions this study evaluated the simulations of outlet observed runoff under the observed gridded climate data sets based on a hydrological model with six versions of the cemaneige snowmelt module first after bias correction of future climate data sets how runoff was in response to climate change under three rcp scenarios was quantified then the 30 year moving average runoff was used to analyze the trend change every 30 years and the cmd was used to indicate the timing of the snowmelt finally we analyzed the importance of variables that determine the trend and variations of runoff in summer using the random forest algorithm through kge calibration and pbias and nse evaluation the m5 combined by single threshold function and seasonal snowmelt factor was more suitable for runoff simulation in the study area with three index values are 0 73 4 96 and 0 58 respectively therefore the difference of simulation and observation sequence during the calibrated period was particularly manifest in the early stage of snowmelt under the rcp scenarios annual runoff responded to global warming trends with about a 15 reduction during the mid century for the end century rcp8 5 runoff declined by about two times that in mid century while rcp4 5 fluctuated steadily and rcp2 6 recovered basically to that in the baseline period which is mainly determined by summer runoff meanwhile the magnitude of the trend under rcp8 5 is more significant than that of other rcps for both annual and seasonal runoff the timing of the snowmelt in the future showed a distinct pattern of temporal change in three rcps suggesting that the timing of the snowmelt was also associated with the extent of warming precipitation and evapotranspiration were the two most important factors contributing to future runoff from spring to autumn which partly agrees with previous studies but with the increase of warming the timing of snowmelt turned to be less important while the importance of precipitation increased relatively overall our results have revealed the potentially important drivers in controlling future trends of runoff in the kaidu river basin and also highlighted that the runoff prediction in this region should not only account for the processes related to snowmelt but also other factors like glacier melt

8118,study region central rift valley lakes sub basin ethiopia study focus the competition for water is rapidly increasing in central rift valley lakes sub basin due to the combined effect of various water resources developments however the impacts of recent and future water resources development pathways on the water balance of the three interconnected lakes i e lake ziway langano and abiyata are unknown the water evaluation and planning weap model was used to assess the development impacts on water resources of the interconnected lakes we considered three development pathways that are recent 2009 2018 short term 2019 2028 and long term development 2029 2038 lake ziway water inflows from six catchments were estimated using the hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv rainfall runoff model crop water requirements for irrigation schemes were estimated by the cropwat model new hydrological insights for the region weap simulations show a total water demand of 102 3 mm3 under the recent development pathway that increases by 46 and 118 for short term and long term development pathways respectively this will notably affect the water balance of the interconnected lakes and cause an unmet water demand of 47 9 mm3 for the long term 2028 2038 for lake ziway and abiyata water levels will decrease substantially to cause water scarcity in the long term and developments in lake ziway will significantly affect water storage in lake abiyata storages in lake abiyata overall future developments will threaten the water resource of the interconnected lake system abbreviations

basin in ethiopia that is of interest to this study the sub basin is a preferred location for irrigation due to the short distance from major cities including the capital city of addis ababa ethiopia over recent years crv has become the focus area for large and small scale irrigation developments and other human activities that withdraw considerable amount of water from the lakes and their tributary rivers the water resources of the sub basin are used for irrigation for soda ash production fish farming and recreation and provide water to eco systems with a wide variety of endemic birds and wild animals ayenew 1998 2004 jansen et al 2007 past studies presented environmental problems of the rapidly growing use of water resources in each of the sub basin s lakes separately zinabu et al 2002 ayenew 2004 desta and lemma 2017 in the near future the impacts can be exacerbated by the future developments awulachew et al 2007 jansen et al 2007 mowie 2012 including uncontrolled irrigation developments by individual farmers absence of water allocation plans and mismatch between hydrological and administrative boundaries that complicates tracking of water withdrawals over the past decades changes have been observed on the behavior of the rift valley lakes and their environments lake areas for lake abiyata and lake ziway have reduced as a consequence of excessive water abstractions zinabu et al 2002 seyoum et al 2015 goshime et al 2020 but lake areas of lake beseka and lake awassa increased ayenew and legesse 2007 ayenew and gebreegziabher 2006 possibly due to increased surface runoff inflows from percolated irrigation water and land use changes respectively in the interconnected lakes of ziway abiyata and langano the level of lake ziway decreased by approximately 0 5 m between 2002 and 2007 jansen et al 2007 that caused a reduction in the discharge of bulbula river that subsequently resulted in 40 reduction in the size of lake abiyata asfaw et al 2020 indicates 4 cm water level decrease per annum and 20 4 mm3 reduction of water storage of lake ziway between 2009 and 2018 downstream connected lake abiyata and lake langano experienced smallest change as compared to other lakes in the sub basin findings of previous studies reported that the climate and land use changes conversion of the woodlands into agricultural lands and settlements areas will affect the water balance of the interconnected ziway abiyata and langano lakes legesse et al 2004 seyoum et al 2015 desta and lemma 2017 desta et al 2017 the reductions in the lake sizes can be related to use of water from the inflowing rivers and lake catchments and lake water abstractions that is aggravated intermittently by climatic and land use changes ayenew and legesse 2007 ayenew and tilahun 2008 desta et al 2017 abrhama et al 2018 seyoum et al 2015 argues that reductions in lake size can be attributed more too human activities than climate change water supply to irrigation and industrial processing purposes from these lakes is threated by future uncontrolled abstraction of water that will inevitably alter the hydrologic balance of the lakes if the human interventions are not managed then lake abiyata water level may continue to decrease that potentially leads to ecological collapse likewise to what has occurred in lake alemaya lemma 2003 alemayehu et al 2007 alemayehu and furi 2007 several studies have investigated the hydrology of the crv sub basin vallet coulomb et al 2001 legesse et al 2003 2004 ayenew 2007 most of the studies focused on the likely impact of socio economic influences on land and water resources at catchment level hengsdijk and jansen 2006 legesse and ayenew 2006 jansen et al 2007 only few studies are available on lake water balance simulation and assessment under natural conditions vallet coulomb 2001 legesse et al 2003 2004 belete et al 2016 but studies ignored water abstractions that serve agricultural production goshime et al 2019a 2020 performed water level simulation of lake ziway by water balance assessment using satellite rainfall estimates these studies did not assess the impacts of present and future water demands by planned developments mowie 2012 and how impacts propagate in the interconnected lakes system the effect of a barrage that since 2016 regulates the outflow of lake ziway also was not investigated by past studies simulation of lake water levels of the interconnected ziway abiyata and langano sub basin requires a model that can simulate both water supply and demand in an integrated manner for such purpose the water evaluation and planning weap model https www weap21 org has been applied in various lake basins in ethiopia and kenya for instance weap was used to evaluate the likely impact of planned water resources development irrigation and water supply on lake tana water level alemayehu et al 2010 it was also used to simulate the surface water resources allocation of didessa sub basin in the abbay river basin considering future developments adgolign et al 2015 gedefaw et al 2019 applied the weap model to assess the potential impact of irrigation expansion and climate change scenario on the water resources in awash river basin of ethiopia alfarra 2010 conducted a study using the weap model to better understand alignment of water resources to identify problems on water resources and to suggest solutions for lake naivasha kenya hence the weap model was selected in this study as it allows for scenario based analyses of water demands and supplies by considering various water resources and hydrological components mccartney and girma 2012 the model also allows simulation of domestic irrigation and ecological water consumption in time and space that is required for integrated water resources assessment reference is made to https www weap21 org for wide range of applications of weap in water resources management arranz and mccartney 2007 mounir et al 2011 hassan et al 2019 the main objective of the present study is to quantify the present and future water demands and to evaluate the impact of recent and future water resources development pathways on the water balance of three interconnected lakes i e ziway langano abiyata and the effect of the constructed barrage in 2016 the study will help to quantify the spatio temporal unmet demand for irrigation water and other users in the sub basin the assessment was by integration of in situ satellite and survey datasets for state of the art modeling rainfall runoff model hbv crop water requirement model cropwat and a water resources planning model weap findings of this study provide information that may serve to improve the water resources management at local and basin scale and contribute to scientific literature on hydrological impacts by human intervention 2 study area the central rift valley crv lakes sub basin is located in the central section of the main ethiopian rift the sub basin which constitutes the interconnected ziway langano and abiyata lakes is situated between 7º10 8º30 n and 38º10 39º30 e the total drainage area of ziway langano and abiyata is 10 769 km2 elevation of the study area ranges from 4200 m a s l at the western and eastern escarpments to 1580 m a s l at the central rift valley floor fig 1 table 1 shows the key characteristics of lake ziway langano abiyata and shala ziway is the largest surface area whereas lake abiyata has the smallest surface area lake abiyata is a terminal lake and is upstream connected to lake langano and lake ziway through the horakela and bulbula rivers lake shala is the deepest lake and is separated from abiyata by a volcanic caldera rim lake shala is a closed lake and is highly alkaline that makes irrigation water abstraction from the lake impossible hence this study only considered a chain of three interconnected crv lakes lake ziway langano and abiyata lake ziway receives most of its surface runoff inflows from meki and katar rivers that drain the western and eastern plateaus respectively meki s catchment area is 2824 km2 including both gauged and ungauged areas rivers in the catchment originate in the highlands of gurage and travel about 100 km from the highlands 3600 m elevation to the lake about 1600 m elevation the meki river is supplemented by rinzaf and wijo minor tributaries before draining into lake ziway the katar river has a catchment area of 3750 km2 it drains the arsi highlands 4200 m elevation towards the western part to supply lake ziway 1636 m elevation the major tributaries that are contributing to the katar river include chuifa sagure ashebeka timala and wolkesa the catchments of meki and katar rivers cover a total of 6574 km2 the altitude of lake ziway is higher than that of abiyata by 56 m hence it supplies water to abiyata lake ziway has an outﬂow through bulbula river that in turn flows to the downstream lake abiyata being a terminal lake the tributaries of lake langano are gedemso huluka lepis and boku rivers that cover a total drainage area of 2006 km2 since lake langano is 4 m higher in elevation than lake abiyata it feeds lake abiyata via the horakelo river lake ziway and langano are open lakes with overflow i e drainage to lake abiyata whereas lake abiyata and shala are closed lakes without any surface water outflow the climate of the study area is characterized by semi arid to sub humid climatic condition we analysed the climate of the sub basin of the interconnected ziway langano and abiyata lakes using data collected from the national meteorology agency nma for the period from 1986 to 2018 the inter annual and seasonal variability of temperature over the study are relatively constant with mean annual maximum temperature ranging from 23 6 to 26 3 and minimum temperature ranging from 9 3 to 11 9 with long term annual average of 17 5 the mean annual rainfall over the sub basin varies from 514 to 1086 mm with long term average of 882 mm as estimated for the period 1986 2018 the highest rainfall mostly occurs during the rainy season july september the potential evapotranspiration based on penman monteith varies between approximately 1330 1502 mm with long term average of 1480 mm the inter annual variation of the potential evapotranspiration is much less than the inter annual variation in rainfall the water system of central rift valley lakes is preferred by various water sectors for irrigation domestic and industrial activities the major land uses in the basin include intensive and moderately cultivated lands with onion tomato maize cabbage green beans and pepper as the dominant irrigated crops grown in the study area 3 data availability in this study hydro meteorological time series water demand and water supply data were used the hydro meteorological dataset includes streamflow satellite and gauge rainfall and climate data required for estimation of evaporation and evapotranspiration daily satellite and gauge rainfall datasets were obtained from climate hazard group chg and national meteorology agency nma respectively daily rainfall data 1984 2018 were obtained from 20 stations in lake ziway catchment and 6 stations in abiyata and langano catchments after data screening 20 stations out of 26 were used in this study for further use six 6 stations were excluded because of too short observation period and or substantial missing data records the rain gauge observations were used to serve bias correction of the climate hazard infrared precipitation chirp satellite rainfall estimates that are available at daily time step and 5 5 km 5 5 km spatial resolution for the period 1984 2018 see goshime et al 2019a streamflow and lake water level data were obtained from the ethiopian ministry of water irrigation and energy mowie streamflow data was collected for stations in major rivers meki katar bulbula horakelo and gedemso and minor tributaries rinzaf chuifa sagure timala huluka lepis and boku the collected data was available for the period 1984 2010 lake water level data ziway langano and abiyata were obtained from mowie for the period 1986 2014 streamflow and lake water level data were used as a reference to calibrate and evaluate the hydrological and lake water balance models respectively data on irrigation sites were collected by a field survey and consultation of governmental organizations a field survey was undertaken from 16 to 21 september 2019 for lake ziway contributing catchments i e meki and katar bulbula river langano and abiyata lakes the survey includes identification of the location of demand sites type of scheme water sources potential irrigated area crop type cropping pattern and intensity the survey data was used to estimate site specific crop water requirements in the study area section 4 2 1 additionally irrigation data was obtained from water and agricultural offices from the basin master plan and extracted from water planning documents of the study area for lake ziway the water abstraction survey data of goshime et al 2019b 2021 were used in this study to estimate water demand from the lake data was collected during the period 20th of october to 5th of november 2018 base data on population sizes domestic and industrial water demands were extracted for the year 2007 as the provided by the central statistical agency of ethiopia csa and water supply from the water supply authorities by absence of a more recent report respective data for the base year 2007 were adopted the digital elevation model dem of aster gdem v2 with a spatial resolution of 30 m 30 m was used to delineate the sub basin and to extract its drainage network the land use land cover lulc map was obtained from mowie of ethiopia for the year 1996 we note that lulc of the sub basin is characterized by intensive cultivation land water bodies and wetlands and shrub lands for all the three lakes a bathymetric survey was conducted in 1984 however an additional survey was conducted for lake ziway in 2013 and hence was used in this study bathymetric maps were provided by mowie 4 methods in this study the impacts of recent and future water development pathways were evaluated using the weap model inputs to the weap model were obtained from multiple sources including simulated streamflow simulated crop water requirements satellite products a field survey the basin master plan and design documents the hbv rainfall runoff model was used to simulate lake water inflow by streamflow to lake ziway simulations 1984 2018 were for 6 river gauge stations at major and minor tributaries the irrigation water demand was estimated using a water abstraction survey cropwat model simulations and a literature survey this study assumes that the climate of the recent development pathway will not change so to isolate aspects that potentially could relate to climate change impacts for future pathways finally we evaluated the impacts of the development pathways on water availability in the rivers and on volume water level and surface areas of the three interconnected lakes i e lakes ziway lake langano and lake abiyata 4 1 model calibration and simulation the available streamflow datasets covered a short observation period with substantial missing records to overcome this limitation the hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv rainfall runoff model bergström 1997 was used to fill observation gaps and to prepare long streamflow time series for application the model was calibrated and validated for respective gauges the main inputs to the model include rainfall potential evapotranspiration pet land use land cover and a digital elevation model dem meteorological observations at 12 stations fig 1 were used to estimate pet using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 that were subsequently used as input to the hbv model the 1996 land cover map that was obtained from mowie also served as hbv input in this study eight parameters alfa beta cflux fc lp k4 khq and perc were selected for calibration following previous studies in the study area goshime et al 2019a goshime et al 2020 for detailed descriptions about the hbv model reference is made to lindström et al 1997 rientjes et al 2011 johansson 2013 to warm calibrate and validate the model time periods 1984 1985 1986 1991 and 1996 2000 were selected respectively at 6 six gauge stations in lake ziway sub basin long term streamflow time series 1986 2018 were prepared using the bias corrected chirp rainfall data as input for bias correction a non linear power method was selected and rain gauge data served as a reference at daily time step with the parameters varying for each of the 12 months of a year for a detailed description on bias correction for this study reference is made to goshime et al 2019a the bias corrected chirp satellite rainfall estimates were used to estimate lake area rainfall and to simulate lake ziway inflow by means of the hbv model the streamflow from the ungauged part of the study area was estimated using a simple regionalization method based on the area ratio method where streamflow from the gauged area is rescaled for the ungauged part of the catchment the performance of the hbv model for available streamflow time series was first evaluated by visual inspection of the match between the simulated and observed hydrographs next the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse relative volumetric error rve and coefficient of determination r2 were used to evaluate the model performance nse is a performance indicator that measures the relative magnitude of the residual variance of the simulated flow compared to the observed flow it indicates how well the pattern of the simulated hydrograph fits that of the observed hydrograph nash and sutcliffe 1970 rve measures the average tendency of the simulated streamflow volume to be larger or smaller than the observed counterparts gupta et al 1999 the coefficient of determination r2 is the measure of the fraction of the variation in the observed streamflow data that is replicated in the simulated streamflow data moriasi et al 2007 table 2 provides the equations for the three objective functions with additional descriptions 4 2 water demand assessment 4 2 1 irrigation demand in this study irrigation water demand was estimated using a combination of water abstraction survey and the crop water requirement model cropwat 8 0 fao 2018 of food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao cropwat estimates the water requirements of the crop cwr using climate soil and crop phenological data its inputs include reference evapotranspiration rainfall soil crop type and crop pattern twelve 12 meteorological stations that are located close to the demand sites were used to estimate reference evapotranspiration using penman monteith equation which is considered a standard method allen et al 1998 and to specify daily rainfall at each demand site during the field survey it appeared that the main irrigated crops of the study area include onion tomato maize cabbage green beans pepper alfalfa and grapes crop planting and harvesting dates irrigation scheduling and irrigated area of each crop were also obtained from the survey managers and irrigators were interviewed to collect the basic information as well as information on their respective development pathways crop characteristics growth stage and soil characteristic data on soil moisture storage and depletion were obtained from fao 56 irrigation and drainage paper the basin master plan and irrigation project design documents 4 2 2 domestic water demand the latest population and housing census of ethiopia was conducted in 2007 therefore 2007 was defined as the base year for the weap simulation the 2007 census showed that the population of ziway and bulbula towns was 43 660 and 5000 respectively central statistical agency of ethiopia csa in 2007 the water supply authorities of the two towns were distributing 3450 and 430 m3 d 1 of water for ziway and bulbula towns respectively and hence this was used in the weap model simulations for the recent account or base year for future developments the domestic water demand was extrapolated using population size geometric population growth rate 2 9 and water use liter per capita per day data to estimate the domestic water demand the water use rates were multiplied by the population size 4 2 3 industrial water demand demands for industrial uses only apply to lake abiyata whereas a soda ash factory abstracts water from the lake since 1985 in 2007 it was reported that 15 000 ton of soda ash was produced that was used for the recent account in weap simulations according to the rift valley lakes basin master plan the factory produces 25 000 tons of soda ash per year 2009 2018 with a water requirement of 150 m3 per ton of production for the recent development pathway an increment of 25 000 ton for future development pathways from the 2007 reference year was used to construct the future production capacity as per the rift valley lake basin master plan report mowie 2012 and design documents 4 2 4 environmental flow requirement the environmental flow is the water that serves the river ecosystem to maintain the downstream ecological balance in this study requirements on environmental flows were not available and thus allowance only made for main rivers requirements were simply expressed as a percentage of the mean annual flow following tennant 1976 was reported to use approximate 15 20 of mean annual flow as downstream water requirement hence the environmental flow is specified as 20 of the mean annual flow in this study environmental flow requirements were specified downstream of bulbula river to regulate lake ziway and to attribute to downstream flow to lake abiyata see also shumet and mengistu 2016 4 3 water evaluation and planning weap model the weap model was developed by stockholm environment institute at boston usa to evaluate water demands associated priorities and water supply for recent and future periods the model allows specifying alternative scenarios i e plausible futures based on what if questions to assess the impact of different development and management options it optimizes water use in the catchment with the objective to maximize the water delivered to demand sites according to a set of user defined priorities yates et al 2005 the demand sites are assigned a priority between 1 and 99 where 1 is assigned for the highest priority and 99 is for the lowest priority some of the input data of weap were water supply river head streamflow water use demand water levels elevation storage area relationship and the spatial location of the water system for a more detailed description about weap model reference is made to yates et al 2005 sei 2015 fig 2 shows the schematization of the crv lakes sub basin based on recent and planned water demand and supply sources in the schematization the type of scheme the supply sources and the location of the demand sites were considered the demand priority was assigned considering the recent pathway in which the upstream demand sites receive priority hence the first priority was assigned to the most upstream demand sites the next priority was assigned to the next downstream demand sites and so on i e priority was varied from upstream to downstream accordingly highest priority 1 was assigned for demand sites that receive water from timala chuifa dugda rinzaf boku huluka gedemso and lepis rivers priority 2 was assigned to demand sites that receive water from meki sagure bulbula and horekelo rivers the demand sites along the katar river were assigned priority 3 demand sites withdrawing water from lake ziway and langano were assigned equal priority of 98 lowest priority 99 was assigned for lake abiyata but with priority 1 for environmental flow demands 4 4 effect of barrage regulation the barrage regulator at the outlet of lake ziway at bulbula river may reduce lake ziway outflow affecting the storage of the downstream lake abiyata hence the barrage should be operated not only to regulate the lake storage but also to fulfill the irrigation water demand along the bulbula river as well as environmental flow requirements efr lake ziway receives water from river streamflows and from lake rainfall and loses water through abstraction evaporation and outflow to simulate changes in the lake level two regression relationships between observed water level and outflow time series were developed the first relation was developed for the period january 2009 may 2016 and the second relation was developed for the period june 2016 2019 which covers the period the barrage is in operation the outflow discharge time series that were simulated for respective periods were subsequently used in weap model for recent development pathway for the future development pathways the second relationship between observed water level and river outflow discharge was specified in weap in the form of mathematical equation similarly the recent and future outflow from langano was specified using the observed langano water level and horakelo outflow discharge 4 5 water resources development pathways in this study three development pathways are considered these pathways include recent development 2009 2018 short term development 2019 2028 and long term development 2029 2038 the development pathways were constructed based on the information from rift valley lakes basin master plan mowie 2012 feasibility studies design documents and consultation of stakeholders during the field survey the data or information source that reflects the current stage of the development pathways was selected to extract the information for weap modeling for this study as a reference to change assessments by respective pathways a base year 2007 was specified using the water abstraction in 2007 jansen et al 2007 for which detailed water abstraction survey data was prepared for the crv basin master plan and the national population and housing census was conducted table 3 shows the summary and descriptions for base year and for each water resources development pathway 4 6 impact of water resources developments after determining the water demand for all development pathways weap was used to simulate the water level of the lakes for this the monthly water balance of the three lakes was estimated for a base line period of 15 years 1986 2000 the period served as a baseline for comparison of changes by each development pathway this period was selected because it best represents the undisturbed water level regime with minimum water withdrawal from the lakes and tributaries furthermore it represents the period before construction of outflow regulator at bulbula river also goshime et al 2020 indicated significant water abstraction from lake ziway for the period 2001 2014 for the 2016 2018 period of the recent development pathway and the entire period of the short term and long term development pathways the regulatory barrage was set to provide flows to the bulbula river so that environmental flow requirements efr are met at downstream lake abiyata then the impact of the three development pathways was evaluated by comparing the weap simulations for these pathways against the simulations for the baseline period 1986 2000 furthermore water scarcity threshold levels for all three lakes were established based on a basin master plan document mowie 2012 the water scarcity level represents a minimum water level to sustain the fish habitat and their food chain hence irrigation water abstraction should be ceased before the water level drops below this level 5 results and discussion 5 1 streamflow simulation fig 3 shows a comparison of the simulated and observed streamflow hydrographs for the calibration period 1986 1991 at meki and rinzaf gauging stations that indicate river flows to the lake from the western side the model fairly captured the pattern of the observed hydrograph including recession and rising limbs of both catchments however it did not satisfactorily capture most of the observed peak flows especially for rinzaf gauge station the agreement between the simulated and observed streamflow was better for meki than rinzaf river catchment the latter has relatively small size that resulted in high streamflow variability and relatively high peaks streamflow was observed two times per day and thus limits to provide representative data on streamflow volume for the small catchments another cause of mismatch could be the stage discharge relations that often are inaccurate to convert high water level measurements into representative discharges fig 4 shows the simulated and observed streamflow for the calibration period 1986 1991 at katar chuifa sagure and timala gauge stations that drain into lake ziway from the eastern plateaus hbv well captured the overall pattern of the observed hydrograph for most of the gauge stations however the rising limb and related peaks of the observed hydrograph were not satisfactorily captured the model better captured the observed flow for the katar catchment that has highest streamflow discharges however some observed peaks were not satisfactorily simulated for smaller tributaries for instance at sagure and chuifa river gauge stations table 4 presents the calibrated values of the model parameters and objectives functions the calibrated values of alfa k4 and cflux do not significantly vary across the catchments the recession parameter k4 influences the recession part of the base flow of the hydrographs alfa is used to simulate rapid responses of the shallow subsurface and affects the peak discharges the parameters fc beta khq and lp show differences across the catchments table 4 this typically suggests hydrologic variability between catchments in terms of rapid streamflow responses but also evapotranspiration fluxes a higher khq results in higher peaks and more dynamic responses in the hydrograph perc values were calibrated so that dry season flows of the catchments were well represented by the model the hbv model performed satisfactory for most of the catchments for the calibration period performance measures indicate that the model performed better for meki and katar catchments nse 0 7 rve 5 and r2 0 7 than for smaller catchments for the minor tributary of rinzaf the nse is lower than 0 5 for both calibration and validation period considering poor data quality the model performance is acceptable for studying streamflow volume although caution should be exercised when the interest is in capturing the hydrograph shape when evaluated for the validation period the model performance deteriorated for most catchments but with noticeable magnitude especially for small catchments such as rinzaf and timala for instance the negative value of the rve 14 3 indicates that the mean simulated streamflow discharge is smaller than the mean observed discharge however these rve values can also indicate deterioration of the quality of observed streamflow data for these two stations the calibration was targeted more on rve than nse since the main target of this study related to inflow and outflow water volumes to respective lakes 5 2 water demand and development pathways there is an on going and planned water abstraction across all catchments of the crv sub basin fig 5 although the abstraction sites are mostly concentrated around lake ziway irrigation demands were from both smallholder and large irrigation schemes water abstraction is commonly through pumping directly from lake ziway in the three districts adami tulu dugda and ziway dugda and along the bulbula river however there are some diversions that pump water from meki katar and bulbula rivers the canal diversions are situated mostly at katar meki and langano tributary rivers particularly the canal diversions are very dense along the most downstream stretch of meki river for the base year 2007 the surface water system of crv sub basin supplied water to a total irrigated area of 5534 ha katar meki and bulbula rivers provided water for large irrigated lands in the sub basin table 5 a large irrigated area with intensive smallholder irrigated farmers flower farms and modern irrigation schemes rely on abstractions from lake ziway compared to the base year 2007 the irrigated areas increased by 36 57 and 71 for the recent short term and long term development pathways respectively irrigation is the largest water user in the study area in addition water is used for soda ash domestic and environmental flow at bulbula river for downstream lake abiyata the domestic water demand and environmental flow remains almost nearly the same for the three development pathways fig 6 shows the summary of annual water abstraction from the main water sources in the entire crv sub basin for the base year 2007 the figure indicates that lake ziway has largest water abstraction accounting for 39 of water withdrawal from the main surface water sources water withdrawal was the second largest for katar and bulbula rivers whereas the withdrawal from lake langano is the smallest the summary of total annual water demand supply and unmet demand for the three development pathways is presented in table 6 findings indicate that the annual water demand for the short term development pathway 2019 2028 is 149 4 mm3 that corresponds to 46 increase as compared to the demand under recent development 102 3 mm3 if all the planned long term water resources developments will be fully implemented the annual water demand will amount to 223 mm3 and signifies an increase by a factor of 2 2 as compared to the recent development this is mainly because of the increase in the projected irrigated area during this period the annual water supply does not match the demand for all the development pathways table 6 also indicates that unmet demand will increase to 47 9mm3 in the long term development table 7 presents the water demand supply delivered and unmet demand across the watersheds for the three development pathways the water demand of water users from the lakes lake ziway langano and abiyata was fully met for all development pathways as expected since there is no limit to water abstraction from the lakes this indicates that water abstraction from the lake system is uncontrolled the unmet demand was larger for long term development for all demand sites the largest unmet demand was estimated for demand sites in katar and catchments draining to langano and meki catchment even though the highest priority was assigned to the most upstream demand sites larger unmet demands were estimated at upstream demand sites than downstream the largest unmet water demand 28 mm3 per annum for long term development table 7 is in katar watershed that is mainly due to large irrigated areas in katar watersheds the percentage of unmet demand was also higher for demand sites with largest water demand for long term development a highest unmet demand of 50 was obtained for katar irrigation schemes 45 for langano tributary and 32 for meki irrigation schemes table 7 overall this study indicates that there is unmet demand across all lake catchments however the unmet demand along bulbula river is not large considering the extent of irrigation abstraction from this river this may alter subject to the regulation of the barrage fig 7 presents the summary of monthly unmet demands for the three development pathways the result indicates that the demand for all development pathways will be fully met for three months of the rainy season july september the unmet demand for november to february is noticeable mainly since this period is the driest season the unmet demand in the small rainy season march may is relatively small compared to the dry season the total annual unmet demand under the recent development was about 15 8 mm3 which accounts for 15 of the total water demand this amount increases by a factor of 1 85 i e 29 2 mm3 for the short term development at the end of the long term development pathway the annual unmet water demand will increase by a factor of 3 0 47 9 mm3 as compared to the recent development 5 3 impact of water resources development for accurate estimation of water resources development it is crucial to determine respective water balance components estimates of annual water balance components for the recent development pathway 1986 2000 for the three interconnected lakes are shown in table 8 estimates are comparable to estimates shown in the various studies vallet coulomb et al 2001 ayenew 2004 legesse and ayenew 2006 desta et al 2017 findings indicate that lake evaporation is the largest component of the water balance for all lakes whereas surface outflow is the smallest component note that the amount of water abstraction was estimated from the recent 2018 water abstraction survey being the field survey period the amount of water abstraction from lake ziway was significantly larger than the abstraction from lake langano and abiyata in table 8 the net volume change δv is estimated as the difference of lake inflows rainfall and streamflow and outflows streamflow evaporation and abstraction for the baseline period 1986 2000 the net volume change and water abstraction for lake ziway is comparable to lake langano and abiyata this will result in minimum closure term for lake ziway when water abstraction is considered and the vice versa for other two lakes fig 8 shows observed water levels of the three crv lakes for the period 1986 2014 with reference to the mean lake bottom depth the overall pattern with seasonal variations of water levels of lake langano and lake ziway appears to be similar but the pattern of lake abiyata shows some deviation in particular a noticeable reduction in water level is observed from 2002 to 2006 which is a dry period of the study area fig 8 that may be attributed to the cumulative effect of reduced water level of lake abiyata by reduced lake rainfall but also by the propagated effect of the reduced water level of lake ziway and lake langano also lake abiyata is relatively small 148 km2 and nearly three times smaller than lake ziway 435 km2 with surface outflow that does not exhibit a large seasonal variation ayenew and becht 2008 lake langano showed relatively small seasonal and inter annual water level variations as compared to the other lakes ayenew 2001 vilalta 2010 this phenomenon mainly can be attributed to relatively smaller irrigation water abstraction around the lake and its tributaries overall for all interconnected lakes a notable decrease of the water level after 2000 is observed very low water levels were recorded from 2002 to 2005 which coincides with climatic drought years since june 2016 the outflow of upstream lake ziway is regulated by a barrage constructed at bulbula river near lake ziway fig 9 shows result of lake level simulation for baseline period and the three development pathways findings indicate that the simulated lake levels for the three development pathways were lower than the water levels that apply to the baseline period lake ziway shows a water level decrease because of water resources development in feeding rivers as well as direct pumping from the lake we note that for respective years a maximum of up to 3 m water level decrease will occur during long term development pathway results of water level simulation of lake ziway indicate that the level will decrease below the water scarcity level in most years of the short term and long term development pathways in contrast the water level of lake langano is unlikely to decrease below the water scarcity level for all pathways but for extended period in the long term pathway but with a possible exception for drought periods that in the assessments were not considered this indicates that irrigation water abstraction from langano lake and its tributary rivers do not directly affect water availability by lake storage the projected water level fluctuations in lake abiyata follow the same pattern as simulated for lake ziway findings show that the lake level notably decreases below the water scarcity level for all development pathways including the recent development pathway for instance up to a maximum of 4 2 m water level reduction in lake abiyata as attributed to long term water resources development there is significant difference between the patterns of the natural simulated water level i e base line period and that for short term and long term development pathways of the three interconnected lakes hence the results of this study show that the influence of water resources development on the lake water levels and thus lake water balance is substantial there is large difference between the water level under the recent development and base line period the shift from recent to short term development will aggravate the reduction of the water level however simulation on the lake water level indicates the largest decrease applies to long term development pathway during this period the water levels significantly decrease below the water scarcity level for most of the time for lake ziway and abiyata this is mainly related to increasing cumulative water abstractions from the lakes and tributaries this likely would have a significant impact on shipping and fishing of lake ziway and ecology of both abiyata and ziway lakes table 9 shows volume water level and surface area relationships for each development pathway for crv lakes as expected when water resources development in the sub basin increases then water storage of the lake will decrease for instance the mean annual water level of lake ziway drops by 0 72 m for recent development which results in reduction by 21 and 7 6 of the storage volume and surface area of the lake from the baseline period respectively the long term development pathway further aggravates the decreases in the water level volume and surface area of the lake during this development the average lake water level of lake ziway decreases by 1 76 m from the natural recent condition this would result in 40 and 20 reduction of the lake volume and surface area of the lake respectively table 9 for lake langano the impact of water resources developments follows nearly similar pattern for both volume and surface area of the lake the recent development pathway indicated a 0 5 m decrease in water level which transforms to a reduction of 3 5 storage volume and 4 2 in surface area of the lake for long term development the lake water level decreases by 0 97 m this yields 7 4 reduction in surface area of the lake this transforms to 8 5 reduction in the volume of the lake for lake abiyata during recent development the mean annual water level and volume of lake abiyata decrease by 1 13 m and 11 respectively as compared to baseline period that represent the natural condition this will result in reduction of lake surface area by 9 4 table 9 the short term development causes further decrease of the water level of lake abiyata the impact of the water resource developments for the long term pathway notably will decrease the average water level by 2 1 m this will yield 27 6 reduction in lake surface area and 46 7 reduction in volume of the lake these findings indicate that any intervention in the upstream catchments results in further decrease in the water level of lake abiyata overall the impact of water resources developments from the crv lakes results in significant impact on the water level volume and surface area of the lake 6 discussions in this study in situ satellite and survey datasets were used and combined in rainfall runoff water balance crop water modeling and water resources planning models streamflow from lake ziway gauged catchments was simulated by use of a hbv conceptual rainfall runoff model the contributions of streamflow from ungauged catchments were estimated by use of area ratio methods the lake open water evaporation was estimated from the air temperature data of the eastern and western shore of the lake whereas previous studies only used one station lake area rainfall estimation used the bias corrected chirp satellite rainfall on the lake surface this study extended on previous studies on the crv lakes sub basin by considering effects of water abstractions on the water balance over the lakes and its tributaries findings of this study on lake water balance are affected by various sources of error and uncertainty each of which cannot be quantified directly by lack of sound data this study assumed that lake groundwater interaction is negligible given pronounced long term erosion and sedimentation in the lakes we assumed that fine grain lake bottom materials largely obstruct flow of water for estimation of lake evaporation the penman method was used and meteorological data from only two stations was available rainfall estimates to serve rainfall runoff modeling and to estimate lake rainfall were from bias corrected chirp satellite rainfall since runoff from ungauged catchments was related to runoff from gauged catchment though area ratio conversions this implies that errors in hbv model simulation results propagate to ungauged basins as well crop water requirements for irrigation were estimated by the cropwat model by lack of field data on crop yield or bio mass production results on water requirements could not be explicitly verified and thus results must somewhat be exercised with care time series data from twelve meteorological stations that were located close to the demand sites were used for rainfall and for potential evapotranspiration input estimation as such estimates on irrigation demands for each development pathway relied on the same meteorological data we suggest that future studies consider detailed uncertainty analysis to indicate how uncertainties affect the water balance and findings in this study on lake sustainability in table 10 findings on water balance components of crv lakes sub basins in this study are compared to findings in vallet coloumb et al 2001 ayenew 2004 legesse et al 2004 jansen et al 2007 ayenew and legesse 2007 seyoum et al 2015 desta et al 2017 goshime et al 2020 causes of differences not only relate to the methodological approach in this study but also to the selected data sources and length of the simulation periods in this study we estimated lake rainfall from bias corrected chirp satellite rainfall whereas previous studies only used observed data with limited rain gauge network coverage we also used the bias corrected chirp product to estimate lake ziway catchment streamflow discharges as time series from rain gauges were incomplete hampering water resource assessments open water evaporation estimates 832 mm3 in this study from lake ziway are lower than estimates by ayenew 2004 890 mm3 but higher than that by jansen et al 2007 774 mm3 for lake langano and abiyata estimates in this study are quite similar to estimates by ayenew 2004 and ayenew and becht 2008 467 and 372 mm3 respectively any difference may arise from the number of stations and length of the time series of the meteorological data used to estimate the lake evaporation the volume of streamflow outflow 171 mm3 for lake ziway in this study is lower than the volumes by ayenew 2004 184 mm3 and jansen et al 2007 185 mm3 but higher than vallet coulomb et al 2001 157 mm3 water abstraction from lake ziway as estimated by ayenew 2004 28 mm3 is lower than estimates in this study but match estimates in desta et al 2017 41 mm3 this is due to the difference in time period for which the abstraction was estimated and the method applied the amount of lake abiyata water abstraction estimated in this study 11 mm3 is relatively close to ayenew and legesse 2007 13 mm3 overall there is some disagreement in reported outflow and water abstraction findings by different studies for all lakes fig 10 shows annual water level change of lake ziway and that of downstream lake abiyata for the baseline period 1986 2000 the comparison illustrates a direct relationship between water level changes of both lakes for instance for 1990 a 0 5 m decrease in water level of lake ziway can be associated to a 1 8 m decrease in lake abiyata and a 3 m decrease in lake ziway water level for 2000 can be associated to a 4 5 m decrease in lake abiyata similar findings were reported in vallet coulomb et al 2001 seyoum et al 2015 for instance seyoum et al 2015 reported that approximately up to 4 5 m decrease in water level of lake abiyata was observed between 1986 and 2006 overall in this study the simulated water level decrease in the downstream lake abiyata is considerable moreover any water level decrease in lake ziway will result in larger decrease in the downstream lake abiyata the water balance of lake abiyata depends on seasonal rainfall and river inflow mainly from bulbula and horakelo rivers which are the largest inflowing river into the lake hence any intervention either from lake ziway or bulbula river contributes to changes in the water inflow and propagates to affect lake storage of lake abiyata further intensive irrigation water abstraction is on going from lake ziway and its tributaries and bulbula rivers for the production of horticulture vegetables and flowers as a result the water level of lake ziway and water flow into bulbula river is reduced by water withdrawal this phenomenon might be related to regulation of lake ziway through a recently constructed barrage that causes reduced lake outflow this consequently will result in significant water level decrease of lake abiyata in addition abiyata soda ash production could be the other possible anthropogenic cause for the water level decrease since the water withdrawal from the lake for soda ash production does not return to the lake the shore of lake abiyata has receded each year personal communication fetahi 2016 reported that lake abiyata shore receded by 3 km from its pumping station and soda ash production has reduced because of the loss of water in lake abiyata at recent time therefore this study suggests appropriate measures should be taken by decision makers and concerned stakeholders for improved water management of the crv lakes in this study water resources and water balance assessment were based on climatic data for recent time periods for assessment on future development pathways the same climate data was used and as such aspects of climate change have been ignored we consider this an omission and recommend climate change assessments to better project on available water resources therefore future studies should consider future projected climate by global and regional climate circulation models as used in various studies setegn et al 2011 haile et al 2017 bekele et al 2021 also future studies can explore approaches supported by field survey and stakeholder consultation to outline the environmental flows of the rivers the environmental flows can be estimated using various approaches such as tennant 1976 or hydrological variability based on the original flow time series and its corresponding flow duration curve fdc as a cumulative distribution function of flows following mersha et al 2021 a range of environmental management classes emc from natural to severely modified cane be used to calculate flow duration curve with a corresponding progressively reducing environmental flows resulting in a decreasing level of ecosystem protection 7 conclusions in this study impacts of water resources developments on the water balance of crv lakes and their contributing catchment were assessed three development pathways covering for recent and future water demands were considered as a benchmark to simulation results for respective pathways a baseline period with minimum of water abstractions was considered to best represent natural conditions this study is distinctive as it considers the spatial and temporal water resources developments of the sub basin using a combination of modeling approaches and since up to date datasets are used considering ground observations satellite rainfall estimates and field survey datasets the water evaluation and planning weap model was used to assess recent and future water demand and thereby to evaluate the likely impact of three water resources development pathways on the water balance of lake ziway langano and abiyata simulated streamflow resulted from the hbv model that well captured volumes of observed hydrographs for most of the gauge stations volumetric errors by rve model performance indicator in general only were small 5 crop water requirements for irrigation were estimated by cropwat model findings of this study indicate severe implications of water resources development pathways around the lake and its feeding rivers for time periods from recent to long term development pathways the water balance of the three interconnected lakes shows substantial impacts with water shortage that only further increases the weap simulation results revealed that in the long term development the water demand in the crv will be twice the present water demand under long term development pathways the water demand of the sub basin is estimated to be 222 9 mm3 compared to the recent development this will cause a decease of the mean annual lake water level by 1 76 m 0 97 m and 2 1 m for lake ziway langano and abiyata respectively this will cause reduction in the lake volumes by 615 mm3 of lake ziway 454 mm3 of lake langano and 494 mm3 of lake abiyata the largest unmet water demand occurs from november february that marks the dry season findings also indicate that the demand sites at katar meki and langano catchments have highest unmet demands for all development pathways our findings indicate that for long term and short term development the water levels of lake ziway will decrease below a water level that indicates water scarcity finding show that any reduction will propagate to the downstream lake abiyata with even further increased reduction of water storage water levels are likely to fall below the critical water level that indicates water scarcity for all development pathways mainly due to intensive upstream water abstraction and barrage outflow regulations the result also suggests that the newly constructed barrage can be used to regulate the lake level of lake ziway this study shows that to prevent further desiccation of crv lakes it will be necessary to reduce irrigation water abstractions and to adapt water resources development pathways more efficient irrigation techniques and scheduling could be considered crops could be introduced that consume less water but also improved planning and redistribution of available water resources at national scale should be considered hence we suggest future studies to assess and evaluate various water management scenarios that will reduce impacts of water withdrawal climate change and inform integrated water resources management among all stakeholders credit authorship contribution statement demelash wondimagegnehu goshime conceptualization data acquisition model set up calibration draft manuscript

8118,study region central rift valley lakes sub basin ethiopia study focus the competition for water is rapidly increasing in central rift valley lakes sub basin due to the combined effect of various water resources developments however the impacts of recent and future water resources development pathways on the water balance of the three interconnected lakes i e lake ziway langano and abiyata are unknown the water evaluation and planning weap model was used to assess the development impacts on water resources of the interconnected lakes we considered three development pathways that are recent 2009 2018 short term 2019 2028 and long term development 2029 2038 lake ziway water inflows from six catchments were estimated using the hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv rainfall runoff model crop water requirements for irrigation schemes were estimated by the cropwat model new hydrological insights for the region weap simulations show a total water demand of 102 3 mm3 under the recent development pathway that increases by 46 and 118 for short term and long term development pathways respectively this will notably affect the water balance of the interconnected lakes and cause an unmet water demand of 47 9 mm3 for the long term 2028 2038 for lake ziway and abiyata water levels will decrease substantially to cause water scarcity in the long term and developments in lake ziway will significantly affect water storage in lake abiyata storages in lake abiyata overall future developments will threaten the water resource of the interconnected lake system abbreviations

basin in ethiopia that is of interest to this study the sub basin is a preferred location for irrigation due to the short distance from major cities including the capital city of addis ababa ethiopia over recent years crv has become the focus area for large and small scale irrigation developments and other human activities that withdraw considerable amount of water from the lakes and their tributary rivers the water resources of the sub basin are used for irrigation for soda ash production fish farming and recreation and provide water to eco systems with a wide variety of endemic birds and wild animals ayenew 1998 2004 jansen et al 2007 past studies presented environmental problems of the rapidly growing use of water resources in each of the sub basin s lakes separately zinabu et al

developments by individual farmers absence of water allocation plans and mismatch between hydrological and administrative boundaries that complicates tracking of water withdrawals over the past decades changes have been observed on the behavior of the rift valley lakes and their environments lake areas for lake abiyata and lake ziway have reduced as a consequence of excessive water abstractions zinabu et al 2002 seyoum et al 2015 goshime et al 2020 but lake areas of lake beseka and lake awassa increased ayenew and legesse 2007 ayenew and gebreegziabher 2006 possibly due to increased surface runoff inflows from percolated irrigation water and land use changes respectively in the interconnected lakes of ziway abiyata and langano the level of lake ziway decreased by approximately 0 5 m between 2002 and 2007 jansen et al 2007 that caused a reduction in the discharge of bulbula river that subsequently resulted in 40 reduction in the size of lake abiyata asfaw et al 2020 indicates 4 cm water level decrease per annum and 20 4 mm3 reduction of water storage of lake ziway between 2009 and 2018 downstream connected lake abiyata and lake langano experienced smallest change as compared to other lakes in the sub basin findings of previous studies reported that the climate and land use changes conversion of the woodlands into agricultural lands and settlements areas will affect the water balance of the interconnected ziway abiyata and langano lakes legesse et al 2004 seyoum et al 2015 desta and lemma 2017 desta et al 2017 the reductions in the lake sizes can be related to use of water from the inflowing rivers and lake catchments and lake water abstractions that is aggravated intermittently by climatic and land use changes ayenew and legesse 2007 ayenew and tilahun 2008 desta et al 2017 abrhama et al 2018 seyoum et al 2015 argues that reductions in lake size can be attributed more too human activities than climate change water supply to irrigation and industrial processing purposes from these lakes is threated by future uncontrolled abstraction of water that will inevitably alter the hydrologic balance of the lakes if the human interventions are not managed then lake abiyata water level may continue to decrease that potentially leads to ecological collapse likewise to what has occurred in lake alemaya lemma 2003 alemayehu et al 2007 alemayehu

planned developments mowie 2012 and how impacts propagate in the interconnected lakes system the effect of a barrage that since 2016 regulates the outflow of lake ziway also was not investigated by past studies simulation of lake water levels of the interconnected ziway abiyata and langano sub basin requires a model that can simulate both water supply and demand in an integrated manner for such purpose the water evaluation and planning weap model https www weap21 org has been applied in various lake basins in ethiopia and kenya for instance weap was used to evaluate the likely impact of planned water resources development irrigation and water supply on lake tana water level alemayehu et al 2010 it was also used to simulate the surface water resources allocation of didessa sub basin in the abbay river basin considering future developments adgolign et al 2015 gedefaw et al 2019 applied the weap model to assess the potential impact of irrigation expansion and climate change scenario on the water resources in awash river basin of ethiopia alfarra 2010 conducted a study using the weap model to better understand alignment of water resources to identify problems on water resources and to suggest solutions for lake naivasha kenya hence the weap model was selected in this study as it allows for scenario based analyses of water demands and supplies by considering various water resources and hydrological components mccartney and girma 2012 the model also allows simulation of domestic irrigation and ecological water consumption in time and space that is required for integrated water resources assessment reference is made to https www weap21 org for wide range of applications of weap in water resources management arranz and mccartney 2007 mounir et al 2011 hassan et al 2019 the main objective of the present study is to quantify the present and future water demands and to evaluate the impact of recent and future water resources development pathways on the water balance of three interconnected lakes i e ziway langano abiyata and the effect of the constructed barrage in 2016 the study will help to quantify the spatio temporal unmet demand for irrigation water and other users in the sub basin the assessment was by integration of in situ satellite and survey datasets for state of the art modeling rainfall runoff model hbv crop water requirement model cropwat and a water resources planning model weap findings of this study provide information that may serve to improve the water resources management at local and basin scale and contribute to scientific literature on hydrological impacts by human intervention 2 study area the central rift valley crv lakes sub basin is located in the central section of the main ethiopian rift the sub basin which constitutes the interconnected ziway langano and abiyata lakes is situated between 7º10 8º30 n and 38º10 39º30 e the total drainage area of ziway langano and abiyata is 10 769 km2 elevation of the study area ranges from 4200 m a s l at the western and eastern escarpments to 1580 m a s l at the central rift valley floor fig 1 table 1 shows the key characteristics of lake ziway langano abiyata and shala ziway is the largest surface area whereas lake abiyata has the smallest surface area lake abiyata is a terminal lake and is upstream connected to lake langano and lake ziway through the horakela and bulbula rivers lake shala is the deepest lake and is separated from abiyata by a volcanic caldera rim lake shala is a closed lake and is highly alkaline that makes irrigation water abstraction from the lake impossible hence this study only considered a chain of three interconnected crv lakes lake ziway langano and abiyata lake ziway receives most of its surface runoff inflows from meki and katar rivers that drain the western and eastern plateaus respectively meki s catchment area is 2824 km2 including both gauged and ungauged areas rivers in the catchment originate in the highlands of gurage and travel about 100 km from the highlands 3600 m elevation to the lake about 1600 m elevation the meki river is supplemented by rinzaf and wijo minor tributaries before draining into lake ziway the katar river has a catchment area of 3750 km2 it drains the arsi highlands 4200 m elevation towards the western part to supply lake ziway 1636 m elevation the major tributaries that are contributing to the katar river include chuifa sagure ashebeka timala and wolkesa the catchments of meki and katar rivers cover a total of 6574 km2 the altitude of lake ziway is higher than that of abiyata by 56 m hence it supplies water to abiyata lake ziway has an outﬂow through bulbula river that in turn flows to the downstream lake abiyata being a terminal lake the tributaries of lake langano are gedemso huluka lepis and boku rivers that cover a total drainage area of 2006 km2 since lake langano is 4 m higher in elevation than lake abiyata it feeds lake abiyata via the horakelo river lake ziway and langano are open lakes with overflow i e drainage to lake abiyata whereas lake abiyata and shala are closed lakes without any surface water outflow the climate of the study area is characterized by semi arid to sub humid climatic condition we analysed the climate of the sub basin of the interconnected ziway langano and abiyata lakes using data collected from the national meteorology agency nma for the period from 1986 to 2018 the inter annual and seasonal variability of temperature over the study are relatively constant with mean annual maximum temperature ranging from 23 6 to 26 3 and minimum temperature ranging from 9 3 to 11 9 with long term annual average of 17 5 the mean annual rainfall over the sub basin varies from 514 to 1086 mm with long term average of 882 mm as estimated for the period 1986 2018 the highest rainfall mostly occurs during the rainy season july september the potential evapotranspiration based on penman monteith varies between approximately 1330 1502 mm with long term average of 1480 mm the inter annual variation of the potential evapotranspiration is much less than the inter annual variation in rainfall the water system of central rift valley lakes is preferred by various water sectors for irrigation domestic and industrial activities the major land uses in the basin include intensive and moderately cultivated lands with onion tomato maize cabbage green beans and pepper as the dominant irrigated crops grown in the study area 3 data availability in this study hydro meteorological time series water demand and water supply data were used the hydro meteorological dataset includes streamflow satellite and gauge rainfall and climate data required for estimation of evaporation and evapotranspiration daily satellite and gauge rainfall datasets were obtained from climate hazard group chg and national meteorology agency nma respectively daily rainfall data 1984 2018 were obtained from 20 stations in lake ziway catchment and 6 stations in abiyata and langano catchments after data screening 20 stations out of 26 were used in this study for further use six 6 stations were excluded because of too short observation period and or substantial missing data records the rain gauge observations were used to serve bias correction of the climate hazard infrared precipitation chirp satellite rainfall estimates that are available at daily time step and 5 5 km 5 5 km spatial resolution for the period 1984 2018 see goshime et al 2019a streamflow and lake water level data were obtained from the ethiopian ministry of water irrigation and energy mowie streamflow data was collected for stations in major rivers meki katar bulbula horakelo and gedemso and minor tributaries rinzaf chuifa sagure timala huluka lepis and boku the collected data was available for the period 1984 2010 lake water level data ziway langano and abiyata were obtained from mowie for the period 1986 2014 streamflow and lake water level data were used as a reference to calibrate and evaluate the hydrological and lake water balance models respectively data on irrigation sites were collected by a field survey and consultation of governmental organizations a field survey was undertaken from 16 to 21 september 2019 for lake ziway contributing catchments i e meki and katar bulbula river langano and abiyata lakes the survey includes identification of the location of demand sites type of scheme water sources potential irrigated area crop type cropping pattern and intensity the survey data was used to estimate site specific crop water requirements in the study area section 4 2 1 additionally irrigation data was obtained from water and agricultural offices from the basin master plan and extracted from water planning documents of the study area for lake ziway the water abstraction survey data of goshime et al 2019b 2021 were used in this study to estimate water demand from the lake data was collected during the period 20th of october to 5th of november 2018 base data on population sizes domestic and industrial water demands were extracted for the year 2007 as the provided by the central statistical agency of ethiopia csa and water supply from the water supply authorities by absence of a more recent report respective data for the base year 2007 were adopted the digital elevation model dem of aster gdem v2 with a spatial resolution of 30 m 30 m was used to delineate the sub basin and to extract its drainage network the land use land cover lulc map was obtained from mowie of ethiopia for the year 1996 we note that lulc of the sub basin is characterized by intensive cultivation land water bodies and wetlands and shrub lands for all the three lakes a bathymetric survey was conducted in 1984 however an additional survey was conducted for lake ziway in 2013 and hence was used in this study bathymetric maps were provided by mowie 4 methods in this study the impacts of recent and future water development pathways were evaluated using the weap model inputs to the weap model were obtained from multiple sources including simulated streamflow simulated crop water requirements satellite products a field survey the basin master plan and design documents the hbv rainfall runoff model was used to simulate lake water inflow by streamflow to lake ziway simulations 1984 2018 were for 6 river gauge stations at major and minor tributaries the irrigation water demand was estimated using a water abstraction survey cropwat model simulations and a literature survey this study assumes that the climate of the recent development pathway will not change so to isolate aspects that potentially could relate to climate change impacts for future pathways finally we evaluated the impacts of the development pathways on water availability in the rivers and on volume water level and surface areas of the three interconnected lakes i e lakes ziway lake langano and lake abiyata 4 1 model calibration and simulation the available streamflow datasets covered a short observation period with substantial missing records to overcome this limitation the hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv rainfall runoff model bergström 1997 was used to fill observation gaps and to prepare long streamflow time series for application the model was calibrated and validated for respective gauges the main inputs to the model include rainfall potential evapotranspiration pet land use land cover and a digital elevation model dem meteorological observations at 12 stations fig 1 were used to estimate pet using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 that were subsequently used as input to the hbv model the 1996 land cover map that was obtained from mowie also served as hbv input in this study eight parameters alfa beta cflux fc lp k4 khq and perc were selected for calibration following previous studies in the study area goshime et al 2019a goshime et al 2020 for detailed descriptions about the hbv model reference is made to lindström et al 1997 rientjes et al 2011 johansson 2013 to warm calibrate and validate the model time periods 1984 1985 1986 1991 and 1996 2000 were selected respectively at 6 six gauge stations in lake ziway sub basin long term streamflow time series 1986 2018 were prepared using the bias corrected chirp rainfall data as input for bias correction a non linear power method was selected and rain gauge data served as a reference at daily time step with the parameters varying for each of the 12 months of a year for a detailed description on bias correction for this study reference is made to goshime et al 2019a the bias corrected chirp satellite rainfall estimates were used to estimate lake area rainfall and to simulate lake ziway inflow by means of the hbv model the streamflow from the ungauged part of the study area was estimated using a simple regionalization method based on the area ratio method where streamflow from the gauged area is rescaled for the ungauged part of the catchment the performance of the hbv model for available streamflow time series was first evaluated by visual inspection of the match between the simulated and observed hydrographs next the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse relative volumetric error rve and coefficient of determination r2 were used to evaluate the model performance nse is a performance indicator that measures the relative magnitude of the residual variance of the simulated flow compared to the observed flow it indicates how well the pattern of the simulated hydrograph fits that of the observed hydrograph nash and sutcliffe 1970 rve measures the average tendency of the simulated streamflow volume to be larger or smaller than the observed counterparts gupta et al 1999 the coefficient of determination r2 is the measure of the fraction of the variation in the observed streamflow data that is replicated in the simulated streamflow data moriasi et al 2007 table 2 provides the equations for the three objective functions with additional descriptions 4 2 water demand assessment 4 2 1 irrigation demand in this study irrigation water demand was estimated using a combination of water abstraction survey and the crop water requirement model cropwat 8 0 fao 2018 of food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao cropwat estimates the water requirements of the crop cwr using climate soil and crop phenological data its inputs include reference evapotranspiration rainfall soil crop type and crop pattern twelve 12 meteorological stations that are located close to the demand sites were used to estimate reference evapotranspiration using penman monteith equation which is considered a standard method allen et al 1998 and to specify daily rainfall at each demand site during the field survey it appeared that the main irrigated crops of the study area include onion tomato maize cabbage green beans pepper alfalfa and grapes crop planting and harvesting dates irrigation scheduling and irrigated area of each crop were also obtained from the survey managers and irrigators were interviewed to collect the basic information as well as information on their respective development pathways crop characteristics growth stage and soil characteristic data on soil moisture storage and depletion were obtained from fao 56 irrigation and drainage paper the basin master plan and irrigation project design documents 4 2 2 domestic water demand the latest population and housing census of ethiopia was conducted in 2007 therefore 2007 was defined as the base year for the weap simulation the 2007 census showed that the population of ziway and bulbula towns was 43 660 and 5000 respectively central statistical agency of ethiopia csa in 2007 the water supply authorities of the two towns were distributing 3450 and 430 m3 d 1 of water for ziway and bulbula towns respectively and hence this was used in the weap model simulations for the recent account or base year for future developments the domestic water demand was extrapolated using population size geometric population growth rate 2 9 and water use liter per capita per day data to estimate the domestic water demand the water use rates were multiplied by the population size 4 2 3 industrial water demand demands for industrial uses only apply to lake abiyata whereas a soda ash factory abstracts water from the lake since 1985 in 2007 it was reported that 15 000 ton of soda ash was produced that was used for the recent account in weap simulations according to the rift valley lakes basin master plan the factory produces 25 000 tons of soda ash per year 2009 2018 with a water requirement of 150 m3 per ton of production for the recent development pathway an increment of 25 000 ton for future development pathways from the 2007 reference year was used to construct the future production capacity as per the rift valley lake basin master plan report mowie 2012 and design documents 4 2 4 environmental flow requirement the environmental flow is the water that serves the river ecosystem to maintain the downstream ecological balance in this study requirements on environmental flows were not available and thus allowance only made for main rivers requirements were simply expressed as a percentage of the mean annual flow following tennant 1976 was reported to use approximate 15 20 of mean annual flow as downstream water requirement hence the environmental flow is specified as 20 of the mean annual flow in this study environmental flow requirements were specified downstream of bulbula river to regulate lake ziway and to attribute to downstream flow to lake abiyata see also shumet and mengistu 2016 4 3 water evaluation and planning weap model the weap model was developed by stockholm environment institute at boston usa to evaluate water demands associated priorities and water supply for recent and future periods the model allows specifying alternative scenarios i e plausible futures based on what if questions to assess the impact of different development and management options it optimizes water use in the catchment with the objective to maximize the water delivered to demand sites according to a set of user defined priorities yates et al 2005 the demand sites are assigned a priority between 1 and 99 where 1 is assigned for the highest priority and 99 is for the lowest priority some of the input data of weap were water supply river head streamflow water use demand water levels elevation storage area relationship and the spatial location of the water system for a more detailed description about weap model reference is made to yates et al 2005 sei 2015 fig 2 shows the schematization of the crv lakes sub basin based on recent and planned water demand and supply sources in the schematization the type of scheme the supply sources and the location of the demand sites were considered the demand priority was assigned considering the recent pathway in which the upstream demand sites receive priority hence the first priority was assigned to the most upstream demand sites the next priority was assigned to the next downstream demand sites and so on i e priority was varied from upstream to downstream accordingly highest priority 1 was assigned for demand sites that receive water from timala chuifa dugda rinzaf boku huluka gedemso and lepis rivers priority 2 was assigned to demand sites that receive water from meki sagure bulbula and horekelo rivers the demand sites along the katar river were assigned priority 3 demand sites withdrawing water from lake ziway and langano were assigned equal priority of 98 lowest priority 99 was assigned for lake abiyata but with priority 1 for environmental flow demands 4 4 effect of barrage regulation the barrage regulator at the outlet of lake ziway at bulbula river may reduce lake ziway outflow affecting the storage of the downstream lake abiyata hence the barrage should be operated not only to regulate the lake storage but also to fulfill the irrigation water demand along the bulbula river as well as environmental flow requirements efr lake ziway receives water from river streamflows and from lake rainfall and loses water through abstraction evaporation and outflow to simulate changes in the lake level two regression relationships between observed water level and outflow time series were developed the first relation was developed for the period january 2009 may 2016 and the second relation was developed for the period june 2016 2019 which covers the period the barrage is in operation the outflow discharge time series that were simulated for respective periods were subsequently used in weap model for recent development pathway for the future development pathways the second relationship between observed water level and river outflow discharge was specified in weap in the form of mathematical equation similarly the recent and future outflow from langano was specified using the observed langano water level and horakelo outflow discharge 4 5 water resources development pathways in this study three development pathways are considered these pathways include recent development 2009 2018 short term development 2019 2028 and long term development 2029 2038 the development pathways were constructed based on the information from rift valley lakes basin master plan mowie 2012 feasibility studies design documents and consultation of stakeholders during the field survey the data or information source that reflects the current stage of the development pathways was selected to extract the information for weap modeling for this study as a reference to change assessments by respective pathways a base year 2007 was specified using the water abstraction in 2007 jansen et al 2007 for which detailed water abstraction survey data was prepared for the crv basin master plan and the national population and housing census was conducted table 3 shows the summary and descriptions for base year and for each water resources development pathway 4 6 impact of water resources developments after determining the water demand for all development pathways weap was used to simulate the water level of the lakes for this the monthly water balance of the three lakes was estimated for a base line period of 15 years 1986 2000 the period served as a baseline for comparison of changes by each development pathway this period was selected because it best represents the undisturbed water level regime with minimum water withdrawal from the lakes and tributaries furthermore it represents the period before construction of outflow regulator at bulbula river also goshime et al 2020 indicated significant water abstraction from lake ziway for the period 2001 2014 for the 2016 2018 period of the recent development pathway and the entire period of the short term and long term development pathways the regulatory barrage was set to provide flows to the bulbula river so that environmental flow requirements efr are met at downstream lake abiyata then the impact of the three development pathways was evaluated by comparing the weap simulations for these pathways against the simulations for the baseline period 1986 2000 furthermore water scarcity threshold levels for all three lakes were established based on a basin master plan document mowie 2012 the water scarcity level represents a minimum water level to sustain the fish habitat and their food chain hence irrigation water abstraction should be ceased before the water level drops below this level 5 results and discussion 5 1 streamflow simulation fig 3 shows a comparison of the simulated and observed streamflow hydrographs for the calibration period 1986 1991 at meki and rinzaf gauging stations that indicate river flows to the lake from the western side the model fairly captured the pattern of the observed hydrograph including recession and rising limbs of both catchments however it did not satisfactorily capture most of the observed peak flows especially for rinzaf gauge station the agreement between the simulated and observed streamflow was better for meki than rinzaf river catchment the latter has relatively small size that resulted in high streamflow variability and relatively high peaks streamflow was observed two times per day and thus limits to provide representative data on streamflow volume for the small catchments another cause of mismatch could be the stage discharge relations that often are inaccurate to convert high water level measurements into representative discharges fig 4 shows the simulated and observed streamflow for the calibration period 1986 1991 at katar chuifa sagure and timala gauge stations that drain into lake ziway from the eastern plateaus hbv well captured the overall pattern of the observed hydrograph for most of the gauge stations however the rising limb and related peaks of the observed hydrograph were not satisfactorily captured the model better captured the observed flow for the katar catchment that has highest streamflow discharges however some observed peaks were not satisfactorily simulated for smaller tributaries for instance at sagure and chuifa river gauge stations table 4 presents the calibrated values of the model parameters and objectives functions the calibrated values of alfa k4 and cflux do not significantly vary across the catchments the recession parameter k4 influences the recession part of the base flow of the hydrographs alfa is used to simulate rapid responses of the shallow subsurface and affects the peak discharges the parameters fc beta khq and lp show differences across the catchments table 4 this typically suggests hydrologic variability between catchments in terms of rapid streamflow responses but also evapotranspiration fluxes a higher khq results in higher peaks and more dynamic responses in the hydrograph perc values were calibrated so that dry season flows of the catchments were well represented by the model the hbv model performed satisfactory for most of the catchments for the calibration period performance measures indicate that the model performed better for meki and katar catchments nse 0 7 rve 5 and r2 0 7 than for smaller catchments for the minor tributary of rinzaf the nse is lower than 0 5 for both calibration and validation period considering poor data quality the model performance is acceptable for studying streamflow volume although caution should be exercised when the interest is in capturing the hydrograph shape when evaluated for the validation period the model performance deteriorated for most catchments but with noticeable magnitude especially for small catchments such as rinzaf and timala for instance the negative value of the rve 14 3 indicates that the mean simulated streamflow discharge is smaller than the mean observed discharge however these rve values can also indicate deterioration of the quality of observed streamflow data for these two stations the calibration was targeted more on rve than nse since the main target of this study related to inflow and outflow water volumes to respective lakes 5 2 water demand and development pathways there is an on going and planned water abstraction across all catchments of the crv sub basin fig 5 although the abstraction sites are mostly concentrated around lake ziway irrigation demands were from both smallholder and large irrigation schemes water abstraction is commonly through pumping directly from lake ziway in the three districts adami tulu dugda and ziway dugda and along the bulbula river however there are some diversions that pump water from meki katar and bulbula rivers the canal diversions are situated mostly at katar meki and langano tributary rivers particularly the canal diversions are very dense along the most downstream stretch of meki river for the base year 2007 the surface water system of crv sub basin supplied water to a total irrigated area of 5534 ha katar meki and bulbula rivers provided water for large irrigated lands in the sub basin table 5 a large irrigated area with intensive smallholder irrigated farmers flower farms and modern irrigation schemes rely on abstractions from lake ziway compared to the base year 2007 the irrigated areas increased by 36 57 and 71 for the recent short term and long term development pathways respectively irrigation is the largest water user in the study area in addition water is used for soda ash domestic and environmental flow at bulbula river for downstream lake abiyata the domestic water demand and environmental flow remains almost nearly the same for the three development pathways fig 6 shows the summary of annual water abstraction from the main water sources in the entire crv sub basin for the base year 2007 the figure indicates that lake ziway has largest water abstraction accounting for 39 of water withdrawal from the main surface water sources water withdrawal was the second largest for katar and bulbula rivers whereas the withdrawal from lake langano is the smallest the summary of total annual water demand supply and unmet demand for the three development pathways is presented in table 6 findings indicate that the annual water demand for the short term development pathway 2019 2028 is 149 4 mm3 that corresponds to 46 increase as compared to the demand under recent development 102 3 mm3 if all the planned long term water resources developments will be fully implemented the annual water demand will amount to 223 mm3 and signifies an increase by a factor of 2 2 as compared to the recent development this is mainly because of the increase in the projected irrigated area during this period the annual water supply does not match the demand for all the development pathways table 6 also indicates that unmet demand will increase to 47 9mm3 in the long term development table 7 presents the water demand supply delivered and unmet demand across the watersheds for the three development pathways the water demand of water users from the lakes lake ziway langano and abiyata was fully met for all development pathways as expected since there is no limit to water abstraction from the lakes this indicates that water abstraction from the lake system is uncontrolled the unmet demand was larger for long term development for all demand sites the largest unmet demand was estimated for demand sites in katar and catchments draining to langano and meki catchment even though the highest priority was assigned to the most upstream demand sites larger unmet demands were estimated at upstream demand sites than downstream the largest unmet water demand 28 mm3 per annum for long term development table 7 is in katar watershed that is mainly due to large irrigated areas in katar watersheds the percentage of unmet demand was also higher for demand sites with largest water demand for long term development a highest unmet demand of 50 was obtained for katar irrigation schemes 45 for langano tributary and 32 for meki irrigation schemes table 7 overall this study indicates that there is unmet demand across all lake catchments however the unmet demand along bulbula river is not large considering the extent of irrigation abstraction from this river this may alter subject to the regulation of the barrage fig 7 presents the summary of monthly unmet demands for the three development pathways the result indicates that the demand for all development pathways will be fully met for three months of the rainy season july september the unmet demand for november to february is noticeable mainly since this period is the driest season the unmet demand in the small rainy season march may is relatively small compared to the dry season the total annual unmet demand under the recent development was about 15 8 mm3 which accounts for 15 of the total water demand this amount increases by a factor of 1 85 i e 29 2 mm3 for the short term development at the end of the long term development pathway the annual unmet water demand will increase by a factor of 3 0 47 9 mm3 as compared to the recent development 5 3 impact of water resources development for accurate estimation of water resources development it is crucial to determine respective water balance components estimates of annual water balance components for the recent development pathway 1986 2000 for the three interconnected lakes are shown in table 8 estimates are comparable to estimates shown in the various studies vallet coulomb et al 2001 ayenew 2004 legesse and ayenew 2006 desta et al 2017 findings indicate that lake evaporation is the largest component of the water balance for all lakes whereas surface outflow is the smallest component note that the amount of water abstraction was estimated from the recent 2018 water abstraction survey being the field survey period the amount of water abstraction from lake ziway was significantly larger than the abstraction from lake langano and abiyata in table 8 the net volume change δv is estimated as the difference of lake inflows rainfall and streamflow and outflows streamflow evaporation and abstraction for the baseline period 1986 2000 the net volume change and water abstraction for lake ziway is comparable to lake langano and abiyata this will result in minimum closure term for lake ziway when water abstraction is considered and the vice versa for other two lakes fig 8 shows observed water levels of the three crv lakes for the period 1986 2014 with reference to the mean lake bottom depth the overall pattern with seasonal variations of water levels of lake langano and lake ziway appears to be similar but the pattern of lake abiyata shows some deviation in particular a noticeable reduction in water level is observed from 2002 to 2006 which is a dry period of the study area fig 8 that may be attributed to the cumulative effect of reduced water level of lake abiyata by reduced lake rainfall but also by the propagated effect of the reduced water level of lake ziway and lake langano also lake abiyata is relatively small 148 km2 and nearly three times smaller than lake ziway 435 km2 with surface outflow that does not exhibit a large seasonal variation ayenew and becht 2008 lake langano showed relatively small seasonal and inter annual water level variations as compared to the other lakes ayenew 2001 vilalta 2010 this phenomenon mainly can be attributed to relatively smaller irrigation water abstraction around the lake and its tributaries overall for all interconnected lakes a notable decrease of the water level after 2000 is observed very low water levels were recorded from 2002 to 2005 which coincides with climatic drought years since june 2016 the outflow of upstream lake ziway is regulated by a barrage constructed at bulbula river near lake ziway fig 9 shows result of lake level simulation for baseline period and the three development pathways findings indicate that the simulated lake levels for the three development pathways were lower than the water levels that apply to the baseline period lake ziway shows a water level decrease because of water resources development in feeding rivers as well as direct pumping from the lake we note that for respective years a maximum of up to 3 m water level decrease will occur during long term development pathway results of water level simulation of lake ziway indicate that the level will decrease below the water scarcity level in most years of the short term and long term development pathways in contrast the water level of lake langano is unlikely to decrease below the water scarcity level for all pathways but for extended period in the long term pathway but with a possible exception for drought periods that in the assessments were not considered this indicates that irrigation water abstraction from langano lake and its tributary rivers do not directly affect water availability by lake storage the projected water level fluctuations in lake abiyata follow the same pattern as simulated for lake ziway findings show that the lake level notably decreases below the water scarcity level for all development pathways including the recent development pathway for instance up to a maximum of 4 2 m water level reduction in lake abiyata as attributed to long term water resources development there is significant difference between the patterns of the natural simulated water level i e base line period and that for short term and long term development pathways of the three interconnected lakes hence the results of this study show that the influence of water resources development on the lake water levels and thus lake water balance is substantial there is large difference between the water level under the recent development and base line period the shift from recent to short term development will aggravate the reduction of the water level however simulation on the lake water level indicates the largest decrease applies to long term development pathway during this period the water levels significantly decrease below the water scarcity level for most of the time for lake ziway and abiyata this is mainly related to increasing cumulative water abstractions from the lakes and tributaries this likely would have a significant impact on shipping and fishing of lake ziway and ecology of both abiyata and ziway lakes table 9 shows volume water level and surface area relationships for each development pathway for crv lakes as expected when water resources development in the sub basin increases then water storage of the lake will decrease for instance the mean annual water level of lake ziway drops by 0 72 m for recent development which results in reduction by 21 and 7 6 of the storage volume and surface area of the lake from the baseline period respectively the long term development pathway further aggravates the decreases in the water level volume and surface area of the lake during this development the average lake water level of lake ziway decreases by 1 76 m from the natural recent condition this would result in 40 and 20 reduction of the lake volume and surface area of the lake respectively table 9 for lake langano the impact of water resources developments follows nearly similar pattern for both volume and surface area of the lake the recent development pathway indicated a 0 5 m decrease in water level which transforms to a reduction of 3 5 storage volume and 4 2 in surface area of the lake for long term development the lake water level decreases by 0 97 m this yields 7 4 reduction in surface area of the lake this transforms to 8 5 reduction in the volume of the lake for lake abiyata during recent development the mean annual water level and volume of lake abiyata decrease by 1 13 m and 11 respectively as compared to baseline period that represent the natural condition this will result in reduction of lake surface area by 9 4 table 9 the short term development causes further decrease of the water level of lake abiyata the impact of the water resource developments for the long term pathway notably will decrease the average water level by 2 1 m this will yield 27 6 reduction in lake surface area and 46 7 reduction in volume of the lake these findings indicate that any intervention in the upstream catchments results in further decrease in the water level of lake abiyata overall the impact of water resources developments from the crv lakes results in significant impact on the water level volume and surface area of the lake 6 discussions in this study in situ satellite and survey datasets were used and combined in rainfall runoff water balance crop water modeling and water resources planning models streamflow from lake ziway gauged catchments was simulated by use of a hbv conceptual rainfall runoff model the contributions of streamflow from ungauged catchments were estimated by use of area ratio methods the lake open water evaporation was estimated from the air temperature data of the eastern and western shore of the lake whereas previous studies only used one station lake area rainfall estimation used the bias corrected chirp satellite rainfall on the lake surface this study extended on previous studies on the crv lakes sub basin by considering effects of water abstractions on the water balance over the lakes and its tributaries findings of this study on lake water balance are affected by various sources of error and uncertainty each of which cannot be quantified directly by lack of sound data this study assumed that lake groundwater interaction is negligible given pronounced long term erosion and sedimentation in the lakes we assumed that fine grain lake bottom materials largely obstruct flow of water for estimation of lake evaporation the penman method was used and meteorological data from only two stations was available rainfall estimates to serve rainfall runoff modeling and to estimate lake rainfall were from bias corrected chirp satellite rainfall since runoff from ungauged catchments was related to runoff from gauged catchment though area ratio conversions this implies that errors in hbv model simulation results propagate to ungauged basins as well crop water requirements for irrigation were estimated by the cropwat model by lack of field data on crop yield or bio mass production results on water requirements could not be explicitly verified and thus results must somewhat be exercised with care time series data from twelve meteorological stations that were located close to the demand sites were used for rainfall and for potential evapotranspiration input estimation as such estimates on irrigation demands for each development pathway relied on the same meteorological data we suggest that future studies consider detailed uncertainty analysis to indicate how uncertainties affect the water balance and findings in this study on lake sustainability in table 10 findings on water balance components of crv lakes sub basins in this study are compared to findings in vallet coloumb et al 2001 ayenew 2004 legesse et al 2004 jansen et al 2007 ayenew and legesse 2007 seyoum et al 2015 desta et al 2017 goshime et al 2020 causes of differences not only relate to the methodological approach in this study but also to the selected data sources and length of the simulation periods in this study we estimated lake rainfall from bias corrected chirp satellite rainfall whereas previous studies only used observed data with limited rain gauge network coverage we also used the bias corrected chirp product to estimate lake ziway catchment streamflow discharges as time series from rain gauges were incomplete hampering water resource assessments open water evaporation estimates 832 mm3 in this study from lake ziway are lower than estimates by ayenew 2004 890 mm3 but higher than that by jansen et al 2007 774 mm3 for lake langano and abiyata estimates in this study are quite similar to estimates by ayenew 2004 and ayenew and becht 2008 467 and 372 mm3 respectively any difference may arise from the number of stations and length of the time series of the meteorological data used to estimate the lake evaporation the volume of streamflow outflow 171 mm3 for lake ziway in this study is lower than the volumes by ayenew 2004 184 mm3 and jansen et al 2007 185 mm3 but higher than vallet coulomb et al 2001 157 mm3 water abstraction from lake ziway as estimated by ayenew 2004 28 mm3 is lower than estimates in this study but match estimates in desta et al 2017 41 mm3 this is due to the difference in time period for which the abstraction was estimated and the method applied the amount of lake abiyata water abstraction estimated in this study 11 mm3 is relatively close to ayenew and legesse 2007 13 mm3 overall there is some disagreement in reported outflow and water abstraction findings by different studies for all lakes fig 10 shows annual water level change of lake ziway and that of downstream lake abiyata for the baseline period 1986 2000 the comparison illustrates a direct relationship between water level changes of both lakes for instance for 1990 a 0 5 m decrease in water level of lake ziway can be associated to a 1 8 m decrease in lake abiyata and a 3 m decrease in lake ziway water level for 2000 can be associated to a 4 5 m decrease in lake abiyata similar findings were reported in vallet coulomb et al 2001 seyoum et al 2015 for instance seyoum et al 2015 reported that approximately up to 4 5 m decrease in water level of lake abiyata was observed between 1986 and 2006 overall in this study the simulated water level decrease in the downstream lake abiyata is considerable moreover any water level decrease in lake ziway will result in larger decrease in the downstream lake abiyata the water balance of lake abiyata depends on seasonal rainfall and river inflow mainly from bulbula and horakelo rivers which are the largest inflowing river into the lake hence any intervention either from lake ziway or bulbula river contributes to changes in the water inflow and propagates to affect lake storage of lake abiyata further intensive irrigation water abstraction is on going from lake ziway and its tributaries and bulbula rivers for the production of horticulture vegetables and flowers as a result the water level of lake ziway and water flow into bulbula river is reduced by water withdrawal this phenomenon might be related to regulation of lake ziway through a recently constructed barrage that causes reduced lake outflow this consequently will result in significant water level decrease of lake abiyata in addition abiyata soda ash production could be the other possible anthropogenic cause for the water level decrease since the water withdrawal from the lake for soda ash production does not return to the lake the shore of lake abiyata has receded each year personal communication fetahi 2016 reported that lake abiyata shore receded by 3 km from its pumping station and soda ash production has reduced because of the loss of water in lake abiyata at recent time therefore this study suggests appropriate measures should be taken by decision makers and concerned stakeholders for improved water management of the crv lakes in this study water resources and water balance assessment were based on climatic data for recent time periods for assessment on future development pathways the same climate data was used and as such aspects of climate change have been ignored we consider this an omission and recommend climate change assessments to better project on available water resources therefore future studies should consider future projected climate by global and regional climate circulation models as used in various studies setegn et al 2011 haile et al 2017 bekele et al 2021 also future studies can explore approaches supported by field survey and stakeholder consultation to outline the environmental flows of the rivers the environmental flows can be estimated using various approaches such as tennant 1976 or hydrological variability based on the original flow time series and its corresponding flow duration curve fdc as a cumulative distribution function of flows following mersha et al 2021 a range of environmental management classes emc from natural to severely modified cane be used to calculate flow duration curve with a corresponding progressively reducing environmental flows resulting in a decreasing level of ecosystem protection 7 conclusions in this study impacts of water resources developments on the water balance of crv lakes and their contributing catchment were assessed three development pathways covering for recent and future water demands were considered as a benchmark to simulation results for respective pathways a baseline period with minimum of water abstractions was considered to best represent natural conditions this study is distinctive as it considers the spatial and temporal water resources developments of the sub basin using a combination of modeling approaches and since up to date datasets are used considering ground observations satellite rainfall estimates and field survey datasets the water evaluation and planning weap model was used to assess recent and future water demand and thereby to evaluate the likely impact of three water resources development pathways on the water balance of lake ziway langano and abiyata simulated streamflow resulted from the hbv model that well captured volumes of observed hydrographs for most of the gauge stations volumetric errors by rve model performance indicator in general only were small 5 crop water requirements for irrigation were estimated by cropwat model findings of this study indicate severe implications of water resources development pathways around the lake and its feeding rivers for time periods from recent to long term development pathways the water balance of the three interconnected lakes shows substantial impacts with water shortage that only further increases the weap simulation results revealed that in the long term development the water demand in the crv will be twice the present water demand under long term development pathways the water demand of the sub basin is estimated to be 222 9 mm3 compared to the recent development this will cause a decease of the mean annual lake water level by 1 76 m 0 97 m and 2 1 m for lake ziway langano and abiyata respectively this will cause reduction in the lake volumes by 615 mm3 of lake ziway 454 mm3 of lake langano and 494 mm3 of lake abiyata the largest unmet water demand occurs from november february that marks the dry season findings also indicate that the demand sites at katar meki and langano catchments have highest unmet demands for all development pathways our findings indicate that for long term and short term development the water levels of lake ziway will decrease below a water level that indicates water scarcity finding show that any reduction will propagate to the downstream lake abiyata with even further increased reduction of water storage water levels are likely to fall below the critical water level that indicates water scarcity for all development pathways mainly due to intensive upstream water abstraction and barrage outflow regulations the result also suggests that the newly constructed barrage can be used to regulate the lake level of lake ziway this study shows that to prevent further desiccation of crv lakes it will be necessary to reduce irrigation water abstractions and to adapt water resources development pathways more efficient irrigation techniques and scheduling could be considered crops could be introduced that consume less water but also improved planning and redistribution of available water resources at national scale should be considered hence we suggest future studies to assess and evaluate various water management scenarios that will reduce impacts of water withdrawal climate change and inform integrated water

8119,study region são paulo state brazil study focus compound events such as droughts and heat waves may have severe impacts on human activities traditionally they are characterized considering a univariate perspective however this approach may not be the most adequate to characterize such hazards as they often result from a combination of variables interacting in space and time alternatively several studies adopt the multivariate frequency analysis as it allows the consideration of concurrent drivers and their dependencies nevertheless few of them evaluated this methodology in a climate change context in view of this this study aims to compare the uni and multivariate approaches to characterize extreme drought events considering both historical and future scenarios using the severe water crisis experienced in the southeast region of brazil in 2014 2015 as a study case new hydrological insights for the region the univariate approach can substantially underestimate the risk associated with extreme events for future scenarios differences between the two methodologies reached 90 of the estimated return period significant increasing trends were found only for temperature both approaches indicated that drought events will be more common and intense in the future however the univariate framework may misspecificate the associated risks as it not account for the expected warming condition that may trigger or exacerbate extreme drought events keywords meteorological droughts multivariate frequency analysis global warming compound extreme events 1 introduction hydrological extreme events have received special attention in recent decades due to their increasing impacts in a climate change context hao et al 2018 despite several scientific advances to characterize them understanding their mechanisms considering a global warming scenario where extreme events may happen at increasing rates is still a challenge trenberth et al 2015 vaghefi et al 2019 among various climate extreme events droughts are by far the most complex and costly natural disaster representing the main natural cause of socioeconomic and environmental damage across the globe hao et al 2014 pendergrass et al 2020 pulwarty and sivakumar 2014 vicente serrano et al 2014 to avoid their potential consequences a reliable characterization process is required to provide substantial knowledge for improving risk assessment and decision making conventionally drought events are characterized considering one single and representative variable in a univariate framework e g precipitation anomalies through the standardized precipitation index spi to characterize meteorological droughts aghakouchak et al 2014 coelho et al 2016a mesbahzadeh et al 2020 sheffield and wood 2008 however drought events may be triggered or exacerbated by a combination of concurrent variables interacting in space and time such as precipitation anomaly and high temperature as observed in several recent events aghakouchak et al 2014 therefore to improve drought analysis it is important to consider its multivariate characteristic assessing all important variables involved in the process leonard et al 2014 mesbahzadeh et al 2020 salvadori and de michele 2004 serinaldi 2016 several studies have applied multivariate frequency analysis such as copula functions to overcome limitations in the characterization of extreme drought events aghakouchak et al 2014 fischer and knutti 2013 gräler et al 2013 masud et al 2015 serinaldi 2016 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 this approach provides a great potential to characterize compound events as it allows risk assessment of different variables considering their dependence structure however in these studies little attention has been paid to the characterization of extreme events considering future scenarios mechler and bouwer 2015 droughts may intensify in the future in many regions of the world as a consequence of increasing atmospheric evaporative demand caused by the increase in global temperatures pendergrass et al 2020 vicente serrano et al 2014 wang et al 2012 compound intensification in both precipitation deficit and temperature extremes may exacerbate their impacts furthermore two non extreme conditions combined may result in an extreme condition with significant impacts aghakouchak et al 2014 leonard et al 2014 in this context an accurate characterization of droughts considering future scenarios in a multivariate framework may help risk assessment practices and prevent future damage melo and wendland 2017 mesbahzadeh et al 2020 in the present study we evaluated two different approaches uni and multivariate to risk assessment of extreme droughts events considering both historical and future conditions using temperature and precipitation data we characterized the severe water crisis experienced in são paulo state located in the southeast region of brazil between 2014 and 2015 marengo et al 2018 nobre et al 2016 which impacted about 11 million people in brazil s most populated region coelho et al 2016b getirana 2016 melo and wendland 2016 nobre et al 2016 by using this extreme drought event as a study case we aimed i to identify the influence of the joint occurrence of precipitation temperature extremes on the characterization of drought events and ii to evaluate relative changes in future droughts compared with the historical period considering both uni and multivariate frameworks given the multivariate characteristic of droughts we argue that the copula approach can improve the understanding of these events helping decision makers to optimize drought management practices considering that drought impacts may be exacerbated by an intensification in temperature vicente serrano et al 2014 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and the 2014 2015 drought the study focuses on the most populated state of brazil são paulo located between 26 19ºs and 54 46ºw the region is characterized by a wet period in the austral summer which starts in december and ends in february obregón et al 2014 and a dry winter from june to august dufek and ambrizzi 2008 on the other seasons autumn and spring the region presents intermediate conditions of precipitation coelho et al 2016a however the region is sensitive to climate anomalies the rainfall variability in the region from daily to decadal timescales is affected by different sources such as the south atlantic convergence zone sacz which is the main mechanism responsible for rainfall in the summer season otto et al 2015 frontal systems and the humidity flux from amazonia coelho et al 2016b dufek and ambrizzi 2008 obregón et al 2014 some other studies also evaluated the effects of el niño southern oscillation enso on rainfall in são paulo showing that it may affect the inter annual variability despite its complex and not well defined signal coelho et al 2002 kane 2000 obregón et al 2014 the state experienced a major drought in 2014 2015 which resulted in several impacts related to water availability for human consumption hydropower production and agricultural irrigation coelho et al 2016b the main water supply system of the brazilian megacity of são paulo cantareira system dropped below 15 of its capacity affecting about 11 million people melo et al 2016 seth et al 2015 according to nobre et al 2016 the complexity and severity of the observed drought resulted from a mix of abnormal amounts of precipitation extreme high temperatures and from the high vulnerability of the supply systems the atmospheric condition in the region blocked the passage of cold fronts from the south and the flux moisture from the amazon region culminating in a extreme dry condition coelho et al 2016b seth et al 2015 extreme high temperatures affected the water availability increasing the water consumption evapotranspiration and the soil moisture deficiency moreover other major factor that aggravated the water crisis is related to changes in the water use são paulo s population grew approximately 20 in the past 20 years impacting directly the water consumption otto et al 2015 so while precipitation deficits reduced water availability and high temperatures increased the water consumption the rapid development and expansion of the population in são paulo state increased the exposure and vulnerability of supply systems coelho et al 2016b 2016a nobre et al 2016 otto et al 2015 2 2 characterization of drought events drought events can be defined in multiple ways and be influenced by multiple drivers otto et al 2015 their different concepts and uses may vary according to the aim of the study melo and wendland 2016 in this paper we focused on meteorological droughts which are popularly defined as a period of deficits in precipitation kao and govindaraju 2010 wilhite and glantz 1985 however considering the possible multivariate aspect of droughts we also opted to evaluate them through an alternative perspective considering the joint occurrence of extreme hydroclimatic events meteorological droughts precipitation deficit and high temperatures heat waves which is the worst case from a socioeconomic point of view this approach is particularly relevant to the study region and may apply to other tropical environments since the simultaneous occurrence of high temperatures and precipitation deficits may trigger or exacerbate water supply hazards vicente serrano et al 2014 moreover extreme temperature is projected to increase in the region according to climate change scenarios this condition may substantially increase the chance of concurrent precipitation deficits and heat waves aghakouchak et al 2014 in brazil 83 of the produced energy is renewable hydroelectricity represents 64 of the total energy matrix in this context a severe precipitation deficit reduces the electricity production due to smaller volume of stored water and lower hydraulic head on the other hand heat waves increase evaporation human water consumption and agriculture irrigation further reducing the water availability in storage dams in addition the energy demand for public water supply air conditioning and food preservation increases therefore the consideration of precipitation and temperature as compound events aims to account for these possible issues 2 3 precipitation and temperature data 2 3 1 observed data in contrast to aghakouchak et al 2014 and serinaldi 2016 who used aggregated data temperature and precipitation of the rainy season to characterize the 2014 california severe drought we aggregated the precipitation and rainfall data considering the entire year such as filho et al 2020 and melo et al 2016 we opted for this time scale as it is the time required for the effects of droughts to be felt on different sectors such as agricultural activities water resources management and hydropower production by doing this we included the effects of high temperatures and abnormal amounts of precipitation that occurred in the dry season approximately 20 of the annual volume which also affected the water supply system of the region in the severe 2014 water crisis by increasing water consumption and the soil moisture deficiency as showed by nobre et al 2016 coelho et al 2016b and melo et al 2016 moreover the consideration of this temporal scale allowed us to ensure consistency with the analysis of future scenarios as shown by almazroui et al 2021 future projections indicate a shift in seasonality and intra annual variability of precipitation events in brazil historically drier months will increase their contribution to the annual total while rainier months will have a decrease in their contribution that is the definition of dry and rainy seasons may vary throughout the future projections therefore the consideration of the annual scale allowed us to avoid the possible problem of incorrectly defining the rainy and dry seasons in future scenarios we considered data of two rain gauges with centenary rainfall temperature records the datasets were obtained from the agronomic institute of campinas iac and the luiz de queiroz college of agriculture esalq in campinas and piracicaba respectively which are cities located in são paulo state fig 1 although the data were previously quality checked we eliminated some inconsistent data such as those with an incorrect order of magnitude the missing values in both series were filled according to the correlation method sattari et al 2017 using data from three auxiliary stations some statistical properties of the two evaluated series can be seen in the supplementary material table s1 2 3 2 future simulation the projected rainfall and temperature datasets used to characterize future conditions are available at projeta climate change projections for south america regionalized by the eta model from the national institute for space research inpe these data were generated using the inpe s rcm the eta model for south america which downscales the projections of two different global climate models gcm miroc5 and the haggem2 es which was used in this study due to its higher resolution in projeta s downscaling products the dynamic downscaling method used in rcms can capture the global climate simulations generated by gcms for smaller grid sizes considering local features and dynamics to improve the resolution of the simulations used in local studies chou et al 2014a chou et al 2014b for the southeastern region of brazil where sao paulo state is located the model presents a 5 km spatial resolution the future simulations available on projeta consider the future scenarios established in the ipcc 5th assessment report ar5 the so called rcps representative concentration pathway scenarios which are based on different concentrations of greenhouse gases expressed in terms of global radiative forcing in 2100 lyra et al 2018 we considered two different rcps in this study the first rcp4 5 represents an intermediate scenario predicting a 4 5 w m 2 global forcing radiation at the end of the twenty first century assuming a reduction in emissions over the years through the application of climate policies and clean technologies almagro et al 2017 the second rcp8 5 assumes an 8 5 w m 2 global forcing radiation in 2100 representing the most pessimistic scenario in which there are no climate policies resulting in intensifying emissions and use of fossil fuels although rcms improve the resolution of gcms they may suffer from systematic errors in their simulations resulting from the used gcm and or the downscaling procedure which are systematically propagated throughout their future projections kotlarski et al 2014 liang et al 2008 in a recent study almagro et al 2020 indicated that inpe s eta rcm had systematic errors in rainfall simulations in both downscaled gcm simulations hadgem2 es and miroc5 suggesting that both products need a bias correction procedure to overcome these limitations and to guarantee more reliable future projections as it is expected that theses biases are also propagated in rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios to deal with these systematic errors we applied the quantile delta mapping qdm proposed by cannon et al 2015 see figs s2 and s3 for details about its performance compared with the simulated series of inpe s eta rcm this methodology corrects systematic biases of modeled and observed series preserving the relative changes between future and historical simulated quantiles its algorithm follows three steps first we fit a probability distribution to the observed and simulated historical and future series associating quantiles to a non exceedance probability after that a relative change factor is defined for these quantiles associating simulated values of historical and future periods eq 2 finally following the quantile mapping technique future bias correction projections are obtained by multiplying the historical simulated values bias corrected using the observed values by the relative factor eq 3 eqs 2 and 3 are relative to the multiplicative expression suitable for precipitation variables for temperature variables we use the additive expression see appendix a in cannon et al 2015 1 t q f s t f h s 1 f f s q f s t 2 q c t f h o 1 f f s q f s t x t where q f s t f f s f h s 1 are the t th quantile of the future data the cumulative distribution function cdf fitted to future data and the inverse cdf corresponding to the simulated data during the historical period respectively in eq 3 f h o 1 is the inverse cdf fitted to historical observed data and q c t the bias corrected t th quantile of projections given the relative change between historical and future data and the bias corrected historical value 2 4 trend estimation in order to verify the presence of statistical significant trends in the observed and simulated series we applied the non parametric rank based mann kendall test mk if a significant trend was found its magnitude was computed using the theil sen slope estimator ts the mk test is the most popular statistical test for trend detection in hydrological studies villarini et al 2009 to address serial autocorrelation issues we adopted the modified mk test proposed by hamed and rao 1998 in this work this methodology suggests a variance correction to improve the trend detection similar to the mk test the ts estimator is a robust non parametric statistic widely applied in hydrological studies which shows little influence regarding the presence of outliers chagas and chaffe 2018 yue and hashino 2007 2 5 design value univariate framework we evaluated the suitability of six probability distribution functions pdf widely used in hydrological frequency analysis to model precipitation and temperature anomalies gumbel gum generalized extreme value gev pearson iii pe3 generalized normal gno generalized logistic glo and weibull wei their parameters were estimated based on the l moments method which has many advantages over other popular estimation methods such as its ability to characterize a wider range of distribution and its robustness for short samples ahmad et al 2016 hosking 1990 salinas et al 2014 we used weibull s plotting position to estimate the non exceedance probability of the observed series the best probability distribution was selected based on their performance in three popular goodness of fit criteria root mean square error rmse akaike information criterion aic and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the rmse focuses on minimizing the error residuals between the observed and estimated values selecting the model with the lowest rmse value the aic is based not only on minimizing the residuals but also on the complexity of the model degrees of freedom expressed by the number of parameters of the model lower values of aic represent better models the nse introduced by nash and sutcliffe 1970 compares the performance of the model with regards to a naïve forecast considered as the average of the observations nse values close to 1 indicate better models gupta et al 2009 jackson et al 2019 we also visually assessed the suitability of the probability distributions through a quantile quantile q q plot finally from the performance of each evaluated probability distribution on rmse aic and nse we selected the best probability distribution which best describes the statistical properties of the observed series the selected pdf was then used to define design values of the analyzed variables relating quantiles with specific return periods 2 6 design value multivariate framework the multivariate approach was conducted using copula functions as it can couple two or more observed variables describing their dependence well salvadori and de michele 2004 we considered both variables involved in the study precipitation and temperature as x and y respectively and denoted f x and f y as their cumulative distribution functions and f xy x y p x x y y as the joint distribution function if f x and f y are continuous there is a copula function c unique which can be used to obtain f xy x y 3 f xy x y c f x x f y y for each realization of f x and y there is a unique isoline or critical layer on which both variables share the same probability t 0 1 this critical layer associated with probability t defines three regions the critical region where f xy t the alert region with f xy t and the safe one where f xy t salvadori et al 2013 eq 5 defines the return period of the compound event in a multivariate approach whose analysis complies with the idea of the univariate return period 4 t ken μ 1 k t where μ is the time between subsequent values of the observed variables in the time series i e the average interval time between x i and x i 1 or y i and y i 1 t ken is the kendall s return period introduced by salvadori et al 2011 and k t is the kendall s distribution function associated with copula c eq 6 the return period κ xy is clearly a function of the critical layer associated with probability t 5 k t p c f x x f y y t in a multivariate framework we have a multiple choice to define the critical region as the variables can combine in different ways serinaldi 2016 different scenarios can be used to describe the extreme event leading to distinct critical regions salvadori et al 2016 serinaldi 2015 2016 in this study we opted for the kendall s scenario formulation described above which defines a unique dangerous region for all events lying over a critical layer salvadori et al 2011 in other words the uses of kendall s approach ensures that all events with larger return periods of the design value are in the dangerous region gräler et al 2013 alternatively the and scenario eq 7 described in salvadori et al 2016 was also analyzed to evaluate design quantiles and return periods from another perspective unlike the kendall scenario whose definition is based on the identification of a critical layer in this scenario the return period is based on both variables that exceed a certain threshold mesbahzadeh et al 2020 we opted not to use the or scenario considering that drought events are triggered by extreme conditions in both precipitation and temperature not only in one of them moreover as pointed out by salvadori et al 2016 the kendall scenario represents the intersection of infinite or scenarios lying over a specific critical level that identifies the dangerous region thus when using kendall s scenario we are indirectly considering all the dangerous realizations that characterize the or scenario from a summarized perspective 6 p and p x x y y 1 f x x f y y c f x x f y y 7 t and μ p and there are different copulas used in multivariate meteorological and hydrological analysis gräler et al 2013 kao and govindaraju 2010 2007 kwon and lall 2016 sadegh et al 2018 2017 salvadori et al 2013 salvadori and de michele 2004 serinaldi et al 2009 sun et al 2019 in this work using the mvcat toolbox developed by sadegh et al 2017 26 different copulas gaussian t clayton frank gumbel independence ali mikhail haq joe farlie gumbel morgenstern gumbel barnett plackett cuadras auge raftery shih louis linear spearman cubic burr nelsen galambos marshall olkin fischer hinzmann roch alegre fischer kock bb1 bb5 and tawn were analyzed to characterize the meteorological drought events this tool uses the markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation in a bayesian framework to estimate copula parameters and their uncertainties this method converts the posterior distribution of the parameter values into uncertainty intervals for the probability isolines as highlighted by sadegh et al 2017 the correct choice of the copula functions may greatly affect the characterization process as the copula functions may differ significantly the toolbox ranks the performance of the copulas based on several goodness of fit criteria the maximum likelihood ml value bayesian information criterion bic and akaike information criterion aic root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliff efficiency nse the best copula function is the one with the best performance in these tests as well as rmse and nse ml is based only on the minimization of error residuals between estimated and observed values on the other hand bic takes into account the model complexity such as aic in this study we transformed the precipitation and temperature data to an anomaly perspective as suggested by aghakouchak et al 2014 and serinaldi 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 temperature and precipitation series 3 1 1 observed data although the 2014 2015 drought in the study region experienced a dry condition the region had already seen worse situations related to precipitation deficits if we consider the annual precipitation in campinas in 2014 900 9 mm it can be seen that it is not the most extreme situation representing only the third position in the ranking of dry years fig 2 considering the recorded period 1890 2019 drier situations can be observed in 1944 836 5 mm and 1924 886 2 mm the same happens with piracicaba where the 2014 total annual precipitation 906 mm represents the fourth position in the dry condition ranking the driest conditions can be seen in 1921 1984 and 1924 with 812 mm 890 mm and 894 mm respectively however according to the historical series of campinas the warmest condition was observed in 2014 with a maximum temperature of 29 28 ºc fig 2 this condition made the 2014 2015 drought unique having several economic and social impacts in comparison the average daily maximum temperature at the driest year 1944 was only in the 35th position of the warmest year thus even though 1944 experienced the driest condition it not experienced an extreme drought condition with water supply impacts as what happened in 2014 2015 in fact the region already experienced similar dry conditions historically however none of them resulted in an extreme drought such as in 2014 coelho et al 2016b the same happens with the piracicaba where the driest year 1921 with annual rainfall of 812 mm occupies only the 48th position in the ranking of the warmest years again no water crisis was registered in this year even with the driest condition 3 1 2 future data both future scenarios considered in this study showed an intensification in meteorological droughts expressed by a drier and warmer climate highlighting the relative changes in both precipitation and temperature fig 3 as expected the pessimistic scenario rcp 8 5 presents worse drought conditions with higher and lower values of average daily maximum temperature and annual precipitation respectively when compared with the intermediate scenario rcp 4 5 considering both future scenarios an increase in the maximum temperature range is expected from 3 5 to 5 5 ºc approximately even if no changes were expected in the annual precipitation the maximum temperature intensification would lead to an increase in drought severity aghakouchak et al 2014 the boxes in fig 3c and d confirm the high uncertainty level expected for future scenarios however the changes in both scenarios and stations campinas and piracicaba corroborate the idea that drought events in the future will be more common and intense compared with the dry occurrences observed now 3 2 trend estimation the results of the mk test applied to the dataset show that all temperature series observed and future periods present significant trends at a 5 significance level however for precipitation series no significant trends were found analyzing the ts results we found that both trends in the observed temperature series were positive and had similar magnitudes 0 0150 and 0 0141 ºc year 1 for campinas and piracicaba respectively confirming as expected a warmer scenario with growing temperatures the positive trends found in the observed temperature series remained in future periods with a magnitude intensification in rcp4 5 0 0236 and 0 0193 ºc year 1 for campinas and piracicaba respectively and rcp8 5 0 0710 and 0 0655 ºc year 1 these findings confirm the warmer climate expected at the end of the century which can lead to extreme drought events and causes significant stress on the ecosystem aghakouchak et al 2014 furthermore although no significant trends were found in the observed and future precipitation series drought events may become more frequent and severe due to the increase in temperature observed over the last decade perkins et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2014 3 3 return period 3 3 1 observed data for each station and drought variable temperature or precipitation the best probability distribution was selected table 1 based on its performance on the evaluated goodness of fit criteria among all evaluated distributions gev and glo appeared as the most suitable distributions to represent this dataset however it can be seen in the q q plots that all evaluated probability distributions describe the observed values similarly fig s1 considering only precipitation data from a univariate perspective fig 4 the return period of the 2014 2015 drought in the study region was approximately 25 years for campinas and 40 years for piracicaba if we consider temperature data the return period changed to approximately 100 years piracicaba and 120 years campinas that is in both evaluated stations the 2014 2015 southeast drought was not seen as an extreme and rare condition according to the common practice of using only precipitation data despite its severe economic and social impacts however drought events can depend on different meteorological variables which when combined simultaneously generate an extreme condition with significant impacts to assess the 2014 2015 water crisis according to a multivariate perspective we used the copula framework considering drought events as a combination of extreme conditions of low precipitation and high temperature to do this we used the mvcat toolbox sadegh et al 2017 to select the best copula function for both stations the best copula functions bb1 and clayton for piracicaba and campinas respectively were selected based on their performance in aic and bic table 2 it is important to note the agreement between the choices of the statistical tests the bb1 tawn and roch alegre copulas performed well for both stations the selected copula also showed a good performance on rmse and nse tests 0 1054 and 0 9980 for piracicaba and 0 1637 and 0 9957 for campinas considering the return period on the multivariate framework fig 5 it can be observed that the 2014 2015 drought in the study region was classified as a rare and extreme event with a larger recurrence interval than those found in the univariate framework in campinas the joint return period found is higher than 200 years whereas for piracicaba it is approximately 80 years these results contrast with the univariate analysis due to the addition of the temperature variable in the frequency analysis drought events as already pointed out are the result of compound and concurrent events therefore when we evaluate only a single driver there is a possibility of misspecifications of the risks associated with extreme events these differences fig 5 highlight the importance of considering interactions between drivers for a more accurate estimation to provide a wider view of extreme events for both stations various examples can be found where the univariate analysis is either underestimated or overestimated e g in 1944 in campinas which had the lowest precipitation amount but without an extreme temperature condition leading to a 20 year event from a multivariate perspective this difference in the estimation can be attributed to the fact that the univariate framework evaluates only one driver of extreme events ignoring all the others considering a 200 year event fig 5a and b for both temperature and precipitation the univariate approach estimates higher values than those estimated by copulas in piracicaba this event is characterized by 791 27 mm 29 77 ºc annual precipitation average daily maximum temperature whereas in the univariate framework the 200 year annual precipitation is 673 30 mm and the average daily maximum temperature is 30 31 ºc the same examples can be found in the and scenario fig 6 in this case the differences between the univariate and the multivariate approach were even greater given the less conservative analysis of the and case see gräler et al 2013 3 3 2 future data the same procedure was conducted for future data to verify relative changes in the design quantiles of historical and future periods for the univariate framework the glo was selected as the best probability distribution according to the three selected goodness of fit criteria to describe the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 simulated series considering the common approach of using only precipitation data to define design quantiles for future data it can be observed that the return period of the reference event 2014 2015 drought in the study region reduced to 2 years for all stations and plan scenarios fig 7 this fact suggests that meteorological droughts will become more frequent in the future an event classified as a 30 year event as was characterized in the 2014 2015 studied drought considering the historical period presented a total of 500 mm of annual precipitation this represents a reduction of about 40 of the total in one year meteorological drought characteristics were also assessed in the future period in a multivariate framework via copulas we focused on the kendall s approach in this case as we were interested only in evaluate the changes between historical and future scenarios however the results can be analyzed for the and case in an analogous framework to assess the relative changes of drought characteristics two kinds of anomalies were considered the first one called future anomalies considers deviations in the future data calculating the anomalies as the difference between the simulated values and the mean of the future series fig 8 the second methodology called present anomalies uses the mean of the observed data to calculate the anomalies considering the deviations between the simulated and historical observed data fig 9 therefore two essential aspects of droughts can be defined their behavior and possible deviations in the future climate condition considering a warmer and drier context and its relative changes from the current period in both methodologies the bb1 copula appeared as the best function to describe meteorological drought events as also seen in the historical period see tables s2 and s3 to an overall performance of the best copulas functions given that its formulation allows upper and lower tails dependences nikoloulopoulos et al 2012 which is key property to deal with extreme events such as droughts we suggest the bb1 copula as the most indicated function to characterize the joint occurrence of high temperature and low precipitation in the region according to the scenarios extreme meteorological droughts tend to be more common fig 8 when compared to historically observed ones fig 5 they show a larger amplitude of climate variables with higher anomalies found in both the temperature and precipitation this can be observed by the movement up and to the right of the isolines when compared with the isolines associated with the historical period fig 5 in the present situation an anomaly as seen in the 2014 2015 studied drought 500 mm of annual precipitation and 2 ºc average daily maximum temperature was classified as a 200 year return period event in a future scenario these anomalies are associated with a 25 year return period in both representative pathway conditions from the present anomalies analysis fig 9 it can be seen that drought events previously classified as extreme and rare considering the historical observed data such as the 2014 2015 drought in the study region were characterized as a common event with less than 2 years of return period this framework clarifies the expected changes in the future a reduction in the return period of the reference drought event 2014 2015 from 100 to less than 2 years was observed regarding the present climate a 100 year future drought will be characterized as an event with approximately 900 mm precipitation anomaly and 6 ºc temperature anomaly considering the intermediate future scenario and 1000 mm precipitation anomaly and 8 ºc for the pessimistic future plot it is also important to note that in the worst scenario rcp8 5 extreme droughts will differ mainly due to temperature anomalies this situation highlights the importance of considering drought as a compound event associating temperature and precipitation given the fact that this difference would not be noted in the univariate framework similar results were found for the and case considering the future anomalies approach for the iac station fig 10a and c we can see that larger anomalies are expected in temperature and precipitation for both future scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the reference drought was expected to be common in future conditions being classified as a 2 year return period and less than that for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively in contrast to what is expected precipitation anomalies for the rcp8 5 were smaller than those of the rcp4 5 probably due to the larger uncertainty associated with the rcp8 5 simulations it is worth mentioning that these results represent approximate changes in meteorological dynamics climate model simulations are associated with a high degree of uncertainty which affects the accuracy of these estimates 4 conclusion in this study we evaluate the differences between uni precipitation and multivariate precipitation and temperature frequency analyses to characterize extreme drought events for both present and future scenarios the simultaneous occurrence of high temperatures and precipitation deficits may increase the socioeconomic impacts of water shortage evaluating the 2014 2015 southeast brazilian water crisis we show that the univariate approach traditionally adopted for drought characterization substantially underestimated the recurrence interval of this severe event considering that significant positive trends were found only for temperature data we argue that the traditional approach of considering only precipitation data may lead to poor decision making in water management especially in a climate change context moreover future period analysis showed an intensification in drought characteristics using different perspectives present and future anomalies helped to clarify the relative changes in drought events indicating that i severe drought events such as the 2014 2015 southeast drought will become more common in the future and ii a higher occurrence of temperature and precipitation anomalies are expected these results suggest that even if no relative changes in precipitation anomalies are expected they are not sufficient to understand and characterize future drought events which are also influenced by temperature anomalies the multivariate frequency analysis showed to be a fundamental tool for a more reliable and realistic characterization of extreme events which can be used for risk assessment in different applications agronomists can use the methodology to assist the modeling of agricultural productivity and the risk of crop failure with the occurrence of climate extremes water resources professionals can use it to create an operational rule to ensure water security in the face of extreme events in essence the use of a multivariate framework can help politicians decision makers and the whole community in water resources management to shape public policies to deal with climate based hazards for future studies the consideration of different variables that may trigger or exacerbate drought events such as soil moisture water consumption and atmospheric patterns and the consideration of a larger set of centennial series which are not yet available in the region will certainly improve our knowledge and bring new insights concerning the drivers and the rarity of severe droughts credit authorship contribution statement andré s ballarin methodology formal analysis investigation writing original draft visualization writing review

8119,study region são paulo state brazil study focus compound events such as droughts and heat waves may have severe impacts on human activities traditionally they are characterized considering a univariate perspective however this approach may not be the most adequate to characterize such hazards as they often result from a combination of variables interacting in space and time alternatively several studies adopt the multivariate frequency analysis as it allows the consideration of concurrent drivers and their dependencies nevertheless few of them evaluated this methodology in a climate change context in view of this this study aims to compare the uni and multivariate approaches to characterize extreme drought events considering both historical and future scenarios using the severe water crisis experienced in the southeast region of brazil in 2014 2015 as a study case new hydrological insights for the region the univariate approach can substantially underestimate the risk associated with extreme events for future scenarios differences between the two methodologies reached 90 of the estimated return period significant increasing trends were found only for temperature both approaches indicated that drought events will be more common and intense in the future however the univariate framework may misspecificate the associated risks as it not account for the expected warming condition that may trigger or exacerbate extreme drought events keywords meteorological droughts multivariate frequency analysis global warming compound extreme events 1 introduction hydrological extreme events have received special attention in recent decades due to their increasing impacts in a climate change context hao et al 2018 despite several scientific advances to characterize them understanding their mechanisms considering a global warming scenario where extreme events may happen at increasing rates is still a challenge trenberth et al 2015 vaghefi et al 2019 among various climate extreme events droughts are by far the most complex and costly natural disaster representing the main natural cause of socioeconomic and environmental damage across the globe hao et al 2014 pendergrass et al 2020 pulwarty and sivakumar 2014 vicente serrano et al 2014 to avoid their potential consequences a reliable characterization process is required to provide substantial knowledge for improving risk assessment and decision making conventionally drought events are characterized considering one single and representative variable in a univariate framework e g precipitation anomalies through the standardized precipitation index spi to characterize meteorological droughts aghakouchak et al 2014 coelho et al 2016a mesbahzadeh et al 2020 sheffield and wood 2008 however drought events may be triggered or exacerbated by a combination of concurrent variables interacting in space and time such as precipitation anomaly and high temperature as observed in several recent events aghakouchak et al 2014 therefore to improve drought analysis it is important to consider its multivariate characteristic assessing all important variables involved in the process leonard et al 2014 mesbahzadeh et al 2020 salvadori and de michele 2004 serinaldi 2016 several studies have applied multivariate frequency analysis such as copula functions to overcome limitations in the characterization of extreme drought events aghakouchak et al 2014 fischer and knutti 2013 gräler et al 2013 masud et al 2015 serinaldi 2016 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 this approach provides a great potential to characterize compound events as it allows risk assessment of different variables considering their dependence structure however in these studies little attention has been paid to the characterization of extreme events considering future scenarios mechler and bouwer 2015 droughts may intensify in the future in many regions of the world as a consequence of increasing atmospheric evaporative demand caused by the increase in global temperatures pendergrass et al 2020 vicente serrano et al 2014 wang et al 2012 compound intensification in both precipitation deficit and temperature extremes may exacerbate their impacts furthermore two non extreme conditions combined may result in an extreme condition with significant impacts aghakouchak et al 2014 leonard et al 2014 in this context an accurate characterization of droughts considering future scenarios in a multivariate framework may help risk assessment practices and prevent future damage melo and wendland 2017 mesbahzadeh et al 2020 in the present study we evaluated two different approaches uni and multivariate to risk assessment of extreme droughts events considering both historical and future conditions using temperature and precipitation data we characterized the severe water crisis experienced in são paulo state located in the southeast region of brazil between 2014 and 2015 marengo et al 2018 nobre et al 2016 which impacted about 11 million people in brazil s most populated region coelho et al 2016b getirana 2016 melo and wendland 2016 nobre et al 2016 by using this extreme drought event as a study case we aimed i to identify the influence of the joint occurrence of precipitation temperature extremes on the characterization of drought events and ii to evaluate relative changes in future droughts compared with the historical period considering both uni and multivariate frameworks given the multivariate characteristic of droughts we argue that the copula approach can improve the understanding of these events helping decision makers to optimize drought management practices considering that drought impacts may be exacerbated by an intensification in temperature vicente serrano et al 2014 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and the 2014 2015 drought the study focuses on the most populated state of brazil são paulo located between 26 19ºs and 54 46ºw the region is characterized by a wet period in the austral summer which starts in december and ends in february obregón et al 2014 and a dry winter from june to august dufek and ambrizzi 2008 on the other seasons autumn and spring the region presents intermediate conditions of precipitation coelho et al 2016a however the region is sensitive to climate anomalies the rainfall variability in the region from daily to decadal timescales is affected by different sources such as the south atlantic convergence zone sacz which is the main mechanism responsible for rainfall in the summer season otto et al 2015 frontal systems and the humidity flux from amazonia coelho et al 2016b dufek and ambrizzi 2008 obregón et al 2014 some other studies also evaluated the effects of el niño southern oscillation enso on rainfall in são paulo showing that it may affect the inter annual variability despite its complex and not well defined signal coelho et al 2002 kane 2000 obregón et al 2014 the state experienced a major drought in 2014 2015 which resulted in several impacts related to water availability for human consumption hydropower production and agricultural irrigation coelho et al 2016b the main water supply system of the brazilian megacity of são paulo cantareira system dropped below 15 of its capacity affecting about 11 million people melo et al 2016 seth et al 2015 according to nobre et al 2016 the complexity and severity of the observed drought resulted from a mix of abnormal amounts of precipitation extreme high temperatures and from the high vulnerability of the supply systems the atmospheric condition in the region blocked the passage of cold fronts from the south and the flux moisture from the amazon region culminating in a extreme dry condition coelho et al 2016b seth et al 2015 extreme high temperatures affected the water availability increasing the water consumption evapotranspiration and the soil moisture deficiency moreover other major factor that aggravated the water crisis is related to changes in the water use são paulo s population grew approximately 20 in the past 20 years impacting directly the water consumption otto et al 2015 so while precipitation deficits reduced water availability and high temperatures increased the water consumption the rapid development and expansion of the population in são paulo state increased the exposure and vulnerability of supply systems coelho et al 2016b 2016a nobre et al 2016 otto et al 2015 2 2 characterization of drought events drought events can be defined in multiple ways and be influenced by multiple drivers otto et al 2015 their different concepts and uses may vary according to the aim of the study melo and wendland 2016 in this paper we focused on meteorological droughts which are popularly defined as a period of deficits in precipitation kao and govindaraju 2010 wilhite and glantz 1985 however considering the possible multivariate aspect of droughts we also opted to evaluate them through an alternative perspective considering the joint occurrence of extreme hydroclimatic events meteorological droughts precipitation deficit and high temperatures heat waves which is the worst case from a socioeconomic point of view this approach is particularly relevant to the study region and may apply to other tropical environments since the simultaneous occurrence of high temperatures and precipitation deficits may trigger or exacerbate water supply hazards vicente serrano et al 2014 moreover extreme temperature is projected to increase in the region according to climate change scenarios this condition may substantially increase the chance of concurrent precipitation deficits and heat waves aghakouchak et al 2014 in brazil 83 of the produced energy is renewable hydroelectricity represents 64 of the total energy matrix in this context a severe precipitation deficit reduces the electricity production due to smaller volume of stored water and lower hydraulic head on the other hand heat waves increase evaporation human water consumption and agriculture irrigation further reducing the water availability in storage dams in addition the energy demand for public water supply air conditioning and food preservation increases therefore the consideration of precipitation and temperature as compound events aims to account for these possible issues 2 3 precipitation and temperature data 2 3 1 observed data in contrast to aghakouchak et al 2014 and serinaldi 2016 who used aggregated data temperature and precipitation of the rainy season to characterize the 2014 california severe drought we aggregated the precipitation and rainfall data considering the entire year such as filho et al 2020 and melo et al 2016 we opted for this time scale as it is the time required for the effects of droughts to be felt on different sectors such as agricultural activities water resources management and hydropower production by doing this we included the effects of high temperatures and abnormal amounts of precipitation that occurred in the dry season approximately 20 of the annual volume which also affected the water supply system of the region in the severe 2014 water crisis by increasing water consumption and the soil moisture deficiency as showed by nobre et al 2016 coelho et al 2016b and melo et al 2016 moreover the consideration of this temporal scale allowed us to ensure consistency with the analysis of future scenarios as shown by almazroui et al 2021 future projections indicate a shift in seasonality and intra annual variability of precipitation events in brazil historically drier months will increase their contribution to the annual total while rainier months will have a decrease in their contribution that is the definition of dry and rainy seasons may vary throughout the future projections therefore the consideration of the annual scale allowed us to avoid the possible problem of incorrectly defining the rainy and dry seasons in future scenarios we considered data of two rain gauges with centenary rainfall temperature records the datasets were obtained from the agronomic institute of campinas iac and the luiz de queiroz college of agriculture esalq in campinas and piracicaba respectively which are cities located in são paulo state fig 1 although the data were previously quality checked we eliminated some inconsistent data such as those with an incorrect order of magnitude the missing values in both series were filled according to the correlation method sattari et al 2017 using data from three auxiliary stations some statistical properties of the two evaluated series can be seen in the supplementary material table s1 2 3 2 future simulation the projected rainfall and temperature datasets used to characterize future conditions are available at projeta climate change projections for south america regionalized by the eta model from the national institute for space research inpe these data were generated using the inpe s rcm the eta model for south america which downscales the projections of two different global climate models gcm miroc5 and the haggem2 es which was used in this study due to its higher resolution in projeta s downscaling products the dynamic downscaling method used in rcms can capture the global climate simulations generated by gcms for smaller grid sizes considering local features and dynamics to improve the resolution of the simulations used in local studies chou et al 2014a chou et al 2014b for the southeastern region of brazil where sao paulo state is located the model presents a 5 km spatial resolution the future simulations available on projeta consider the future scenarios established in the ipcc 5th assessment report ar5 the so called rcps representative concentration pathway scenarios which are based on different concentrations of greenhouse gases expressed in terms of global radiative forcing in 2100 lyra et al 2018 we considered two different rcps in this study the first rcp4 5 represents an intermediate scenario predicting a 4 5 w m 2 global forcing radiation at the end of the twenty first century assuming a reduction in emissions over the years through the application of climate policies and clean technologies almagro et al 2017 the second rcp8 5 assumes an 8 5 w m 2 global forcing radiation in 2100 representing the most pessimistic scenario in which there are no climate policies resulting in intensifying emissions and use of fossil fuels although rcms improve the resolution of gcms they may suffer from systematic errors in their simulations resulting from the used gcm and or the downscaling procedure which are systematically propagated throughout their future projections kotlarski et al 2014 liang et al 2008 in a recent study almagro et al 2020 indicated that inpe s eta rcm had systematic errors in rainfall simulations in both downscaled gcm simulations hadgem2 es and miroc5 suggesting that both products need a bias correction procedure to overcome these limitations and to guarantee more reliable future projections as it is expected that theses biases are also propagated in rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios to deal with these systematic errors we applied the quantile delta mapping qdm proposed by cannon et al 2015 see figs s2 and s3 for details about its performance compared with the simulated series of inpe s eta rcm this methodology corrects systematic biases of modeled and observed series preserving the relative changes between future and historical simulated quantiles its algorithm follows three steps first we fit a probability distribution to the observed and simulated historical and future series associating quantiles to a non exceedance probability after that a relative change factor is defined for these quantiles associating simulated values of historical and future periods eq 2 finally following the quantile mapping technique future bias correction projections are obtained by multiplying the historical simulated values bias corrected using the observed values by the relative factor eq 3 eqs 2 and 3 are relative to the multiplicative expression suitable for precipitation variables for temperature variables we use the additive expression see appendix a in cannon et al 2015 1 t q f s t f h s 1 f f s q f s t 2 q c t f h o 1 f f s q f s t x t where q f s t f f s f h s 1 are the t th quantile of the future data the cumulative distribution function cdf fitted to future data and the inverse cdf corresponding to the simulated data during the historical period respectively in eq 3 f h o 1 is the inverse cdf fitted to historical observed data and q c t the bias corrected t th quantile of projections given the relative change between historical and future data and the bias corrected historical value 2 4 trend estimation in order to verify the presence of statistical significant trends in the observed and simulated series we applied the non parametric rank based mann kendall test mk if a significant trend was found its magnitude was computed using the theil sen slope estimator ts the mk test is the most popular statistical test for trend detection in hydrological studies villarini et al 2009 to address serial autocorrelation issues we adopted the modified mk test proposed by hamed and rao 1998 in this work this methodology suggests a variance correction to improve the trend detection similar to the mk test the ts estimator is a robust non parametric statistic widely applied in hydrological studies which shows little influence regarding the presence of outliers chagas and chaffe 2018 yue and hashino 2007 2 5 design value univariate framework we evaluated the suitability of six probability distribution functions pdf widely used in hydrological frequency analysis to model precipitation and temperature anomalies gumbel gum generalized extreme value gev pearson iii pe3 generalized normal gno generalized logistic glo and weibull wei their parameters were estimated based on the l moments method which has many advantages over other popular estimation methods such as its ability to characterize a wider range of distribution and its robustness for short samples ahmad et al 2016 hosking 1990 salinas et al 2014 we used weibull s plotting position to estimate the non exceedance probability of the observed series the best probability distribution was selected based on their performance in three popular goodness of fit criteria root mean square error rmse akaike information criterion aic and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the rmse focuses on minimizing the error residuals between the observed and estimated values selecting the model with the lowest rmse value the aic is based not only on minimizing the residuals but also on the complexity of the model degrees of freedom expressed by the number of parameters of the model lower values of aic represent better models the nse introduced by nash and sutcliffe 1970 compares the performance of the model with regards to a naïve forecast considered as the average of the observations nse values close to 1 indicate better models gupta et al 2009 jackson et al 2019 we also visually assessed the suitability of the probability distributions through a quantile quantile q q plot finally from the performance of each evaluated probability distribution on rmse aic and nse we selected the best probability distribution which best describes the statistical properties of the observed series the selected pdf was then used to define design values of the analyzed variables relating quantiles with specific return periods 2 6 design value multivariate framework the multivariate approach was conducted using copula functions as it can couple two or more observed variables describing their dependence well salvadori and de michele 2004 we considered both variables involved in the study precipitation and temperature as x and y respectively and denoted f x and f y as their cumulative distribution functions and f xy x y p x x y y as the joint distribution function if f x and f y are continuous there is a copula function c unique which can be used to obtain f xy x y 3 f xy x y c f x x f y y for each realization of f x and y there is a unique isoline or critical layer on which both variables share the same probability t 0 1 this critical layer associated with probability t defines three regions the critical region where f xy t the alert region with f xy t and the safe one where f xy t salvadori et al 2013 eq 5 defines the return period of the compound event in a multivariate approach whose analysis complies with the idea of the univariate return period 4 t ken μ 1 k t where μ is the time between subsequent values of the observed variables in the time series i e the average interval time between x i and x i 1 or y i and y i 1 t ken is the kendall s return period introduced by salvadori et al 2011 and k t is the kendall s distribution function associated with copula c eq 6 the return period κ xy is clearly a function of the critical layer associated with probability t 5 k t p c f x x f y y t in a multivariate framework we have a multiple choice to define the critical region as the variables can combine in different ways serinaldi 2016 different scenarios can be used to describe the extreme event leading to distinct critical regions salvadori et al 2016 serinaldi 2015 2016 in this study we opted for the kendall s scenario formulation described above which defines a unique dangerous region for all events lying over a critical layer salvadori et al 2011 in other words the uses of kendall s approach ensures that all events with larger return periods of the design value are in the dangerous region gräler et al 2013 alternatively the and scenario eq 7 described in salvadori et al 2016 was also analyzed to evaluate design quantiles and return periods from another perspective unlike the kendall scenario whose definition is based on the identification of a critical layer in this scenario the return period is based on both variables that exceed a certain threshold mesbahzadeh et al 2020 we opted not to use the or scenario considering that drought events are triggered by extreme conditions in both precipitation and temperature not only in one of them moreover as pointed out by salvadori et al 2016 the kendall scenario represents the intersection of infinite or scenarios lying over a specific critical level that identifies the dangerous region thus when using kendall s scenario we are indirectly considering all the dangerous realizations that characterize the or scenario from a summarized perspective 6 p and p x x y y 1 f x x f y y c f x x f y y 7 t and μ p and there are different copulas used in multivariate meteorological and hydrological analysis gräler et al 2013 kao and govindaraju 2010 2007 kwon and lall 2016 sadegh et al 2018 2017 salvadori et al 2013 salvadori and de michele 2004 serinaldi et al 2009 sun et al 2019 in this work using the mvcat toolbox developed by sadegh et al 2017 26 different copulas gaussian t clayton frank gumbel independence ali mikhail haq joe farlie gumbel morgenstern gumbel barnett plackett cuadras auge raftery shih louis linear spearman cubic burr nelsen galambos marshall olkin fischer hinzmann roch alegre fischer kock bb1 bb5 and tawn were analyzed to characterize the meteorological drought events this tool uses the markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation in a bayesian framework to estimate copula parameters and their uncertainties this method converts the posterior distribution of the parameter values into uncertainty intervals for the probability isolines as highlighted by sadegh et al 2017 the correct choice of the copula functions may greatly affect the characterization process as the copula functions may differ significantly the toolbox ranks the performance of the copulas based on several goodness of fit criteria the maximum likelihood ml value bayesian information criterion bic and akaike information criterion aic root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliff efficiency nse the best copula function is the one with the best performance in these tests as well as rmse and nse ml is based only on the minimization of error residuals between estimated and observed values on the other hand bic takes into account the model complexity such as aic in this study we transformed the precipitation and temperature data to an anomaly perspective as suggested by aghakouchak et al 2014 and serinaldi 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 temperature and precipitation series 3 1 1 observed data although the 2014 2015 drought in the study region experienced a dry condition the region had already seen worse situations related to precipitation deficits if we consider the annual precipitation in campinas in 2014 900 9 mm it can be seen that it is not the most extreme situation representing only the third position in the ranking of dry years fig 2 considering the recorded period 1890 2019 drier situations can be observed in 1944 836 5 mm and 1924 886 2 mm the same happens with piracicaba where the 2014 total annual precipitation 906 mm represents the fourth position in the dry condition ranking the driest conditions can be seen in 1921 1984 and 1924 with 812 mm 890 mm and 894 mm respectively however according to the historical series of campinas the warmest condition was observed in 2014 with a maximum temperature of 29 28 ºc fig 2 this condition made the 2014 2015 drought unique having several economic and social impacts in comparison the average daily maximum temperature at the driest year 1944 was only in the 35th position of the warmest year thus even though 1944 experienced the driest condition it not experienced an extreme drought condition with water supply impacts as what happened in 2014 2015 in fact the region already experienced similar dry conditions historically however none of them resulted in an extreme drought such as in 2014 coelho et al 2016b the same happens with the piracicaba where the driest year 1921 with annual rainfall of 812 mm occupies only the 48th position in the ranking of the warmest years again no water crisis was registered in this year even with the driest condition 3 1 2 future data both future scenarios considered in this study showed an intensification in meteorological droughts expressed by a drier and warmer climate highlighting the relative changes in both precipitation and temperature fig 3 as expected the pessimistic scenario rcp 8 5 presents worse drought conditions with higher and lower values of average daily maximum temperature and annual precipitation respectively when compared with the intermediate scenario rcp 4 5 considering both future scenarios an increase in the maximum temperature range is expected from 3 5 to 5 5 ºc approximately even if no changes were expected in the annual precipitation the maximum temperature intensification would lead to an increase in drought severity aghakouchak et al 2014 the boxes in fig 3c and d confirm the high uncertainty level expected for future scenarios however the changes in both scenarios and stations campinas and piracicaba corroborate the idea that drought events in the future will be more common and intense compared with the dry occurrences observed now 3 2 trend estimation the results of the mk test applied to the dataset show that all temperature series observed and future periods present significant trends at a 5 significance level however for precipitation series no significant trends were found analyzing the ts results we found that both trends in the observed temperature series were positive and had similar magnitudes 0 0150 and 0 0141 ºc year 1 for campinas and piracicaba respectively confirming as expected a warmer scenario with growing temperatures the positive trends found in the observed temperature series remained in future periods with a magnitude intensification in rcp4 5 0 0236 and 0 0193 ºc year 1 for campinas and piracicaba respectively and rcp8 5 0 0710 and 0 0655 ºc year 1 these findings confirm the warmer climate expected at the end of the century which can lead to extreme drought events and causes significant stress on the ecosystem aghakouchak et al 2014 furthermore although no significant trends were found in the observed and future precipitation series drought events may become more frequent and severe due to the increase in temperature observed over the last decade perkins et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2014 3 3 return period 3 3 1 observed data for each station and drought variable temperature or precipitation the best probability distribution was selected table 1 based on its performance on the evaluated goodness of fit criteria among all evaluated distributions gev and glo appeared as the most suitable distributions to represent this dataset however it can be seen in the q q plots that all evaluated probability distributions describe the observed values similarly fig s1 considering only precipitation data from a univariate perspective fig 4 the return period of the 2014 2015 drought in the study region was approximately 25 years for campinas and 40 years for piracicaba if we consider temperature data the return period changed to approximately 100 years piracicaba and 120 years campinas that is in both evaluated stations the 2014 2015 southeast drought was not seen as an extreme and rare condition according to the common practice of using only precipitation data despite its severe economic and social impacts however drought events can depend on different meteorological variables which when combined simultaneously generate an extreme condition with significant impacts to assess the 2014 2015 water crisis according to a multivariate perspective we used the copula framework considering drought events as a combination of extreme conditions of low precipitation and high temperature to do this we used the mvcat toolbox sadegh et al 2017 to select the best copula function for both stations the best copula functions bb1 and clayton for piracicaba and campinas respectively were selected based on their performance in aic and bic table 2 it is important to note the agreement between the choices of the statistical tests the bb1 tawn and roch alegre copulas performed well for both stations the selected copula also showed a good performance on rmse and nse tests 0 1054 and 0 9980 for piracicaba and 0 1637 and 0 9957 for campinas considering the return period on the multivariate framework fig 5 it can be observed that the 2014 2015 drought in the study region was classified as a rare and extreme event with a larger recurrence interval than those found in the univariate framework in campinas the joint return period found is higher than 200 years whereas for piracicaba it is approximately 80 years these results contrast with the univariate analysis due to the addition of the temperature variable in the frequency analysis drought events as already pointed out are the result of compound and concurrent events therefore when we evaluate only a single driver there is a possibility of misspecifications of the risks associated with extreme events these differences fig 5 highlight the importance of considering interactions between drivers for a more accurate estimation to provide a wider view of extreme events for both stations various examples can be found where the univariate analysis is either underestimated or overestimated e g in 1944 in campinas which had the lowest precipitation amount but without an extreme temperature condition leading to a 20 year event from a multivariate perspective this difference in the estimation can be attributed to the fact that the univariate framework evaluates only one driver of extreme events ignoring all the others considering a 200 year event fig 5a and b for both temperature and precipitation the univariate approach estimates higher values than those estimated by copulas in piracicaba this event is characterized by 791 27 mm 29 77 ºc annual precipitation average daily maximum temperature whereas in the univariate framework the 200 year annual precipitation is 673 30 mm and the average daily maximum temperature is 30 31 ºc the same examples can be found in the and scenario fig 6 in this case the differences between the univariate and the multivariate approach were even greater given the less conservative analysis of the and case see gräler et al 2013 3 3 2 future data the same procedure was conducted for future data to verify relative changes in the design quantiles of historical and future periods for the univariate framework the glo was selected as the best probability distribution according to the three selected goodness of fit criteria to describe the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 simulated series considering the common approach of using only precipitation data to define design quantiles for future data it can be observed that the return period of the reference event 2014 2015 drought in the study region reduced to 2 years for all stations and plan scenarios fig 7 this fact suggests that meteorological droughts will become more frequent in the future an event classified as a 30 year event as was characterized in the 2014 2015 studied drought considering the historical period presented a total of 500 mm of annual precipitation this represents a reduction of about 40 of the total in one year meteorological drought characteristics were also assessed in the future period in a multivariate framework via copulas we focused on the kendall s approach in this case as we were interested only in evaluate the changes between historical and future scenarios however the results can be analyzed for the and case in an analogous framework to assess the relative changes of drought characteristics two kinds of anomalies were considered the first one called future anomalies considers deviations in the future data calculating the anomalies as the difference between the simulated values and the mean of the future series fig 8 the second methodology called present anomalies uses the mean of the observed data to calculate the anomalies considering the deviations between the simulated and historical observed data fig 9 therefore two essential aspects of droughts can be defined their behavior and possible deviations in the future climate condition considering a warmer and drier context and its relative changes from the current period in both methodologies the bb1 copula appeared as the best function to describe meteorological drought events as also seen in the historical period see tables s2 and s3 to an overall performance of the best copulas functions given that its formulation allows upper and lower tails dependences nikoloulopoulos et al 2012 which is key property to deal with extreme events such as droughts we suggest the bb1 copula as the most indicated function to characterize the joint occurrence of high temperature and low precipitation in the region according to the scenarios extreme meteorological droughts tend to be more common fig 8 when compared to historically observed ones fig 5 they show a larger amplitude of climate variables with higher anomalies found in both the temperature and precipitation this can be observed by the movement up and to the right of the isolines when compared with the isolines associated with the historical period fig 5 in the present situation an anomaly as seen in the 2014 2015 studied drought 500 mm of annual precipitation and 2 ºc average daily maximum temperature was classified as a 200 year return period event in a future scenario these anomalies are associated with a 25 year return period in both representative pathway conditions from the present anomalies analysis fig 9 it can be seen that drought events previously classified as extreme and rare considering the historical observed data such as the 2014 2015 drought in the study region were characterized as a common event with less than 2 years of return period this framework clarifies the expected changes in the future a reduction in the return period of the reference drought event 2014 2015 from 100 to less than 2 years was observed regarding the present climate a 100 year future drought will be characterized as an event with approximately 900 mm precipitation anomaly and 6 ºc temperature anomaly considering the intermediate future scenario and 1000 mm precipitation anomaly and 8 ºc for the pessimistic future plot it is also important to note that in the worst scenario rcp8 5 extreme droughts will differ mainly due to temperature anomalies this situation highlights the importance of considering drought as a compound event associating temperature and precipitation given the fact that this difference would not be noted in the univariate framework similar results were found for the and case considering the future anomalies approach for the iac station fig 10a and c we can see that larger anomalies are expected in temperature and precipitation for both future scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the reference drought was expected to be common in future conditions being classified as a 2 year return period and less than that for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively in contrast to what is expected precipitation anomalies for the rcp8 5 were smaller than those of the rcp4 5 probably due to the larger uncertainty associated with the rcp8 5 simulations it is worth mentioning that these results represent approximate changes in meteorological dynamics climate model simulations are associated with a high degree of uncertainty which affects the accuracy of these estimates 4 conclusion in this study we evaluate the differences between uni precipitation and multivariate precipitation and temperature frequency analyses to characterize extreme drought events for both present and future scenarios the simultaneous occurrence of high temperatures and precipitation deficits may increase the socioeconomic impacts of water shortage evaluating the 2014 2015 southeast brazilian water crisis we show that the univariate approach traditionally adopted for drought characterization substantially underestimated the recurrence interval of this severe event considering that significant positive trends were found only for temperature data we argue that the traditional approach of considering only precipitation data may lead to poor decision making in water management especially in a climate change context moreover future period analysis showed an intensification in drought characteristics using different perspectives present and future anomalies helped to clarify the relative changes in drought events indicating that i severe drought events such as the 2014 2015 southeast drought will become more common in the future and ii a higher occurrence of temperature and precipitation anomalies are expected these results suggest that even if no relative changes in precipitation anomalies are expected they are not sufficient to understand and characterize future drought events which are also influenced by temperature anomalies the multivariate frequency analysis showed to be a fundamental tool for a more reliable and realistic characterization of extreme events which can be used for risk assessment in different applications agronomists can use the methodology to assist the modeling of agricultural productivity and the risk of crop failure with the occurrence of climate extremes water resources professionals can use it to create an operational rule to ensure water security in the face of extreme events in essence the use of a multivariate framework can help politicians decision makers and the whole community in water resources management to shape public policies to deal with climate based hazards for future studies the consideration of different variables that may trigger or exacerbate drought events such as soil moisture water consumption and atmospheric patterns and the consideration of a larger set of centennial series which are not yet available in the region will certainly improve our knowledge and bring new insights concerning the drivers and the rarity of severe droughts credit authorship contribution statement andré s ballarin methodology formal analysis investigation writing original draft visualization writing review
