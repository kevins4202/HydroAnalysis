24760,dynamic energy budget individual based models deb ibms provide a well tested framework for modelling the acquisition and use of energy throughout the life cycle of organisms these models are often developed using species specific data to link behaviour and physiology and predict how individuals and populations perform in changing environments novel bio logging technology applied to free ranging animals provide detailed information about individual behavioural variations and responses to the environment however so far no deb ibm has attempted to link and parameterise energy dynamics with the fine scale activity data obtained by bio logging to answer questions related to life history events in wild populations the aim of this study is therefore to develop and test a deb ibm framework which integrates individuals behaviour obtained from high resolution activity data our approach uses data collected with gps and accelerometer tags attached to two muskox ovibos moschatus the individuals had different fates one survived the arctic winter while the other died applying hidden markov models to accelerometer data we quantified the variation in behavioural activity budgets in stationary feeding and transit in relation to environmental conditions we subsequently test how differences in time allocation affect fitness outcomes such as body mass energy reserves and survival the proportion of time spent feeding by each animal is used within the deb ibm framework to scale the functional response for food acquisition simulations using the seasonal feeding budget of the deceased individual lead to drastically reduced energy reserves and body weight during the arctic winter and to elevated probabilities of mortality by the end of winter in contrast simulations using the seasonal feeding pattern of the surviving muskox result in much less pronounced losses in reserves and body weight leading to negligible over winter mortality the framework we present here uses standardized modelling techniques is applicable across species and can easily be extended to include other fitness measures or environmental stressors moreover our framework provides the foundation needed for future studies to link individual movements energetic processes life history events and population dynamics in wildlife which would open up possibilities to test how changing future environmental conditions influence animal decision making and ultimately population level consequences keywords bio logging dynamic energy budget theory life history events individual based modelling hidden markov modelling 1 introduction understanding how environmental changes affect individuals populations and communities is one of the fundamental challenges in ecology knowledge of individual behavioural variation and adaptation interactions with conspecifics and responses to the surrounding environment is key to answering questions related to life history events and population dynamics however it is usually difficult if not impossible to obtain such a wide range of information from wild populations approaches based on the characteristics of individuals age stage internal states energy fluxes which have been incorporated in individual based models ibms also known as agent based models abm grimm and railsback 2012 railsback and grimm 2019 matrix population models mpms caswell 2001 integral projection models ipms smallegange et al 2017 and dynamic energy budget models deb kearney et al 2015 sousa et al 2010 meet these challenges by integrating environmental data with individual states to model the dynamics of populations by merging the fields of ecology and physiological energetics kearney et al 2010 2013 kooijman 2010 dynamic energy budget individual based models deb ibms offer a powerful approach to link behaviour and physiology and thus to predict how individuals and ultimately populations perform in changing environments campos candela et al 2018 ijima et al 2019 jusup et al 2017 malishev et al 2018 martin et al 2013 2012 to infer population level processes using an individual level mechanistic approach information on resource acquisition and metabolic allocation over the entire life cycle of individuals that constitute a population is essential at its core the total amount of energy available to an individual can be invested in processes such as growth survival and reproduction raubenheimer et al 2009 van noordwijk and de jong 1986 more specifically in deb theory it is assumed that assimilated energy from the environment is invested in a utilization flux for maintenance m growth g development maturation d and reproduction r metabolic processes and general energy fluxes influence survival s and regulate fecundity f by allocating energy for somatic maintenance maturation and reproduction fig 1 deb theory quantifies these parameters and therefore can be used to explore how environmental factors and internal states affect fitness outcomes because deb theory captures the energy dynamics of organisms at the individual level coupling deb theory with ibms or ipms provides a standardized framework for linking the energetics and behaviour of individuals with processes at the level of populations martin et al 2019 smallegange et al 2017 in fact deb theory is increasingly used in combination with ibms for example to study the effects of food and microclimate on thermoregulation and exercise strategies malishev et al 2018 in addition deb ibms are also used to simulate behaviour dependent home ranges campos candela et al 2018 population dynamics beaudouin et al 2015 de roos et al 2009 goedegebuure et al 2018 martin et al 2012 and even ecosystem processes galic et al 2017 to the best of our knowledge however no deb ibm model has yet attempted to link and parameterise energy dynamics based on the immense amount of bio logging data obtained from wild animals such a modelling approach can greatly facilitate the connection between individual energetic processes metabolic processes life history events and ultimately population dynamics in wildlife technological advances in bio logging enable researchers to collect millions of data points on fine scale individual behavioural processes hussey et al 2015 kays et al 2015 williams et al 2020 novel gps collars with integrated accelerometers tags that communicate with sensors recording internal temperature and heart rate arnold et al 2018 schmidt et al 2020 wilson et al 2015 enable the collection of behavioural and physiological information of individuals at high temporal resolution these data are key to answering a number of ecological and physiological questions related to habitat use animal behaviour activity budgets cost benefit of different movement patterns predator prey dynamics and interactions with conspecifics and surrounding habitat to name but a few amélineau et al 2018 chimienti et al 2017 flack et al 2018 goldbogen et al 2015 langrock et al 2012 leos barajas et al 2017a pirotta et al 2018 the knowledge gained from bio logging technology on animal space use has been used in ibms ibms can be spatially explicit and use information on animal movements collected for example using gps technology and derived activity budgets these models have focused on predicting how the spatial distribution of resources affects the distribution of species and how animals behave in different parts of their home range fryxell et al 2008 fryxell 2004 how habitat characteristics and the memory of individuals motivate patch selection merkle and fortin 2014 how populations respond to changes in food availability boult et al 2019 2018 and disturbance nabe nielsen et al 2018 however it remains difficult to assess how changes in movements and activity patterns in space and time and variations in environmental conditions influence the fitness of animals and dynamics of populations despite these challenges the extraction of such information from novel bio logging technology and its integration into deb ibm approaches is a promising way to quantify the impact of environment dependant variations in movements and activities on metabolic physiology life history events and population dynamics accelerometers that provide 3d acceleration data are among the most powerful and easy to use bio logging devices to obtain measurements of effort and relative energy consumption related to different behaviours and activities nathan et al 2012 wilson et al 2019 metrics as overall dynamic body acceleration odba partial dynamic body acceleration pdba and vectorial dynamic body acceleration vedba are derived from accelerometer data and can be considered proxies of the energy expended on different activities wilson et al 2019 when validated these measurements can provide absolute estimates of energy consumption brown et al 2013 elliott et al 2013 elliott 2012 pagano and williams 2019 more recent bio logging studies based on accelerometer data have investigated relationships between individual activity budgets energetics fitness and survival benson et al 2018 cox et al 2019 sherub et al 2017 as well as energetic expenditure and behaviour during key life events such as the lactation period jeanniard du dot et al 2017 shuert et al 2018 in combination with location and environmental data 3d accelerometer data can be used to measure how different activities in different habitat types are connected to vital events of an individual s life history the energy allocated to different activities in response to environmental factors is then translated into fecundity survival and ultimately into individual fitness fig 1 here we propose a conceptually simple framework that combines these theoretical and empirical fields and that builds on frequently collected high resolution activity data to assess the interaction between behaviour energy use acquisition and life history events in wild populations in particular we use the muskox ovibos moschatus in greenland as a model system to demonstrate how high resolution activity data can be used in combination with environmental data collected from monitoring programmes in a deb ibm approach long term data on the abundance and demography of musk oxen collected in northeast greenland have shown how winter conditions and in particular snow are factors limiting the growth of and survival within the musk ox population mosbacher et al 2016 schmidt et al 2015 muskoxen have almost unlimited access to food for about three months during the short arctic summer while in winter there is a severe food shortage for nine months mosbacher et al 2016 the shortage in food availability during the winter months might severely affect time spent in different activities beumer et al 2020 schmidt et al 2016 hence affecting survival therefore we focus our investigation on this critical period to test the influence of harsh winter conditions on the variation in energy intake affecting individual survival by using high resolution activity data we model the variation of feeding behaviour across a typical arctic winter and extract changes in body mass and survival as a function of feeding rates using the deb ibm framework we expect more marked declines in body weight and lower survival probabilities in simulated individuals following reduced time spent feeding compared to those maintaining higher or constant feeding rates through winter 2 methods 2 1 study species and data collection for the purpose of this study we use data collected from two adult female muskoxen captured during autumn 2017 at zackenberg research station 74 28 n 20 34 w in high arctic greenland the individuals were equipped with gps collars with integrated 3d accelerometer sensors vertex plus 6 collar vectronics aerospace gmbh germany recording respectively locations at 1 h intervals and acceleration at 8 hz in the three dimensions surge horizontal ah sway lateral al and heave vertical av one individual survived through winter and one died in late may 2018 the modelling framework presented herein thus focuses on the comparison of these two individuals survived vs died as a case study to illustrate the integration of multiple data sources to predict individual fitness outcomes 2 2 data manipulation and analysis raw accelerometer data were checked for incorrect or missing recordings and data for the first 24 h after deployment were removed in order to minimize bias due to tagging and handling grøndahl et al 2018 schmidt et al 2016 dynamic metrics of body acceleration were calculated from raw data using a 2 s running mean the time window applied for the running mean was arbitrarily chosen as compromise to reduce noise and to avoid masking behaviourally driven signals the result of the running mean is called static acceleration sh sl sv and provides a measure of the angle of the instrumented animals pitch p dynamic acceleration dx and overall dynamic body acceleration odba were then calculated following shepard et al 2008 and wilson et al 2019 1 p tan 1 s h s l 2 s v 2 180 π 2 d x a x s x where dx is the dynamic acceleration ax is the raw acceleration recorded and sx is the static acceleration for each axis x horizontal lateral or vertical axis dh dl dv 3 o d b a d h d l d v odba is an indicator of general effort invested in different activities as the accelerometer was mounted on the collar pitch indicates neck and head posture of the animal shepard et al 2008 wilson et al 2019 based on data exploration the general knowledge of ungulates behaviours and analysis previously applied to muskox gps data beumer et al 2020 pohle et al 2017 we aimed to characterize three general and coarse behavioural states stationary state 1 feeding state 2 and transit state 3 the datasets were first summarized at 1 min resolution as this was deemed a good balance between resolution of the information retained by the data the aim of estimating coarse behaviours and size of the dataset to be handled a first estimate of these three different behavioural states was made using an unsupervised machine learning technique we used the expectation maximisation em algorithm bishop 2006 implemented in the r package rmixmod lebret et al 2015 to explore the interactions between the two variables pitch and odba and the distribution and shape of the three behavioural states individuals were analysed in separate models without temporal or environmental covariates and mean and standard deviation of odba and pitch values were obtained for each behavioural state the information obtained from the em algorithm was used to guide the starting parameters for the hidden markov model framework hmm to identify the three main behavioural states as function of environmental covariates langrock et al 2012 mcclintock and michelot 2018 pohle et al 2017 muskox behaviour could be affected by both time of the day and month schmidt et al 2016 beumer et al 2020 hence these two variables were added as covariates in the state transition probabilities time of the day was modelled following a 24 h cycle using the cosinor function implemented in the r package momentuhmm mcclintock and michelot 2018 while month was added as nominal variable snow conditions can limit the ability of mammals to access foraging patches and decrease the efficiency of movement beier and mccullough 1990 robinson and merrill 2012 massé and côté 2013 richard et al 2014 and thus affect both the posture and the effort invested in behaviours throughout winter as such mean daily snow depth across the muskox study area schmidt et al 2015 was used as a covariate to estimate parameters of the state dependant distributions of both odba and pitch in the hmm using the dm argument implemented in the r package momentuhmm mcclintock and michelot 2018 a first model mod1 is run without effect on the state dependant distributions the dm argument is then used to indicate the effect snow depth in our case to be used for the probability distribution parameters of each data stream new starting parameter values are extracted from the existing mod1 using the getpar0 function to fit the more complicated model in which dm is then specified see vignette in momentuhmm as we were interested in the rate of variation of snow conditions in the area used by muskoxen during a winter with average conditions we used daily snow depth averaged over 18 years 2000 2017 modelled for the muskox census area pedersen et al 2018 schmidt et al 2015 odba was modelled as a gamma distribution while pitch was modelled as a gaussian distribution hmms were run for each individual separately and tested with varying starting parameters model selection was performed by considering log likelihood for the different starting parameters aic values for the different models as well as visually assessing the behavioural partition produced by the model data manipulation and analysis were performed in r version 3 6 1 within the r package momentuhmm mcclintock and michelot 2018 r core team 2019 2 3 integrating accelerometer derived activity budgets in a deb ibm model to demonstrate the integration of bio logging data and deb ibms to predict relevant fitness metrics and survival we compared the over winter behaviour of the two muskoxen with different fates one survived one died once the behavioural states were classified for each individual via the hmms the daily proportion of time spent feeding was used as input for the functional response f in an adapted deb ibm model developed for muskoxen desforges et al 2019 the deb ibm developed in desforges et al 2019 predicted patterns of growth body condition feeding metabolic rates reproduction and survival of muskoxen the individuals used for this case study did not reproduce schmidt et al 2020 hence the model s ability to simulate reproduction was not used as an extension to the previous deb ibm we integrated high resolution feeding activity information as input for the functional response f individual variability in foraging success and assimilation potential and probabilistic mortality functions based on animal body condition full model description is provided in appendix i for simplicity we assume the energy flux in our deb ibm model to include all nutrients and minerals required the model was used in this case to explore the consequences of the divergent over winter feeding patterns observed for two individuals termed survived and died respectively based on their over winter survival fates because f represents a scaled response between 0 and 1 the daily proportion of feeding derived from the hmm was smoothed and re scaled first we extracted fitted values of proportion of time spent feeding from both individuals using a generalised additive model gam r package mgcv daily proportion of feeding was scaled to the minimum and maximum value of the pooled dataset of both individuals to get values within the relevant range for the functional response i e between 0 and 1 lastly the values were re scaled to a new lower limit foragingthresh 0 3 in order to arrive at final values that support field observations of seasonal and minimal body weight eq 4 appendix i 4 n e w v a l u e o l d v a l u e r a n g e m i n

of both individual used and foragingthresh a new lower limit see fig 2 appendix i the lower limit represents the minimum seasonal value for the functional response the proportion of time spent feeding affects energy reserves and thus all downstream metabolic processes ultimately dictating the rate of starvation and mortality in the deb model desforges et al 2019 stochasticity in the model is introduced for the daily functional response value and the maximum specific assimilation rate of each individual in the initialization of the model population hence affecting reserves and starvation dynamics individual variability is included using a scatter multiplier a log normally distributed random number with a 2 5 coefficient of variation applied to the initial parameter value see appendix i we initiated simulations using 100 individuals for each feeding strategy for the period october may to match the daily proportion of time spent feeding by julian day all animals survived and died started simulations at the same conditions i e body weight reserves the simulations returned predicted daily values of body weight energy reserves and number of surviving individuals appendix i the probability of mortality is modelled within the deb framework as a logistic function of the body condition of the animal measured as scaled total energy reserves etot see also appendix i section 3 6 5

feeding and 7 83 3 5 for transit survived individual 0 88 0 67 for stationary 7 21 1 82 for feeding and 6 16 4 5 for transit mean sd fig 2 distributions of odba values associated with transit had higher variance compared to feeding as well as higher values fig 2 pitch values degrees associated with feeding were lower compared to stationary and transit indicating the animal s head posture was towards the ground values in mean sd dead individual 14 16 5 3 for stationary 47 05 5 3 for feeding and 29 7 8 66 for transit survived individual 5 72 4 47 for stationary 38 74 5 94 for feeding and 24 42 10 27 for transit fig 2 pitch in transit and stationary states had more positive values with stationary showing the animal s head in an upright posture indicating the animal being vigilant and or looking around there were clear differences in the accelerometer derived activity budgets between the two individuals with different fates i e survived vs died primarily in daily proportion of time allocated to feeding and transiting fig 3 from the beginning of january julian day 1 until the end of may julian day 135 the proportion of time spent feeding decreased from 0 45 to almost 0 for the individual that died while the proportion of time spent transiting increased from 0 01 to 0 3 this could indicate unsuccessful searching of food in contrast the surviving individual kept feeding consistently around 0 4 over the winter and 0 10 transiting these patterns were in line with visual observations of the gps data appendix ii figure s1 as the individual that died travelled greater distances and spent more time relocating to new areas compared to the individual that survived proportion of time spent stationary remained rather constant around 0 5 across the winter in the individual that survived the individual that died slightly increased time spent being stationary especially in late winter beginning of spring julian day 55 75 when the proportion of time spent in the stationary state increased above 0 6 fig 3 the emergent energetic and fitness implications of the observed divergent fine scale activity patterns between survival fates were clear from our deb ibm simulations while both seasonal feeding patterns resulted in modelled weight loss during winter food intake in the simulated deceased individuals declined more over time compared to the simulated surviving individuals fig 4 d this divergence in energy intake resulted in a mean weight difference between individuals surviving vs deceased of only 6 kg at the beginning of december mean sd surviving individuals 212 5 kg deceased individuals 206 3 kg for simulation day 320 330 but up to 67 kg by april may surviving individuals 164 8 kg deceased individuals 97 7 kg for simulation day 115 125 the reduced body weight and consequently diminished energy reserves directly influenced mortality rate as winter progressed this risk of mortality increased dramatically as snow depth approached its maximum at the end of february i e during the period where access to food was most restricted fig 4d for the simulated individuals following seasonal feeding activity budget of the deceased individual this resulted in a predicted mortality rate of 0 93 93 individuals 100 simulated died during the simulation and survival probability of mean sd 0 36 0 1 at simulation day 135 predicted time of death aligned closely with the actual date observed in the field fig 4 in contrast to the simulated deceased animals the feeding pattern for the simulated surviving individual was such that energy reserves were never low enough to markedly increase the probability of mortality here model simulations suggested a near 100 survival rate over winter and survival probability of mean sd 0 99 0 001 at simulation day 135 4 discussion standardized mechanistic frameworks such as the deb ibm approach described herein use broadly applicable bioenergetic principles based on theory shedding light on aspects of individual dynamics in a population context martin et al 2012 the collection of data on movements behavioural activities and energy expenditure covering life cycles stages or decades of animal observations crossin et al 2014 elliott et al 2014 weimerskirch 2018 is difficult but it remains essential to cover the full variability of energy consumption and acquisition of an individual or population here we demonstrate how behavioural data collected with bio logging technology can be used in deb ibm approaches to link individual behaviour to life history events and fitness measures i e body weight high frequency activity data such as those recorded by accelerometers provide valuable information on energy intake and various activities of individuals wilson et al 2019 using hmms we first classify different behavioural activities in stationary feeding and transit performed by muskoxen as a function of the most important environmental variable in winter i e snow depth fig 4b the three behavioural states estimated by the hmms were generally associated with low medium and high levels of activity registered by the accelerometer figs 2 and 3 leos barajas et al 2017b lush et al 2016 naylor and kie 2004 wilson et al 2019 while stationary the individuals were mainly still low odba with the head mostly in an upright position which is indicative for an animal that is resting on the ground or standing and vigilant lush et al 2016 feeding indicated that the animals searched for food and were grazing with the head directed towards the ground moreau et al 2009 transit indicated the animal was mainly walking and relocating with varying acceleration and neck positions fig 2 moreau et al 2009 naylor and kie 2004 validation of such accelerometer signals with observational data will enable to quantify the many behaviours currently included in the coarse behavioural states and their associated energy costs winter conditions can be energetically challenging and have been shown to be an important determinant of body condition reproduction and population dynamics of northern ungulates gaillard et al 2000 helle and kojola 2008 schmidt et al 2015 as highlighted by the hmm analysis the individuals tracked showed a divergent response when snow reduced forage accessibility and quality merkle et al 2016 mosbacher et al 2016 food intake in the deceased animal in fact gradually declined over time compared to the surviving individual fig 3 by including the different daily proportion of time spent feeding in the deb ibm fig 4 we were able to translate high frequency activity data into fitness relevant predictions such as body mass energy reserves and survival which are directly related to population dynamic processes as in our prediction variability in individual feeding seasonal patterns is crucial for the survival of muskox individuals under harsh winter conditions fig 4d 4 1 incorporating animal movement metrics in the deb ibm modelling framework although deb ibms are increasingly used to study the effects of environmental changes or exposure to toxicants on animal population trajectories de roos et al 2009 gergs et al 2013 pethybridge et al 2013 individual movements are rarely included in fact most deb ibms are non spatial and movement or activity costs are generalised and pooled with somatic maintenance kooijman 2010 and therefore not explicitly modelled while our presented case study is not explicitly spatial we refer to activity costs indirectly through impacts on forage acquisition processes as shown in our case study at higher movement rates individuals showed lower feeding activities fig 3 appendix ii movement activity and energy expenditure can be measured in wild animals using a variety of bio logging tags recording data at different temporal resolutions hierarchical hidden markov models hhmms a recently developed extension of hmms are able to account for more complex hierarchical structures and offer the possibility to include such variables captured at different temporal resolutions adam et al 2019 using these versatile statistical frameworks provides key variables related to movement patterns activity costs impact of environmental variables conspecifics predation and disease to further implement and parameterise movements and functional responses in the deb ibm framework more recently theoretical models have also opened up the possibility of including simulated individual movements and space use in the deb framework campos candela et al 2018 malishev et al 2018 the inclusion of underlying cognitive processes is fundamental to the prediction of space use patterns fagan et al 2013 although individual memory remains difficult to study ibms enable the integration of processes of perception memory and decision making so that predictions can be made on animal resource selection and space use as well as on effects on reproduction and survival avgar et al 2013 nabe nielsen et al 2018 by combining the functional responses and energy budgets obtained from bio logging data with spatially explicit memory based deb ibm models we can move towards quantifying how behavioural choices and their energetic implications determine population dynamics figs 1 and 4e 4 2 the role of energetics in bridging the gap between individual processes and population dynamics all organisms must strive to maintain a positive energy balance to avoid starvation loss of offspring and death which is why animals maximize their net energy balance by optimizing their movements including individual energy budgets in ibms has been fundamental to modelling populations that are subject to environmental change sibly et al 2013 spatially explicit ibms involving movement energy budgets and fitness esposito et al 2010 nabe nielsen et al 2018 have shown the potential of integrating energetics and individual processes to understand population dynamics although these ibms show the importance of linking spatially explicit food intake and energy consumption they often lack detailed energy measurements that can be obtained using bio logging technology wilson et al 2019 and further modelled in deb approaches the inclusion of realistic low level processes in deb ibms such as high resolution field measurements of energy use and acquisition is essential to ensure realistic predictions of effects of environmental changes stillman et al 2015 highly variable and seasonal environmental conditions as well as ontogenetic developments can trigger metabolic changes in individuals causing torpor aestivation or metabolic acceleration thus reshaping energy balances seasonal torpor and heterothermy have been demonstrated across animal phyla in response to environmental change arnold 2020 boyles et al 2013 carey et al 2003 riek et al 2017 signer et al 2011 deb models have focused on linking physiological responses and individual fitness with environmental variability and ontogenetic development such models take into account metabolic depression during periods of aestivation in reptiles such as the western pond terrapin living in harsh environments arnall et al 2019 or in mussels under extreme conditions caused by tidal cycles monaco and mcquaid 2018 as well as metabolic acceleration during a particular life stage augustine et al 2014 these cases show that deb ibm frameworks have sufficient flexibility in metabolic physiology and demonstrated broad species applicability strengthening their use for linking energetics and environmental conditions to population dynamics in wildlife combined recordings of accelerometer and internal sensors can provide information about changes in behaviour and energy expenditure associated to critical periods i e reproduction and over winter hypothermic strategy schmidt et al 2020 shuert et al 2018 future implementations of deb ibm frameworks parameterized by combined recordings from multiple sensors will help answering questions related to energy and fitness related consequences of environmental changes 4 3 conclusions and future developments with our showcase we linked individual activity budgets obtained from bio logging technology with energy dynamics regulating body maintenance and survival within a deb ibm framework fig 4 with this framework we made a decisive step toward linking individual behaviour to life history events and animal fitness measures opening up to further research questions i how do energy dynamics influence animal condition ii how does animal condition influence fitness iii how does individual fitness affect population dynamics and iv how individual fitness varies in relation to variable environments by investigating the energetic implications of and physiological adaptations to environmental change deb ibm models can be further implemented and parameterised to study changes in the condition and fitness of animals across different life stages bio logging data and the use of standardized modelling approaches such as hmms deb and ibms can facilitate the investigation of various aspects of ecological research from individuals to populations up to the community level there is a need to use bottom up approaches for determining patterns in species distributions species interactions and for a better understanding of spatiotemporal biodiversity dynamics jeltsch et al 2013 we argue that multi disciplinary research utilizing both bio logging data environmental monitoring data and population data in a deb ibm framework is key to advance our understanding of how individual responses shape population dynamics and how individuals and populations interact and respond to current and future environmental change authors contributions all

2001 integral projection models ipms smallegange et al 2017 and dynamic energy budget models deb kearney et al 2015 sousa et al 2010 meet these challenges by integrating environmental data with individual states to model the dynamics of populations by merging the fields of ecology and physiological energetics kearney et al 2010 2013 kooijman 2010 dynamic energy budget individual based models deb ibms offer a powerful approach to link behaviour and physiology and thus to predict how individuals and ultimately populations perform in changing environments campos candela et al 2018 ijima et al 2019 jusup et al 2017 malishev et al 2018 martin et al 2013 2012 to infer population level processes using an individual level mechanistic approach information on resource acquisition and metabolic allocation over the entire life cycle of individuals that constitute a population is essential at its core the total amount of energy available to an individual can be invested in processes such as growth survival and reproduction raubenheimer et al 2009 van noordwijk and de jong 1986 more specifically in deb theory it is assumed that assimilated energy from the environment is invested in a utilization flux for maintenance m growth g development maturation d and reproduction r metabolic processes and general energy fluxes influence survival s and regulate fecundity f by allocating energy for somatic maintenance maturation and reproduction fig 1 deb theory quantifies these parameters and therefore can be used to explore how environmental factors and internal states affect fitness outcomes because deb theory captures the energy dynamics of organisms at the individual level coupling deb theory with ibms or ipms provides a standardized framework for linking the energetics and behaviour of individuals with processes at the level of populations martin et al 2019 smallegange et al 2017 in fact deb theory is increasingly used in combination with ibms for example to study the effects of food and microclimate on thermoregulation and exercise strategies malishev et al 2018 in addition deb ibms are also used to simulate behaviour dependent home ranges campos candela et al 2018 population dynamics beaudouin et al 2015 de roos et al 2009 goedegebuure et al 2018 martin et al 2012 and even ecosystem processes galic et al 2017 to the best of our knowledge however no deb ibm model has yet attempted to link and parameterise energy dynamics based on the immense amount of bio logging data obtained from wild animals such a modelling approach can greatly facilitate the connection between individual energetic processes metabolic processes life history events and ultimately population dynamics in wildlife technological advances in bio logging enable researchers to collect millions of data points on fine scale individual behavioural processes hussey et al 2015 kays et al 2015 williams et al 2020 novel gps collars with integrated accelerometers tags that communicate with sensors recording internal temperature and heart rate arnold et al 2018 schmidt et al 2020 wilson et al 2015 enable the collection of behavioural and physiological information of individuals at high temporal resolution these data are key to answering a number of ecological and physiological questions related to habitat use animal behaviour activity budgets cost benefit of different movement patterns predator prey dynamics and interactions with conspecifics and surrounding habitat to name but a few amélineau et al 2018 chimienti et al 2017 flack et al 2018 goldbogen et al 2015 langrock et al 2012 leos barajas et al 2017a pirotta et al 2018 the knowledge gained from bio logging technology on animal space use has been used in ibms ibms can be spatially explicit and use information on animal movements collected for example using gps technology and derived activity budgets these models have focused on predicting how the spatial distribution of resources affects the distribution of species and how animals behave in different parts of their home range fryxell et al 2008 fryxell 2004 how habitat characteristics and the memory of individuals motivate patch selection merkle and fortin 2014 how populations respond to changes in food availability boult et al 2019 2018 and disturbance nabe nielsen et al 2018 however it remains difficult to assess how changes in movements and activity patterns in space and time and variations in environmental conditions influence the fitness of animals and dynamics of populations despite these challenges the extraction of such information from novel bio logging technology and its integration into deb ibm approaches is a promising way to quantify the impact of environment dependant variations in movements and activities on metabolic physiology life history events and population dynamics accelerometers that provide 3d acceleration data are among the most powerful and easy to use bio logging devices to obtain measurements of effort and relative energy consumption related to different behaviours and activities nathan et al 2012 wilson et al 2019 metrics as overall dynamic body acceleration odba partial dynamic body acceleration pdba and vectorial dynamic body acceleration vedba are derived from accelerometer data and can be considered proxies of the energy expended on different activities wilson et al 2019 when validated these measurements can provide absolute estimates of energy consumption brown et al 2013 elliott et al 2013 elliott 2012 pagano and williams 2019 more recent bio logging studies based on accelerometer data have investigated relationships between individual activity budgets energetics fitness and survival benson et al 2018 cox et al 2019 sherub et al 2017 as well as energetic expenditure and behaviour during key life events such as the lactation period jeanniard du dot et al 2017 shuert et al 2018 in combination with location and environmental data 3d accelerometer data can be used to measure how different activities in different habitat types are connected to vital events of an individual s life history the energy allocated to different activities in response to environmental factors is then translated into fecundity survival and ultimately into individual fitness fig 1 here we propose a conceptually simple framework that combines these theoretical and empirical fields and that builds on frequently collected high resolution activity data to assess the interaction between behaviour energy use acquisition and life history events in wild populations in particular we use the muskox ovibos moschatus in greenland as a model system to demonstrate how high resolution activity data can be used in combination with environmental data collected from monitoring programmes in a deb ibm approach long term data on the abundance and demography of musk oxen collected in northeast greenland have shown how winter conditions and in particular snow are factors limiting the growth of and survival within the musk ox population mosbacher et al 2016 schmidt et al 2015 muskoxen have almost unlimited access to food for about three months during the short arctic summer while in winter there is a severe food shortage for nine months mosbacher et al 2016 the shortage in food availability during the winter months might severely affect time spent in different activities beumer et al 2020 schmidt et al 2016 hence affecting survival therefore we focus our investigation on this critical period to test the influence of harsh winter conditions on the variation in energy intake affecting individual survival by using high resolution activity data we model the variation of feeding behaviour across a typical arctic winter and extract changes in body mass and survival as a function of feeding rates using the deb ibm framework we expect more marked declines in body weight and lower survival probabilities in simulated individuals following reduced time spent feeding compared to those maintaining higher or constant feeding rates through winter 2 methods 2 1 study species and data collection for the purpose of this study we use data collected from two adult female muskoxen captured during autumn 2017 at zackenberg research station 74 28 n 20 34 w in high arctic greenland the individuals were equipped with gps collars with integrated 3d accelerometer sensors vertex plus 6 collar vectronics aerospace gmbh germany recording respectively locations at 1 h intervals and acceleration at 8 hz in the three dimensions surge horizontal ah sway lateral al and heave vertical av one individual survived through winter and one died in late may 2018 the modelling framework presented herein thus focuses on the comparison of these two individuals survived vs died as a case study to illustrate the integration of multiple data sources to predict individual fitness outcomes 2 2 data manipulation and analysis raw accelerometer data were checked for incorrect or missing recordings and data for the first 24 h after deployment were removed in order to minimize bias due to tagging and handling grøndahl et al 2018 schmidt et al 2016 dynamic metrics of body acceleration were calculated from raw data using a 2 s running mean the time window applied for the running mean was arbitrarily chosen as compromise to reduce noise and to avoid masking behaviourally driven signals the result of the running mean is called static acceleration sh sl sv and provides a measure of the angle of the instrumented animals pitch p dynamic acceleration dx and overall dynamic body acceleration odba were then calculated following shepard et al 2008 and wilson et al 2019 1 p tan 1 s h s l 2 s v 2 180 π 2 d x a x s x where dx is the dynamic acceleration ax is the raw acceleration recorded and sx is the static acceleration for each axis x horizontal lateral or vertical axis dh dl dv 3 o d b a d h d l d v odba is an indicator of general effort invested in different activities as the accelerometer was mounted on the collar pitch indicates neck and head posture of the animal shepard et al 2008 wilson et al 2019 based on data exploration the general knowledge of ungulates behaviours and analysis previously applied to muskox gps data beumer et al 2020 pohle et al 2017 we aimed to characterize three general and coarse behavioural states stationary state 1 feeding state 2 and transit state 3 the datasets were first summarized at 1 min resolution as this was deemed a good balance between resolution of the information retained by the data the aim of estimating coarse behaviours and size of the dataset to be handled a first estimate of these three different behavioural states was made using an unsupervised machine learning technique we used the expectation maximisation em algorithm bishop 2006 implemented in the r package rmixmod lebret et al 2015 to explore the interactions between the two variables pitch and odba and the distribution and shape of the three behavioural states individuals were analysed in separate models without temporal or environmental covariates and mean and standard deviation of odba and pitch values were obtained for each behavioural state the information obtained from the em algorithm was used to guide the starting parameters for the hidden markov model framework hmm to identify the three main behavioural states as function of environmental covariates langrock et al 2012 mcclintock and michelot 2018 pohle et al 2017 muskox behaviour could be affected by both time of the day and month schmidt et al 2016 beumer et al 2020 hence these two variables were added as covariates in the state transition probabilities time of the day was modelled following a 24 h cycle using the cosinor function implemented in the r package momentuhmm mcclintock and michelot 2018 while month was added as nominal variable snow conditions can limit the ability of mammals to access foraging patches and decrease the efficiency of movement beier and mccullough 1990 robinson and merrill 2012 massé and côté 2013 richard et al 2014 and thus affect both the posture and the effort invested in behaviours throughout winter as such mean daily snow depth across the muskox study area schmidt et al 2015 was used as a covariate to estimate parameters of the state dependant distributions of both odba and pitch in the hmm using the dm argument implemented in the r package momentuhmm mcclintock and michelot 2018 a first model mod1 is run without effect on the state dependant distributions the dm argument is then used to indicate the effect snow depth in our case to be used for the probability distribution parameters of each data stream new starting parameter values are extracted from the existing mod1 using the getpar0 function to fit the more complicated model in which dm is then specified see vignette in momentuhmm as we were interested in the rate of variation of snow conditions in the area used by muskoxen during a winter with average conditions we used daily snow depth averaged over 18 years 2000 2017 modelled for the muskox census area pedersen et al 2018 schmidt et al 2015 odba was modelled as a gamma distribution while pitch was modelled as a gaussian distribution hmms were run for each individual separately and tested with varying starting parameters model selection was performed by considering log likelihood for the different starting parameters aic values for the different models as well as visually assessing the behavioural partition produced by the model data manipulation and analysis were performed in r version 3 6 1 within the r package momentuhmm mcclintock and michelot 2018 r core team 2019 2 3 integrating accelerometer derived activity budgets in a deb ibm model to demonstrate the integration of bio logging data and deb ibms to predict relevant fitness metrics and survival we compared the over winter behaviour of the two muskoxen with different fates one survived one died once the behavioural states were classified for each individual via the hmms the daily proportion of time spent feeding was used as input for the functional response f in an adapted deb ibm model developed for muskoxen desforges et al 2019 the deb ibm developed in desforges et al 2019 predicted patterns of growth body condition feeding metabolic rates reproduction and survival of muskoxen the individuals used for this case study did not reproduce schmidt et al 2020 hence the model s ability to simulate reproduction was not used as an extension to the previous deb ibm we integrated high resolution feeding activity information as input for the functional response f individual variability in foraging success and assimilation potential and probabilistic mortality functions based on animal body condition full model description is provided in appendix i for simplicity we assume the energy flux in our deb ibm model to include all nutrients and minerals required the model was used in this case to explore the consequences of the divergent over winter feeding patterns observed for two individuals termed survived and died respectively based on their over winter survival fates because f represents a scaled response between 0 and 1 the daily proportion of feeding derived from the hmm was smoothed and re scaled first we extracted fitted values of proportion of time spent feeding from both individuals using a generalised additive model gam r package mgcv daily proportion of feeding was scaled to the minimum and maximum value of the pooled dataset of both individuals to get values within the relevant range for the functional response i e between 0 and 1 lastly the values were re scaled to a new lower limit foragingthresh 0 3 in order to arrive at final values that support field observations of seasonal and minimal body weight eq 4 appendix i 4 n e w v a l u e o l d v a l u e r a n g e m i n

of both individual used and foragingthresh a new lower limit see fig 2 appendix i the lower limit represents the minimum seasonal value for the functional response the proportion of time spent feeding affects energy reserves and thus all downstream metabolic processes ultimately dictating the rate of starvation and mortality in the deb model desforges et al 2019 stochasticity in the model is introduced for the daily functional response value and the maximum specific assimilation rate of each individual in the initialization of the model population hence affecting reserves and starvation dynamics individual variability is included using a scatter multiplier a log normally distributed random number with a 2 5 coefficient of variation applied to the initial parameter value see appendix i we initiated simulations using 100 individuals for each feeding strategy for the period october may to match the daily proportion of time spent feeding by julian day all animals survived and died started simulations at the same conditions i e body weight reserves the simulations returned predicted daily values of body weight energy reserves and number of surviving individuals appendix i the

feeding and 7 83 3 5 for transit survived individual 0 88 0 67 for stationary 7 21 1 82 for feeding and 6 16 4 5 for transit mean sd fig 2 distributions of odba values associated with transit had higher variance compared to feeding as well as higher values fig 2 pitch values degrees associated with feeding were lower compared to stationary and transit indicating the animal s head posture was

42 10 27 for transit fig 2 pitch in transit and stationary states had more positive values with stationary showing the animal s head in an upright posture indicating the animal being vigilant and or looking around there were clear differences in the accelerometer derived activity budgets between the two individuals with different fates i e survived vs died primarily in daily proportion of time allocated to feeding and transiting fig 3 from the beginning of january julian day 1 until the end of may julian day 135 the proportion of time spent feeding decreased from 0 45 to almost 0 for the individual that died while the proportion of time spent transiting increased from 0 01 to 0 3 this could indicate unsuccessful searching of food in contrast the surviving individual kept feeding consistently around 0 4 over the winter and 0 10 transiting these patterns were in line with visual observations of the gps data appendix ii figure s1 as the individual that died travelled greater distances and spent more time relocating to new areas compared to the individual that survived proportion of time spent stationary remained rather constant around 0 5 across the winter in the individual that survived the individual that died slightly increased time spent being stationary especially in late winter beginning of spring julian day 55 75 when the proportion of time spent in the stationary state increased above 0 6 fig 3 the emergent energetic and fitness implications of the observed divergent fine scale activity patterns between survival fates were clear from our deb ibm simulations while both seasonal feeding patterns resulted in modelled weight loss during winter food intake in the simulated deceased individuals declined more over time compared to the simulated surviving individuals fig 4 d this divergence in energy intake resulted in a mean weight difference between individuals surviving vs deceased of only 6 kg at the beginning of december mean sd surviving individuals 212 5 kg deceased individuals 206 3 kg for simulation day 320 330 but up to 67 kg by april may surviving individuals 164 8 kg deceased individuals 97 7 kg for simulation day 115 125 the reduced body weight and consequently diminished energy reserves directly influenced mortality rate as winter progressed this risk of mortality increased dramatically as snow depth approached its maximum at the end of february i e during the period where access to food was most restricted fig 4d for the simulated individuals following seasonal feeding activity budget of the deceased individual this resulted in a predicted mortality rate of 0 93 93 individuals 100 simulated died during the simulation and survival probability of mean sd 0 36 0 1 at simulation day 135 predicted time of death aligned closely with the actual date observed in the field fig 4 in contrast to the simulated deceased animals the feeding pattern for the simulated surviving individual was such that energy reserves were never low enough to markedly increase the probability of mortality here model simulations suggested a near 100 survival rate over winter and survival probability of mean sd 0 99 0 001 at simulation day 135 4 discussion standardized mechanistic frameworks such as the deb ibm approach described herein use broadly applicable bioenergetic principles based on theory shedding light on aspects of individual dynamics in a population context martin et al 2012 the collection of data on movements behavioural activities and energy expenditure covering life cycles stages or decades of animal observations crossin et al 2014 elliott et al 2014 weimerskirch 2018 is difficult but it remains essential to cover the full variability of energy consumption and acquisition of an individual or population here we demonstrate how behavioural data collected with bio logging technology can be used in deb ibm approaches to link individual behaviour to life history events and fitness measures i e body weight high frequency activity data such as those recorded by accelerometers provide valuable information on energy intake and various activities of individuals wilson et al 2019 using hmms we first classify different behavioural activities in stationary feeding and transit performed by muskoxen as a function of the most important environmental variable in winter i e snow depth fig 4b the three behavioural states estimated by the hmms were generally associated with low medium and high levels of activity registered by the accelerometer figs 2 and 3 leos barajas et al 2017b lush et al 2016 naylor and kie 2004 wilson et al 2019 while stationary the individuals were mainly still low odba with the head mostly in an upright position which is indicative for an animal that is resting on the ground or standing and vigilant lush et al 2016 feeding indicated that the animals searched for food and were grazing with the head directed towards the ground moreau et al 2009 transit indicated the animal was mainly walking and relocating with varying acceleration and neck positions fig 2 moreau et al 2009 naylor and kie 2004 validation of such accelerometer signals with observational data will enable to quantify the many behaviours currently included in the coarse behavioural states and their associated energy costs winter conditions can be energetically challenging and have been shown to be an important determinant of body condition reproduction and population dynamics of northern ungulates gaillard et al 2000 helle and kojola 2008 schmidt et al 2015 as highlighted by the hmm analysis the individuals tracked showed a divergent response when snow reduced forage accessibility and quality merkle et al 2016 mosbacher et al 2016 food intake in the deceased animal in fact gradually declined over time compared to the surviving individual fig 3 by including the different daily proportion of time spent feeding in the deb ibm fig 4 we were able to translate high frequency activity data into fitness relevant predictions such as body mass energy reserves and survival which are directly related to population dynamic processes as in our prediction variability in individual feeding seasonal patterns is crucial for the survival of muskox individuals under harsh winter conditions fig 4d 4 1 incorporating animal movement metrics in the deb ibm modelling framework although deb ibms are increasingly used to study the effects of environmental changes or exposure to toxicants on animal population trajectories de roos et al 2009 gergs et al 2013 pethybridge et al 2013 individual movements are rarely included in fact most deb ibms are non spatial and movement or activity costs are generalised and pooled with somatic maintenance kooijman 2010 and therefore not explicitly modelled while our presented case study is not explicitly spatial we refer to activity costs indirectly through impacts on forage acquisition processes as shown in our case study at higher movement rates individuals showed lower feeding activities fig 3 appendix ii movement activity and energy expenditure can be measured in wild animals using a variety of bio logging tags recording data at different temporal resolutions hierarchical hidden markov models hhmms a recently developed extension of hmms are able to account for more complex hierarchical structures and offer the possibility to include such variables captured at different temporal resolutions adam et al 2019 using these versatile statistical frameworks provides key variables related to movement patterns activity costs impact of environmental variables conspecifics predation and disease to further implement and parameterise movements and functional responses in the deb ibm framework more recently theoretical models have also opened up the possibility of including simulated individual movements and space use in the deb framework campos candela et al 2018 malishev et al 2018 the inclusion of underlying cognitive processes is fundamental to the prediction of space use patterns fagan et al 2013 although individual memory remains difficult to study ibms enable the integration of processes of perception memory and decision making so that predictions can be made on animal resource selection and space use as well as on effects on reproduction and survival avgar et al 2013 nabe nielsen et al 2018 by combining the functional responses and energy budgets obtained from bio logging data with spatially explicit memory based deb ibm models we can move towards quantifying how behavioural choices and their energetic implications determine population dynamics figs 1 and 4e 4 2 the role of energetics in bridging the gap between individual processes and population dynamics all organisms must strive to maintain a positive energy balance to avoid starvation loss of offspring and death which is why animals maximize their net energy balance by optimizing their movements including individual energy budgets in ibms has been fundamental to modelling populations that are subject to environmental change sibly et al 2013 spatially explicit ibms involving movement energy budgets and fitness esposito et al 2010 nabe nielsen et al 2018 have shown the potential of integrating energetics and individual processes to understand population dynamics although these ibms show the importance of linking spatially explicit food intake and energy consumption they often lack detailed energy measurements that can be obtained using bio logging technology wilson et al 2019 and further modelled in deb approaches the inclusion of realistic low level processes in deb ibms such as high resolution field measurements of energy use and acquisition is essential to ensure realistic predictions of effects of environmental changes stillman et al 2015 highly variable and seasonal environmental conditions as well as ontogenetic developments can trigger metabolic changes in individuals causing torpor aestivation or metabolic acceleration thus reshaping energy balances seasonal torpor and heterothermy have been demonstrated across animal phyla in response to environmental change arnold 2020 boyles et al 2013 carey et al 2003 riek et al 2017 signer et al 2011 deb models have focused on linking physiological responses and individual fitness with environmental variability and ontogenetic development such models take into account metabolic depression during periods of aestivation in reptiles such as the western pond terrapin living in harsh environments arnall et al 2019 or in mussels under extreme conditions caused by tidal cycles monaco and mcquaid 2018 as well as metabolic acceleration during a particular life stage augustine et al 2014 these cases show that deb ibm frameworks have sufficient flexibility in metabolic physiology and demonstrated broad species applicability strengthening their use for linking energetics and environmental conditions to population dynamics in wildlife combined recordings of accelerometer and internal sensors can provide information about changes in behaviour and energy expenditure associated to critical periods i e reproduction and over winter hypothermic strategy schmidt et al 2020 shuert et al 2018 future implementations of deb ibm frameworks parameterized by combined recordings from multiple sensors will help answering questions related to energy and fitness related consequences of environmental changes 4 3 conclusions and future developments with our showcase we linked individual activity budgets obtained from bio logging technology with energy dynamics regulating body maintenance and survival within a deb ibm framework fig 4 with this framework we made a decisive step toward linking individual behaviour to life history events and animal fitness measures opening up to further research questions i how do energy dynamics influence animal condition ii how does animal condition influence fitness iii how does individual fitness affect population dynamics and iv how individual fitness varies in relation to variable environments by investigating the energetic implications of and physiological adaptations to environmental change deb ibm models can be further implemented and parameterised to study changes in the condition and fitness of animals across different life stages bio logging data and the use of standardized modelling approaches such as hmms deb and ibms can facilitate the investigation of various aspects of ecological research from individuals to populations up to the community level there is a need to use bottom up approaches for determining patterns in species distributions species interactions and for a better understanding of spatiotemporal biodiversity dynamics jeltsch et al 2013 we argue that multi disciplinary research utilizing both bio logging data environmental monitoring data and population data in a deb ibm framework is key to advance our understanding of how individual responses shape population dynamics and how individuals and populations interact and respond to current and future environmental change authors contributions all

24761,periphyton benthic algae forms the base of the lotic food web but under particular conditions can grow to nuisance levels river managers need to understand under what conditions the rivers might develop nuisance periphyton biomass in order to set water quality and quantity limits and support healthy ecosystems factors that promote periphyton growth e g light temperature nutrients and the frequency of flows that remove periphyton the periphyton removal flow have long been recognized as primary controls on periphyton abundance predicting differences in periphyton removal flows prfs between rivers has remained a challenge the main objective of this study is to investigate how bed sediment mobility affects periphyton removal and whether it can be used to better predict prfs at unmonitored sites with acceptable levels of certainty we calculated the sediment based prfs at 113 periphyton monitoring sites in rivers of different sizes and different environmental conditions by finding for a range of particle sizes the entrainment flow that produced the strongest correlation between periphyton biomass measured by chlorophyll a chl a and days since the last exceedance of that flow we then grouped the monitoring sites based on the size of sediment mobile at the prf and identified a suite of environmental variables that best distinguished these groups using a discriminatory function analysis we then predicted prfs at unvisited sites using the same river groupings and associated sediment based flow metrics sediment based prfs were able to be identified at 93 of the 113 monitoring sites across these sites the variance in chl a explained by the sediment based prf r2 ranged from 0 37 to 0 88 and averaged 0 58 94 of these rivers with periphyton data were successfully discriminated into three periphyton removal flow groups together with a non identified group by including 33 out of 44 tested environmental variables e g temperature nutrient concentrations rainfall width the groups were then used to predict sediment based periphyton removal flows for unvisited sites across a broad range of conditions the value of our analysis lies in the ability to predict a range of sediment based periphyton removal flows using only channel slope substrate composition and wetted width while acknowledging that sediment mobility is only one of several mechanistic controls on periphyton this finding nonetheless offers a simple means to identify the range of sediment based periphyton removal flows in a river reach which can help inform river managers about the potential effects of changes in river flows on periphyton chl a graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords rivers benthic algae effective flow sediment mobility stream power 1 introduction periphyton refers to the slimy material found on the beds of water bodies usually consisting primarily of attached algae but often including cyanobacteria heterotrophic microbes and detritus that attach to the riverbed along with phytoplankton suspended algae periphyton forms the base of the aquatic food web power 1990 vadeboncoeur and steinman 2002 graça et al 2018 periphyton growth is mediated by light temperature nutrients substrate flow and invertebrate grazing larned 2010 and abundance is usually measured either as percent areal cover or as biomass i e chlorophyll a chl a dry mass dm or ash free dry mass afdm kilroy et al 2013 proliferation of periphyton in rivers and lakes can have negative environmental economic and health effects for example benthic cyanobacteria produce toxins which have been linked to numerous dog fatalities e g hamill 2001 wood et al 2007 wood et al 2010 wood et al 2017 stream periphyton abundance and controlling factors have been measured for decades and efforts to predict periphyton biomass using regression and process models have been made chapra et al 2014 snelder et al 2014 such efforts have often focussed on the need to set nutrient criteria that assist in limiting periphyton biomass to levels that indicate a healthy river ecosystem e g biggs 2000 dodds et al 2002 herlihy et al 2013 however current relationships based on simple flow habitat and nutrient metrics generally explain low proportions 55 of the variance in chlorophyll a across sites munn et al 2002 dodds 2007 miltner 2010 therefore to manage flows and nutrients in rivers to meet periphyton biomass targets current understanding of other controlling factors must be incorporated into predictive modelling for example neverman et al 2018 set out a strong case for taking into account the role of sediment entrainment when setting flow targets for the purpose of removing periphyton geophysical limiting factors for stream periphyton growth include river flows and associated shear stress which can either directly scour periphyton from the riverbed by current drag or entrain sediment which can then remove periphyton from the substrate rocks by abrasion a range of flow metrics has been used in studies of the effects of flows and flow alteration on ecological indices including periphyton poff and zimmerman 2010 the mean annual frequency of events exceeding three times median flow fre3 booker 2013 has been widely studied and sometimes used in new zealand to represent a threshold for periphyton removal e g biggs 2000 based on the finding by clausen and biggs 1997 that fre3 was the hydrological variable most highly correlated with a range of biological indices when measured across river sites however neverman et al 2018 among others found that fre3 is not always representative of the flow that removes periphyton periphyton removing or effective flow kilroy et al 2020 recently tested the original biggs 2000 equations and developed improved site specific empirical models based on effective flow and other environmental variables apart from nutrient concentrations e g conductivity and three substrate size groups other flow metrics that have been used to predict periphyton standing crop and removal in a more mechanistic context include velocity shear stress and statistics such as the mean annual 7 day low flow or mean flow horner et al 1983 welch et al 1989 biggs and thomsen 1995 saravia et al 1998 periphyton detachment has also been mechanistically modelled as a function of flow and biomass uehlinger et al 1996 labiod et al 2007 more complicated mechanistic models involve periphyton and attachment specific resistance to drag forces asaeda and son 2001 hondzo and wang 2002 tsujimoto and tashiro 2004 the interaction between flow and sediment and the role of entrained sediment in mediating periphyton biomass has been recognized clausen and biggs 1997 biggs et al 1999 myers et al 2007 and statistically modelled luce et al 2010 but has not yet been fully elucidated for example tsujimoto and tashiro 2004 applied a sediment entrainment model assuming that periphyton detaches only when entrainment occurs research by hoyle et al 2017 suggests that discriminating river reaches based on frequency of sediment mobility could help identify reaches with potential to develop nuisance levels of periphyton hoyle et al 2017 focused on three potential mechanisms for periphyton removal current drag abrasion off stationary coarse substrate by mobile fractions of finer bed material under partial transport conditions and molar action by tumbling of the substrate when general mobility occurs they used a 5 year dataset of monthly periphyton biomass as chl a dissolved inorganic nitrogen din dissolved reactive phosphorus drp along with continuous flow records and representative bed surface material size data to 1 determine which flows effectively remove periphyton 2 determine which flows entrain sediment of various sizes 3 identify the key removal mechanism at each site by recognizing which sediment sizes should be mobile at periphyton removal flows and 4 determine whether a common mechanism controls periphyton levels across sites the study found that all tested sediment mobility metrics were better predictors for periphyton abundance than purely flow based metrics the approach taken by hoyle et al 2017 involved site specific 1d hydraulic modelling to estimate flows required to entrain bed sediment which requires observations of site topography grain size distribution and water surface levels at a given flow in this study we extended the work of hoyle et al 2017 and that of kilroy et al 2020 who used seven years of periphyton water quality and flow data across 38 sites in the manawatū whanganui region to empirically predict periphyton chl a our objective was to identify flow thresholds for entraining sediment of given sizes hereafter referred to as sediment based flow metrics that can be used to predict flows that effectively remove periphyton to a low level referred to as the periphyton removal flow or prf across a broad range of river types using only channel properties slope wetted width substrate size grading readily available on national datasets we aimed to 1 identify site specific relationships between periphyton biomass and inferred accrual days since removal events associated with sediment based flow metrics 2 demonstrate that sediment based flow metrics provide improved predictions of inferred prf compared to predictions derived from simple flow metrics e g multiples of the median flow 3 apply statistical techniques to categorise sites based on the size of sediment for which the sediment s entrainment flow best corresponds with periphyton removal and 4 predict prf across the entire new zealand river network using the site categories and relevant sediment based flow metrics to group sites based on the size of mobile sediment that corresponds best with periphyton removal 2 approach our general approach was to calculate prfs across a range of sites using periphyton monitoring data group those sites based on the range of sediment sizes mobile at those effective flows and then identify environmental variables that distinguished between the groups the groups were then calculated for unmonitored sites using the same environmental variables to enable prediction of prf from available data sources the data used in our study included observed periphyton biomass chl a sediment grain size distributions and flow records provided by five new zealand regional councils from 113 monitoring sites along with predictions of river wetted width booker 2010 and river reach slope obtained from the new zealand river environment classification rec national stream network snelder and biggs 2002 hereafter we refer to this network as the rec network which is a digital representation of all river reaches in new zealand for which model estimates of a wide range of environmental variables exist e g leathwick et al 2008 booker et al 2015 our workflow fig 1 comprised three steps the first step was to calculate the prf for each periphyton monitoring site by determining a the critical entrainment flow for selected grain size metrics b the number of days n since each size specific critical flow was last exceeded and c the relationship between periphyton biomass and n for each grain metric eight grain size metrics were chosen grain diameters of 1 mm 2 mm 4 mm 8 mm and 16 mm and cumulative percent particle pass sizes d16 d50 and d84 the critical flow was calculated for each grain size using a stream power based approach that used information on the river bed size distribution flow specific wetted width and slope at each sampled river reach monthly periphyton biomass as chlorophyll a and continuous flow time series were used to determine the number of days n since the grain size specific critical flow was last exceeded on each periphyton sampling visit at each site for each site a sediment based prf was identified by finding the grain size metric that provided the best relationship between periphyton chl a and n the second step was to group the observed sites by sediment based prf and identify environmental variables that distinguish them in terms of the range of sediment sizes that defined their prf nationally available data for environmental variables that affect periphyton growth were used in a statistical method stepwise discriminant function analysis to find the best division between the sites grouped based on the mobile sediment sizes at the prf the third step was to predict the prf at unmonitored reaches across new zealand using the river groups identified in step two these three steps are described in detail in subsequent sections 3 methods 3 1 calculating the sediment based prf for the monitoring sites 3 1 1 site locations and sample collection the analysis required periphyton chl a records corresponding flow time series records and geomorphological information monthly chl a data along with continuous river flow data and estimates of riverbed substrate composition were obtained for 113 sites across five new zealand regions northland manawatu whanganui greater wellington canterbury and southland fig 2 periphyton observations spanned 2 10 years per site table 1 sites in each region were selected to cover a range of river flow variability see fig 3 reaches were selected and periphyton measurements were carried out using standard procedures biggs and kilroy 2000 the sampled reaches were typically located in runs wadable at base flows i e river reaches with a generally smooth unbroken water surface maximum depth of 0 6 m and maximum water velocity of 1 m s 1 for each sampling periphyton was scraped brushed off a uniform area on 10 randomly selected rocks taken from four transects and combined into a single composite sample samples were stored frozen until chl a analysis using ethanol extraction biggs and kilroy 2000 in total 6292 chl a observations were included in the analysis and results from different operators have been shown not to vary significantly kilroy et al 2013 observations of substrate composition were made during the monthly periphyton surveys at all but the wellington sites and were reported as means of 20 visual estimates of percentage cover of substrate on the stream bed of the periphyton observation reach using an underwater viewer with a diameter of 350 mm nuova rade genova italy substrate was categorised into boulders 256 512 mm cobbles 64 256 mm coarse gravel 8 64 mm fine gravel 2 8 mm and sand 0 06 2 mm with category size definitions following the wentworth scale and as used in jowett et al 1991 the monthly observations of the substrate coverage were averaged for each site and converted into a particle size distribution i e cumulative percent of sample passes through against particle size using the middle size of the substrate categories as substrate observations were not available for sites from the greater wellington region we used estimates as calculated by haddadchi et al 2018 the ranges of the median substrate size and the riverbed slope for each region are listed in table 1 the 113 monitoring sites represented strahler stream orders from 2 to 7 with 80 of sites being medium sized rivers stream order 4 6 10 of sites being small stream order 2 3 and 10 being large stream order 7 all monitoring sites were linked to a reach of the national rec digital stream network snelder and biggs 2002 the slope of the linked rec reach was derived from digital elevation models for the corresponding rec network reach time series of daily mean and maximum flows were extracted from continuous flow records at each site the ranges of daily mean and maximum flows over the period of periphyton monitoring varied across the 113 sites due to the varying durations of the periphyton monitoring periods the median daily mean flow for the period of sampling was 10 m3 s 1 at all sites except for waimakariri river at gorge fig 3 3 1 2 calculation of the critical stream power and critical flow for a range of sediment sizes the flows required to entrain bed sediment i e critical flows at each site were determined in a two step process step 1 a in fig 1 first the critical unit stream power was calculated for the eight selected sediment sizes based on the reach slope the unit stream power is the rate at which stream potential energy is dissipated per unit area of stream bed the critical unit stream power is a fraction of the total unit stream power and the amount required to initiate sediment transport bull 1979 this entrainment metric was then transformed into a flow rate using the wetted width of the reach for each site the flows required to initiate the motion of sand 1 mm and 2 mm grain diameters and gravels 4 8 and 16 mm grain diameters as well as the 16th 50th and 84th percentile size of the bed surface material d16 d50 and d84 respectively were calculated this grain size selection was informed by the work of hoyle et al 2017 who explored three mechanisms for periphyton removal current drag abrasion under partial transport conditions by mobile finer fractions of the bed material and molar action by general tumbling of all of the bed material as bedload they found that abrasion was the dominant sediment based periphyton removal mechanism and the sediment size required for effective abrasion ranged from 2 to 16 mm drag occurs with no sediment entrainment and molar action requires entrainment of material sized d50 some investigators gomez and church 1989 parker et al 2011 have argued that unit stream power is a better parameter than shear stress for predicting the initiation of bed material motion in some ways this is a moot argument because stream power formulations are based on a critical shear stress however a key advantage of the stream power approach is that it can be more easily determined from channel characteristics therefore we use stream power as a predictor for sediment mobility in this study we refined the critical unit stream power equation of ferguson 2005 using relationships developed by wilcock and crowe 2003 to account for grain hiding effects i e in mixed size stream beds smaller size sediment grains hide behind larger sizes or larger grains may protrude above smaller grains influencing sediment mobility the formula used in this study for calculating critical stream power based on the logarithmic flow resistance law is defined as 1 ω c i 2 3 κ ρ θ r m r g d i d i d m b 1 1 5 log 30 θ r m d i d m b 1 r d i d 50 e m s where ωci is the unit critical stream power required to move sediment size di w m 2 ρs is the sediment density taken as 2650 kg m 3 r is the submerged specific gravity taken as 1 65 ρ is the density of water taken as 1000 kg m 3 g is the gravitational acceleration taken as 9 81 m s 2 k is the von kármán s constant taken as 0 4 e is the root of the natural logarithm 2 718 m is the dimensionless factor for roughness height ranging from 1 to 10 depending on how poorly sorted the bed is here taken as 1 for a well sorted bed and s is the slope of the river reach compared with the critical stream power formula of ferguson 2005 which used the geometric mean grain size to represent the roughness height a parameter characterising the surface roughness the median grain diameter d50 was used in eq 1 as yen 2002 and parker 2008 indicated that this better represents roughness height the term θrm in eq 1 is a dimensionless reference shields number adopted from wilcock and crowe 2003 this refers to a fixed dimensionless transport rate and is calculated using the sand proportion on the bed surface fs 2 θ r m 0 021 0 015 e 20 f s the surface mean grain size dm is calculated as 3 d m j 1 n d j f j where fj is the fraction of each sediment size dj the exponent b in eq 1 can be calculated by using the entrained size diameter di and mean grain size dm ferguson 2005 used a constant exponent b to calculate critical stream power whereas the hiding function of wilcock and crowe 2003 which we applied in this study uses a non linear function of the ratio of entrained sediment size to mean grain size for exponent b 4 b 0 67 1 e 1 5 d i d m in addition to the logarithmic flow resistance law log law critical stream power values were calculated using the manning strickler law to check the estimates using a different method 5 ω c i a ρ g 3 2 θ r m d i b d m b 1 r 5 3 s d 50 1 6 the unit critical stream power ωci is related to the unit critical flow qci in m2s 1 by 6 ω c i ρ g q c i s finally the critical flow qci was determined from the wetted width of the river w in m and unit critical flow in the river reach 7 q c i q c i w the wetted width was determined using the site specific power law relationship between discharge and reach mean wetted width that was developed empirically by relating power law parameters to catchment properties across new zealand by booker 2010 in summary to calculate critical flow for a specific sediment size di the only required parameters are the river bed substrate size distribution fj the wetted width w and the river gradient slope s all of which are available at the national scale for new zealand 3 1 3 identification of the prf at each site to determine the most relevant prf for each periphyton monitoring site first critical flows to initiate the motion of eight grain sizes were calculated then by using daily mean and maximum flow records the number of days n since these critical flows for each grain size were last exceeded on each periphyton sampling date was determined i e when flows equalled or exceeded the critical flow required to move each of the chosen sediment sizes step 1 b in fig 1 the relationship between the number of days n and periphyton biomass chl a for each grain size was evaluated visually and by fitting linear regressions to log transformed n and log transformed chl a for each site step 1 c in fig 1 from these eight relationships per site the sediment based flow metric that best predicted periphyton biomass as indicated by the highest explanatory power high coefficients of determination r2 values was taken as the sediment based effective flow metric for each site sites at which the relationships varied little across the range of sediment based flow metrics were judged as having no identifiable sediment based prf a cut off r2 value of 0 35 for a linear fit to log transformed chlorophyll a and log transformed number of days was used to select sites with non identifiable prf 3 2 grouping and discriminating monitoring sites 3 2 1 statistical test used to group rivers in the next step step 2 in fig 1 the monitoring sites were assigned one of four prf categories based on the range of sediment sizes that defined their prf e g sites with effective flow defined by mobility of 1 mm 2 mm 4 mm or 8 mm grains were grouped into one category variables linked to the rec network table 2 were used in statistical tests to determine the best division of the sites into the groups we used a stepwise discriminant function analysis dfa which classifies samples into groups using the maximum likelihood technique and minimisation of wilk s lambda by this method we can classify sites into groups and identify the environmental variables that provide the greatest discrimination between each group however the main goal of using the dfa test in this study was to select the groups efficiently rather than identifying environmental variables with highest discriminatory power the basis of dfa is to provide a set of weightings that maximally discriminate the groups the weightings can then be used on sites that are not assigned to a group to provide a probability of them belonging to each of the groups the prf based identity was the dependent variable whereas the 43 nationally available environmental predictors i e available across the whole rec network were the independent variables the number of groups and distinctions between the groups were user inputs while the discriminatory power between the groups was calculated by the dfa the dfa test requires that no discriminatory variable be perfectly correlated with another variable i e r2 0 99 collinearity among environmental variables was checked during the stepwise dfa variable selection phase james 1985 queen et al 2002 sardinha and pinto 2019 3 2 2 nationally available environmental variables for predicting prf groups a range of potential explanatory variables used in the dfa statistical test variables had previously been mapped onto the rec network leathwick et al 2008 booker et al 2015 and were therefore available for our predictive model we limited candidate predictor variables to those with a justifiable physical basis for being related to periphyton biomass through hydrology habitat temperature or nutrient concentrations as indicated in table 2 predictors fell into nine categories rainfall was represented by various parameters showing different characteristics of precipitation flow magnitude parameters were included as primary drivers of periphyton biomass channel morphology was represented by estimates of reach slope sinuosity and width at different flows booker 2010 bed substrate composition strongly influences the stability of the river bed as large stable substrate moves infrequently and favours periphyton accrual geology of the upstream catchment which has a strong influence on the bed material cover of downstream river reaches and their stability was represented by a geological hardness variable water quality and nutrient availability were represented by electrical conductivity and nutrient concentrations light is an important requirement for periphyton growth and was represented by percent of shade due to riparian vegetation sand size sediment mobility metrics were included as input variables for the test because it has been shown that the flow magnitude that removes periphyton to low levels is similar to the flow magnitude at which sand on the bed is mobilised hoyle et al 2017 estimates of conductivity and nutrient concentrations were derived from unwin and larned 2013 flow variables were derived from national scale hydrological modelling booker 2013 booker and woods 2014 descriptions of catchment regolith were derived from the land resources inventory leathwick et al 2003 bed substrate compositions were estimated for each river reach using a national predictive model developed by haddadchi et al 2018 climate and other attributes were derived from snelder et al 2014 and whitehead 2018 3 3 predicting the prf nationally each river reach in the rec river network was assigned to a sediment based prf group step 3 in fig 1 in following three steps first the environmental variables selected by the dfa were standardised i e transformed into values averaging zero and with standard deviation of one nationally using 8 x s i x i μ i σ i where xi is the value of each predictor listed in table 3 for every river reach μi is the average and σi is the standard deviation for each variable second canonical discriminant function values were calculated for three functions as the product of the standardised environmental variables and the canonical discriminant function coefficients for the selected variables third for each river reach the flow required to mobilise sediments for the assigned group was calculated the sediment based prfs were calculated for river reaches across the whole new zealand river network since two groups comprise a range of grain sizes lower and upper sediment based prfs were estimated for reaches in these two groups we explored the effect of source of flow on the variability of prf by grouping the tested sites according to the rec topographic classes mountain hill lowland or lake fed and considering lower 3 4 and higher 5 order streams 4 results 4 1 calculating the sediment based prf for the monitoring sites 4 1 1 estimates of critical stream power and critical flow at periphyton monitoring sites unit critical stream power values calculated using the log law and manning strickler relationships eqs 1 and 5 were similar for all eight size metrics e g as shown for the median sediment size d50 in fig 4 thus the estimates using the log law eq 1 were used for subsequent analyses 4 1 2 periphyton chlorophyll a and predicted prf using daily mean flows in our analysis resulted in greater explanatory power than using daily maximum flows mean r2 of 0 58 versus 0 53 respectively this is probably because periphyton removal depends on the duration of an accrual period time between prfs as well as exceedance of critical flow thus using mean daily flow ensures that the flow exceeded the threshold for a significant period of the day resulting in significant periphyton removal all results referred to hereafter are those generated using daily mean flows for the 113 sites log n explained up to 88 of the variance in log chl a at a site and the identified sediment based prfs ranged across all tested grain sizes i e some sediment based prfs were flows required to initiate the motion of sediment sizes as small as sand 2 mm to as large as d84 examples of the log chl a log n scatter plots used to identify the sediment based prfs are shown for four sites in fig 5 the mason river site shows an example with no identifiable sediment based prf there were weak positive log chl a log n relationships r2 0 01 0 13 using critical flows for sand to gravel sediment sizes 16 mm and negative relations using critical flows for coarser grain sizes d50 the mataura river site shows an example with strong correlations using critical flows for several grain sizes but the flow required to initiate the motion of 16 mm sediments yielded the highest correlation r2 0 79 and was defined as the prf for this site the waitangi river site shows the best correlation using the critical flow for fine gravel q4mm with r2 0 75 while the twizel river site shows the best correlation using the critical flow for the d50 sediment size fraction r2 0 76 fig 6 shows the sediment based prf determined for each sampling site in almost all cases the best correlations highest r2 values identified the sediment based prf at some other sites like the mason river site shown in fig 5 as the size of mobile sediment increases the relationship with chl a becomes negative and although the r2 value may be high a negative relationship is inconsistent with the underlying conceptual model therefore it was necessary to visually check the relationships and identify the prf for each monitoring site the pattern of sediment based prfs varied across the periphyton monitoring sites across all monitoring sites 11 sites including sites on the hurunui river with qd84 as sediment based prf the mataura river qd16 the selwyn river q4mm and the twizel river qd50 showed very high correlation r2 0 7 49 sites indicated reasonable correlation 0 55 r2 0 7 and 33 sites showed an acceptable log chl a log n correlation 0 35 r2 0 55 no prf could be identified at 20 sites due to weak log chl a log n correlation r2 0 35 for all tested critical flows i e all eight grain sizes these sites were grouped into a non identifiable sediment based prf group and labelled as non in fig 6 of the 113 sites at 34 sites the flows required to mobilise the median and coarser sediment i e d50 and d84 showed the highest correlation with periphyton chlorophyll a in contrast 27 sites had prfs based on flows required to mobilise sand i e 1 mm and 2 mm sediment sizes 4 2 grouping sites based on environmental variables after testing several numbers of groups and different distinctions between groups four sediment based prf groups were identified using the dfa group 1 includes sites where prfs mobilise sand to fine gravel i e 8 mm group 2 includes sites where prfs mobilised d16 and 16 mm size sediment group 3 includes sites where prfs mobilise d50 size sediment and group 4 included all sites with non identifiable sediment based prfs the number of discriminant dimensions and therefore discriminant functions that were used to assign the sites to the groups are the number of groups minus one i e since four groups were selected there are three canonical discriminant functions the stepwise discriminant function yielded a classification matrix indicating that 94 1 of the sites could be classified into the four groups table 3 stepwise selection using wilks lambda indicated that a composite signature of 33 out of 44 variables drp boulder seg rain segripshade seg slope dg ushard mud us

discriminatory power although some selected variables had high collinearity with other variables e g malf and q50 with r2 0 94 these multicollinearities were lower than the threshold value to remove the variables we did not seek to balance explanatory power with the number of variables used in the stepwise procedure i e we simply aimed for maximum discriminatory power using the available data because the purpose of this analysis was to discriminate between sites using linear functions not to determine the influence of environmental variables on the group selection the width parameters i e widthmean and widthq5 followed by nutrient variables i e drp tp and tn and malf for function 3 had the highest scores therefore these variables had the highest loading indicating the greatest importance along with sediment based flow i e q cr log qcr ms sand metrics to predict group membership a scatterplot using the first and second discriminant functions confirmed that the environmental variables selected by the stepwise dfa to characterise the different potential prf groups were well separated top plot in fig 7 similar high discrimination between the groups was found by comparing the first two functions against function 3 to avoid confusion those plots are not presented 4 3 national predictions for prf and assessing the strength of the prediction after normalizing the 33 selected environmental variables the canonical discriminant function values were calculated for each river reach using the coefficients listed in table 3 to identify its location on the territorial map bottom plot in fig 7 and thus assign the sediment based prf group mapping predictions of sediment based prf groups using color coding revealed regional patterns fig 8 for example different groups predominated on either side of the southern alps that divide the south island this is sensible given the differing hydrology and gradients east and west of the southern alps the river groups indicate what flows may remove periphyton based on the flows required to mobilise the group specific range of sediment sizes in group 1 rivers periphyton removal is predicted to occur at flows between less than those required to move fine gravels and higher than those required to move fine gravel q1mm q q8mm in group 2 rivers periphyton removal is predicted to begin at flows between those that move 16 mm and d16 size sediment q q16mm or qd16 in group 3 rivers periphyton removal is predicted to occur at flows that move d50 and coarser size sediment q qd50 in group 4 rivers no sediment based prfs indicative of periphyton removal could be predicted considering all river reaches of stream order 3 in the network group 1 and group 2 were predicted to occur most frequently 65 of river segments rivers with no identifiable sediment based prf 23 were mainly on the northeast coast of the north island and in patches around the south island to reveal spatial patterns the lower and upper ends of the range of normalised sediment based prfs were mapped for river reaches of stream order 3 in the new zealand river network fig 9 flows were normalised by dividing the prf by the median flow q50 as listed in table 2 on the south island smaller normalised prfs were predicted for more mountainous rivers across the southern alps along the spine of the south island though normalised prfs were greater in rivers of higher stream order higher normalised prfs were predicted on the southeast and northwest coasts of the north island on the central plateau of the north island and in the mainstems of large rivers in the south island especially on the southern coast to assess the accuracy of the selected groups prediction of the prf groups at the monitoring sites was compared against the original site groupings after the dfa analysis out of 113 monitoring sites 91 sites 81 were placed into their allocated groups selected groups for monitoring sites are listed in section 3 2 10 sites were grouped with one level of difference between groups e g real group 1 predicted as group 2 or real group 2 predicted as group 1 or 3 and only 4 of the sites were wrongly grouped into non identifiable sites these results indicate that the dfa statistical test was reasonably reliable at selecting the prf groups and that the rec variables successfully reflected the observed between site differences in periphyton controlling variables like slope and hydrology periphyton removal flows were normalised to the site specific median flow and plotted with respect to stream order 3 4 and 5 and their source of flow classes lake fed lowland fed hill fed mountain fed fig 10 the distribution of normalised prfs in each plot was positively skewed regardless of stream order in rivers flowing through different topographic classes except lower order lowland fed rivers however while almost all distributions are positively skewed rivers of higher order yielded a greater frequency of low normalised prfs 40 75 than lower order streams 10 60 5 discussion the aim of our study was to identify prfs based on sediment mobility at 113 periphyton monitoring sites and to use the resulting dataset to develop predictions of prf across the whole new zealand river network using data for 33 additional environmental variables along with the identified sediment based prfs in a statistical test we classified the 113 sites into four groups which were used to generate the predictions considering all river reaches of stream order 3 in the network group 1 prfs correspond with mobility of fine gravels q q8mm and group 2 prfs correspond with mobility of 16 mm or d16 size sediment q q16mm or q qd16 were predicted to occur the most frequently the present study is a partial response to the neverman et al 2018 recommendation to estimate periphyton removing or flushing flows by accounting for sediment entrainment rather than using simple hydrological indices a common rule of thumb is to use the frequency of flows exceeding three times the median flow or fre3 to predict periphyton chlorophyll a and in turn define periphyton removing flows clausen and biggs 1997 tsujimoto and tashiro 2004 toda and tsujimoto 2009 mcallister et al 2016 but research has shown that the fre3 is often only a weak predictor for periphyton abundance and that periphyton removing flows can range from 1 7 to 14 5 times the median flow snelder et al 2014 hoyle et al 2017 some mechanistic periphyton models simulate periphyton detachment using bottom shear stress or velocity thresholds welch et al 1989 saravia et al 1998 fovet et al 2010 while others define flow and biomass dependent sloughing detachment rates labiod et al 2007 unwin and larned 2013 bellmore et al 2014 tsujimoto and tashiro 2004 and toda and tsujimoto 2009 mechanistically modelled periphyton detachment as a function of bed sediment entrainment but only for one study site however the variability in sediment grain size and associated periphyton removal mechanisms abrasion and molar action and critical flows in different river reaches must be considered in this study we defined periphyton removing flows prfs based on flows initiating mobility of eight different sediment sizes and determine prfs for sites across new zealand when sufficient field data are available the magnitude of effective periphyton removal flows at individual sites can be estimated based on the flow record e g hoyle et al 2017 kilroy et al 2020 the advantage of the sediment based approach is that we were able to distinguish sites with different prfs based on independent environmental variables available for all river reaches in new zealand with no requirement for field data attempts to similarly distinguish sites with different flow based effective flows were unsuccessful kilroy et al 2019 hoyle et al 2017 identified sediment based periphyton removal mechanisms and established relationships between critical flows for sediment mobility and effective flows for periphyton removal for a dataset in one region in new zealand our study supported these results and demonstrates that those findings hold true across multiple regions sediment based prfs were identified for more than 80 of all tested sites fig 8 approximately 31 of the sites had best fit sediment based prfs for the largest d84 and second largest d50 grain sizes fig 8 which indicates that at these sites molar action is the main mechanism for periphyton removal hoyle et al 2017 approximately 18 of the tested sites had best fit sediment based prfs for the smallest 1 mm tested grain size which indicates that abrasion is their main mechanism for periphyton removal hoyle et al 2017 we noted that very low prfs median flow were predicted for a large proportion of reaches 30 especially in the south island the reaches are generally in mountainous areas with limited land development snelder et al 2018 and high rainfall snelder and biggs 2002 some unexplained scatter was observed in the log chl a log n regressions for the 113 different monitoring sites we recognize that sediment based prfs are not the only driver or control of periphyton biomass and that the observed scatter indicates that periphyton biomass is influenced by many other variables including nutrient concentrations e g different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus and their bioavailability light conditions shading attenuation through the water column and periphyton mat temperature grazing pressure and other disturbances that may cause sloughing detachment e g larned 2010 in addition spontaneous sloughing of periphyton can occur during long periods of stable flows when periphyton biomass has reached a peak and undergoes natural degradation biggs and stokseth 1996 recognising that other variables influence periphyton biomass our results nonetheless support recommendations by neverman et al 2018 and show that mobility of bed sediment and associated abrasion and molar action are important mechanisms controlling periphyton biomass as almost 60 of the variance in chl a on average was explained by sediment based prfs plots of normalised prfs with respect to stream order and topographic class fig 10 show that flow magnitudes less than the median flow of each site were the most frequent flows at which periphyton biomass removal is initiated indicating that abrasion is the prevalent identified periphyton removal process no matter what the source of flow is note that the median flow which was used to normalise prf is higher in higher stream order than lower stream order rivers which is why almost all distributions are positively skewed fig 10 and a greater fraction of the rivers of higher order 40 75 had low normalised prfs than lower order streams 10 60 comparison of mountain and lowland river flows indicates that mountain fed rivers were more associated with lower normalised prfs than lowland fed rivers a low prf for mountain fed rivers may reflect more continuous removal of periphyton in low nutrient streams than in lowland streams which are more likely to be nutrient enriched mcdowell et al 2013 mountain fed rivers are known for high flow variability and frequency in flood events biggs et al 2005 in addition the same discharge is more potent at entraining sandy bed material in mountainous areas compared with lowland areas by virtue of the steeper slopes of the mountain streams since entrainment is determined by stream power which is governed by the discharge slope product three important issues should be noted when applying the stream power approach to predict the prf first the form drag which potentially influences the proportion of stream power available to entrain riverbed sediments was not considered in most gravel bed rivers the flow resistance is dominated by small scale form drag created by boulders and clast clusters bedforms and bank protrusions high spatial resolution of substrate sediment sizes is required to accurately determine the effect of form roughness on the critical stream power estimation but which was beyond the scope of this study second pool and riffle sequences commonly develop in either supply or transport limited gravel bed rivers therefore hydraulic parameters such as velocity and shear stress differ in pools and riffles compared to uniform flow as an assumption of the stream power approach kironto and graf 1995 found that turbulence intensities were high in pool heads compared with those in uniform flow such that the turbulence profiles are convex in the downstream direction with maximum turbulence well above the bed in contrast turbulence intensities were reduced in pool tails and riffles such that the profiles are more concave than those in uniform flow with maximum turbulence close to the bed the mean bed shear stress and therefore stream power which is the product of mean velocity and mean shear stress is therefore of limited use in pools and riffles because non uniform topography perturbs the turbulent boundary layer local shear stress see wilcock 1996 macvicar and roy 2007 for different estimating methods rather than spatially averaged shear values should be used to properly capture non uniform flow effects on entrainment of sediment transport consequently the calculations in this study apply mainly to river run habitat which approximates uniform flow and in which periphyton monitoring is typically carried out see methods section third is the dependence of critical stream power on riverbed slope although parker et al 2011 demonstrated that critical stream power per unit bed area is less variable with slope than the critical mean bed shear stress the influence of slope on stream power required to entrain river bed sediments should be considered this is especially important in rivers where the gradient changes laterally over the cross section in these cases a single value for critical stream power may not represent the whole cross section improvements in slope measurements using high resolution topographic data e g light detection and ranging lidar for individual river reaches may improve stream power calculations it should be noted that this study only focused on determining the flow magnitudes at which periphyton removal is initiated to better understand the sensitivity of rivers to periphyton growth in addition to the prf values the frequency of prf occurrence should be determined to do this the prf values calculated in this study should be combined with flow duration curves at each site to determine the proportion of time in a year when a river flow meets or exceeds its prf while not undertaken for this study there is the potential do this across new zealand using the flow duration curves estimated for all river reaches in new zealand by booker and snelder 2012 such an exercise could be used to identify 1 places where periphyton are likely frequently removed by flows exceeding their predicted prf and 2 places where flow magnitudes higher than the predicted prf are less frequent which can allow for longer accrual periods permitting periphyton to become established and reach nuisance levels in the latter places nutrient loads are more likely to drive or hinder periphyton growth 6 conclusion in this study we aimed to establish effective flows for periphyton removal based on flows required to move selected sediment sizes these sediment based prfs explained 58 of the variation in chl a at the 93 river periphyton monitoring sites in new zealand for regressions on log transformed chl a a sediment based prf that removes periphyton biomass was identified at 81 of our study sites limitations of our method in defining the four groups i e prfs mobilises sand to fine gravel d16 and 16 mm size sediment d50 size sediment and non identifiable prfs concern the calculation of stream power from which the critical flows required to move sediment of different sizes are calculated our calculation approach does not consider flow resistance due to small scale form drag or turbulence differences in pool and riffle sequences and the river reach slope value is important in the calculation but difficult to measure or estimate accurately our approach allows managers to make first estimates of the flows required to remove periphyton based on only three input parameters river reach slope wetted width and the river group which provides the range of sediment sizes defining sediment based prfs it must be noted that this calculation provides coarse estimates and that the effects of environmental variables other than the three inputs used here especially nutrient concentrations and light conditions can be important in mediating periphyton growth for more accurate predictions river or even river reach specific models accounting for site specific characteristics should be developed data availability statement the data that support the findings of this study are

24761,periphyton benthic algae forms the base of the lotic food web but under particular conditions can grow to nuisance levels river managers need to understand under what conditions the rivers might develop nuisance periphyton biomass in order to set water quality and quantity limits and support healthy ecosystems factors that promote periphyton growth e g light temperature nutrients and the frequency of flows that remove periphyton the periphyton removal flow have long been recognized as primary controls on periphyton abundance predicting differences in periphyton removal flows prfs between rivers has remained a challenge the main objective of this study is to investigate how bed sediment mobility affects periphyton removal and whether it can be used to better predict prfs at unmonitored sites with acceptable levels of certainty we calculated the sediment based prfs at 113 periphyton monitoring sites in rivers of different sizes and different environmental conditions by finding for a range of particle sizes the entrainment flow that produced the strongest correlation between periphyton biomass measured by chlorophyll a chl a and days since the last exceedance of that flow we then grouped the monitoring sites based on the size of sediment mobile at the prf and identified a suite of environmental variables that best distinguished these groups using a discriminatory function analysis we then predicted prfs at unvisited sites using the same river groupings and associated sediment based flow metrics sediment based prfs were able to be identified at 93 of the 113 monitoring sites across these sites the variance in chl a explained by the sediment based prf r2 ranged from 0 37 to 0 88 and averaged 0 58 94 of these rivers with periphyton data were successfully discriminated into three periphyton removal flow groups together with a non identified group by including 33 out of 44 tested environmental variables e g temperature nutrient concentrations rainfall width the groups were then used to predict sediment based periphyton removal flows for unvisited sites across a broad range of conditions the value of our analysis lies in the ability to predict a range of sediment based periphyton removal flows using only channel slope substrate composition and wetted width while acknowledging that sediment mobility is only one of several mechanistic controls on periphyton this finding nonetheless offers a simple means to identify the range of sediment based periphyton removal flows in a river reach which can help inform river managers about the potential effects of changes in river flows on periphyton chl a graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords rivers benthic algae effective flow sediment mobility stream power 1 introduction periphyton refers to the slimy material found on the beds of water bodies usually consisting primarily of attached algae but often including cyanobacteria heterotrophic microbes and detritus that attach to the riverbed along with phytoplankton suspended algae periphyton forms the base of the aquatic food web power 1990 vadeboncoeur and steinman 2002 graça et al 2018 periphyton growth is mediated by light temperature nutrients substrate flow and invertebrate grazing larned 2010 and abundance is usually measured either as percent areal cover or as biomass i e chlorophyll a chl a dry mass dm or ash free dry mass afdm kilroy et al 2013 proliferation of periphyton in rivers and lakes can have negative environmental economic and health effects for example benthic cyanobacteria produce toxins which have been linked to numerous dog fatalities e g hamill 2001 wood et al 2007 wood et al 2010 wood et al 2017 stream periphyton abundance and controlling factors have been measured for decades and efforts to predict periphyton biomass using regression and process models have been made chapra et al 2014 snelder et al 2014 such efforts have often focussed on the need to set nutrient criteria that assist in limiting periphyton biomass to levels that indicate a healthy river ecosystem e g biggs 2000 dodds et al 2002 herlihy et al 2013 however current relationships based on simple flow habitat and nutrient metrics generally explain low proportions 55 of the variance in chlorophyll a across sites munn et al 2002 dodds 2007 miltner 2010 therefore to manage flows and nutrients in rivers to meet periphyton biomass targets current understanding of other controlling factors must be incorporated into predictive modelling for example neverman et al 2018 set out a strong case for taking into account the role of sediment entrainment when setting flow targets for the purpose of removing periphyton geophysical limiting factors for stream periphyton growth include river flows and associated shear stress which can either directly scour periphyton from the riverbed by current drag or entrain sediment which can then remove periphyton from the substrate rocks by abrasion a range of flow metrics has been used in studies of the effects of flows and flow alteration on ecological indices including periphyton poff and zimmerman 2010 the mean annual frequency of events exceeding three times median flow fre3 booker 2013 has been widely studied and sometimes used in new zealand to represent a threshold for periphyton removal e g biggs 2000 based on the finding by clausen and biggs 1997 that fre3 was the hydrological variable most highly correlated with a range of biological indices when measured across river sites however neverman et al 2018 among others found that fre3 is not always representative of the flow that removes periphyton periphyton removing or effective flow kilroy et al 2020 recently tested the original biggs 2000 equations and developed improved site specific empirical models based on effective flow and other environmental variables apart from nutrient concentrations e g conductivity and three substrate size groups other flow metrics that have been used to predict periphyton standing crop and removal in a more mechanistic context include velocity shear stress and statistics such as the mean annual 7 day low flow or mean flow horner et al 1983 welch et al 1989 biggs and thomsen 1995 saravia et al 1998 periphyton detachment has also been mechanistically modelled as a function of flow and biomass uehlinger et al 1996 labiod et al 2007 more complicated mechanistic models involve periphyton and attachment specific resistance to drag forces asaeda and son 2001 hondzo and wang 2002 tsujimoto and tashiro 2004 the interaction between flow and sediment and the role of entrained sediment in mediating periphyton biomass has been recognized clausen and biggs 1997 biggs et al 1999 myers et al 2007 and statistically modelled luce et al 2010 but has not yet been fully elucidated for example tsujimoto and tashiro 2004 applied a sediment entrainment model assuming that periphyton detaches only when entrainment occurs research by hoyle et al 2017 suggests that discriminating river reaches based on frequency of sediment mobility could help identify reaches with potential to develop nuisance levels of periphyton hoyle et al 2017 focused on three potential mechanisms for periphyton removal current drag abrasion off stationary coarse substrate by mobile fractions of finer bed material under partial transport conditions and molar action by tumbling of the substrate when general mobility occurs they used a 5 year dataset of monthly periphyton biomass as chl a dissolved inorganic nitrogen din dissolved reactive phosphorus drp along with continuous flow records and representative bed surface material size data to 1 determine which flows effectively remove periphyton 2 determine which flows entrain sediment of various sizes 3 identify the key removal mechanism at each site by recognizing which sediment sizes should be mobile at periphyton removal flows and 4 determine whether a common mechanism controls periphyton levels across sites the study found that all tested sediment mobility metrics were better predictors for periphyton abundance than purely flow based metrics the approach taken by hoyle et al 2017 involved site specific 1d hydraulic modelling to estimate flows required to entrain bed sediment which requires observations of site topography grain size distribution and water surface levels at a given flow in this study we extended the work of hoyle et al 2017 and that of kilroy et al 2020 who used seven years of periphyton water quality and flow data across 38 sites in the manawatū whanganui region to empirically predict periphyton chl a our objective was to identify flow thresholds for entraining sediment of given sizes hereafter referred to as sediment based flow metrics that can be used to predict flows that effectively remove periphyton to a low level referred to as the periphyton removal flow or prf across a broad range of river types using only channel properties slope wetted width substrate size grading readily available on national datasets we aimed to 1 identify site specific relationships between periphyton biomass and inferred accrual days since removal events associated with sediment based flow metrics 2 demonstrate that sediment based flow metrics provide improved predictions of inferred prf compared to predictions derived from simple flow metrics e g multiples of the median flow 3 apply statistical techniques to categorise sites based on the size of sediment for which the sediment s entrainment flow best corresponds with periphyton removal and 4 predict prf across the entire new zealand river network using the site categories and relevant sediment based flow metrics to group sites based on the size of mobile sediment that corresponds best with periphyton removal 2 approach our general approach was to calculate prfs across a range of sites using periphyton monitoring data group those sites based on the range of sediment sizes mobile at those effective flows and then identify environmental variables that distinguished between the groups the groups were then calculated for unmonitored sites using the same environmental variables to enable prediction of prf from available data sources the data used in our study included observed periphyton biomass chl a sediment grain size distributions and flow records provided by five new zealand regional councils from 113 monitoring sites along with predictions of river wetted width booker 2010 and river reach slope obtained from the new zealand river environment classification rec national stream network snelder and biggs 2002 hereafter we refer to this network as the rec network which is a digital representation of all river reaches in new zealand for which model estimates of a wide range of environmental variables exist e g leathwick et al 2008 booker et al 2015 our workflow fig 1 comprised three steps the first step was to calculate the prf for each periphyton monitoring site by determining a the critical entrainment flow for selected grain size metrics b the number of days n since each size specific critical flow was last exceeded and c the relationship between periphyton biomass and n for each grain metric eight grain size metrics were chosen grain diameters of 1 mm 2 mm 4 mm 8 mm and 16 mm and cumulative percent particle pass sizes d16 d50 and d84 the critical flow was calculated for each grain size using a stream power based approach that used information on the river bed size distribution flow specific wetted width and slope at each sampled river reach monthly periphyton biomass as chlorophyll a and continuous flow time series were used to determine the number of days n since the grain size specific critical flow was last exceeded on each periphyton sampling visit at each site for each site a sediment based prf was identified by finding the grain size metric that provided the best relationship between periphyton chl a and n the second step was to group the observed sites by sediment based prf and identify environmental variables that distinguish them in terms of the range of sediment sizes that defined their prf nationally available data for environmental variables that affect periphyton growth were used in a statistical method stepwise discriminant function analysis to find the best division between the sites grouped based on the mobile sediment sizes at the prf the third step was to predict the prf at unmonitored reaches across new zealand using the river groups identified in step two these three steps are described in detail in subsequent sections 3 methods 3 1 calculating the sediment based prf for the monitoring sites 3 1 1 site locations and sample collection the analysis required periphyton chl a records corresponding flow time series records and geomorphological information monthly chl a data along with continuous river flow data and estimates of riverbed substrate composition were obtained for 113 sites across five new zealand regions northland manawatu whanganui greater wellington canterbury and southland fig 2 periphyton observations spanned 2 10 years per site table 1 sites in each region were selected to cover a range of river flow variability see fig 3 reaches were selected and periphyton measurements were carried out using standard procedures biggs and kilroy 2000 the sampled reaches were typically located in runs wadable at base flows i e river reaches with a generally smooth unbroken water surface maximum depth of 0 6 m and maximum water velocity of 1 m s 1 for each sampling periphyton was scraped brushed off a uniform area on 10 randomly selected rocks taken from four transects and combined into a single composite sample samples were stored frozen until chl a analysis using ethanol extraction biggs and kilroy 2000 in total 6292 chl a observations were included in the analysis and results from different operators have been shown not to vary significantly kilroy et al 2013 observations of substrate composition were made during the monthly periphyton surveys at all but the wellington sites and were reported as means of 20 visual estimates of percentage cover of substrate on the stream bed of the periphyton observation reach using an underwater viewer with a diameter of 350 mm nuova rade genova italy substrate was categorised into boulders 256 512 mm cobbles 64 256 mm coarse gravel 8 64 mm fine gravel 2 8 mm and sand 0 06 2 mm with category size definitions following the wentworth scale and as used in jowett et al 1991 the monthly observations of the substrate coverage were averaged for each site and converted into a particle size distribution i e cumulative percent of sample passes through against particle size using the middle size of the substrate categories as substrate observations were not available for sites from the greater wellington region we used estimates as calculated by haddadchi et al 2018 the ranges of the median substrate size and the riverbed slope for each region are listed in table 1 the 113 monitoring sites represented strahler stream orders from 2 to 7 with 80 of sites being medium sized rivers stream order 4 6 10 of sites being small stream order 2 3 and 10 being large stream order 7 all monitoring sites were linked to a reach of the national rec digital stream network snelder and biggs 2002 the slope of the linked rec reach was derived from digital elevation models for the corresponding rec network reach time series of daily mean and maximum flows were extracted from continuous flow records at each site the ranges of daily mean and maximum flows over the period of periphyton monitoring varied across the 113 sites due to the varying durations of the periphyton monitoring periods the median daily mean flow for the period of sampling was 10 m3 s 1 at all sites except for waimakariri river at gorge fig 3 3 1 2 calculation of the critical stream power and critical flow for a range of sediment sizes the flows required to entrain bed sediment i e critical flows at each site were determined in a two step process step 1 a in fig 1 first the critical unit stream power was calculated for the eight selected sediment sizes based on the reach slope the unit stream power is the rate at which stream potential energy is dissipated per unit area of stream bed the critical unit stream power is a fraction of the total unit stream power and the amount required to initiate sediment transport bull 1979 this entrainment metric was then transformed into a flow rate using the wetted width of the reach for each site the flows required to initiate the motion of sand 1 mm and 2 mm grain diameters and gravels 4 8 and 16 mm grain diameters as well as the 16th 50th and 84th percentile size of the bed surface material d16 d50 and d84 respectively were calculated this grain size selection was informed by the work of hoyle et al 2017 who explored three mechanisms for periphyton removal current drag abrasion under partial transport conditions by mobile finer fractions of the bed material and molar action by general tumbling of all of the bed material as bedload they found that abrasion was the dominant sediment based periphyton removal mechanism and the sediment size required for effective abrasion ranged from 2 to 16 mm drag occurs with no sediment entrainment and molar action requires entrainment of material sized d50 some investigators gomez and church 1989 parker et al 2011 have argued that unit stream power is a better parameter than shear stress for predicting the initiation of bed material motion in some ways this is a moot argument because stream power formulations are based on a critical shear stress however a key advantage of the stream power approach is that it can be more easily determined from channel characteristics therefore we use stream power as a predictor for sediment mobility in this study we refined the critical unit stream power equation of ferguson 2005 using relationships developed by wilcock and crowe 2003 to account for grain hiding effects i e in mixed size stream beds smaller size sediment grains hide behind larger sizes or larger grains may protrude above smaller grains influencing sediment mobility the formula used in this study for calculating critical stream power based on the logarithmic flow resistance law is defined as 1 ω c i 2 3 κ ρ θ r m r g d i d i d m b 1 1 5 log 30 θ r m d i d m b 1 r d i d 50 e m s where ωci is the unit critical stream power required to move sediment size di w m 2 ρs is the sediment density taken as 2650 kg m 3 r is the submerged specific gravity taken as 1 65 ρ is the density of water taken as 1000 kg m 3 g is the gravitational acceleration taken as 9 81 m s 2 k is the von kármán s constant taken as 0 4 e is the root of the natural logarithm 2 718 m is the dimensionless factor for roughness height ranging from 1 to 10 depending on how poorly sorted the bed is here taken as 1 for a well sorted bed and s is the slope of the river reach compared with the critical stream power formula of ferguson 2005 which used the geometric mean grain size to represent the roughness height a parameter characterising the surface roughness the median grain diameter d50 was used in eq 1 as yen 2002 and parker 2008 indicated that this better represents roughness height the term θrm in eq 1 is a dimensionless reference shields number adopted from wilcock and crowe 2003 this refers to a fixed dimensionless transport rate and is calculated using the sand proportion on the bed surface fs 2 θ r m 0 021 0 015 e 20 f s the surface mean grain size dm is calculated as 3 d m j 1 n d j f j where fj is the fraction of each sediment size dj the exponent b in eq 1 can be calculated by using the entrained size diameter di and mean grain size dm ferguson 2005 used a constant exponent b to calculate critical stream power whereas the hiding function of wilcock and crowe 2003 which we applied in this study uses a non linear function of the ratio of entrained sediment size to mean grain size for exponent b 4 b 0 67 1 e 1 5 d i d m in addition to the logarithmic flow resistance law log law critical stream power values were calculated using the manning strickler law to check the estimates using a different method 5 ω c i a ρ g 3 2 θ r m d i b d m b 1 r 5 3 s d 50 1 6 the unit critical stream power ωci is related to the unit critical flow qci in m2s 1 by 6 ω c i ρ g q c i s finally the critical flow qci was determined from the wetted width of the river w in m and unit critical flow in the river reach 7 q c i q c i w the wetted width was determined using the site specific power law relationship between discharge and reach mean wetted width that was developed empirically by relating power law parameters to catchment properties across new zealand by booker 2010 in summary to calculate critical flow for a specific sediment size di the only required parameters are the river bed substrate size distribution fj the wetted width w and the river gradient slope s all of which are available at the national scale for new zealand 3 1 3 identification of the prf at each site to determine the most relevant prf for each periphyton monitoring site first critical flows to initiate the motion of eight grain sizes were calculated then by using daily mean and maximum flow records the number of days n since these critical flows for each grain size were last exceeded on each periphyton sampling date was determined i e when flows equalled or exceeded the critical flow required to move each of the chosen sediment sizes step 1 b in fig 1 the relationship between the number of days n and periphyton biomass chl a for each grain size was evaluated visually and by fitting linear regressions to log transformed n and log transformed chl a for each site step 1 c in fig 1 from these eight relationships per site the sediment based flow metric that best predicted periphyton biomass as indicated by the highest explanatory power high coefficients of determination r2 values was taken as the sediment based effective flow metric for each site sites at which the relationships varied little across the range of sediment based flow metrics were judged as having no identifiable sediment based prf a cut off r2 value of 0 35 for a linear fit to log transformed chlorophyll a and log transformed number of days was used to select sites with non identifiable prf 3 2 grouping and discriminating monitoring sites 3 2 1 statistical test used to group rivers in the next step step 2 in fig 1 the monitoring sites were assigned one of four prf categories based on the range of sediment sizes that defined their prf e g sites with effective flow defined by mobility of 1 mm 2 mm 4 mm or 8 mm grains were grouped into one category variables linked to the rec network table 2 were used in statistical tests to determine the best division of the sites into the groups we used a stepwise discriminant function analysis dfa which classifies samples into groups using the maximum likelihood technique and minimisation of wilk s lambda by this method we can classify sites into groups and identify the environmental variables that provide the greatest discrimination between each group however the main goal of using the dfa test in this study was to select the groups efficiently rather than identifying environmental variables with highest discriminatory power the basis of dfa is to provide a set of weightings that maximally discriminate the groups the weightings can then be used on sites that are not assigned to a group to provide a probability of them belonging to each of the groups the prf based identity was the dependent variable whereas the 43 nationally available environmental predictors i e available across the whole rec network were the independent variables the number of groups and distinctions between the groups were user inputs while the discriminatory power between the groups was calculated by the dfa the dfa test requires that no discriminatory variable be perfectly correlated with another variable i e r2 0 99 collinearity among environmental variables was checked during the stepwise dfa variable selection phase james 1985 queen et al 2002 sardinha and pinto 2019 3 2 2 nationally available environmental variables for predicting prf groups a range of potential explanatory variables used in the dfa statistical test variables had previously been mapped onto the rec network leathwick et al 2008 booker et al 2015 and were therefore available for our predictive model we limited candidate predictor variables to those with a justifiable physical basis for being related to periphyton biomass through hydrology habitat temperature or nutrient concentrations as indicated in table 2 predictors fell into nine categories rainfall was represented by various parameters showing different characteristics of precipitation flow magnitude parameters were included as primary drivers of periphyton biomass channel morphology was represented by estimates of reach slope sinuosity and width at different flows booker 2010 bed substrate composition strongly influences the stability of the river bed as large stable substrate moves infrequently and favours periphyton accrual geology of the upstream catchment which has a strong influence on the bed material cover of downstream river reaches and their stability was represented by a geological hardness variable water quality and nutrient availability were represented by electrical conductivity and nutrient concentrations light is an important requirement for periphyton growth and was represented by percent of shade due to riparian vegetation sand size sediment mobility metrics were included as input variables for the test because it has been shown that the flow magnitude that removes periphyton to low levels is similar to the flow magnitude at which sand on the bed is mobilised hoyle et al 2017 estimates of conductivity and nutrient concentrations were derived from unwin and larned 2013 flow variables were derived from national scale hydrological modelling booker 2013 booker and woods 2014 descriptions of catchment regolith were derived from the land resources inventory leathwick et al 2003 bed substrate compositions were estimated for each river reach using a national predictive model developed by haddadchi et al 2018 climate and other attributes were derived from snelder et al 2014 and whitehead 2018 3 3 predicting the prf nationally each river reach in the rec river network was assigned to a sediment based prf group step 3 in fig 1 in following three steps first the environmental variables selected by the dfa were standardised i e transformed into values averaging zero and with standard deviation of one nationally using 8 x s i x i μ i σ i where xi is the value of each predictor listed in table 3 for every river reach μi is the average and σi is the standard deviation for each variable second canonical discriminant function values were calculated for three functions as the product of the standardised environmental variables and the canonical discriminant function coefficients for the selected variables third for each river reach the flow required to mobilise sediments for the assigned group was calculated the sediment based prfs were calculated for river reaches across the whole new zealand river network since two groups comprise a range of grain sizes lower and upper sediment based prfs were estimated for reaches in these two groups we explored the effect of source of flow on the variability of prf by grouping the tested sites according to the rec topographic classes mountain hill lowland or lake fed and considering lower 3 4 and higher 5 order streams 4 results 4 1 calculating the sediment based prf for the monitoring sites 4 1 1 estimates of critical stream power and critical flow at periphyton monitoring sites unit critical stream power values calculated using the log law and manning strickler relationships eqs 1 and 5 were similar for all eight size metrics e g as shown for the median sediment size d50 in fig 4 thus the estimates using the log law eq 1 were used for subsequent analyses 4 1 2 periphyton chlorophyll a and predicted prf using daily mean flows in our analysis resulted in greater explanatory power than using daily maximum flows mean r2 of 0 58 versus 0 53 respectively this is probably because periphyton removal depends on the duration of an accrual period time between prfs as well as exceedance of critical flow thus using mean daily flow ensures that the flow exceeded the threshold for a significant period of the day resulting in significant periphyton removal all results referred to hereafter are those generated using daily mean flows for the 113 sites log n explained up to 88 of the variance in log chl a at a site and the identified sediment based prfs ranged across all tested grain sizes i e some sediment based prfs were flows required to initiate the motion of sediment sizes as small as sand 2 mm to as large as d84 examples of the log chl a log n scatter plots used to identify the sediment based prfs are shown for four sites in fig 5 the mason river site shows an example with no identifiable sediment based prf there were weak positive log chl a log n relationships r2 0 01 0 13 using critical flows for sand to gravel sediment sizes 16 mm and negative relations using critical flows for coarser grain sizes d50 the mataura river site shows an example with strong correlations using critical flows for several grain sizes but the flow required to initiate the motion of 16 mm sediments yielded the highest correlation r2 0 79 and was defined as the prf for this site the waitangi river site shows the best correlation using the critical flow for fine gravel q4mm with r2 0 75 while the twizel river site shows the best correlation using the critical flow for the d50 sediment size fraction r2 0 76 fig 6 shows the sediment based prf determined for each sampling site in almost all cases the best correlations highest r2 values identified the sediment based prf at some other sites like the mason river site shown in fig 5 as the size of mobile sediment increases the relationship with chl a becomes negative and although the r2 value may be high a negative relationship is inconsistent with the underlying conceptual model therefore it was necessary to visually check the relationships and identify the prf for each monitoring site the pattern of sediment based prfs varied across the periphyton monitoring sites across all monitoring sites 11 sites including sites on the hurunui river with qd84 as sediment based prf the mataura river qd16 the selwyn river q4mm and the twizel river qd50 showed very high correlation r2 0 7 49 sites indicated reasonable correlation 0 55 r2 0 7 and 33 sites showed an acceptable log chl a log n correlation 0 35 r2 0 55 no prf could be identified at 20 sites due to weak log chl a log n correlation r2 0 35 for all tested critical flows i e all eight grain sizes these sites were grouped into a non identifiable sediment based prf group and labelled as non in fig 6 of the 113 sites at 34 sites the flows required to mobilise the median and coarser sediment i e d50 and d84 showed the highest correlation with periphyton chlorophyll a in contrast 27 sites had prfs based on flows required to mobilise sand i e 1 mm and 2 mm sediment sizes 4 2 grouping sites based on environmental variables after testing several numbers of groups and different distinctions between groups four sediment based prf groups were identified using the dfa group 1 includes sites where prfs mobilise sand to fine gravel i e 8 mm group 2 includes sites where prfs mobilised d16 and 16 mm size sediment group 3 includes sites where prfs mobilise d50 size sediment and group 4 included all sites with non identifiable sediment based prfs the number of discriminant dimensions and therefore discriminant functions that were used to assign the sites to the groups are the number of groups minus one i e since four groups were selected there are three canonical discriminant functions the stepwise discriminant function yielded a classification matrix indicating that 94 1 of the sites could be classified into the four groups table 3 stepwise selection using wilks lambda indicated that a composite signature of 33 out of 44 variables drp boulder seg rain segripshade seg slope dg ushard mud us

the variables we did not seek to balance explanatory power with the number of variables used in the stepwise procedure i e we simply aimed for maximum discriminatory power using the available data

selected environmental variables the canonical discriminant function values were calculated for each river reach using the coefficients listed in table 3 to identify its location on the territorial map bottom plot in fig 7 and thus assign the sediment based prf group mapping predictions of sediment based prf groups using color coding revealed regional patterns fig 8 for example different groups predominated on either side of the southern alps that divide the south island this is sensible given the differing hydrology and gradients east and west of the southern alps the river groups indicate what flows may remove periphyton based on the flows required to mobilise the group specific range of sediment sizes in group 1 rivers periphyton removal is predicted to occur at flows between less than those required to move fine gravels and higher than those required to move fine gravel q1mm q q8mm in group 2 rivers periphyton removal is predicted to begin at flows between those that move 16 mm and d16 size sediment q q16mm or qd16 in group 3 rivers periphyton removal is predicted to occur at flows that move d50 and coarser size sediment q qd50 in group 4 rivers no sediment based prfs indicative of periphyton removal could be predicted considering all river reaches of stream order 3 in the network group 1 and group 2 were predicted to occur most frequently 65 of river segments rivers with no identifiable sediment based prf 23 were mainly on the northeast coast of the north island and in patches around the south island to reveal spatial patterns the lower and upper ends of the range of normalised sediment based prfs were mapped for river reaches of stream order 3 in the new zealand river network fig 9 flows were normalised by dividing the prf by the median flow q50 as listed in table 2 on the south island smaller normalised prfs were predicted for more mountainous rivers across the southern alps along the spine of the south island though normalised prfs were greater in rivers of higher stream order higher normalised prfs were predicted on the southeast and northwest coasts of the north island on the central plateau of the north island and in the mainstems of large rivers in the south island especially on the southern coast to assess the accuracy of the selected groups prediction of the prf groups at the monitoring sites was compared against the original site groupings after the dfa analysis out of 113 monitoring sites 91 sites 81 were placed into their allocated groups selected groups for monitoring sites are listed in section 3 2 10 sites were grouped with one level of difference between groups e g real group 1 predicted as group 2 or real group 2 predicted as group 1 or 3 and only 4 of the sites were wrongly grouped into non identifiable sites these results indicate that the dfa statistical test was reasonably reliable at selecting the prf groups and that the rec variables successfully reflected the observed between site differences in periphyton controlling variables like slope and hydrology periphyton removal flows were normalised to the site specific median flow and plotted with respect to stream order 3 4 and 5 and their source of flow classes lake fed lowland fed hill fed mountain fed fig 10 the distribution of normalised prfs in each plot was positively skewed regardless of stream order in rivers flowing through different topographic classes except lower order lowland fed rivers however while almost all distributions are positively skewed rivers of higher order yielded a greater frequency of low normalised prfs 40 75 than lower order streams 10 60 5 discussion the aim of our study was to identify prfs based on sediment mobility at 113 periphyton monitoring sites and to use the resulting dataset to develop predictions of prf across the whole new zealand river network using data for 33 additional environmental variables along with the identified sediment based prfs in a statistical test we classified the 113 sites into four groups which were used to generate the predictions considering all river reaches of stream order 3 in the network group 1 prfs correspond with mobility of fine gravels q q8mm and group 2 prfs correspond with mobility of 16 mm or d16 size sediment q q16mm or q qd16 were predicted to occur the most frequently the present study is a partial response to the neverman et al 2018 recommendation to estimate periphyton removing or flushing flows by accounting for sediment entrainment rather than using simple hydrological indices a common rule of thumb is to use the frequency of flows exceeding three times the median flow or fre3 to predict periphyton chlorophyll a and in turn define periphyton removing flows clausen and biggs 1997 tsujimoto and tashiro 2004 toda and tsujimoto 2009 mcallister et al 2016 but research has shown that the fre3 is often only a weak predictor for periphyton abundance and that periphyton removing flows can range from 1 7 to 14 5 times the median flow snelder et al 2014 hoyle et al 2017 some mechanistic periphyton models simulate periphyton detachment using bottom shear stress or velocity thresholds welch et al 1989 saravia et al 1998 fovet et al 2010 while others define flow and biomass dependent sloughing detachment rates labiod et al 2007 unwin and larned 2013 bellmore et al 2014 tsujimoto and tashiro 2004 and toda and tsujimoto 2009 mechanistically modelled periphyton detachment as a function of bed sediment entrainment but only for one study site however the variability in sediment grain size and associated periphyton removal mechanisms abrasion and molar action and critical flows in different river reaches must be considered in this study we defined periphyton removing flows prfs based on flows initiating mobility of eight different sediment sizes and determine prfs for sites across new zealand when sufficient field data are available the magnitude of effective periphyton removal flows at individual sites can be estimated based on the flow record e g hoyle et al 2017 kilroy et al 2020 the advantage of the sediment based approach is that we were able to distinguish sites with different prfs based on independent environmental variables available for all river reaches in new zealand with no requirement for field data attempts to similarly distinguish sites with different flow based effective flows were unsuccessful kilroy et al 2019 hoyle et al 2017 identified sediment based periphyton removal mechanisms and established relationships between critical flows for sediment mobility and effective flows for periphyton removal for a dataset in one region in new zealand our study supported these results and demonstrates that those findings hold true across multiple regions sediment based prfs were identified for more than 80 of all tested sites fig 8 approximately 31 of the sites had best fit sediment based prfs for the largest d84 and second largest d50 grain sizes fig 8 which indicates that at these sites molar action is the main mechanism for periphyton removal hoyle et al 2017 approximately 18 of the tested sites had best fit sediment based prfs for the smallest 1 mm tested grain size which indicates that abrasion is their main mechanism for periphyton removal hoyle et al 2017 we noted that very low prfs median flow were predicted for a large proportion of reaches 30 especially in the south island the reaches are generally in mountainous areas with limited land development snelder et al 2018 and high rainfall snelder and biggs 2002 some unexplained scatter was observed in the log chl a log n regressions for the 113 different monitoring sites we recognize that sediment based prfs are not the only driver or control of periphyton biomass and that the observed scatter indicates that periphyton biomass is influenced by many other variables including nutrient concentrations e g different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus and their bioavailability light conditions shading attenuation through the water column and periphyton mat temperature grazing pressure and other disturbances that may cause sloughing detachment e g larned 2010 in addition spontaneous sloughing of periphyton can occur during long periods of stable flows when periphyton biomass has reached a peak and undergoes natural degradation biggs and stokseth 1996 recognising that other variables influence periphyton biomass our results nonetheless support recommendations by neverman et al 2018 and show that mobility of bed sediment and associated abrasion and molar action are important mechanisms controlling periphyton biomass as almost 60 of the variance in chl a on average was explained by sediment based prfs plots of normalised prfs with respect to stream order and topographic class fig 10 show that flow magnitudes less than the median flow of each site were the most frequent flows at which periphyton biomass removal is initiated indicating that abrasion is the prevalent identified periphyton removal process no matter what the source of flow is note that the median flow which was used to normalise prf is higher in higher stream order than lower stream order rivers which is why almost all distributions are positively skewed fig 10 and a greater fraction of the rivers of higher order 40 75 had low normalised prfs than lower order streams 10 60 comparison of mountain and lowland river flows indicates that mountain fed rivers were more associated with lower normalised prfs than lowland fed rivers a low prf for mountain fed rivers may reflect more continuous removal of periphyton in low nutrient streams than in lowland streams which are more likely to be nutrient enriched mcdowell et al 2013 mountain fed rivers are known for high flow variability and frequency in flood events biggs et al 2005 in addition the same discharge is more potent at entraining sandy bed material in mountainous areas compared with lowland areas by virtue of the steeper slopes of the mountain streams since entrainment is determined by stream power which is governed by the discharge slope product three important issues should be noted when applying the stream power approach to predict the prf first the form drag which potentially influences the proportion of stream power available to entrain riverbed sediments was not considered in most gravel bed rivers the flow resistance is dominated by small scale form drag created by boulders and clast clusters bedforms and bank protrusions high spatial resolution of substrate sediment sizes is required to accurately determine the effect of form roughness on the critical stream power estimation but which was beyond the scope of this study second pool and riffle sequences commonly develop in either supply or transport limited gravel bed rivers therefore hydraulic parameters such as velocity and shear stress differ in pools and riffles compared to uniform flow as an assumption of the stream power approach kironto and graf 1995 found that turbulence intensities were high in pool heads compared with those in uniform flow such that the turbulence profiles are convex in the downstream direction with maximum turbulence well above the bed in contrast turbulence intensities were reduced in pool tails and riffles such that the profiles are more concave than those in uniform flow with maximum turbulence close to the bed the mean bed shear stress and therefore stream power which is the product of mean velocity and mean shear stress is therefore of limited use in pools and riffles because non uniform topography perturbs the turbulent boundary layer local shear stress see wilcock 1996 macvicar and roy 2007 for different estimating methods rather than spatially averaged shear values should be used to properly capture non uniform flow effects on entrainment of sediment transport consequently the calculations in this study apply mainly to river run habitat which approximates uniform flow and in which periphyton monitoring is typically carried out see methods section third is the dependence of critical stream power on riverbed slope although parker et al 2011 demonstrated that critical stream power per unit bed area is less variable with slope than the critical mean bed shear stress the influence of slope on stream power required to entrain river bed sediments should be considered this is especially important in rivers where the gradient changes laterally over the cross section in these cases a single value for critical stream power may not represent the whole cross section improvements in slope measurements using high resolution topographic data e g light detection and ranging lidar for individual river reaches may improve stream power calculations it should be noted that this study only focused on determining the flow magnitudes at which periphyton removal is initiated to better understand the sensitivity of rivers to periphyton growth in addition to the prf values the frequency of prf occurrence should be determined to do this the prf values calculated in this study should be combined with flow duration curves at each site to determine the proportion of time in a year when a river flow meets or exceeds its prf while not undertaken for this study there is the potential do this across new zealand using the flow duration curves estimated for all river reaches in new zealand by booker and snelder 2012 such an exercise could be used to identify 1 places where periphyton are likely frequently removed by flows exceeding their predicted prf and 2 places where flow magnitudes higher than the predicted prf are less frequent which can allow for longer accrual periods permitting periphyton to become established and reach nuisance levels in the latter places nutrient loads are more likely to drive or hinder periphyton growth 6 conclusion in this study we aimed to establish effective flows for periphyton removal based on flows required to move selected sediment sizes these sediment based prfs explained 58 of the variation in chl a at the 93 river periphyton monitoring sites in new zealand for regressions on log transformed chl a a sediment based prf that removes periphyton biomass was identified at 81 of our study sites limitations of our method in defining the four groups i e prfs mobilises sand to fine gravel d16 and 16 mm size sediment d50 size sediment and non identifiable prfs concern the calculation of stream power from which the critical flows required to move sediment of different sizes are calculated our calculation approach does not consider flow resistance due to small scale form drag or turbulence differences in pool and riffle sequences and the river reach slope value is important in the calculation but difficult to measure or estimate accurately our approach allows managers to make first estimates of the flows required to remove periphyton based on only three input parameters river reach slope wetted width and the river group which provides the range of sediment sizes defining sediment based prfs it must be noted that this calculation provides coarse estimates and that the effects of environmental variables other than the three inputs used here especially nutrient concentrations and light conditions can be important in mediating periphyton growth for more accurate predictions river or even river reach specific models accounting for site specific characteristics should be developed data availability statement the data that support the findings of this study are

24762,livestock production is one of the main contributors to global greenhouse gas ghg emissions the tools provided by the intergovernmental panel on climate change to estimate ghg emissions tier 1 and tier 2 cannot be used as a tool for advising farmers or national policy on how to minimize ghg emissions because these estimates are not explicitly related to any metabolic properties for that we need a metabolic model that obeys mass and energy balances and that models the trade offs between different allocations of energy in the organism throughout the life cycle as a function of environmental variables such as temperature and the amount and type of food the dynamic energy budget deb theory ensures mass conservation and models the transformations of state variable and product formation allowing for explicit ghg emissions estimates therefore we used this theory to build models for four bovine breeds alentejana angus charolais and limousin the goodness of fit of deb models to data is good for all breeds differences in deb breed specific parameters such as the maximum reserve density and the maximum specific assimilation rate explain differences in ghg emissions ultimate lengths and weights and von bertalanffy growth rates accumulated methane and nitrogen production ranges between 0 2 and 2 and 0 1 and 0 7 kg per kg of body weight respectively in terms of accumulated direct ghg emissions there is a strong dependence on breed and age keywords climate change livestock beef dynamic energy budget metabolism enteric fermentation animal growth bovine excretion industrial ecology 1 introduction livestock production is one of the main contributors to global greenhouse gas ghg emissions garnett 2009 leip et al 2010 steinfeld et al 2006 this contribution is driven in great part by methane ch4 emissions from enteric fermentation that exit the animal through flatulence and eructation and by nitrous oxide n2o emissions from animal excretions leip et al 2010 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc provides simple tier 1 factors to calculate animal excretions and enteric fermentation as well as a tier 2 method that enables a refinement of calculations ipcc 2006 tier 2 has been the basis of methods applied by countries in their national inventory reports nir submitted to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc in the scope of the kyoto protocol unfcccnis 2020 ipcc methods are also used abundantly for livestock production impact assessment morais et al 2018a 2018b 2017 teixeira et al 2019 in tier 1 and tier 2 animal methane emissions are determined on a per head basis in kg ch4 head yr tier 1 provides emission values that are different for dairy and other cattle and that vary between world regions based on different weight averages and different milk production averages in western europe the methane emission per year per head is 57 kg for non dairy cattle tier 2 animal methane emissions are proportional to gross energy intake and a methane conversion factor that depends on the type of food concentrate milk or pasture enteric fermentation and the chemical composition of excretions are a function of animal feed type de vries et al 2015 extensive and intensive systems i e with respectively lower or higher amounts of labour and physical capital relative to the agricultural area utilised commonly evident through the respective use of grazing pastures or concentrate feeding as the main source of feeding among other differences have different effects on livestock emissions eldesouky et al 2018 haas et al 2001 morais et al 2018a teixeira 2018 concentrate feed and fresh grass or legumes will trigger different metabolic pathways that produce different outcomes in terms of excretions and emissions hristov et al 2013 kirkpatrick et al 1997 these effects are not just dependant on the energy content of feed but rather on its nutritional characteristics such as the cellulosic contents of vegetable feedstuffs peyraud et al 2009 the response to feed also varies substantially with animal type and breed andrews et al 2004 many authors have proposed improved methods and models to improve the estimation of livestock enteric fermentation hynes et al 2016 stergiadis et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 and nitrogen excretion dijkstra et al 2013 fox et al 2004 smith et al 2000 these methods usually involve bottom up statistical modelling that starts from measurement of the variables such as ch4 emissions nitrogen excretion body weight and gross energy feed intake among others these procedures are thus inadequate for large scale application as they would require replication for all possible feedstuffs and animal breeds also they are not useful in explaining metabolic differences between individual animals or breeds which is of paramount importance for the farmer that wants to improve the genetic make up of their cattle the alternative to these statistical based methods is the use of a mechanistic based modelling theory at the individual level the only metabolic theory that we know that 1 obeys mass and energy conservation laws and that 2 describes the metabolism for the different life stages is the dynamic energy budget deb theory jusup et al 2017 kooijman 2010 deb theory is a process based theory that allows for the understanding of energy and mass flows in organisms providing a more detailed approach to estimating ghg emissions this is made possible because deb ensures mass conservation and uses the generalized macro chemical transformations of the state variables to make it explicit these transformations allow for the prediction of product formation including ghg emissions it is a universal theory since one can use it to model organisms of any species in add my pet amp database add my pet 2020 parameters for more than 2000 species are available additionally the use of deb theory reduces the need for intensive experimentation in search of new statistical correlations and possible causal chains when environmental conditions change a comprehensive set of input data is used to calibrate and validate the deb model but if the calibration and validation of the model for a cow breed is successful the model can then be applied in a plethora of new environmental conditions triggered by events such as climate change due to the fact that the metabolic relationships between the different deb parameters and state variables is always the same and therefore causality is ultimately explicit finally in contrast to statistical models where specific coefficients need to be assessed or updated through experimentation e g different coefficients for different age classes or breeds and do not clearly convey the biological causality underlying the values those coefficients may assume i e the biology is implicit the application of deb theory allows for an easy understanding of what may be causing the differences observed because the biology is explicit with state variables and parameters having a clear biological definition a deb based model can address some of the shortcomings of tier 2 estimates that were acknowledged by ipcc namely it can take into account breed variation in maintenance requirements and diet chemical composition in a coherent form here we develop a new metabolic model based on deb theory to simulate animal growth and direct emissions from enteric fermentation and excretions we calibrate and validate the model for 4 breeds of beef cows in portugal obtaining a distinctive set of deb parameters for each breed we apply the deb model to estimate direct ghg emissions and show how it can be used to minimize cumulative methane production per kg of beef 2 materials and methods the data and methodologies used to estimate direct ghg emissions are detailed here including the tiers 1 and 2 factors and respective equations and the deb based model additionally we synthesize the basic concepts of deb theory that support the development of the model and validate and calibrate the deb model with data for 4 breeds of beef cows 2 1 deb theory deb theory presents rules to quantify the energy and mass flows for the different processes assimilation somatic and maturity maintenance growth maturation and reproduction in fig 1 we present a scheme that summarizes the state variables and the energy flows in an organism represented by the standard deb model while the mathematical description of the energy flows and the parameters are in tables 1 and 2 respectively parameters are breed specific the state variables characterize the biomass and the level of maturity of the organism the biomass of the organism is composed by the mass of reserve the mass of structure and the mass stored in the reproduction buffer reserve e and the reproduction buffer er are typically quantified as the energy j while structure v is quantified as volume cm3 the level of maturity eh quantified by the total amount of energy j dissipated in the process of maturation indicates the current life stage of the organism embryo juvenile or adult the maturity increases from zero to e h b during the embryo stage then birth occurs and the juvenile starts feeding during this life stage maturity continues to increase when maturity reaches its maximum level e h p the organism transits to the adult life stage and starts allocating to reproduction in the organism food is transformed into reserve and faeces p are produced the ingestion of food p x depends on the amount of food available f on the maximum surface specific ingestion rate p x m and on the structural surface area of the organism v 2 3 the assimilation flux p a which depends on the assimilation efficiency κx of converting food into reserve is represented in fig 1 this efficiency depends on the chemical composition of food the reserve is then mobilized p c for all the organism s internal processes a fraction κ of the mobilized flux p c is used first to pay the somatic maintenance costs of structure p s where the proportionality constant p m is the specific somatic maintenance and then for growing p g the fraction 1 κ of the mobilized flux p c is used first to pay the maintenance cost of maturity p j where the proportionality constant k j is the specific maturity maintenance rate and then the rest p r is used to increase maturity eh or maturation during the life stages of the embryo and juvenile when the organism is an adult maturity has reached its maximum and p r is accumulated in the reproduction buffer to be used latter on in the production of offspring in the standard deb model growth at abundant food is of von bertalanffy type 1 l l l l b e r b t where ultimate length l and the von bertalanffy growth rate r b are a function of deb parameters see table 3 for a detailed explanation of the mathematical descriptions of these flows see sousa et al 2008 in the standard deb model there are three aggregated chemical transformations assimilation growth and dissipation taking into account that 1 deb incorporates fully mass and energy conservation and that 2 these transformations have constant stoichiometric coefficients if food has a constant chemical composition it is possible to estimate gas production in the different aggregated chemical transformations assimilation is the conversion of food into reserve with the production of faeces and production consumption of mineral products growth is the conversion of reserve into structure with the consumption production of minerals dissipation is the use of reserve with the production consumption of minerals to fuel somatic and maturity maintenances maturation and the inefficiency of reproduction let us now focus on assimilation in the standard deb model we have 2 y x e a x y o e a o 2 e y c e a c o 2 y h e a h 2 o y n e a n waste y p e a p where y e a represents the yield of on reserve in the assimilation process for example y x e a is the number of c moles of food x needed to produce one c mol of reserve e different species use different compounds to get rid of nitrogenous waste for mammals the compound is usually urea co nh 2 2 finally we have a generalized product p for faeces all organic compounds are assumed to be composed of hydrogen carbon oxygen and nitrogen four stoichiometric coefficients or yield coefficients can be estimated from the four mass balances the two additional yields that cannot be estimated are functions of parameters of the deb model one is the assimilation efficiency κx which is inversely proportional to the yield y x e a and the other is the efficiency of producing feces κp which is inversely proportional to y p e a the other two transformations are growth and dissipation 3 e y o e g o 2 y v e g v y c e g c o 2 y h e g h 2 o y n e g c o n h 2 2 e y o e d o 2 y c e d c o 2 y h e d h 2 o y n e d c o n h 2 2 where y e g and where y e d correspond respectively to the yields of the growth and dissipation transformations in dissipation all yields are determined by the mass balances while for growth the yield of structure on reserve y v e g is related with the deb parameter volume specific cost of growth eg 2 2 the deb model for a cow to model the juvenile and adult cow we used the deb standard model defined in the previous section while for the fetus we used the standard fetus deb model usually known by the acronym stf this model assumes that the fetus has a continuous and very large input of mass and energy from the mother growing linearly in length after a diapause in the womb the cow differs from the average herbivorous mammal mainly because it is a ruminant ruminants have the capacity to enhance digestion by using the microbiome in the rumen in order to break up larger molecules such as cellulose and other carbohydrates a process which other herbivores are unable to perform fermentation converts carbohydrates into volatile fatty acids such as propionic ch3ch2cooh butyric c4h8o2 and acetic ch3cooh acids the main result from cellulose fermentation is acetate while starch fermentation mostly produces propionate and butyrate wilkinson 2004 propionate production is the most efficient retaining all six carbon atoms present in a common carbohydrate such as glucose c6h12o6 both butyrate and acetate production allow only for the retention of four carbon atoms but while the former releases the other two carbon atoms as carbon dioxide co2 the latter releases one as carbon dioxide and the other as methane ch4 lawrence 2004 we focus on a diet mostly obtained through grazing in pastures and therefore consider it to require significant fermentation of cellulose resulting in the release of both carbon dioxide and methane therefore the assimilation process for ruminants can be summarized with the two following sub transformations 4 1 ξ c 1 ξ c y x e a x y o e a c o 2 e y c e a c c o 2 y h e a c h 2 o y n e a c c o n h 2 2 y p e a p ξ c y x e a x y o e a m o 2 e y c e a m c h 4 y h e a m h 2 o y n e a m c o n h 2 2 y p e a p the first sub transformation produces co 2 while the second produces ch 4 the first sub transformation contributes 1 ξ c to the overall assimilation transformation while the second contributes ξc the yields y c and y m are the equivalent yields for the transformations that produce carbon dioxide and methane respectively in other words a fraction ξc of the ingested food x is transformed into reserve producing methane and a fraction 1 ξ c of the ingested food is transformed into reserve producing carbon dioxide considering that the release of carbon dioxide and methane from cellulose fermentation will always be complemented with the release of carbon dioxide from other types of fermentation and respiration the fraction ξc should always be below 0 5 usually and for most deb estimations without further data and for simplicity purposes one uses the same standard compositions for the organic state variables i e n o 1 1 1 8 1 8 1 1 1 8 1 8 0 5 0 5 0 15 0 15 0 5 0 5 0 15 0 15 where each column represents food structure reserve and faeces respectively and each line represents the amount of an element carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen in each c mol for example a c mol of reserve has the chemical composition ch 1 8 o 0 5 n 0 15 although the composition of cattle feed may vary the standard composition used is similar to several of the main feed alternatives table 4 in portugal sown pastures are constituted by a variety of species but clover species trifolium spp are among the most relevant the dry matter ash free of clover grass is constituted by about 47 of carbon 7 of hydrogen 44 of oxygen and 2 of nitrogen the corresponding values for hay which is often used as a supplement are 48 5 45 and 2 respectively in the case of maize also used as a supplement the values the values are similar 49 6 43 and 0 4 respectively these compositions were obtained from elemental analyses available in phyllis2 2020 the same database includes biochemical composition values for materials specifically classified as cattle feed such as maize whole plant wheat whole crop and sorghum although the available values do not cover all the compounds that constitute these materials for instance those containing nitrogen more than half the dry matter content is composed of cellulose c6h1005 hemicellulose c5h8o4 and lignin c15h14o4 but there are also other types of lignin if we consider exclusively these compounds and their respective relative contribution to the total dry matter of maize 32 22 5 on average of wheat 27 16 9 on average and of sorghum fodder 29 28 4 the resulting composition regarding carbon hydrogen and oxygen would be similar to the compositions obtained from the elemental analyses previously mentioned table 4 given these compositions of the feed for our estimations we chose to use the different compositions of the compositions for the organic state variables our matrix of compositions will be n o 1 1 1 5 1 8 1 1 1 8 1 8 0 69 0 5 0 03 0 15 0 5 0 5 0 15 0 15 where again each column represents food structure reserve and faeces respectively for the minerals we use the following compositions n m 1 1 0 0 2 0 1 0 4 2 1 0 0 2 1 0 2 and n m 2 1 0 4 2 0 1 0 4 0 1 0 0 2 1 0 2 where n m1 is for the sub transformation producing co 2 and n m2 is for the one producing ch 4 again each line represents the amount of an element in each mol of a mineral respectively carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen and each column represents one mineral for example in n m1 those are carbon dioxide water dioxygen and urea respectively 2 3 calibration and validation of the deb model for 4 breeds of cows occurring in portugal data regarding a variety of life history traits single point data was collected from the literature for four different bovine bos taurus linné 1758 breeds alentejana angus charolais and limousin table 5 these breeds are commonly reared in southern portugal the alentejana breed is autochthonous to portugal and has its origin in the alentejo region marques et al 2004 pure specimens from the angus charolais and limousin breeds are bred in southern portugal but a considerable portion of the total population actually consists of different generation hybrids combining mostly charolais and limousin breeds among others reis 2010 additional data required included adult body temperature lifespan and total body water needed to estimate specific body densities for the four breeds we assumed an average adult body temperature 38 6 c 311 75 k a natural lifespan between 30 and 35 years x 32 5 11 863 days and a total body water tbw content corresponding to about 65 of the live weight of an adult for charolais specimens about 66 degen and young 1980 tucker et al 2008 besides single point zerovariate data values univariate data sets were also used specifically live weight growth curves priority was given for growth curves obtained from individual specimens but when these were not available growth curves obtained from small sampled populations were considered some growth curves reflected the effect of different experimental treatments mostly dealing with diet composition but not quantity which was ad libitum the observed growth data for each breed which was used is available in appendix a figures s1 to s4 the parameterization i e the estimation of values for the core deb parameters for each breed was carried out through the use of the debtool software matlab version 7 3 0 kooijman 2020 by applying the typical structure of the standard deb model the parameterization process followed the covariation method marques et al 2019 using pseudo data values adapted from the deb generalized animal hypothetical animal described through a set of typical deb parameter values corresponding to a consensus within the community of researchers applying deb theory kooijman 2010 table 8 1 and all data collected for each breed we estimated the parameter values that provide the best estimates for all the life history traits collected table 5 while simultaneously allowing for a good fit to the observed growth curves the parameter that corresponds to the level of available food during growth was set to the maximum f 1 corresponding to situations when food is available ad libitum estimated deb growth curves in red are in good agreement with data blue dots for all breeds figures s1 to s4 in appendix a estimated core deb parameters table 6 include the maximum specific assimilation rate and the volume specific somatic maintenance which are lower for alentejana as well as the energy conductance which characterizes the mobilization rate from reserve which is substantially lower for angus and charolais estimated compound parameters such as the ultimate length l and the von bertalanffy growth rate r b and the maximum energy reserve density em are in table 7 angus and charolais have higher energy reserve densities and lower ultimate lengths while limousin has a higher von bertalanffy growth rate to further validate our deb parameterization we compared values estimated with the deb models with additional data table 8 for breeds of similar ultimate size to those of the alentejana and angus breeds the deb estimated values for the gross energy ge content expected to be found in the daily feed ingested are within or close to the range of recommended daily feed values for females provided by the institut national de la recherche agronomique inra 1988 using the chemical compositions of the state variables and minerals presented in section 2 2 we computed the yields for the various transformations table 9 the yields y x e a and y p e a which are the food or feces needed to produce or obtained from reserve measured in moles are obtained from the assimilation efficiency κ x 0 3 and overhead to feces κ p 0 1 taking into account the chemical composition of these compounds and the specific enthalpies the value of digestion efficiency κ x 0 3 was set to be lower than 0 4 which is the estimated efficiency considering faeces but not other energy losses such as gases or heat the values of defecation efficiency κ p 0 1 is the standard value used in deb the generalized sub transformation that produces methane needs an input of water and has a net production of o 2 negative stoichiometric coefficients however this sub transformation does not occur alone and in the overall transformation of assimilation with a fraction of carbon dioxide to methane production of ξ c 0 3 there is consumption of o 2 the value of ξc was estimated to so that the results are consistent with the ipcc tiers the value is below 0 5 as expected and previously mentioned the aggregated chemical reaction for assimilation is 5 y a 1 ξ c y ac ξ c y am 6 3 49 x 1 12 o 2 e 1 37 c o 2 0 59 c h 4 0 41 h 2 o 0 16 co n h 2 2 0 38 p the first sub transformation produces co2 while the second produces ch4 2 4 ippc nir tier 1 and 2 factors regarding enteric ch4 emissions the 2006 version of ipcc ipcc 2006 provides two different methods tier 1 and 2 with increasing level of detail the tier 1 method is simplified as it relies on default emission factors drawn from the literature it divides the emissions into two types of cattle livestock dairy and non dairy and in eight different regions of the world the main criteria used to differentiate among these regions was milk yield measured in kg milk head year the tier 2 method is applied to more disaggregated livestock categories and depends on gross energy intake ge unit mj head day and the methane conversion factor ym which is the percentage of gross energy in feed that is converted to methane according to 7 c h 4 k g h d y r g e y m 100 365 55 65 where the factor 55 65 mj kg ch4 is the energy content of methane ge depends on the net energies required for maintenance animal activity lactation pregnancy growth and work ratio of net energy available in a diet for maintenance to digestible energy consumed ratio of net energy available for growth in a diet to digestible energy consumed and digestible energy expressed as a percentage of gross energy according to the equation 10 3 10 16 from chapter 4 of ipcc ipcc 2006 maintenance needs are a function of weight and depend on whether it is a lactating or non lactating cow or a bull activity needs that are a function of the feeding situation stall pasture or grazing large areas are proportional to maintenance needs while growth needs decrease with the proximity to adult weight ym is methane conversion factor which depends on several interacting feed and animal factors for feedlot fed cattle the factor is 3 and 6 5 for other cattle classes and diets the main data required to estimate the above mentioned parameters to calculate ge are live weight and daily weight gain of animal milk production for milking and suckler cows feed type pasture commercial feed and animal activity if the animal is used for agricultural operations regarding nitrogen excretion the ipcc provides again two methods tier 1 and 2 ipcc 2006 it recommends that country specific rates should be used in tier 2 nevertheless if country specific data cannot be collected or derived it provides nitrogen excretion rates kg n 1000 kg of animal mass day based on literature review the excretion rate is function of the cattle type dairy cattle and other cattle and the geographical region the same division as in the enteric fermentation emission nitrogen excretion according tier 2 is based on the total annual nitrogen intake and total annual nitrogen retention of the animal 8 n e x c r e t i o n k g n h d y r n u p t a k e 1 n r e t e n t i o n nitrogen intake is function of the amount of feed digested by the animal and the protein content of that feed ipcc proposed the following equation to calculate the nitrogen intake 9 n u p t a k e k g n h d y r g e 18 45 c p 100 6 25 3 results and discussion 3 1 deb model application for beef cows in portugal in this section we will present the metabolic results for the different breeds of cows these include growth and production of ch 4 and nitrogen in urea the core and compound deb parameters were estimated for each cow breed tables 6 and 7 assuring a good fit between observed values and estimates concerning several life history traits and growth curves the quality of the fit is documented through the low relative error re values which resulted from the fitting procedure resulting in mean relative errors all below 0 1 table 5 but can also be visually evaluated through the plots available in appendix a figures s1 to s4 using the parameters estimated for each breed we estimated the growth curves of an individual with the maximum level of available food f 1 the results are presented in fig 2 we present growth in terms of total live body weight and total body length weight is the more standard way of presenting this type of result but weight is a compound variable depending on reserve and structure individuals with the same weight can have different proportions of reserve and structure on the other hand length is directly connected to structure which controls several processes such as assimilation and somatic maintenance growth curves predicted by deb models at abundant food fig 2 are of von bertalanffy type they tend to ultimate length l at the von bertalanffy growth rate r b which is a function of deb parameters table 7 in the context of deb theory the ultimate length is the ratio between the rate of energy mobilized from reserve for growth and maintenance needs alentejana has a higher ultimate length because it has substantially lower maintenance needs the von bertalanffy growth rate controls the rate at which the animal tends to the ultimate length the higher the energy conductance value the higher the von bertalanffy growth rate because energy is being mobilised from the reserve faster limousine has the highest von bertalanffy growth rate because it has a substantially higher mobilization rate to better understand the link between the dynamics of physical length on the left plot of fig 2 and weight on the right plot of fig 2 we should look at weight as a function of physical length fig 3 for the same length the relative weight of charolais limousin and alentejana is controlled by the energy reserve density see table 7 we estimated that alentejana is the breed with the lowest maximum reserve density 23 33 103 j cm 3 followed by limousin 29 43 103 j cm 3 charolais 74 81 103 j cm 3 and angus 75 74 103 j cm 3 although the reserved density does not represent exclusively such traits as the energy stored in fat the differences we observed between these different cattle breeds are in line with what has been previously measured regarding the relative amounts of fat found in animals belonging to these breeds for instance costa et al 2013 measured 6 33 of visceral fat in alentejana bulls carcasses and albertí et al 2008 measured 13 2 15 4 and 21 7 of fat in bull s carcasses of limousin charolais and angus respectively although there may still be some small amount of fat to add to the visceral fat measured in the former study the order of increasing relative amounts of fat found in carcasses of these breeds match with the order of increasing maximum reserve density we estimated mandell et al 1997 compared the fat yield in steers carcass composition of limousin and charolais and also measured higher values for the latter 18 1 and 20 6 respectively coleman et al 1993 had already compared the amounts of fat in carcasses of charolais and angus steers and although the values measured were higher for charolais than in the study by mandell and colleagues the authors measured even higher values for the angus 21 5 and 34 3 respectively for spring born steers and 21 4 and 29 4 respectively for fall born steers our results regarding maximum energy reserve density also align with fat measurements performed in particular organs such as kidneys in the albertí et al 2008 study the increasing kidney fat percentage measured in limousin charolais and angus bulls carcasses consisted of 1 4 1 5 and 2 1 respectively these values were generally low compared to those gathered by marshall 1994 in a pooled across study comparing sires carcass traits but this author also published the same order of increasing fat presence in kidneys of limousin charolais and angus 2 7 2 8 and 3 respectively in their study costa et al 2013 measured about 2 4 of kidney knob and channel fat in bulls carcasses of the alentejana breed i e the lowest value when compared to those in the marshall 1994 study nevertheless comparisons based on just one organ need to be considered carefully in their study zahrádková et al 2010 measured 1 55 of kidney fat in charolais heifers and 2 31 kidney fat in limousin heifers the authors were surprised and explained that this reverse difference could be due to the fact that the breeds sampled groups had different physiological age and the limousin heifers had prolonged fattening periods the higher the reserve per unit of structural volume the higher the weight angus is special because it has the highest energy reserve density but not the highest weight per physical length the explanation is its low shape coefficient δm the shape coefficient controls the relationship between structural length and physical length an angus cow with a physical length of 1 m has a structural volume of 0 02 m3 while alentejana charolais and limousin have structural volumes of 0 04 m3 0 05 m3 and 0 05 m3 respectively this means that angus has a high amount of reserve per unit of structural volume but a low amount of structural volume per cube of physical length thus angus is lighter than expected based on the relative values of energy reserve density as far as emissions are concerned fig 4 shows the methane production while fig 5 shows nitrogen production as urea at abundant food level for the 4 breeds of cows we can see that angus and alentejana breeds are quite similar in terms of methane and nitrogen production for a given length or weight and they produce less methane and nitrogen than the other two breeds there is already evidence that methane production is strongly correlated to feed intake both in the short term minutes to several hours and medium term days pickering et al 2015 in our model the rate of methane production depends on the amount of food ingested which is proportional to the structural surface area of the organism where the maximum surface assimilation rate ṗam is the coefficient of proportionality the way the breeds are ordered in fig 4 results from the combined differences observed in ṗam and δm if we consider one animal of each breed sharing the same physical length e g 100 cm the energy each would assimilate in a day would result from multiplying the respective ṗam by the respective structural surface area i e ṗam ṗam 100 δm 2 at 100 cm of physical length angus alentejana charolais and limousin assimilate 2 9 3 1 4 9 and 6 7 mj d respectively alentejana may have the lowest ṗam about 62 of what we estimate for angus but angus has an even lower structural surface area about 59 of what we estimate for alentejana making it the lowest of the four hence the order observed a similar procedure can be followed to understand the graph in weight of fig 4 the right plot in fig 4 results from the combined differences observed in more deb parameters and therefore the calculations are lengthier essentially charolais has a similar methane and nitrogen production per year as limousin for a given length however for the same weight it is more similar to the more efficient breeds efficient in the sense of producing less methane for the same weight the maximum reserve density of this breed which is more than twice as much as the reserve density of limousine explains this phenomenon the maximum reserve density which is the reserve density of the animal at abundant food is the reserve per unit of structure thus for the same size similar methane production a charolais cow is heavier than a limousine fig 3 for 500 kg the methane production of a limousine cow is almost twice the methane production of the other breeds however nitrogen production fig 5 has a behaviour that is very similar to methane fig 4 because the assimilation process is the main contributor to nitrogen production in contrast to methane production that depends on assimilation only nitrogen production also depends on growth and dissipation fig 6 3 2 comparison with ippc nir tier 1 and 2 factors tier 2 method for enteric fermentation was already applied to portugal on the nir apa 2019 considering average portuguese livestock population data and based on expert judgment livestock population was divided into 2 main classes dairy cattle and other cattle other cattle class was divided in 10 different classes for enteric fermentation and 5 classes for n excretion depending on the age sex and animal function e g replacement or beef production regarding other cattle classes nir used data from the 17 breeders associations existing in portugal this data included number of animals the main productive function weaning age the age at slaughtering use as working animal territorial range and biometric parameters e g weight at birth for each cattle breed the values chosen for typical parameters weight weight gain and feeding situation were dived into 3 types imported breed traditional breed on pasture and traditional breeds on range enteric fermentation and n excretion were calculated for the 17 different breeds and then converted into a national average using total other cattle population as the weighting factor the nir results for the enteric fermentation are substantially different from ipcc tier 1 values namely for the animal classes in the extremes on the animal age the ipcc default value for a other cattle is 57 kg ch4 head yr while nir values range between 21 7 for beef calves 1year class and 91 8 kg ch4 head yr for adult non dairy cattle class in summary for portugal tier 2 emission factors were computed for three stages of the individual cow calves 1year juveniles 1 2 years and heifers 2years in fig 7 we present the results of our model together with tier 1 and 2 results we can see that the results are broadly in line taking into account that the nir results include the breeds encountered in portugal as well as animals of mixed breeds the nitrogen retention depends on energy needs for growth and milk production the tier 2 method for n excretion was already applied to portugal on nir apa 2019 tier 2 emission factors were computed for three stages of the individual cow calves 1year juveniles 1 2 years and heifers 2years in fig 8 we present the results for n excretion based on the model together with the values for tiers 1 and 2 in general the results for methane and nitrogen excretion are in line with the what is computed in tiers 1 and 2 however due to the fact that relationships between the different deb parameters and state variables are known and explicit the metabolic causal chains underlying the observed variation and differences in ghg emissions can be discussed and advices to be provided to farmers or policy makers aimed at reducing ghg emissions may be based on those causal chains 3 3 efficiency of production with minimization of impacts one of the most important advantages of having a continuous model able to predict growth as well as product excretions is the possibility of helping with decision making in fig 9 we present an example of this type of computation for the case of methane production to produce these results we assumed the calf at birth already has the burden of one year of accumulated methane production of the mother that explains why the cumulative emissions start at positive value at birth and decreases as the individual grows we then compute the accumulated methane production per weight of cow as a function of time and weight and determine when methane production is minimized with maximum available food f 1 the accumulated methane production can range between 0 2 kg and 2 kg of methane per body weight the range of abatement weights that minimizes methane production is specific for each breed 200 400 kg in angus 450 to 600 kg in alentejana 400 to 900 kg in charolais and 500 to 700 kg in limousin for all weights the limousine breed is the breed that produces more accumulated methane per kg of body weight the same procedure can be done for nitrogen excretion in fig 10 we present the results for the different breeds these results are very similar in terms of curves to the methane production and the minimums are almost the same the accumulated nitrogen production can range between 0 1 kg and 0 7 kg of methane per body weight the range of abatement weights that minimizes nitrogen production is specific for each breed 200 400 kg in angus 400 to 600 kg in alentejana 450 to 900 kg in charolais and 500 to 700 kg in limousin for all weights the limousine breed is the breed that produces more accumulated nitrogen per body weight 4 conclusions we have used deb theory to construct a model for a cow and estimate parameters for four different breeds the fitness of deb models to data is good for all breeds and values obtained for methane production and nitrogen excretion were in the range of values predicted by tier 1 factors and tier 2 methods the deb parameters that were estimated explain the metabolic differences between these four breeds of cows including differences in ghg emissions between breeds moreover having a dynamic model such as deb allows us to produce results that can be better used in decision making alentejana breed has the highest ultimate length because it has substantially lower maintenance needs which means that more energy is available for growth on the other hand limousine breed has the highest von bertalanffy growth rate because it mobilizes energy from the reserve faster comparing cows with the same physical length charolais is the heaviest breed while alentejana is the lightest because of the energy reserve density that is much higher in the first case weight is also controlled by the shape coefficient that transforms physical length into structural length the shape coefficient is substantially lower for the angus breed which means that this breed is lighter that suggested by the value of its reserve density angus and alentejana breeds produce less methane for a given physical length because they have lower maximum surface assimilation rates which controls the amount of assimilated food charolais has a similar methane production per year as limousin for a given length but for the same weight it is similar to the more efficient breeds producing less methane because the maximum reserve density of this breed is very high nitrogen production which depends on assimilation dissipation and growth has a behaviour that is very similar to methane because the assimilation process is the main contributor thus cows that have the same weight but belong to different breeds produce different amounts of ghg emissions because they have different maximum assimilation efficiencies and or different maximum reserve densities for the accumulated methane and nitrogen waste production per body weight the range of abatement weights that minimizes production is specific for each breed but very similar for both excretions 200 400 kg in angus 400 to 600 kg in alentejana 450 to 900 kg in charolais and 500 to 700 kg in limousin in contrast to tier 1 and tier 2 and statistical models available in the literature the deb model is able to predict methane production and nitrogen excretion as a function of age length or weight for the different breeds figs 7 and 8 and can be used to estimate the life time span that minimizes ghg emissions per body weight for a certain breed because it models the full life cycle of the organism additionally the deb model and most parameters estimated can also be used to simulate conditions that are different from the conditions that were present when the input data which was used for calibration was collected e g a lower amount of food or a different environmental temperature the exceptions are the assimilation efficiency κx and the faeces production efficiency κp these parameters depend on the type of food and more data on the amount of ghg emissions for different types of feed must be used so that we have sets of κx and κp that are a function of feed type the advantage of estimating these feed dependant parameters in the context of a deb model is that the predictions of different endpoints including growth methane production and urea production are coherent because deb models obey mass and energy conservation the modelling of the three aggregated chemical transformations that are occurring in the organism assimilation dissipation and growth ensure that the laws of thermodynamics are

24762,livestock production is one of the main contributors to global greenhouse gas ghg emissions the tools provided by the intergovernmental panel on climate change to estimate ghg emissions tier 1 and tier 2 cannot be used as a tool for advising farmers or national policy on how to minimize ghg emissions because these estimates are not explicitly related to any metabolic properties for that we need a metabolic model that obeys mass and energy balances and that models the trade offs between different allocations of energy in the organism throughout the life cycle as a function of environmental variables such as temperature and the amount and type of food the dynamic energy budget deb theory ensures mass conservation and models the transformations of state variable and product formation allowing for explicit ghg emissions estimates therefore we used this theory to build models for four bovine breeds alentejana angus charolais and limousin the goodness of fit of deb models to data is good for all breeds differences in deb breed specific parameters such as the maximum reserve density and the maximum specific assimilation rate explain differences in ghg emissions ultimate lengths and weights and von bertalanffy growth rates accumulated methane and nitrogen production ranges between 0 2 and 2 and 0 1 and 0 7 kg per kg of body weight respectively in terms of accumulated direct ghg emissions there is a strong dependence on breed and age keywords climate change livestock beef dynamic energy budget metabolism enteric fermentation animal growth bovine excretion industrial ecology 1 introduction livestock production is one of the main contributors to global greenhouse gas ghg emissions garnett 2009 leip et al 2010 steinfeld et al 2006 this contribution is driven in great part by methane ch4 emissions from enteric fermentation that exit the animal through flatulence and eructation and by nitrous oxide n2o emissions from animal excretions leip et al 2010 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc provides simple tier 1 factors to calculate animal excretions and enteric fermentation as well as a tier 2 method that enables a refinement of calculations ipcc 2006 tier 2 has been the basis of methods applied by countries in their national inventory reports nir submitted to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc in the scope of the kyoto protocol unfcccnis 2020 ipcc methods are also used abundantly for livestock production impact assessment morais et al 2018a 2018b 2017 teixeira et al 2019 in tier 1 and tier 2 animal methane emissions are determined on a per head basis in kg ch4 head yr tier 1 provides emission values that are different for dairy and other cattle and that vary between world regions based on different weight averages and different milk production averages in western europe the methane emission per year per head is 57 kg for non dairy cattle tier 2 animal methane emissions are proportional to gross energy intake and a methane conversion factor that depends on the type of food concentrate milk or pasture enteric fermentation and the chemical composition of excretions are a function of animal feed type de vries et al 2015 extensive and intensive systems i e with respectively lower or higher amounts of labour and physical capital relative to the agricultural area utilised commonly evident through the respective use of grazing pastures or concentrate feeding as the main source of feeding among other differences have different effects on livestock emissions eldesouky et al 2018 haas et al 2001 morais et al 2018a teixeira 2018 concentrate feed and fresh grass or legumes will trigger different metabolic pathways that produce different outcomes in terms of excretions and emissions hristov et al 2013 kirkpatrick et al 1997 these effects are not just dependant on the energy content of feed but rather on its nutritional characteristics such as the cellulosic contents of vegetable feedstuffs peyraud et al 2009 the response to feed also varies substantially with animal type and breed andrews et al 2004 many authors have proposed improved methods and models to improve the estimation of livestock enteric fermentation hynes et al 2016 stergiadis et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 and nitrogen excretion dijkstra et al 2013 fox et al 2004 smith et al 2000 these methods usually involve bottom up statistical modelling that starts from measurement of the variables such as ch4 emissions nitrogen excretion body weight and gross energy feed intake among others these procedures are thus inadequate for large scale application as they would require replication for all possible feedstuffs and animal breeds also they are not useful in explaining metabolic differences between individual animals or breeds which is of paramount importance for the farmer that wants to improve the genetic make up of their cattle the alternative to these statistical based methods is the use of a mechanistic based modelling theory at the individual level the only metabolic theory that we know that 1 obeys mass and energy conservation laws and that 2 describes the metabolism for the different life stages is the dynamic energy budget deb theory jusup et al 2017 kooijman 2010 deb theory is a process based theory that allows for the understanding of energy and mass flows in organisms providing a more detailed approach to estimating ghg emissions this is made possible because deb ensures mass conservation and uses the generalized macro chemical transformations of the state variables to make it explicit these transformations allow for the prediction of product formation including ghg emissions it is a universal theory since one can use it to model organisms of any species in add my pet amp database add my pet 2020 parameters for more than 2000 species are available additionally the use of deb theory reduces the need for intensive experimentation in search of new statistical correlations and possible causal chains when environmental conditions change a comprehensive set of input data is used to calibrate and validate the deb model but if the calibration and validation of the model for a cow breed is successful the model can then be applied in a plethora of new environmental conditions triggered by events such as climate change due to the fact that the metabolic relationships between the different deb parameters and state variables is always the same and therefore causality is ultimately explicit finally in contrast to statistical models where specific coefficients need to be assessed or updated through experimentation e g different coefficients for different age classes or breeds and do not clearly convey the biological causality underlying the values those coefficients may assume i e the biology is implicit the application of deb theory allows for an easy understanding of what may be causing the differences observed because the biology is explicit with state variables and parameters having a clear biological definition a deb based model can address some of the shortcomings of tier 2 estimates that were acknowledged by ipcc namely it can take into account breed variation in maintenance requirements and diet chemical composition in a coherent form here we develop a new metabolic model based on deb theory to simulate animal growth and direct emissions from enteric fermentation and excretions we calibrate and validate the model for 4 breeds of beef cows in portugal obtaining a distinctive set of deb parameters for each breed we apply the deb model to estimate direct ghg emissions and show how it can be used to minimize cumulative methane production per kg of beef 2 materials and methods the data and methodologies used to estimate direct ghg emissions are detailed here including the tiers 1 and 2 factors and respective equations and the deb based model additionally we synthesize the basic concepts of deb theory that support the development of the model and validate and calibrate the deb model with data for 4 breeds of beef cows 2 1 deb theory deb theory presents rules to quantify the energy and mass flows for the different processes assimilation somatic and maturity maintenance growth maturation and reproduction in fig 1 we present a scheme that summarizes the state variables and the energy flows in an organism represented by the standard deb model while the mathematical description of the energy flows and the parameters are in tables 1 and 2 respectively parameters are breed specific the state variables characterize the biomass and the level of maturity of the organism the biomass of the organism is composed by the mass of reserve the mass of structure and the mass stored in the reproduction buffer reserve e and the reproduction buffer er are typically quantified as the energy j while structure v is quantified as volume cm3 the level of maturity eh quantified by the total amount of energy j dissipated in the process of maturation indicates the current life stage of the organism embryo juvenile or adult the maturity increases from zero to e h b during the embryo stage then birth occurs and the juvenile starts feeding during this life stage maturity continues to increase when maturity reaches its maximum level e h p the organism transits to the adult life stage and starts allocating to reproduction in the organism food is transformed into reserve and faeces p are produced the ingestion of food p x depends on the amount of food available f on the maximum surface specific ingestion rate p x m and on the structural surface area of the organism v 2 3 the assimilation flux p a which depends on the assimilation efficiency κx of converting food into reserve is represented in fig 1 this efficiency depends on the chemical composition of food the reserve is then mobilized p c for all the organism s internal processes a fraction κ of the mobilized flux p c is used first to pay the somatic maintenance costs of structure p s where the proportionality constant p m is the specific somatic maintenance and then for growing p g the fraction 1 κ of the mobilized flux p c is used first to pay the maintenance cost of maturity p j where the proportionality constant k j is the specific maturity maintenance rate and then the rest p r is used to increase maturity eh or maturation during the life stages of the embryo and juvenile when the organism is an adult maturity has reached its maximum and p r is accumulated in the reproduction buffer to be used latter on in the production of offspring in the standard deb model growth at abundant food is of von bertalanffy type 1 l l l l b e r b t where ultimate length l and the von bertalanffy growth rate r b are a function of deb parameters see table 3 for a detailed explanation of the mathematical descriptions of these flows see sousa et al 2008 in the standard deb model there are three aggregated chemical transformations assimilation growth and dissipation taking into account that 1 deb incorporates fully mass and energy conservation and that 2 these transformations have constant stoichiometric coefficients if food has a constant chemical composition it is possible to estimate gas production in the different aggregated chemical transformations assimilation is the conversion of food into reserve with the production of faeces and production consumption of mineral products growth is the conversion of reserve into structure with the consumption production of minerals dissipation is the use of reserve with the production consumption of minerals to fuel somatic and maturity maintenances maturation and the inefficiency of reproduction let us now focus on assimilation in the standard deb model we have 2 y x e a x y o e a o 2 e y c e a c o 2 y h e a h 2 o y n e a n waste y p e a p where y e a represents the yield of on reserve in the assimilation process for example y x e a is the number of c moles of food x needed to produce one c mol of reserve e different species use different compounds to get rid of nitrogenous waste for mammals the compound is usually urea co nh 2 2 finally we have a generalized product p for faeces all organic compounds are assumed to be composed of hydrogen carbon oxygen and nitrogen four stoichiometric coefficients or yield coefficients can be estimated from the four mass balances the two additional yields that cannot be estimated are functions of parameters of the deb model one is the assimilation efficiency κx which is inversely proportional to the yield y x e a and the other is the efficiency of producing feces κp which is inversely proportional to y p e a the other two transformations are growth and dissipation 3 e y o e g

growth and dissipation transformations in dissipation all yields are determined by the mass balances while for growth the yield of structure on reserve y v e g is related with the deb parameter volume specific cost of growth eg 2 2 the deb model for a cow to model the juvenile and adult cow we used the deb standard model defined in the previous section while for the fetus we used the standard fetus deb model usually known by the acronym stf this model assumes that the fetus has a continuous and very large input of mass and energy from the mother growing linearly in length after a diapause in the womb the cow differs from the average herbivorous mammal mainly because it is a ruminant ruminants have the capacity to enhance digestion by using the microbiome in the rumen in order to break up larger molecules such as cellulose and other carbohydrates a process which other herbivores are unable to perform fermentation converts carbohydrates into volatile fatty acids such as propionic ch3ch2cooh butyric c4h8o2 and acetic ch3cooh acids the main result from cellulose fermentation is acetate while starch fermentation mostly produces propionate and butyrate wilkinson 2004 propionate production is the most efficient retaining all six carbon atoms present in a common carbohydrate such as glucose c6h12o6 both butyrate and acetate production allow only for the retention of four carbon atoms but while the former releases the other two carbon atoms as carbon dioxide co2 the latter releases one as carbon dioxide and the other as methane ch4 lawrence 2004 we focus on a diet mostly obtained through grazing in pastures and therefore consider it to require significant fermentation of cellulose resulting in the release of both carbon dioxide and methane therefore the assimilation process for ruminants can be summarized with the two following sub transformations 4 1 ξ c 1 ξ c y x e a x y o e a c o 2 e y c e a c c o 2 y h e a c h 2 o y n e a c c o n h 2 2 y p e a p ξ c y x e a x y o e a m o 2 e y c e a m c h 4 y h e a m h 2 o y n e a m c o n h 2 2 y p e a p the first sub transformation produces co 2 while the second produces ch 4 the first sub transformation contributes 1 ξ c to the overall assimilation transformation while the second contributes ξc the yields y c and y m are the equivalent yields for the transformations that produce carbon dioxide and methane respectively in other words a fraction ξc of the ingested food x is transformed into reserve producing methane and a fraction 1 ξ c of the ingested food is transformed into reserve producing carbon dioxide considering that the release of carbon dioxide and methane from cellulose fermentation will always be complemented with the release of carbon dioxide from other types of fermentation and respiration the fraction ξc should always be below 0 5 usually and for most deb estimations without further data and for simplicity purposes one uses the same standard compositions for the organic state variables i e n o 1 1 1 8 1 8 1 1 1 8 1 8 0 5 0 5 0 15 0 15 0 5 0 5 0 15 0 15 where each column represents food structure reserve and faeces respectively and each line represents the amount of an element carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen in each c mol for example a c mol of reserve has the chemical composition ch 1 8 o 0 5 n 0 15 although the composition of cattle feed may vary the standard composition used is similar to several of the main feed alternatives table 4 in portugal sown pastures are constituted by a variety of species but clover species trifolium spp are among the most relevant the dry matter ash free of clover grass is constituted by about 47 of carbon 7 of hydrogen 44 of oxygen and 2 of nitrogen the corresponding values for hay which is often used as a supplement are 48 5 45 and 2 respectively in the case of maize also used as a supplement the values the values are similar 49 6 43 and 0 4 respectively these compositions were obtained from elemental analyses available in phyllis2 2020 the same database includes biochemical composition values for materials specifically classified as cattle feed such as maize whole plant wheat whole crop and sorghum although the available values do not cover all the compounds that constitute these materials for instance those containing nitrogen more than half the dry matter content is composed of cellulose c6h1005 hemicellulose c5h8o4 and lignin c15h14o4 but there are also other types of lignin if we consider exclusively these compounds and their respective relative contribution to the total dry matter of maize 32 22 5 on average of wheat 27 16 9 on average and of sorghum fodder 29 28 4 the resulting composition regarding carbon hydrogen and oxygen would be similar to the compositions obtained from the elemental analyses previously mentioned table 4 given these compositions of the feed for our estimations we chose to use the different compositions of the compositions for the organic state variables our matrix of compositions will be n o 1 1 1 5 1 8 1 1 1 8 1 8 0 69 0 5 0 03 0 15 0 5 0 5 0 15 0 15 where again each column represents food structure reserve and faeces respectively for the minerals we use the following compositions n m 1 1 0 0 2 0 1 0 4 2 1 0 0 2 1 0 2 and n m 2 1 0 4 2 0 1 0 4 0 1 0 0 2 1 0 2 where n m1 is for the sub transformation producing co 2 and n m2 is for the one producing ch 4 again each line represents the amount of an element in each mol of a mineral respectively carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen and each column represents one mineral for example in n m1 those are carbon dioxide water dioxygen and urea respectively 2 3 calibration and validation of the deb model for 4 breeds of cows occurring in portugal data regarding a variety of life history traits single point data was collected from the literature for four different bovine bos taurus linné 1758 breeds alentejana angus charolais and limousin table 5 these breeds are commonly reared in southern portugal the alentejana breed is autochthonous to portugal and has its origin in the alentejo region marques et al 2004 pure specimens from the angus charolais and limousin breeds are bred in southern portugal but a considerable portion of the total population actually consists of different generation hybrids combining mostly charolais and limousin breeds among others reis 2010 additional data required included adult body temperature lifespan and total body water needed to estimate specific body densities for the four breeds we assumed an average adult body temperature 38 6 c 311 75 k a natural lifespan between 30 and 35 years x 32 5 11 863 days and a total body water tbw content corresponding to about 65 of the live weight of an adult for charolais specimens about 66 degen and young 1980 tucker et al 2008 besides single point zerovariate data values univariate data sets were also used specifically live weight growth curves priority was given for growth curves obtained from individual specimens but when these were not available growth curves obtained from small sampled populations were considered some growth curves reflected the effect of different experimental treatments mostly dealing with diet composition but not quantity which was ad libitum the observed growth data for each breed which was used is available in appendix a figures s1 to s4 the parameterization i e the estimation of values for the core deb parameters for each breed was carried out through the use of the debtool software matlab version 7 3 0 kooijman 2020 by applying the typical structure of the standard deb model the parameterization process followed the covariation method marques et al 2019 using pseudo data values adapted from the deb generalized animal hypothetical animal described through a set of typical deb parameter values corresponding to a consensus within the community of researchers applying deb theory kooijman 2010 table 8 1 and all data collected for each breed we estimated the parameter values that provide the best estimates for all the life history traits collected table 5 while simultaneously allowing for a good fit to the observed growth curves the parameter that corresponds to the level of available food during growth was set to the maximum f 1 corresponding to situations when food is available ad libitum estimated deb growth curves in red are in good agreement with data blue dots for all breeds figures s1 to s4 in appendix a estimated core deb parameters table 6 include the maximum specific assimilation rate and the volume specific somatic maintenance which are lower for alentejana as well as the energy conductance which characterizes the mobilization rate from reserve which is substantially lower for angus and charolais estimated compound parameters such as the ultimate length l and the von bertalanffy growth rate r b and the maximum energy reserve density em are in table 7 angus and charolais have higher energy reserve densities and lower ultimate lengths while limousin has a higher von bertalanffy growth rate to further validate our deb parameterization we compared values estimated with the deb models with additional data table 8 for breeds of similar ultimate size to those of the alentejana and angus breeds the deb estimated values for the gross energy ge content expected to be found in the daily feed ingested are within or close to the range of recommended daily feed values for females provided by the institut national de la recherche agronomique inra 1988 using the chemical compositions of the state variables and minerals presented in section 2 2 we computed the yields for the various transformations table 9 the yields y x e a and y p e a which are the food or feces needed to produce or obtained from reserve measured in moles are obtained from the assimilation efficiency κ x 0 3 and overhead to feces κ p 0 1 taking into account the chemical composition of these compounds and the specific enthalpies the value of digestion efficiency κ x 0 3 was set to be lower than 0 4 which is the estimated efficiency considering faeces but not other energy losses such as gases or heat the values of defecation efficiency κ p 0 1 is the standard value used in deb the generalized sub transformation that produces methane needs an input of water and has a net production of o 2 negative stoichiometric coefficients however this sub transformation does not occur alone and in the overall transformation of assimilation with a fraction of carbon dioxide to methane production of ξ c 0 3 there is consumption of o 2 the value of ξc was estimated to so that the results are consistent with the ipcc tiers the value is below 0 5 as expected and previously mentioned

while the second produces ch4 2 4 ippc nir tier 1 and 2 factors regarding enteric ch4 emissions the 2006 version of ipcc ipcc 2006 provides two different methods tier 1 and 2 with increasing level of detail the tier 1 method is simplified as it relies on default emission factors drawn from the literature it divides the emissions into two types of cattle livestock dairy and non dairy and in eight different regions of the world the main criteria used to differentiate among these regions was milk yield measured in kg milk head year the tier 2 method is applied to more disaggregated livestock categories and depends on gross energy intake ge unit mj head day and the methane conversion factor ym which is the percentage of gross energy in feed that is converted to methane according to 7 c h 4 k g h d y r g e y m 100 365 55 65 where the factor 55 65 mj kg ch4 is the energy content of methane ge depends on the net energies required for maintenance animal activity lactation pregnancy growth and work ratio of net energy available in a diet for maintenance to digestible energy consumed ratio of net energy available for growth in a diet to digestible energy consumed and digestible energy expressed as a percentage of gross energy according to the equation 10 3 10 16 from chapter 4 of ipcc ipcc 2006 maintenance needs are a function of weight and depend on whether it is a lactating or non lactating cow or a bull activity needs that are a function of the feeding situation stall pasture or grazing large areas are proportional to maintenance needs while growth needs decrease with the proximity to adult weight ym is methane conversion factor which depends on several interacting feed and animal factors for feedlot fed cattle the factor is 3 and 6 5 for other cattle classes and diets the main data required to estimate the above mentioned parameters to calculate ge are live weight and daily weight gain of animal milk production for milking and suckler cows feed type pasture commercial feed and animal activity if the animal is used for agricultural operations regarding nitrogen excretion the ipcc provides again two methods tier 1 and 2 ipcc 2006 it recommends that country specific rates should be used in tier 2 nevertheless if country specific data cannot be collected or derived it provides nitrogen excretion rates kg n 1000 kg of animal mass day based on literature review the excretion rate is function of the cattle type dairy cattle and other cattle and the geographical region the same division as in the enteric fermentation emission nitrogen excretion according tier 2 is based on the total annual nitrogen intake and total annual nitrogen retention of the animal 8 n e x c r e t i o n k g n h d y r n u p t a k e 1 n r e t e n t i o n nitrogen intake is function of the amount of feed digested by the animal and the protein content of that feed ipcc proposed the following equation to calculate the nitrogen intake 9 n u p t a k e k g n h d y r g e 18 45 c p 100 6 25 3 results and discussion 3 1 deb model application for beef cows in portugal in this section we will present the metabolic results for the different breeds of cows these include growth and production of ch 4 and nitrogen in urea the core and compound deb parameters were estimated for each cow breed tables 6 and 7 assuring a good fit between observed values and estimates concerning several life history traits and growth curves the quality of the fit is documented through the low relative error re values which resulted from the fitting procedure resulting in mean relative errors all below 0 1 table 5 but can also be visually evaluated through the plots available in appendix a figures s1 to s4 using the parameters estimated for each breed we estimated the growth curves of an individual with the maximum level of available food f 1 the results are presented in fig 2 we present growth in terms of total live body weight and total body length weight is the more standard way of presenting this type of result but weight is a compound variable depending on reserve and structure individuals with the same weight can have different proportions of reserve and structure on the other hand length is directly connected to structure which controls several processes such as assimilation and somatic maintenance growth curves predicted by deb models at abundant food fig 2 are of von bertalanffy type they tend to ultimate length l at the von bertalanffy growth rate r b which is a function of deb parameters table 7 in the context of deb theory the ultimate length is the ratio between the rate of energy mobilized from reserve for growth and maintenance needs alentejana has a higher ultimate length because it has substantially lower maintenance needs the von bertalanffy growth rate controls the rate at which the animal tends to the ultimate length the higher the energy conductance value the higher the von bertalanffy growth rate because energy is being mobilised from the reserve faster limousine has the highest von bertalanffy growth rate because it has a substantially higher mobilization rate to better understand the link between the dynamics of physical length on the left plot of fig 2 and weight on the right plot of fig 2 we should look at weight as a function of physical length fig 3 for the same length the relative weight of charolais limousin and alentejana is controlled by the energy reserve density see table 7 we estimated that alentejana is the breed with the lowest maximum reserve density 23 33 103 j cm 3 followed by limousin 29 43 103 j cm 3 charolais 74 81 103 j cm 3 and angus 75 74 103 j cm 3 although the reserved density does not represent exclusively such traits as the energy stored in fat the differences we observed between these different cattle breeds are in line with what has been previously measured regarding the relative amounts of fat found in animals belonging to these breeds for instance costa et al 2013 measured 6 33 of visceral fat in alentejana bulls carcasses and albertí et al 2008 measured 13 2 15 4 and 21 7 of fat in bull s carcasses of limousin charolais and angus respectively although there may still be some small amount of fat to add to the visceral fat measured in the former study the order of increasing relative amounts of fat found in carcasses of these breeds match with the order of increasing maximum reserve density we estimated mandell et al 1997 compared the fat yield in steers carcass composition of limousin and charolais and also measured higher values for the latter 18 1 and 20 6 respectively coleman et al 1993 had already compared the amounts of fat in carcasses of charolais and angus steers and although the values measured were higher for charolais than in the study by mandell and colleagues the authors measured even higher values for the angus 21 5 and 34 3 respectively for spring born steers and 21 4 and 29 4 respectively for fall born steers our results regarding maximum energy reserve density also align with fat measurements performed in particular organs such as kidneys in the albertí et al 2008 study the increasing kidney fat percentage measured in limousin charolais and angus bulls carcasses consisted of 1 4 1 5 and 2 1 respectively these values were generally low compared to those gathered by marshall 1994 in a pooled across study comparing sires carcass traits but this author also published the same order of increasing fat presence in kidneys of limousin charolais and angus 2 7 2 8 and 3 respectively in their study costa et al 2013 measured about 2 4 of kidney knob and channel fat in bulls carcasses of the alentejana breed i e the lowest value when compared to those in the marshall 1994 study nevertheless comparisons based on just one organ need to be considered carefully in their study zahrádková et al 2010 measured 1 55 of kidney fat in charolais heifers and 2 31 kidney fat in limousin heifers the authors were surprised and explained that this reverse difference could be due to the fact that the breeds sampled groups had different physiological age and the limousin heifers had prolonged fattening periods the higher the reserve per unit of structural volume the higher the weight angus is special because it has the highest energy reserve density but not the highest weight per physical length the explanation is its low shape coefficient δm the shape coefficient controls the relationship between structural length and physical length an angus cow with a physical length of 1 m has a structural volume of 0 02 m3 while alentejana charolais and limousin have structural volumes of 0 04 m3 0 05 m3 and 0 05 m3 respectively this means that angus has a high amount of reserve per unit of structural volume but a low amount of structural volume per cube of physical length thus angus is lighter than expected based on the relative values of energy reserve density as far as emissions are concerned fig 4 shows the methane production while fig 5 shows nitrogen production as urea at abundant food level for the 4 breeds of cows we can see that angus and alentejana breeds are quite similar in terms of methane and nitrogen production for a given length or weight and they produce less methane and nitrogen than the other two breeds there is already evidence that methane production is strongly correlated to feed intake both in the short term minutes to several hours and medium term days pickering et al 2015 in our model the rate of methane production depends on the amount of food ingested which is proportional to the structural surface area of the organism where the maximum surface assimilation rate ṗam is the coefficient of proportionality the way the breeds are ordered in fig 4 results from the combined differences observed in ṗam and δm if we consider one animal of each breed sharing the same physical length e g 100 cm the energy each would assimilate in a day would result from multiplying the respective ṗam by the respective structural surface area i e ṗam ṗam 100 δm 2 at 100 cm of physical length angus alentejana charolais and limousin assimilate 2 9 3 1 4 9 and 6 7 mj d respectively alentejana may have the lowest ṗam about 62 of what we estimate for angus but angus has an even lower structural surface area about 59 of what we estimate for alentejana making it the lowest of the four hence the order observed a similar procedure can be followed to understand the graph in weight of fig 4 the right plot in fig 4 results from the combined differences observed in more deb parameters and therefore the calculations are lengthier essentially charolais has a similar methane and nitrogen production per year as limousin for a given length however for the same weight it is more similar to the more efficient breeds efficient in the sense of producing less methane for the same weight the maximum reserve density of this breed which is more than twice as much as the reserve density of limousine explains this phenomenon the maximum reserve density which is the reserve density of the animal at abundant food is the reserve per unit of structure thus for the same size similar methane production a charolais cow is heavier than a limousine fig 3 for 500 kg the methane production of a limousine cow is almost twice the methane production of the other breeds however nitrogen production fig 5 has a behaviour that is very similar to methane fig 4 because the assimilation process is the main contributor to nitrogen production in contrast to methane production that depends on assimilation only nitrogen production also depends on growth and dissipation fig 6 3 2 comparison with ippc nir tier 1 and 2 factors tier 2 method for enteric fermentation was already applied to portugal on the nir apa 2019 considering average portuguese livestock population data and based on expert judgment livestock population was divided into 2 main classes dairy cattle and other cattle other cattle class was divided in 10 different classes for enteric fermentation and 5 classes for n excretion depending on the age sex and animal function e g replacement or beef production regarding other cattle classes nir used data from the 17 breeders associations existing in portugal this data included number of animals the main productive function weaning age the age at slaughtering use as working animal territorial range and biometric parameters e g weight at birth for each cattle breed the values chosen for typical parameters weight weight gain and feeding situation were dived into 3 types imported breed traditional breed on pasture and traditional breeds on range enteric fermentation and n excretion were calculated for the 17 different breeds and then converted into a national average using total other cattle population as the weighting factor the nir results for the enteric fermentation are substantially different from ipcc tier 1 values namely for the animal classes in the extremes on the animal age the ipcc default value for a other cattle is 57 kg ch4 head yr while nir values range between 21 7 for beef calves 1year class and 91 8 kg ch4 head yr for adult non dairy cattle class in summary for portugal tier 2 emission factors were computed for three stages of the individual cow calves 1year juveniles 1 2 years and heifers 2years in fig 7 we present the results of our model together with tier 1 and 2 results we can see that the results are broadly in line taking into account that the nir results include the breeds encountered in portugal as well as animals of mixed breeds the nitrogen retention depends on energy needs for growth and milk production the tier 2 method for n excretion was already applied to portugal on nir apa 2019 tier 2 emission factors were computed for three stages of the individual cow calves 1year juveniles 1 2 years and heifers 2years in fig 8 we present the results for n excretion based on the model together with the values for tiers 1 and 2 in general the results for methane and nitrogen excretion are in line with the what is computed in tiers 1 and 2 however due to the fact that relationships between the different deb parameters and state variables are known and explicit the metabolic causal chains underlying the observed variation and differences in ghg emissions can be discussed and advices to be provided to farmers or policy makers aimed at reducing ghg emissions may be based on those causal chains 3 3 efficiency of production with minimization of impacts one of the most important advantages of having a continuous model able to predict growth as well as product excretions is the possibility of helping with decision making in fig 9 we present an example of this type of computation for the case of methane production to produce these results we assumed the calf at birth already has the burden of one year of accumulated methane production of the mother that explains why the cumulative emissions start at positive value at birth and decreases as the individual grows we then compute the accumulated methane production per weight of cow as a function of time and weight and determine when methane production is minimized with maximum available food f 1 the accumulated methane production can range between 0 2 kg and 2 kg of methane per body weight the range of abatement weights that minimizes methane production is specific for each breed 200 400 kg in angus 450 to 600 kg in alentejana 400 to 900 kg in charolais and 500 to 700 kg in limousin for all weights the limousine breed is the breed that produces more accumulated methane per kg of body weight the same procedure can be done for nitrogen excretion in fig 10 we present the results for the different breeds these results are very similar in terms of curves to the methane production and the minimums are almost the same the accumulated nitrogen production can range between 0 1 kg and 0 7 kg of methane per body weight the range of abatement weights that minimizes nitrogen production is specific for each breed 200 400 kg in angus 400 to 600 kg in alentejana 450 to 900 kg in charolais and 500 to 700 kg in limousin for all weights the limousine breed is the breed that produces more accumulated nitrogen per body weight 4 conclusions we have used deb theory to construct a model for a cow and estimate parameters for four different breeds the fitness of deb models to data is good for all breeds and values obtained for methane production and nitrogen excretion were in the range of values predicted by tier 1 factors and tier 2 methods the deb parameters that were estimated explain the metabolic differences between these four breeds of cows including differences in ghg emissions between breeds moreover having a dynamic model such as deb allows us to produce results that can be better used in decision making alentejana breed has the highest ultimate length because it has substantially lower maintenance needs which means that more energy is available for growth on the other hand limousine breed has the highest von bertalanffy growth rate because it mobilizes energy from the reserve faster comparing cows with the same physical length charolais is the heaviest breed while alentejana is the lightest because of the energy reserve density that is much higher in the first case weight is also controlled by the shape coefficient that transforms physical length into structural length the shape coefficient is substantially lower for the angus breed which means that this breed is lighter that suggested by the value of its reserve density angus and alentejana breeds produce less methane for a given physical length because they have lower maximum surface assimilation rates which controls the amount of assimilated food charolais has a similar methane production per year as limousin for a given length but for the same weight it is similar to the more efficient breeds producing less methane because the maximum reserve density of this breed is very high nitrogen production which depends on assimilation dissipation and growth has a behaviour that is very similar to methane because the assimilation process is the main contributor thus cows that have the same weight but belong to different breeds produce different amounts of ghg emissions because they have different maximum assimilation efficiencies and or different maximum reserve densities for the accumulated methane and nitrogen waste production per body weight the range of abatement weights that minimizes production is specific for each breed but very similar for both excretions 200 400 kg in angus 400 to 600 kg in alentejana 450 to 900 kg in charolais and 500 to 700 kg in limousin in contrast to tier 1 and tier 2 and statistical models available in the literature the deb model is able to predict methane production and nitrogen excretion as a function of age length or weight for the different breeds figs 7 and 8 and can be used to estimate the life time span that minimizes ghg emissions per body weight for a certain breed because it models the full life cycle of the organism additionally the deb model and most parameters estimated can also be used to simulate conditions that are different from the conditions that were present when the input data which was used for calibration was collected e g a lower amount of food or a different environmental temperature the exceptions are the assimilation efficiency κx and the faeces production efficiency κp these parameters depend on the type of food and more data on the amount of ghg emissions for different types of feed must be used so that we have sets of κx and κp that are a function of feed type the advantage of estimating these feed dependant parameters in the context of a deb model is that the predictions of different endpoints including growth methane production and urea production are coherent because deb models obey mass and energy conservation the modelling of the three aggregated chemical transformations that are occurring in the organism assimilation dissipation and growth ensure that the laws of thermodynamics are

24763,understanding the mechanisms driving community dynamics helps us to make reliable predictions about communities response to environmental change studying desert plant communities is particularly challenging because of strong intra and interannual fluctuations in precipitation models rise to this challenge by providing an arena for systematic evaluation of the parameter space in virtual experiments we applied a trait and individual based model to explore how community dynamics arise from the plant traits and interactions of plants with other plants and with their environment the model is based on data from annual plant communities in the negev desert dominated by the true rose of jericho anastatica hierochuntica we showed that functional traits that are involved in plant plant interactions are equally important for community dynamics as traits promoting tolerance to abiotic stress the sensitivity analysis of the model highlights relative growth rate maximum biomass the amount of time in dormancy and germination probability as the most important traits for community dynamics the model reflects the particular importance of environmental factors such as precipitation and soil water availability based on topography for community dynamics our model benefits from the ability of individual based models to capture plant plant interactions and derive community properties from individual characteristics and from the feature of trait based approaches to link traits to organismal functions our study demonstrates the advantages of the combined use of trait and individual based models for investigating community drivers in changing extreme environments keywords annual plants community dynamics functional trait individual based model negev desert 1 introduction the fate of desert plant communities is unclear in the face of climate change ipcc 2018 an extensive understanding of the mechanisms driving plant community dynamics is important to predict community responses to climate change however the drivers of community dynamics under arid environmental conditions are not well known this uncertainty is partly due to strong intra and interannual fluctuations in water supply chesson et al 2004 which are difficult to capture with relatively short term empirical investigations according to future climate change predictions interannual variability in precipitation will only increase which may generate extreme weather conditions ipcc 2018 these alterations in precipitation patterns may cause loss of desert vegetation including annual plants which are a major component of the vegetation community in these regions gutterman 2000 besides water availability loik et al 2004 and its pulsed nature chesson et al 2004 plant growth and survival are affected by extreme temperatures temperature fluctuation gutterman 2000 and soil salinity gutterman 1997 deserts are usually considered to be particularly vulnerable to climate change as their inhabitants may already grow at their physiological limits ward 2009 vale and brito 2015 however some studies claim that the communities of annual plants might be not as vulnerable as is commonly assumed e g salguero gómez et al 2012 to support the empirical investigation of the possible vulnerability of annual plant communities we present a simulation model that uses a trait and individual based modelling approach this approach provides the necessary tools to explore how community dynamics arise from individual plant traits and plant interactions in an ever fluctuating environment ecological modelling is highly suitable to explain the mechanisms underlying plant community dynamics in deserts an obvious advantage of modelling tools over empirical approaches is the opportunity to test different hypotheses without an intrusion into real ecosystems meyer et al 2009 for instance ecohydrological conditions in deserts are studied in a variety of models addressing run off and run on processes howes and abrahams 2003 dew effects gerlein safdi et al 2018 basic flow processes dijkema et al 2018 effect of fog on soil moisture dynamics li et al 2018 extraction of groundwater through roots wang et al 2018 and groundwater flow in two dimensions sun et al 2018 ecosystem processes including water carbon and nitrogen fluxes are also represented in the desert modelling literature chen and reynolds 1997 reynolds et al 2004 considering the vulnerability of desert vegetation to climatic and anthropogenic change it is surprising that most of the influential models on the topic are more than ten years old examples include models considering dispersal and germination strategies of annuals venable and lawlor 1980 calculating optimal biomass allocation king and roughgarden 1982 or modelling shrubs mcauliffe 1988 james et al 2005 although global vegetation models target desert vegetation as a special case reick et al 2013 we are not aware of any models that address community structure and dynamics of desert annuals trait based approaches provide a holistic understanding of the processes driving desert plant communities these approaches link individual characteristics of organisms with their influence on organism performance and community functions violle et al 2007 desert plant strategies to cope with abiotic and biotic stress are linked to a set of plant functional traits such a trait set connects individual performance with the ability of an organism to tolerate changes in its environment and endure competition from its neighbors based on this functional traits might be divided into two groups representing traits that mediate plant plant interactions versus traits that help coping with harsh abiotic conditions these two groups of traits represent the opposing sides of the growth survival trade off grime 1977 these interactions with the environment and with neighbors give rise to community structure and dynamics at the local scale lortie et al 2004 thus due to the link between traits and interactions trait based approaches can help to explain the processes underlying community structure and dynamics such mechanistic explanations are the basis for predictions of the fate of desert plant communities webb et al 2010 combining modelling and trait based approaches provides a better understanding of the processes that drive desert plant communities and define their response to environmental changes may et al 2009 weiss et al 2014 trait based models may assist in revealing the mutual interaction between interspecific and intraspecific plant trait variability and changes in the environment and in the community auger and shipley 2013 kazakou et al 2014 grassein et al 2014 jeffers et al 2015 individual based modelling is a particularly promising method in combination with trait based approaches zakharova et al 2019 individual based modelling follows a bottom up approach where population or community level dynamics are derived from interactions between individual organisms and their environment grimm and railsback 2005 and capture plant plant interactions at the individual level to explain local community phenomena jeltsch et al 2008 trait based approaches can bridge the gap between the specific phenotypic characteristics of individuals species performance in particular habitats population dynamics and community dynamics including species interactions salguero gómez et al 2018 zakharova et al 2019 thus combining trait based modelling with individual based modelling may assist in overcoming limitations of computing power and lack of data as well as enrich models by including functional links between individual organisms and higher levels of organization we aimed at identifying the plant traits and environmental factors that drive the dynamics of a community of desert annuals particularly concerning traits that mediate plant plant interactions versus traits that help plants to cope with harsh abiotic conditions traits that mediate plant plant interactions include for example maximum biomass and relative growth rate traits related to coping with harsh conditions include species specific dispersal parameters the species specific number of seeds and the probabilities to survive and germinate to tackle our research question we developed a trait and individual based simulation model of plant communities of annuals dominated by anastatica hierochuntica in the negev desert in israel each species in this model was represented as a set of plant functional traits for this analysis we focused on two species interactions to represent two contrasting dispersal strategies we considered escape and protection gutterman 2000 seed dispersal strategies as important functional traits of desert annual plants ensuring their survival in the desert environment species with an escape strategy produce large numbers of small seeds which are dispersed unconditionally species with a protection strategy have developed long term seed banks with seeds that are kept on the mother plants and are only dispersed in portions by rain gutterman 2000 2 methods 2 1 research site model structure parameterization and validation are based on an annual plant community in the southern part of the negev desert israel this part of the desert is characterized by mean annual precipitation of less than 80 mm allocated from september to may the meteorologic service database israel government portal 2020 soils in this region are reg soil and coarse desert alluvium which have properties of loess soils regarding wilting point and field capacity dan et al 1976 as a proof of principle that the model simulates long terms patterns similar to those observed in nature we parameterized the model with environmental parameters and plant functional traits from a field site in the negev for this we focused on a two species community based on two of the most dominant annual plant species at the hameyshar site 30 24 48 3 n 34 56 37 9 e for this we considered the plant functional traits of anastatica hierochuntica brassicaceae and malva parviflora malvaceae supplementary material tab s1 2 2 developing a trait and individual based model we developed the individual based atid model anastatica trait based and individual based desert model atid a hebrew word meaning future to investigate which environmental factors and plant functional traits are important for plant performance and community dynamics in deserts fig 1 we implemented the model in netlogo wilensky 1999 version 6 0 2 supplementary material model code s1 we combined trait based violle et al 2007 and individual based modelling approaches grimm and railsback 2005 in the following we describe our model according to the overview design concepts details odd protocol for describing individual and agent based models grimm et al 2006 2 2 1 overview design concepts and details 2 2 1 1 purpose the aim of the atid model is to assess the relative importance of environmental factors and traits driving biotic versus abiotic interactions and how these factors and traits affect long term community dynamics 2 2 1 2 entities state variables and scales agents individuals agents are adult individual plants and seeds of two generic species that are inspired by a hierochuntica and m parviflora generic species anastatica and malva these two desert annuals are characterized by two contrasting dispersal strategies protection and escape strategies gutterman 2000 the model has an in built opportunity to be extended by an unlimited number of other species with their species specific functional trait combination depending on the plant community that the model represents each species in this model is represented as a set of plant functional traits related to plant plant interactions and to coping with abiotic stress supplementary material tab s2 tab s3 spatial units the simulated surface of the model is made up of cells representing arid sites with different topography and soil water availability with a grain of 1 m by 1 m environment the environment is simulated as featuring a daily updated soil water availability that depends on two types of precipitation rainfall and dew input during the vegetation growth season the model has embedded rainfall and topography generators temporal scale the time step of the model during the simulated vegetation growth season is one day this time step is small enough to consider daily variation in precipitation and simultaneously the main physiological processes involved in growth survival and reproduction of plants outside of the vegetation growth season there are no daily updates of the model variables this reflects environmental conditions in the negev desert where annual plants grow exclusively during winter the only wet season in the region the vegetation growth season is restricted by precipitation availability time extent of a model simulation can be set depending on the research aims but we recommend at least ten years a ten year period allows observing relevant fluctuations in environmental factors that may affect the performance of annual plants the time extent can be prolonged if required spatial scale the size of one grid cell is 1 m by 1 m corresponding to the scale of field measurements of the environmental factors and vegetation parameters the spatial extent covers an area of 100 by 50 m to capture the most important processes at the level of an annual plant community this extent also reflects the size of the experimental field at the hameishar site used for proof of principle simulations 2 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling during each time step the two main parts of the model vegetation and environment are executed supplementary material fig s1 the simulation loop continues until the specified time extent is reached or no adult plant or seed agents exist anymore the vegetation part consists of several submodels involving seed and adult plant agents processes at the level of seeds seed germination germination submodel transforms seeds into adult plants if there is enough soil water availability fig 2 seed dispersal dispersal submodel distributes seeds seed mortality represents the loss of seeds caused by processes such as disease granivory desiccation or other causes of natural mortality it is incorporated in the germination submodel as an integrative part of germination probability processes at the level of adult plants adult plants experience natural mortality inter and intraspecific competition growth ageing and reproduction fig 2 natural mortality is the probability of dying because of any natural mortality factors other than direct competition e g disturbance by wild animal activity adult mortality submodel competition occurs via the zone of influence competition submodel growth is represented by an increase in biomass growth submodel based on the share of resources that each adult plant gets in the competition submodel ageing is applied to both seeds and adult plants ageing submodel because age is relevant for some submodels such as reproduction and germination reproduction leads to the production of seeds under certain conditions reproduction submodel within the environment part during each time step that is part of the vegetation growth season soil water availability is updated for each cell depending on its topography and precipitation water availability submodel the model considers topography as the most important environmental factor this assumption is made based on the nature of the soil in the region that causes a large fraction of the rainfall to move at the local scale from the highest sites to the lowest all other environmental factors in the model depend on topography refined soil water availability and salinity will be incorporated in future model extensions reflecting the progress of ongoing data collections fig 2 2 2 1 4 design concepts the model adopts a trait based approach which provides a link between individual functional traits and properties of populations and communities violle et al 2007 plant functional traits also reflect strategies adopted by individual plants in response to biotic and abiotic stress the competition mechanism implemented in the model is based on zones of influence which are circular biomass depended zones around each plant berger et al 2008 emergence heterogeneity of environmental settings together with the variability of plant functional traits determine emerging plant plant interactions as well as the patterns of the spatial distribution of adult plants and seeds population sizes of different species and response trait distributions e g size distributions at various temporal and spatial scales adaptation in the current version of the model no adaptive processes are implemented sensing plants and seeds sense soil water they indirectly sense other plants in the cells within their zone of influence through shared water resources interaction plants interact with their environment by taking up water depending on soil water availability plants interact indirectly with other plants during the competition for resources via zones of influence stochasticity the germination process includes germination probability as a stochastic component the probabilities of seed germination and plant growth contain a stochastic factor because soil water availability is simulated as the probability that there is enough water for these processes dispersal also includes stochastic components the spatial distribution of seeds includes stochasticity in the direction and distance of the seed dispersal dispersal distances are drawn at random from a weibull shaped distribution with species specific parameters natural mortality involves stochasticity by a comparison of species specific probability to survive during a year with a random number if the probability to survive is smaller than this random number the individual dies depending on the chosen model scenario the initial distribution of adult plant individuals and seeds in space may also be random in the simulated landscape the differences in heights of neighboring cells are drawn at random from a normal distribution at the beginning of each year of the simulation a random number of rain days is drawn from the predetermined range within one vegetation growth season observation the following outputs of the model can be potentially observed at different levels such as individual population and community table 1 the basis for these compound measures is the number of individuals both adult plants and seeds their spatial coordinates and biomass of adult plants in this paper we used all of these measures except for spatial coordinates as reference values for sensitivity analysis 2 2 1 5 initialization model initialization involves setting up a landscape with the cell heights parameter height gradually distributed between the lowest and the highest heights above sea level the procedure starts with assigning the lowest cell min height the height value of its neigbours is a sum of the height of this lowest cell and an increment calculated as a difference between the highest and lowest height divided by the width of the modelled landscape a standard deviation sd height is added to this calculated height based on this initialization the following topographic objects can be identified local maxima local minima and slopes fig 3 local maxima are 1 m by 1 m cells surrounded by eight cells 8 cell neighbourhood lying below them in height local minima are cells lying below their eight neighbours in height these microhabitats correspond with patches in hegazy and kabiel 2007 slopes have at least one neighbour lying above them and at least one neighbour lying below them these topographic objects differ in their properties in terms of water and seed retention the soil seed bank is initialized by creating and randomly distributing seeds throughout the landscape seeds are assigned a set of traits a model simulation starts with the beginning of the first vegetation growth season thus only a specific number of seeds representing each species are created this approach provides us with as neutral starting conditions as possible minimizing the influence of the initial conditions on model outputs depending on topography the suitability of each cell for seed germination and plant growth is determined water availability submodel growth and germination submodels 2 2 1 6 input data topography and rainfall can be initialized in this model via algorithms this paper or via input data not implemented in the analyses presented here the rainfall data must include the number of rainy days in a year their sequential order and the overall length of the vegetation growth season the incorporated rain algorithm is rather simplified due to the absence of suitable rainfall generators for the region generating typical but not historical rainfall time series the topography data must include distribution of heights above sea level e g from digital elevation models the simulations presented in this paper are based on a topography generator initialization and a rainfall generator rain submodel 2 2 1 7 submodels here we explicitly describe the submodels that make up the environment part and the vegetation part we explain theories related to plant physiological processes underlying these submodels and give references to the respective variables and parameter values supplementary material tab s2 tab s3 environmentpart a rain submodel rainy days stimulate plant growth and seed germination through the increase of soil water availability water availability submodel and initiate dispersal according to the protection strategy supplementary material fig 1 dispersal submodel this submodel generates a list of rainy days annually where the number of the list items is the number of rainy days in a certain year and the list items themselves are the sequential numbers of the rainy days in the vegetation growth season the potential number of rainy days in the season is predetermined as is the approximate duration of the season supplementary material tab s2 the distance between the first and the last simulated rain events determines the actual duration of the vegetation growth season in the simulated year each simulated year starts with the vegetation growth season the generated list of the rainy days serves as an input to the model on rainy days soil water availability in the cells is updated in accordance with their topographic characteristics initialization b water availability submodel the water availability submodel checks if there is any precipitation either in the form of rain rain submodel or in the form of dew updating soil water availability daily during the vegetation growth season soil water availability p water availability is a cell property in the model and depends only on the presence of precipitation and the topographical properties of the cell soil water availability is expressed as a probability for plants on this cell to take up enough water for growth or germination in the case of seeds and it does not depend on species identity or age of the plant there are three soil water availability values a local minimum a slope and a local maximum these values are assigned to the topographical objects so that a local minimum has the greatest value and a local maximum has the smallest value this dependency of soil water availability on topography in the model represents the effects of local water run off from a higher site to lower neigbouring sites and higher evaporation at higher sites daws et al 2002 hegazy and kabiel 2007 in reality the amplitude of differences in soil water availability between topographical objects depends on soil properties such as soil texture which define water holding capacity and infiltration rate kramer 2019 thus soil water availability in the model is a derivative of the soil properties although these soil properties are not modelled explicitly in this model version dew as an additional source of water is particularly important under water constraints in the desert hill et al 2015 its impact is increasing with the elevation gradient in the negev kidron 1999 to study possible dew effects on plant growth and survival we included a mechanism in the model to consider the possible input of dew throughout the vegetation growth season with additional days before and after this season dew days before and dew days after respectively and accordingly update soil water availability beyond the rain events within the vegetation growth season dew presence equally affects the soil water availability of all the topographic objects possible elevation effects on dew are negligible within our research area vegetation part a dispersal submodel in this submodel seeds created in the reproduction submodel are dispersed depending on a species specific dispersal strategy escape strategy or protection strategy supplementary material fig s1 which in the simulated plant community of this model version correspond to the dispersal strategies of m parviflora and a hierochuntica respectively gutterman and ginott 1994 in general seeds are only dispersed if they reach the dispersal age s disp age i e if they are mature enough to leave the parental plant the escape strategy represents an unspecific mechanism of seed dispersal the direction of seed dispersal is drawn at random between 0 and 360 and distance calculation is based on a weibull shaped dispersal kernel parameters β s disp shape and δ s disp scale supplementary material tab s2 are species specific paradis et al 2002 and are involved in the calculation of the distance s disp distance over which seeds are dispersed from a maternal plant following the cumulative density function f 1 f 1 e x p d δ β after rearrangement of eq 1 2 d δ l n 1 f 1 β where d is a distance paradis et al 2002 the protection strategy differs from the escape strategy in an additional protective mechanism seeds with the protection strategy are dispersed to other cells only during rain events rain submodel such a mechanism increases the probability that the seeds get enough water to germinate all the following steps such as setting a direction and distance for dispersal are equal to the escape strategy species specific parameters β and δ as well as dispersal strategies are considered plant functional traits related to survival in arid environments b germination submodel the submodel runs only during the simulated vegetation growth season in the main part of this submodel seeds that were already dispersed germinate and become adult plants without explicit modelling of the seedling stage germination occurs only under the following conditions soil water availability p water availability is sufficient for germination the species specific probability to germinate is met s pr germ and seeds have spent the species specific amount of time in dormancy s days dorm an adult plant inherits the functional trait characteristics of the seed from which it emerged age of germinated adult plants is set to one the stage of seedlings is not explicitly modelled because the seedling stage of annuals lasts only a few days however seedling mortality is included by giving adult plants a lower probability of survival until they reach a certain biomass adult mortality submodel this submodel represents the ability of plants to survive in a desert environment we focus on the amount of time in dormancy and probability to germinate as plant functional traits involved in coping with the harsh environment c competition submodel this submodel reflects competition of adult plants for space and resources which are represented in this model version by soil water availability this submodel determines how space and resources are shared with the actual resource uptake expressed in biomass increase being implemented in the growth submodel the submodel runs only during the simulated vegetation growth season plants acquire water resources from the neighboring cells based on their total biomass and asymmetry of competition the competition mechanism occurs through the zone of influence zoi approach berger et al 2008 in this submodel a set of measurements related to the concept of zoi is calculated such as the radius of the zoi and the effective area for resource uptake the zoi of a plant is calculated as a circular area with a radius reflecting its potential resource use this area can cover more than one cell the model offers two calculation options for the allometric relationship between the radius of the area of the zoi and the biomass of a plant 3 r a d i u s b i t 3 8 π or 4 r a d i u s b i t 2 3 π where b is plant biomass i defines an individual in the center of a given zoi and t is a time step after lin et al 2012 eq 3 or after weiner and damgaard 2006 eq 4 the model offers two alternative implementations of the zoi approach eq 3 eq 6 lin et al 2012 radny and meyer 2018 and eq 4 eq 7 weiner et al 2001 weiner and damgaard 2006 because it was not possible to choose one over the other purely based on the literature we suggest that always both implementations are tested to choose the more suitable one for the study at hand based on sensitivity analysis model calibration or pattern oriented modelling grimm 2005 if a plant has neighbors i e their zones of influence have an overlap an effective area of these plants is calculated the effective area is the difference between the area that the plant covers and the area lost to competition with its neighbors weiner and damgaard 2006 in the calculation of the effective area the degree of asymmetry ad comp asymmetry or θ of competition is incorporated this degree of asymmetry is a measure of competition intensity it reflects how the competing plants share their resources depending on their biomass relative to the other competitors the effective area is 5 a e f f i t σ b i t θ σ b j t θ r where θ is the degree of asymmetry bi and bj are the biomasses of the interacting plants i and j r is the amount of resources shared between individuals schwinning and weiner 1998 if the degree of asymmetry equals 0 resources are shared equally regardless of plant biomass if the degree of asymmetry equals one resources are distributed proportionally to the biomass perfect size symmetry schwinning and weiner 1998 weiner and damgaard 2006 lin et al 2012 this submodel and the following one reflect the plant plant interactions in the modelled system we consider here maximum biomass and relative growth rate as traits involved in these interactions d growth submodel in the growth submodel plants increase their biomass based on the available resources the submodel runs only during the simulated vegetation growth season and follows the competition submodel if the conditions for the competition submodel are not fulfilled the growth submodel is not executed either the growth submodel runs only if the zone of influence of an individual is larger than 0 and soil water availability p water availability is larger than a random number we implemented two alternatives for the calculation of biomass gain d b dt as a function of the effective area aeff described in the competition submodel 6 d b dt r g r a e f f b 2 b m a x 4 3 or 7 d b dt r g r a e f f 1 b b m a x 1 4 where bmax is the maximum asymptotic biomass and rgr is a species specific relative growth rate after weiner and damgaard 2006 radny and meyer 2018 eq 6 or after lin et al 2012 eq 7 the relative growth rate is constant throughout all stages of the plant development in our model the model does not consider the distribution of biomass between plant organs such as leaves stem and roots biomass is equal to all the biomass gained in the process of growth plants do not lose biomass because of maintenance and metabolism processes the biomass gained by a plant during a year is positively correlated with the number of seeds it produces the model assumes that plants use all of the water available in the soil during one day according to their share in the competition process the change of soil water availability due to uptake by plants is not explicitly modelled to keep the model simple any water left after the uptake is considered lost to evaporation e ageing submodel in the ageing submodel the age of both seeds and adult plants is increased daily the age update is relevant for the submodels reproduction dispersal and germination adult plants cannot reproduce until they reach the age of reproduction ad age repr in the dispersal submodel the dispersal is possible only if seeds reach a specific age s disp age seeds also cannot germinate before they have spent a certain period of their life in dormancy germination submodel f reproduction submodel this submodel allows adult plants to produce seeds if an adult plant has reached the age of reproduction ad age repr and the biomass of reproduction ad biomass repr it produces several seeds dependent on the plant biomass s number actual with a certain seed weight s mass this actual number of seeds is calculated based on a biomass of reproduction ad biomass repr which is the minimum biomass needed for the production of at least one seed based on the assessed reproduction effort the number of seeds which this specific plant can produce at a certain time step is calculated s n u m b e r a c t u a l i n t a d b i o m a s s a d b i o m a s s r e p r where ad biomass is the actual biomass of this plant and int is a function which returns the integer part of the argument these seeds receive all functional

reproduction process is a strategy for annuals to survive under harsh environmental conditions and seed weight reproduction age and biomass are plant functional traits involved in this process g adult mortality submodel adult plants die randomly with a species specific probability of survival during a year ad prob surv which reflects the natural mortality caused by processes that are not explicitly modelled such as damage caused by wild animals or herbivores if plants have not reached a certain fraction of the maximum biomass juv biomass they are exposed to a lower survival probability juv surv seed mortality is included in the germination probability the survival probability of plants is considered as a plant functional trait that provides information about the survival strategies in a desert environment 2 3 model analysis to assess the relative effects of the model parameters on model output we conducted a sensitivity analysis supplementary material tab s2 with r r core team 2018 version 3 5 1 using the package nlrx salecker and sciaini 2019 the nlrx package provides efficient tools to set up run and analyze netlogo model simulations in r salecker et al 2019 the parameter space of the entire model was analyzed in a global sensitivity analysis to efficiently sample the parameter space we applied the morris screening procedure morris 1991 where only one parameter out of all model parameters is changed at each step we used two output indices of the morris screening procedure to assess the relative influence of parameters μ and σ the index μ is the mean of the absolute values of the elementary effects and σ is the standard deviation of the elementary effects iooss and lemaître 2015 for each model parameter we provided a minimum and a maximum value to the morris screening algorithm according to expert knowledge supplementary material tab s2 as the output reference values of the analysis metrics in the nlrx package we chose mean biomass of adult plants number of adult plants and number of seeds of two generic species with escape malva and protection anastatica seed dispersal strategies over the vegetation growth season in the first model year we chose to run the analysis for one simulated year to keep the processing time short and capture output reference values for those parameter combinations that lead to the death of all seeds and adult plants in the first year we checked the model output sensitivity to several plant functional traits and environmental parameters supplementary material tab s2 the sensitivity analysis was performed under eight scenarios combining the absence or presence of dew with one of two calculations of zoi and plant growth weiner and damgaard 2006 and lin et al 2012 and different combinations of two seed dispersal strategies supplementary material tab s4 the initial number of adult plants and the initial number of seeds were not varied during morris screening simulating the beginning of the vegetation growth season to address the large numbers of parameters and to minimize processing time we kept the following parameters fixed asymmetry of competition the lowest height in the topography generator and the shape parameter of the weibull distribution the asymmetry of competition parameter was set to one as the model considers belowground competition for water as the main limiting resource in deserts fonteyn and mahall 1978 and belowground competition is considered to be symmetric weiner et al 1997 we set the lowest height to one guided by common sense that the minimum height defines the starting point from which all other heights and differences are calculated we set the shape parameter of the weibull distribution to one which corresponds to an exponential like distribution function garcía and borda de água 2017 in total we tested the influence on the model output of 37 parameters supplementary material tab s2 tab s4 3 results 3 1 model development and validation we developed a running model that successfully passed visual plausibility checks visual diagnostics mayer and butler 1993 demonstrated that the model output is similar to informal empirical observations with respect to annual vegetation growth peaks long term species co occurrence of two species and interannual variation in mean biomass of a population fig 4 3 2 results of sensitivity analysis we analyzed the results of morris screening for eight scenarios based on the values of μ and σ in the following we consider the influence of the parameters and scenarios on the model output following the order of the corresponding model parts and submodels supplementary material fig s1 tab s4 3 2 1 environment part topographical parameters from model initialization did not have a large influence in any scenario the difference between the highest and the lowest site affected only mean biomass out of all possible output reference values and the standard deviation of the smooth slope only influenced the number of adults the standard deviation of the smooth slope also had a high σ value implying either a non linear effect or interactions with other parameters supplementary material tab s4 supplementary material fig s2 among the environmental parameters of the rain submodel the minimal number of rainy days per year and the overall length of a rainy season were highly influential parameters both of these parameters influenced largely the number of adult plants and number of seeds figs 5 and 6 for the scenarios considering the dew effect the number of days before the first rain during which dew contributes to water availability in the model showed a great influence on all output reference values except for the number of adult plants of the generic species with protection dispersal strategy anastatica the number of the days after the last rainy days when dew still can affect plant growth in contrast had very little influence on any output reference values although both of these parameters increase the length of the possible vegetation growth season regarding the parameters of the water availability submodel the model demonstrated high sensitivity to water availability at local minima and to the difference between local minima and slopes for all the scenarios both these parameters influenced largely the number of seeds and number of adult plants but much less biomass outputs the difference in water availability between slopes and local maxima influenced only the number of seeds for scenarios with dew effect included the difference in water availability between local maxima and dew contribution to water availability had a high influence on the seed number figs 5 and 6 3 2 2 vegetation part the parameters of the dispersal submodel such as the age at dispersal and the scale parameter of the dispersal distribution had no or little influence on model output surprisingly there were no remarkable differences in the sets of the most influential parameters between scenarios considering different combinations of seed dispersal strategies e g scenarios with contrasting and with the same strategies fig 7 the parameters of the germination submodel appeared to be more influential the amount of time in dormancy influenced all of the outputs of the corresponding species figs 5 and 6 additionally the parameter of malva had a large influence on the outputs of anastatica except the number of seeds of anastatica in the scenarios with calculation of zoi after weiner and damgaard 2006 seed weight had a large influence on the biomass of the corresponding species fig 8 seed probability to germinate had a large influence on the number of adult plants and seeds of the corresponding species figs 5 and 6 the influence of the parameters of the competition and growth submodels were considered in relation to the chosen algorithm of zoi calculation the relative growth rate had a large influence on the output in general remarkably the influence on the output for the opposite species was greater than on that for the corresponding one but the relative growth rate of anastatica had no influence on outputs for malva in the scenarios after weiner and damgaard 2006 the maximum biomass of adult plants had a high influence on the mean biomass of the corresponding species but maximum biomass of anastatica additionally influenced the number of adult plants while maximum biomass of malva had a greater influence on the number of seeds furthermore the maximum biomass of malva had a high influence on the mean biomass for anastatica in the scenarios with calculation of zoi after lin et al 2012 but not after weiner and damgaard 2006 compare left panels of fig 8 and fig 9 in general in the scenarios with calculation of zoi after weiner and damgaard 2006 the influence of the involved parameters on the model output of maximum biomass and relative growth rate of malva was lower than in the scenarios after lin et al 2012 for a direct comparison of the two zoi implementations see also fig s3 the comparison of the scenarios of calculation of zoi showed that they had different sets of highly influential parameters fig 10 in the scenarios with calculation of zoi after weiner and damgaard 2006 water availability at local minima was a highly influential parameter for all output reference values including the mean biomass furthermore the precipitation parameters had a high influence on the output in these scenarios it seemed that the calculation of zoi after lin et al 2012 increased the overall influence of parameters from the competition and growth submodel on model output the parameters of the reproduction submodel demonstrated different influences on the model output depending on the species dispersal strategy the age of reproduction of malva had a high influence on all the outputs of the corresponding species right panels of figs 5 6 7 8 the species specific number of seeds of malva had a high influence only on the number of seeds while it did not have any influence on the number of adult plants and mean biomass compare fig 6 against fig 5 and fig 7 on the contrary the age of reproduction and the species specific number of seeds of anastatica had either no or very little influence on model output in the adult mortality submodel the survival probability of plants had a high influence on the number of adult plants of the corresponding species there was also some influence of the anastatica probability on the output reference value for malva while the probability to survive of malva did not influence at all any of the outputs of anastatica the biomass threshold between seedling and adult plant stages did not markedly influence model output 4 discussion in this paper we present an individual and trait based model simulating desert plant community dynamics with this model it is possible to study the influence of plant functional traits and environmental factors on the community dynamics of annual plants the key aim of the model is to understand processes rather than to make forecasts model for demonstration sensu evans et al 2013 despite the fact that there are some known models describing desert vegetation james et al 2005 or desert vegetation being a special case of a large vegetation model reick et al 2013 to our knowledge the model presented in this paper is the first one with a special focus on community dynamics of desert annuals the key drivers of community dynamics in our model scenarios were more often plant functional traits than environmental factors these traits were related to competition growth germination and survival but surprisingly much less to dispersal environmental factors driving community dynamics in the model were based on soil water availability and precipitation this is in accordance with the proposed environmental drivers of actual desert communities hegazy and kabiel 2007 the proof of principle simulation reproduced accurate pulse dynamics of desert annual plant communities this shows that the model is structurally realistic the model can be parameterized to mimic complement and extend controlled greenhouse experiments this approach would not only contribute to model development but facilitate empirical experiments which are often restricted in the possible complexity of the experimental design and sample size meyer et al 2009 radny et al 2018 radny and meyer 2018 to increase the reliability of the model we suggest further validation of the model by comparing model results first against data from one field site then against several field sites then against data from a different desert ecosystem the results of the sensitivity analysis highlighted the relative importance of different environmental parameters and plant functional traits for a range of model outputs among the environmental factors the most important factors were precipitation the minimum number of rainy days and the length of the rainy season as well as soil water availability at sites with expected higher water availability local minima and slopes when dew effects were included in the model the parameters defining dew influence such as the corresponding increase in water availability and the duration of the period of dew deposition had a high influence on the model output based on these implied dew effects on the model output we advocate for a more elaborated dew submodel in future model versions with more detailed effects on plant growth the topographical parameters affected model outputs only indirectly via water availability taken together this is in line with water being the main limiting environmental factor in deserts the influence of plant functional traits on model output differed from submodel to submodel and between the generic species the parameters from competition and growth submodels such as the relative growth rate and maximum biomass were among the most influential parameters across all the considered scenarios these two parameters are plant functional traits that are involved in plant plant interactions modelled via the calculation of zois the comparison of the scenarios applying different calculations of zois demonstrated that this choice not only directly influenced how biomass is built into the model architecture but also changed the sensitivity of the entire model to the other parameters fig 10 in accordance with these results we advocate that the choice of the zoi approach in the model should be based on empirical measurements of the relationship between biomass and growth for each considered species or group of species if these measurements are not available model calibration techniques or pattern oriented modelling grimm 2005 can be applied to select the suitable calculation of zoi the germination and adult mortality submodels incorporated several highly influential parameters amount of time in dormancy probability to germinate and plant probability to survive these plant functional traits are related to the ability of plants to survive in desert environments although the importance of such germination and survival related traits was expected it was still surprising that these traits were much more important than any dispersal related traits or strategies in the model this means that coping with the local environmental conditions is much more important than exploring new environments at least in our model communities this disagrees with informed dispersal theory which claims that organisms prefer to avoid stressful local environment by investing their costs in dispersal martorell and martínez lópez 2014 we hypothesize that the greater importance of tolerance versus avoidance strategies in the form of dispersal will decrease with increasing spatial heterogeneity of the environment and that this relationship will depend on the scale of the heterogeneity we suggest testing this hypothesis in future simulation experiments with model versions that differ in spatial heterogeneity across spatial scales based on the insights from the sensitivity analysis refinement of the model parameters would be the next logical step of further model development highest priority in parameter refinement should usually be given to the high sensitivity parameters i e amount of time in dormancy probability to germinate probability to survive relative growth rate maximum biomass soil water availability and precipitation parameters parameter refinement relies on new or refined empirical measurements however not all of the high priority parameters will be easy to measure some may even turn out to be impossible to measure in practice traits that are hard to measure can be approximated by soft traits that are easier to measure hodgson et al 1999 cornelissen et al 2003 or easier to model for example root traits are very hard to measure and were approximated by zones of influence in our model similarly seed dispersal parameters can be derived from the spatial distribution of plants relative to the mother plant nathan and muller landau 2000 where it is impossible to obtain parameter values these gaps might be filled with the help of pattern oriented modelling wiegand et al 2003 grimm 2005 if applied for inverse parameterization this approach may assist in acquiring plant functional traits that are not available in relevant literature are hard to measure in the field and cannot be easily replaced by soft traits for example the output reference values in the sensitivity analysis such as biomass distributions and numbers of adult plants would be the first candidate patterns to match with observed natural patterns another pattern for comparison with real world observations would be the spatial distribution of individuals with different species identities of course if the aim of the model was changed from understanding mechanisms towards forecasting concrete community dynamics different priorities in parameter refinement may arise for forecasts the model should be run with real world rainfall data from meteorological stations and corresponding height above sea level values from digital elevation models of a reference site instead of the currently used algorithms generating environmental input for understanding general mechanisms the current model version seems to be valid and applicable but parameter refinement will certainly improve the reliability of its results our model combines trait based and individual based approaches this combination provides an opportunity to derive community properties from the functional traits of individual plants interactions between these individuals as well as between the individuals and their environment zakharova et al 2019 moreover as a mechanistic model the presented model will contribute to our understanding of the processes that affect desert plant communities as shown in the model these processes are associated both with the interaction between plants and their environment and with inter and intraspecific plant plant interactions we combined a trait based approach with an individual based approach by assigning plant functional traits to individual agents in the model with traits being directly linked to a strategy or an organismal function violle et al 2007 simultaneously the bottom up principle of individual based models grimm and railsback 2005 led to the emergence of population and community level dynamics from interacting traits and individuals salguero gómez et al 2018 modelling these individual biotic interactions e g competition or abiotic interactions e g individual responses to the fast changing desert environment was possible because of the individual and grid based nature of the model jeltsch et al 2008 using a combined trait based and individual based approach also improved the mechanistic tractability of the model the model presented in this paper can be considered as a general framework for future case studies we advocate future elaboration and extension of the model by incorporating more detail at the submodel level and by introducing new submodels for example explicitly including soil properties and plant water uptake will refine the water availability submodel a future extension to the model might consider salinity effects on soil properties water availability and water uptake depending on precipitation evaporation and vegetation submodels including the most influential parameters according to the sensitivity analysis such as competition growth and germination submodels are of particular interest in line with claims for more studies of intraspecific trait variation violle et al 2012 burton et al 2017 it is principally possible to vary trait values between individuals in our model due to its individual based approach it will also be interesting to include positive interactions in future model versions with these additional details the model can be used to tackle several research questions including studying communities under different climates representing ipcc scenarios ipcc 2018 in summary the model presented here is the first attempt to study plant community dynamics of desert annual species with the help of a combined trait and individual based approach the model suggests paths to deal with two major challenges lack of empirical data and difficulty to capture the ever changing environmental conditions that desert plant communities face the lack of data can be addressed by using trait based approaches and incorporating pattern oriented modelling to acquire parameter values that are hard to measure the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of desert communities is tackled with the individual based

24763,understanding the mechanisms driving community dynamics helps us to make reliable predictions about communities response to environmental change studying desert plant communities is particularly challenging because of strong intra and interannual fluctuations in precipitation models rise to this challenge by providing an arena for systematic evaluation of the parameter space in virtual experiments we applied a trait and individual based model to explore how community dynamics arise from the plant traits and interactions of plants with other plants and with their environment the model is based on data from annual plant communities in the negev desert dominated by the true rose of jericho anastatica hierochuntica we showed that functional traits that are involved in plant plant interactions are equally important for community dynamics as traits promoting tolerance to abiotic stress the sensitivity analysis of the model highlights relative growth rate maximum biomass the amount of time in dormancy and germination probability as the most important traits for community dynamics the model reflects the particular importance of environmental factors such as precipitation and soil water availability based on topography for community dynamics our model benefits from the ability of individual based models to capture plant plant interactions and derive community properties from individual characteristics and from the feature of trait based approaches to link traits to organismal functions our study demonstrates the advantages of the combined use of trait and individual based models for investigating community drivers in changing extreme environments keywords annual plants community dynamics functional trait individual based model negev desert 1 introduction the fate of desert plant communities is unclear in the face of climate change ipcc 2018 an extensive understanding of the mechanisms driving plant community dynamics is important to predict community responses to climate change however the drivers of community dynamics under arid environmental conditions are not well known this uncertainty is partly due to strong intra and interannual fluctuations in water supply chesson et al 2004 which are difficult to capture with relatively short term empirical investigations according to future climate change predictions interannual variability in precipitation will only increase which may generate extreme weather conditions ipcc 2018 these alterations in precipitation patterns may cause loss of desert vegetation including annual plants which are a major component of the vegetation community in these regions gutterman 2000 besides water availability loik et al 2004 and its pulsed nature chesson et al 2004 plant growth and survival are affected by extreme temperatures temperature fluctuation gutterman 2000 and soil salinity gutterman 1997 deserts are usually considered to be particularly vulnerable to climate change as their inhabitants may already grow at their physiological limits ward 2009 vale and brito 2015 however some studies claim that the communities of annual plants might be not as vulnerable as is commonly assumed e g salguero gómez et al 2012 to support the empirical investigation of the possible vulnerability of annual plant communities we present a simulation model that uses a trait and individual based modelling approach this approach provides the necessary tools to explore how community dynamics arise from individual plant traits and plant interactions in an ever fluctuating environment ecological modelling is highly suitable to explain the mechanisms underlying plant community dynamics in deserts an obvious advantage of modelling tools over empirical approaches is the opportunity to test different hypotheses without an intrusion into real ecosystems meyer et al 2009 for instance ecohydrological conditions in deserts are studied in a variety of models addressing run off and run on processes howes and abrahams 2003 dew effects gerlein safdi et al 2018 basic flow processes dijkema et al 2018 effect of fog on soil moisture dynamics li et al 2018 extraction of groundwater through roots wang et al 2018 and groundwater flow in two dimensions sun et al 2018 ecosystem processes including water carbon and nitrogen fluxes are also represented in the desert modelling literature chen and reynolds 1997 reynolds et al 2004 considering the vulnerability of desert vegetation to climatic and anthropogenic change it is surprising that most of the influential models on the topic are more than ten years old examples include models considering dispersal and germination strategies of annuals venable and lawlor 1980 calculating optimal biomass allocation king and roughgarden 1982 or modelling shrubs mcauliffe 1988 james et al 2005 although global vegetation models target desert vegetation as a special case reick et al 2013 we are not aware of any models that address community structure and dynamics of desert annuals trait based approaches provide a holistic understanding of the processes driving desert plant communities these approaches link individual characteristics of organisms with their influence on organism performance and community functions violle et al 2007 desert plant strategies to cope with abiotic and biotic stress are linked to a set of plant functional traits such a trait set connects individual performance with the ability of an organism to tolerate changes in its environment and endure competition from its neighbors based on this functional traits might be divided into two groups representing traits that mediate plant plant interactions versus traits that help coping with harsh abiotic conditions these two groups of traits represent the opposing sides of the growth survival trade off grime 1977 these interactions with the environment and with neighbors give rise to community structure and dynamics at the local scale lortie et al 2004 thus due to the link between traits and interactions trait based approaches can help to explain the processes underlying community structure and dynamics such mechanistic explanations are the basis for predictions of the fate of desert plant communities webb et al 2010 combining modelling and trait based approaches provides a better understanding of the processes that drive desert plant communities and define their response to environmental changes may et al 2009 weiss et al 2014 trait based models may assist in revealing the mutual interaction between interspecific and intraspecific plant trait variability and changes in the environment and in the community auger and shipley 2013 kazakou et al 2014 grassein et al 2014 jeffers et al 2015 individual based modelling is a particularly promising method in combination with trait based approaches zakharova et al 2019 individual based modelling follows a bottom up approach where population or community level dynamics are derived from interactions between individual organisms and their environment grimm and railsback 2005 and capture plant plant interactions at the individual level to explain local community phenomena jeltsch et al 2008 trait based approaches can bridge the gap between the specific phenotypic characteristics of individuals species performance in particular habitats population dynamics and community dynamics including species interactions salguero gómez et al 2018 zakharova et al 2019 thus combining trait based modelling with individual based modelling may assist in overcoming limitations of computing power and lack of data as well as enrich models by including functional links between individual organisms and higher levels of organization we aimed at identifying the plant traits and environmental factors that drive the dynamics of a community of desert annuals particularly concerning traits that mediate plant plant interactions versus traits that help plants to cope with harsh abiotic conditions traits that mediate plant plant interactions include for example maximum biomass and relative growth rate traits related to coping with harsh conditions include species specific dispersal parameters the species specific number of seeds and the probabilities to survive and germinate to tackle our research question we developed a trait and individual based simulation model of plant communities of annuals dominated by anastatica hierochuntica in the negev desert in israel each species in this model was represented as a set of plant functional traits for this analysis we focused on two species interactions to represent two contrasting dispersal strategies we considered escape and protection gutterman 2000 seed dispersal strategies as important functional traits of desert annual plants ensuring their survival in the desert environment species with an escape strategy produce large numbers of small seeds which are dispersed unconditionally species with a protection strategy have developed long term seed banks with seeds that are kept on the mother plants and are only dispersed in portions by rain gutterman 2000 2 methods 2 1 research site model structure parameterization and validation are based on an annual plant community in the southern part of the negev desert israel this part of the desert is characterized by mean annual precipitation of less than 80 mm allocated from september to may the meteorologic service database israel government portal 2020 soils in this region are reg soil and coarse desert alluvium which have properties of loess soils regarding wilting point and field capacity dan et al 1976 as a proof of principle that the model simulates long terms patterns similar to those observed in nature we parameterized the model with environmental parameters and plant functional traits from a field site in the negev for this we focused on a two species community based on two of the most dominant annual plant species at the hameyshar site 30 24 48 3 n 34 56 37 9 e for this we considered the plant functional traits of anastatica hierochuntica brassicaceae and malva parviflora malvaceae supplementary material tab s1 2 2 developing a trait and individual based model we developed the individual based atid model anastatica trait based and individual based desert model atid a hebrew word meaning future to investigate which environmental factors and plant functional traits are important for plant performance and community dynamics in deserts fig 1 we implemented the model in netlogo wilensky 1999 version 6 0 2 supplementary material model code s1 we combined trait based violle et al 2007 and individual based modelling approaches grimm and railsback 2005 in the following we describe our model according to the overview design concepts details odd protocol for describing individual and agent based models grimm et al 2006 2 2 1 overview design concepts and details 2 2 1 1 purpose the aim of the atid model is to assess the relative importance of environmental factors and traits driving biotic versus abiotic interactions and how these factors and traits affect long term community dynamics 2 2 1 2 entities state variables and scales agents individuals agents are adult individual plants and seeds of two generic species that are inspired by a hierochuntica and m parviflora generic species anastatica and malva these two desert annuals are characterized by two contrasting dispersal strategies protection and escape strategies gutterman 2000 the model has an in built opportunity to be extended by an unlimited number of other species with their species specific functional trait combination depending on the plant community that the model represents each species in this model is represented as a set of plant functional traits related to plant plant interactions and to coping with abiotic stress supplementary material tab s2 tab s3 spatial units the simulated surface of the model is made up of cells representing arid sites with different topography and soil water availability with a grain of 1 m by 1 m environment the environment is simulated as featuring a daily updated soil water availability that depends on two types of precipitation rainfall and dew input during the vegetation growth season the model has embedded rainfall and topography generators temporal scale the time step of the model during the simulated vegetation growth season is one day this time step is small enough to consider daily variation in precipitation and simultaneously the main physiological processes involved in growth survival and reproduction of plants outside of the vegetation growth season there are no daily updates of the model variables this reflects environmental conditions in the negev desert where annual plants grow exclusively during winter the only wet season in the region the vegetation growth season is restricted by precipitation availability time extent of a model simulation can be set depending on the research aims but we recommend at least ten years a ten year period allows observing relevant fluctuations in environmental factors that may affect the performance of annual plants the time extent can be prolonged if required spatial scale the size of one grid cell is 1 m by 1 m corresponding to the scale of field measurements of the environmental factors and vegetation parameters the spatial extent covers an area of 100 by 50 m to capture the most important processes at the level of an annual plant community this extent also reflects the size of the experimental field at the hameishar site used for proof of principle simulations 2 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling during each time step the two main parts of the model vegetation and environment are executed supplementary material fig s1 the simulation loop continues until the specified time extent is reached or no adult plant or seed agents exist anymore the vegetation part consists of several submodels involving seed and adult plant agents processes at the level of seeds seed germination germination submodel transforms seeds into adult plants if there is enough soil water availability fig 2 seed dispersal dispersal submodel distributes seeds seed mortality represents the loss of seeds caused by processes such as disease granivory desiccation or other causes of natural mortality it is incorporated in the germination submodel as an integrative part of germination probability processes at the level of adult plants adult plants experience natural mortality inter and intraspecific competition growth ageing and reproduction fig 2 natural mortality is the probability of dying because of any natural mortality factors other than direct competition e g disturbance by wild animal activity adult mortality submodel competition occurs via the zone of influence competition submodel growth is represented by an increase in biomass growth submodel based on the share of resources that each adult plant gets in the competition submodel ageing is applied to both seeds and adult plants ageing submodel because age is relevant for some submodels such as reproduction and germination reproduction leads to the production of seeds under certain conditions reproduction submodel within the environment part during each time step that is part of the vegetation growth season soil water availability is updated for each cell depending on its topography and precipitation water availability submodel the model considers topography as the most important environmental factor this assumption is made based on the nature of the soil in the region that causes a large fraction of the rainfall to move at the local scale from the highest sites to the lowest all other environmental factors in the model depend on topography refined soil water availability and salinity will be incorporated in future model extensions reflecting the progress of ongoing data collections fig 2 2 2 1 4 design concepts the model adopts a trait based approach which provides a link between individual functional traits and properties of populations and communities violle et al 2007 plant functional traits also reflect strategies adopted by individual plants in response to biotic and abiotic stress the competition mechanism implemented in the model is based on zones of influence which are circular biomass depended zones around each plant berger et al 2008 emergence heterogeneity of environmental settings together with the variability of plant functional traits determine emerging plant plant interactions as well as the patterns of the spatial distribution of adult plants and seeds population sizes of different species and response trait distributions e g size distributions at various temporal and spatial scales adaptation in the current version of the model no adaptive processes are implemented sensing plants and seeds sense soil water they indirectly sense other plants in the cells within their zone of influence through shared water resources interaction plants interact with their environment by taking up water depending on soil water availability plants interact indirectly with other plants during the competition for resources via zones of influence stochasticity the germination process includes germination probability as a stochastic component the probabilities of seed germination and plant growth contain a stochastic factor because soil water availability is simulated as the probability that there is enough water for these processes dispersal also includes stochastic components the spatial distribution of seeds includes stochasticity in the direction and distance of the seed dispersal dispersal distances are drawn at random from a weibull shaped distribution with species specific parameters natural mortality involves stochasticity by a comparison of species specific probability to survive during a year with a random number if the probability to survive is smaller than this random number the individual dies depending on the chosen model scenario the initial distribution of adult plant individuals and seeds in space may also be random in the simulated landscape the differences in heights of neighboring cells are drawn at random from a normal distribution at the beginning of each year of the simulation a random number of rain days is drawn from the predetermined range within one vegetation growth season observation the following outputs of the model can be potentially observed at different levels such as individual population and community table 1 the basis for these compound measures is the number of individuals both adult plants and seeds their spatial coordinates and biomass of adult plants in this paper we used all of these measures except for spatial coordinates as reference values for sensitivity analysis 2 2 1 5 initialization model initialization involves setting up a landscape with the cell heights parameter height gradually distributed between the lowest and the highest heights above sea level the procedure starts with assigning the lowest cell min height the height value of its neigbours is a sum of the height of this lowest cell and an increment calculated as a difference between the highest and lowest height divided by the width of the modelled landscape a standard deviation sd height is added to this calculated height based on this initialization the following topographic objects can be identified local maxima local minima and slopes fig 3 local maxima are 1 m by 1 m cells surrounded by eight cells 8 cell neighbourhood lying below them in height local minima are cells lying below their eight neighbours in height these microhabitats correspond with patches in hegazy and kabiel 2007 slopes have at least one neighbour lying above them and at least one neighbour lying below them these topographic objects differ in their properties in terms of water and seed retention the soil seed bank is initialized by creating and randomly distributing seeds throughout the landscape seeds are assigned a set of traits a model simulation starts with the beginning of the first vegetation growth season thus only a specific number of seeds representing each species are created this approach provides us with as neutral starting conditions as possible minimizing the influence of the initial conditions on model outputs depending on topography the suitability of each cell for seed germination and plant growth is determined water availability submodel growth and germination submodels 2 2 1 6 input data topography and rainfall can be initialized in this model via algorithms this paper or via input data not implemented in the analyses presented here the rainfall data must include the number of rainy days in a year their sequential order and the overall length of the vegetation growth season the incorporated rain algorithm is rather simplified due to the absence of suitable rainfall generators for the region generating typical but not historical rainfall time series the topography data must include distribution of heights above sea level e g from digital elevation models the simulations presented in this paper are based on a topography generator initialization and a rainfall generator rain submodel 2 2 1 7 submodels here we explicitly describe the submodels that make up the environment part and the vegetation part we explain theories related to plant physiological processes underlying these submodels and give references to the respective variables and parameter values supplementary material tab s2 tab s3 environmentpart a rain submodel rainy days stimulate plant growth and seed germination through the increase of soil water availability water availability submodel and initiate dispersal according to the protection strategy supplementary material fig 1 dispersal submodel this submodel generates a list of rainy days annually where the number of the list items is the number of rainy days in a certain year and the list items themselves are the sequential numbers of the rainy days in the vegetation growth season the potential number of rainy days in the season is predetermined as is the approximate duration of the season supplementary material tab s2 the distance between the first and the last simulated rain events determines the actual duration of the vegetation growth season in the simulated year each simulated year starts with the vegetation growth season the generated list of the rainy days serves as an input to the model on rainy days soil water availability in the cells is updated in accordance with their topographic characteristics initialization b water availability submodel the water availability submodel checks if there is any precipitation either in the form of rain rain submodel or in the form of dew updating soil water availability daily during the vegetation growth season soil water availability p water availability is a cell property in the model and depends only on the presence of precipitation and the topographical properties of the cell soil water availability is expressed as a probability for plants on this cell to take up enough water for growth or germination in the case of seeds and it does not depend on species identity or age of the plant there are three soil water availability values a local minimum a slope and a local maximum these values are assigned to the topographical objects so that a local minimum has the greatest value and a local maximum has the smallest value this dependency of soil water availability on topography in the model represents the effects of local water run off from a higher site to lower neigbouring sites and higher evaporation at higher sites daws et al 2002 hegazy and kabiel 2007 in reality the amplitude of differences in soil water availability between topographical objects depends on soil properties such as soil texture which define water holding capacity and infiltration rate kramer 2019 thus soil water availability in the model is a derivative of the soil properties although these soil properties are not modelled explicitly in this model version dew as an additional source of water is particularly important under water constraints in the desert hill et al 2015 its impact is increasing with the elevation gradient in the negev kidron 1999 to study possible dew effects on plant growth and survival we included a mechanism in the model to consider the possible input of dew throughout the vegetation growth season with additional days before and after this season dew days before and dew days after respectively and accordingly update soil water availability beyond the rain events within the vegetation growth season dew presence equally affects the soil water availability of all the topographic objects possible elevation effects on dew are negligible within our research area vegetation part a dispersal submodel in this submodel seeds created in the reproduction submodel are dispersed depending on a species specific dispersal strategy escape strategy or protection strategy supplementary material fig s1 which in the simulated plant community of this model version correspond to the dispersal strategies of m parviflora and a hierochuntica respectively gutterman and ginott 1994 in general seeds are only dispersed if they reach the dispersal age s disp age i e if they are mature enough to leave the parental plant the escape strategy represents an unspecific mechanism of seed dispersal the direction of seed dispersal is drawn at random between 0 and 360 and distance calculation is based on a weibull shaped dispersal kernel parameters β s disp shape and δ s disp scale supplementary material tab s2 are species specific paradis et al 2002 and are involved in the calculation of the distance s disp distance over which seeds are dispersed from a maternal plant following the cumulative density function f 1 f 1 e x p d δ β after rearrangement of eq 1 2 d δ l n 1 f 1 β where d is a distance paradis et al 2002 the protection strategy differs from the escape strategy in an additional protective mechanism seeds with the protection strategy are dispersed to other cells only during rain events rain submodel such a mechanism increases the probability that the seeds get enough water to germinate all the following steps such as setting a direction and distance for dispersal are equal to the escape strategy species specific parameters β and δ as well as dispersal strategies are considered plant functional traits related to survival in arid environments b germination submodel the submodel runs only during the simulated vegetation growth season in the main part of this submodel seeds that were already dispersed germinate and become adult plants without explicit modelling of the seedling stage germination occurs only under the following conditions soil water availability p water availability is sufficient for germination the species specific probability to germinate is met s pr germ and seeds have spent the species specific amount of time in dormancy s days dorm an adult plant inherits the functional trait characteristics of the seed from which it emerged age of germinated adult plants is set to one the stage of seedlings is not explicitly modelled because the seedling stage of annuals lasts only a few days however seedling mortality is included by giving adult plants a lower probability of survival until they reach a certain biomass adult mortality submodel this submodel represents the ability of plants to survive in a desert environment we focus on the amount of time in dormancy and probability to germinate as plant functional traits involved in coping with the harsh environment c competition submodel this submodel reflects competition of adult plants for space and resources which are represented in this model version by soil water availability this submodel determines how space and resources are shared with the actual resource uptake expressed in biomass increase being implemented in the growth submodel the submodel runs only during the simulated vegetation growth season plants acquire water resources from the neighboring cells based on their total biomass and asymmetry of competition the competition mechanism occurs through the zone of influence zoi approach berger et al 2008 in this submodel a set of measurements related to the concept of zoi is calculated such as the radius of the zoi and the effective area for resource uptake the zoi of a plant is calculated as a circular area with a radius reflecting its potential resource use this area can cover more than one cell the model offers two calculation options for the allometric relationship between the radius of the area of the zoi and the biomass of a plant 3 r a d i u s b i t 3 8 π or 4 r a d i u s b i t 2 3 π where b is plant biomass i defines an individual in the center of a given zoi and t is a time step after lin et al 2012 eq 3 or after weiner and damgaard 2006 eq 4 the model offers two alternative implementations of the zoi approach eq 3 eq 6 lin et al 2012 radny and meyer 2018 and eq 4 eq 7 weiner et al 2001 weiner and damgaard 2006 because it was not possible to choose one over the other purely based on the literature we suggest that always both implementations are tested to choose the more suitable one for the study at hand based on sensitivity analysis model calibration or pattern oriented modelling grimm 2005 if a plant has neighbors i e their zones of influence have an overlap an effective area of these plants is calculated the effective area is the difference between the area that the plant covers and the area lost to competition with its neighbors weiner and damgaard 2006 in the calculation of the effective area the degree of asymmetry ad comp asymmetry or θ of competition is incorporated this degree of asymmetry is a measure of competition intensity it reflects how the competing plants share their resources depending on their biomass relative to the other competitors the effective area is 5 a e f f i t σ b i t θ σ b j t θ r where θ is the degree of asymmetry bi and bj are the biomasses of the interacting plants i and j r is the amount of resources shared between individuals schwinning and weiner 1998 if the degree of asymmetry equals 0 resources are shared equally regardless of plant biomass if the degree of asymmetry equals one resources are distributed proportionally to the biomass perfect size symmetry schwinning and weiner 1998 weiner and damgaard 2006 lin et al 2012 this submodel and the following one reflect the plant plant interactions in the modelled system we consider here maximum biomass and relative growth rate as traits involved in these interactions d growth submodel in the growth submodel plants increase their biomass based on the available resources the submodel runs only during the simulated vegetation growth season and follows the competition submodel if the conditions for the competition submodel are not fulfilled the growth submodel is not executed either the growth submodel runs only if the zone of influence of an individual is larger than 0 and soil water availability p water availability is larger than a random number we implemented two alternatives for the calculation of biomass gain d b dt as a function of the effective area aeff described in the competition submodel 6 d b dt r g r a e f f b 2 b m a x 4 3 or 7 d b dt r g r a e f f 1 b b m a x 1 4 where bmax is the maximum asymptotic biomass and rgr is a species specific relative growth rate after weiner and damgaard 2006 radny and meyer 2018 eq 6 or after lin et al 2012 eq 7 the relative growth rate is constant throughout all stages of the plant development in our model the model does not consider the distribution of biomass between plant organs such as leaves stem and roots biomass is equal to all the biomass gained in the process of growth plants do not lose biomass because of maintenance and metabolism processes the biomass gained by a plant during a year is positively correlated with the number of seeds it produces the model assumes that plants use all of the water available in the soil during one day according to their share in the competition process the change of soil water availability due to uptake by plants is not explicitly modelled to keep the model simple any water left after the uptake is considered lost to evaporation e ageing submodel in the ageing submodel the age of both seeds and adult plants is increased daily the age update is

seed mortality is included in the germination probability the survival probability of plants is considered as a plant functional trait that provides information about the survival strategies in a desert environment 2 3 model analysis to assess the relative effects of the model parameters on model output we conducted a sensitivity analysis supplementary material tab s2 with r r core team 2018 version 3 5 1 using the package nlrx salecker and sciaini 2019 the nlrx package provides efficient tools to set up run and analyze netlogo model simulations in r salecker et al 2019 the parameter space of the entire model was analyzed in a global sensitivity analysis to efficiently sample the parameter space we applied the morris screening procedure morris 1991 where only one parameter out of all model parameters is changed at each step we used two output indices of the morris screening procedure to assess the relative influence of parameters μ and σ the index μ is the mean of the absolute values of the elementary effects and σ is the standard deviation of the elementary effects iooss and lemaître 2015 for each model parameter we provided a minimum and a maximum value to the morris screening algorithm according to expert knowledge supplementary material tab s2 as the output reference values of the analysis metrics in the nlrx package we chose mean biomass of adult plants number of adult plants and number of seeds of two generic species with escape malva and protection anastatica seed dispersal strategies over the vegetation growth season in the first model year we chose to run the analysis for one simulated year to keep the processing time short and capture output reference values for those parameter combinations that lead to the death of all seeds and adult plants in the first year we checked the model output sensitivity to several plant functional traits and environmental parameters supplementary material tab s2 the sensitivity analysis was performed under eight scenarios combining the absence or presence of dew with one of two calculations of zoi and plant growth weiner and damgaard 2006 and lin et al 2012 and different combinations of two seed dispersal strategies supplementary material tab s4 the initial number of adult plants and the initial number of seeds were not varied during morris screening simulating the beginning of the vegetation growth season to address the large numbers of parameters and to minimize processing time we kept the following parameters fixed asymmetry of competition the lowest height in the topography generator and the shape parameter of the weibull distribution the asymmetry of competition parameter was set to one as the model considers belowground competition for water as the main limiting resource in deserts fonteyn and mahall 1978 and belowground competition is considered to be symmetric weiner et al 1997 we set the lowest height to one guided by common sense that the minimum height defines the starting point from which all other heights and differences are calculated we set the shape parameter of the weibull distribution to one which corresponds to an exponential like distribution function garcía and borda de água 2017 in total we tested the influence on the model output of 37 parameters supplementary material tab s2 tab s4 3 results 3 1 model development and validation we developed a running model that successfully passed visual plausibility checks visual diagnostics mayer and butler 1993 demonstrated that the model output is similar to informal empirical observations with respect to annual vegetation growth peaks long term species co occurrence of two species and interannual variation in mean biomass of a population fig 4 3 2 results of sensitivity analysis we analyzed the results of morris screening for eight scenarios based on the values of μ and σ in the following we consider the influence of the parameters and scenarios on the model output following the order of the corresponding model parts and submodels supplementary material fig s1 tab s4 3 2 1 environment part topographical parameters from model initialization did not have a large influence in any scenario the difference between the highest and the lowest site affected only mean biomass out of all possible output reference values and the standard deviation of the smooth slope only influenced the number of adults the standard deviation of the smooth slope also had a high σ value implying either a non linear effect or interactions with other parameters supplementary material tab s4 supplementary material fig s2 among the environmental parameters of the rain submodel the minimal number of rainy days per year and the overall length of a rainy season were highly influential parameters both of these parameters influenced largely the number of adult plants and number of seeds figs 5 and 6 for the scenarios considering the dew effect the number of days before the first rain during which dew contributes to water availability in the model showed a great influence on all output reference values except for the number of adult plants of the generic species with protection dispersal strategy anastatica the number of the days after the last rainy days when dew still can affect plant growth in contrast had very little influence on any output reference values although both of these parameters increase the length of the possible vegetation growth season regarding the parameters of the water availability submodel the model demonstrated high sensitivity to water availability at local minima and to the difference between local minima and slopes for all the scenarios both these parameters influenced largely the number of seeds and number of adult plants but much less biomass outputs the difference in water availability between slopes and local maxima influenced only the number of seeds for scenarios with dew effect included the difference in water availability between local maxima and dew contribution to water availability had a high influence on the seed number figs 5 and 6 3 2 2 vegetation part the parameters of the dispersal submodel such as the age at dispersal and the scale parameter of the dispersal distribution had no or little influence on model output surprisingly there were no remarkable differences in the sets of the most influential parameters between scenarios considering different combinations of seed dispersal strategies e g scenarios with contrasting and with the same strategies fig 7 the parameters of the germination submodel appeared to be more influential the amount of time in dormancy influenced all of the outputs of the corresponding species figs 5 and 6 additionally the parameter of malva had a large influence on the outputs of anastatica except the number of seeds of anastatica in the scenarios with calculation of zoi after weiner and damgaard 2006 seed weight had a large influence on the biomass of the corresponding species fig 8 seed probability to germinate had a large influence on the number of adult plants and seeds of the corresponding species figs 5 and 6 the influence of the parameters of the competition and growth submodels were considered in relation to the chosen algorithm of zoi calculation the relative growth rate had a large influence on the output in general remarkably the influence on the output for the opposite species was greater than on that for the corresponding one but the relative growth rate of anastatica had no influence on outputs for malva in the scenarios after weiner and damgaard 2006 the maximum biomass of adult plants had a high influence on the mean biomass of the corresponding species but maximum biomass of anastatica additionally influenced the number of adult plants while maximum biomass of malva had a greater influence on the number of seeds furthermore the maximum biomass of malva had a high influence on the mean biomass for anastatica in the scenarios with calculation of zoi after lin et al 2012 but not after weiner and damgaard 2006 compare left panels of fig 8 and fig 9 in general in the scenarios with calculation of zoi after weiner and damgaard 2006 the influence of the involved parameters on the model output of maximum biomass and relative growth rate of malva was lower than in the scenarios after lin et al 2012 for a direct comparison of the two zoi implementations see also fig s3 the comparison of the scenarios of calculation of zoi showed that they had different sets of highly influential parameters fig 10 in the scenarios with calculation of zoi after weiner and damgaard 2006 water availability at local minima was a highly influential parameter for all output reference values including the mean biomass furthermore the precipitation parameters had a high influence on the output in these scenarios it seemed that the calculation of zoi after lin et al 2012 increased the overall influence of parameters from the competition and growth submodel on model output the parameters of the reproduction submodel demonstrated different influences on the model output depending on the species dispersal strategy the age of reproduction of malva had a high influence on all the outputs of the corresponding species right panels of figs 5 6 7 8 the species specific number of seeds of malva had a high influence only on the number of seeds while it did not have any influence on the number of adult plants and mean biomass compare fig 6 against fig 5 and fig 7 on the contrary the age of reproduction and the species specific number of seeds of anastatica had either no or very little influence on model output in the adult mortality submodel the survival probability of plants had a high influence on the number of adult plants of the corresponding species there was also some influence of the anastatica probability on the output reference value for malva while the probability to survive of malva did not influence at all any of the outputs of anastatica the biomass threshold between seedling and adult plant stages did not markedly influence model output 4 discussion in this paper we present an individual and trait based model simulating desert plant community dynamics with this model it is possible to study the influence of plant functional traits and environmental factors on the community dynamics of annual plants the key aim of the model is to understand processes rather than to make forecasts model for demonstration sensu evans et al 2013 despite the fact that there are some known models describing desert vegetation james et al 2005 or desert vegetation being a special case of a large vegetation model reick et al 2013 to our knowledge the model presented in this paper is the first one with a special focus on community dynamics of desert annuals the key drivers of community dynamics in our model scenarios were more often plant functional traits than environmental factors these traits were related to competition growth germination and survival but surprisingly much less to dispersal environmental factors driving community dynamics in the model were based on soil water availability and precipitation this is in accordance with the proposed environmental drivers of actual desert communities hegazy and kabiel 2007 the proof of principle simulation reproduced accurate pulse dynamics of desert annual plant communities this shows that the model is structurally realistic the model can be parameterized to mimic complement and extend controlled greenhouse experiments this approach would not only contribute to model development but facilitate empirical experiments which are often restricted in the possible complexity of the experimental design and sample size meyer et al 2009 radny et al 2018 radny and meyer 2018 to increase the reliability of the model we suggest further validation of the model by comparing model results first against data from one field site then against several field sites then against data from a different desert ecosystem the results of the sensitivity analysis highlighted the relative importance of different environmental parameters and plant functional traits for a range of model outputs among the environmental factors the most important factors were precipitation the minimum number of rainy days and the length of the rainy season as well as soil water availability at sites with expected higher water availability local minima and slopes when dew effects were included in the model the parameters defining dew influence such as the corresponding increase in water availability and the duration of the period of dew deposition had a high influence on the model output based on these implied dew effects on the model output we advocate for a more elaborated dew submodel in future model versions with more detailed effects on plant growth the topographical parameters affected model outputs only indirectly via water availability taken together this is in line with water being the main limiting environmental factor in deserts the influence of plant functional traits on model output differed from submodel to submodel and between the generic species the parameters from competition and growth submodels such as the relative growth rate and maximum biomass were among the most influential parameters across all the considered scenarios these two parameters are plant functional traits that are involved in plant plant interactions modelled via the calculation of zois the comparison of the scenarios applying different calculations of zois demonstrated that this choice not only directly influenced how biomass is built into the model architecture but also changed the sensitivity of the entire model to the other parameters fig 10 in accordance with these results we advocate that the choice of the zoi approach in the model should be based on empirical measurements of the relationship between biomass and growth for each considered species or group of species if these measurements are not available model calibration techniques or pattern oriented modelling grimm 2005 can be applied to select the suitable calculation of zoi the germination and adult mortality submodels incorporated several highly influential parameters amount of time in dormancy probability to germinate and plant probability to survive these plant functional traits are related to the ability of plants to survive in desert environments although the importance of such germination and survival related traits was expected it was still surprising that these traits were much more important than any dispersal related traits or strategies in the model this means that coping with the local environmental conditions is much more important than exploring new environments at least in our model communities this disagrees with informed dispersal theory which claims that organisms prefer to avoid stressful local environment by investing their costs in dispersal martorell and martínez lópez 2014 we hypothesize that the greater importance of tolerance versus avoidance strategies in the form of dispersal will decrease with increasing spatial heterogeneity of the environment and that this relationship will depend on the scale of the heterogeneity we suggest testing this hypothesis in future simulation experiments with model versions that differ in spatial heterogeneity across spatial scales based on the insights from the sensitivity analysis refinement of the model parameters would be the next logical step of further model development highest priority in parameter refinement should usually be given to the high sensitivity parameters i e amount of time in dormancy probability to germinate probability to survive relative growth rate maximum biomass soil water availability and precipitation parameters parameter refinement relies on new or refined empirical measurements however not all of the high priority parameters will be easy to measure some may even turn out to be impossible to measure in practice traits that are hard to measure can be approximated by soft traits that are easier to measure hodgson et al 1999 cornelissen et al 2003 or easier to model for example root traits are very hard to measure and were approximated by zones of influence in our model similarly seed dispersal parameters can be derived from the spatial distribution of plants relative to the mother plant nathan and muller landau 2000 where it is impossible to obtain parameter values these gaps might be filled with the help of pattern oriented modelling wiegand et al 2003 grimm 2005 if applied for inverse parameterization this approach may assist in acquiring plant functional traits that are not available in relevant literature are hard to measure in the field and cannot be easily replaced by soft traits for example the output reference values in the sensitivity analysis such as biomass distributions and numbers of adult plants would be the first candidate patterns to match with observed natural patterns another pattern for comparison with real world observations would be the spatial distribution of individuals with different species identities of course if the aim of the model was changed from understanding mechanisms towards forecasting concrete community dynamics different priorities in parameter refinement may arise for forecasts the model should be run with real world rainfall data from meteorological stations and corresponding height above sea level values from digital elevation models of a reference site instead of the currently used algorithms generating environmental input for understanding general mechanisms the current model version seems to be valid and applicable but parameter refinement will certainly improve the reliability of its results our model combines trait based and individual based approaches this combination provides an opportunity to derive community properties from the functional traits of individual plants interactions between these individuals as well as between the individuals and their environment zakharova et al 2019 moreover as a mechanistic model the presented model will contribute to our understanding of the processes that affect desert plant communities as shown in the model these processes are associated both with the interaction between plants and their environment and with inter and intraspecific plant plant interactions we combined a trait based approach with an individual based approach by assigning plant functional traits to individual agents in the model with traits being directly linked to a strategy or an organismal function violle et al 2007 simultaneously the bottom up principle of individual based models grimm and railsback 2005 led to the emergence of population and community level dynamics from interacting traits and individuals salguero gómez et al 2018 modelling these individual biotic interactions e g competition or abiotic interactions e g individual responses to the fast changing desert environment was possible because of the individual and grid based nature of the model jeltsch et al 2008 using a combined trait based and individual based approach also improved the mechanistic tractability of the model the model presented in this paper can be considered as a general framework for future case studies we advocate future elaboration and extension of the model by incorporating more detail at the submodel level and by introducing new submodels for example explicitly including soil properties and plant water uptake will refine the water availability submodel a future extension to the model might consider salinity effects on soil properties water availability and water uptake depending on precipitation evaporation and vegetation submodels including the most influential parameters according to the sensitivity analysis such as competition growth and germination submodels are of particular interest in line with claims for more studies of intraspecific trait variation violle et al 2012 burton et al 2017 it is principally possible to vary trait values between individuals in our model due to its individual based approach it will also be interesting to include positive interactions in future model versions with these additional details the model can be used to tackle several research questions including studying communities under different climates representing ipcc scenarios ipcc 2018 in summary the model presented here is the first attempt to study plant community dynamics of desert annual species with the help of a combined trait and individual based approach the model suggests paths to deal with two major challenges lack of empirical data and difficulty to capture the ever changing environmental conditions that desert plant communities face the lack of data can be addressed by using trait based approaches and incorporating pattern oriented modelling to acquire parameter values that are hard to measure the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of desert communities is tackled with the individual based modelling approach in this way the model presented here will advance the research of desert plant communities and understanding their fate under global changes declaration of competing interest the

24764,hyperallometric reproduction whereby large females contribute relatively more to the renewal of the population than small females is purported to be widespread in wild populations especially in fish species bioenergetic models derived from a sufficiently general metabolic theory should be able to capture such a relationship but it was recently stated that no existing models adequately capture hyperallometric reproduction if this were true it would seriously challenge our capacity to develop robust predictions of the life history and population dynamics in changing environments for many species here using the european sea bass dicentrarchus labrax as a test case we demonstrate multiple ways that hyperallometric reproduction in a population may emerge from the dynamic energy budget deb theory some inherently related to the metabolism and life history and others related to plastic or genetically based intraspecific variation in addition we demonstrate an empirical and modelled hypoallometric scaling of reproduction in this species when environment is controlled this work shows how complex metabolic responses may underlie apparently simple relationships between weight and reproduction in the wild and provides new and testable hypotheses regarding the factors driving reproductive scaling relationships found in the wild keywords fishes dynamic energy budget scaling life history variability 1 introduction hyperallometric reproduction defined as a more than proportional increase of the fecundity relative to the body mass of individuals within a species has a wide range of consequences for our understanding of population dynamics our predictions in a changing environment and ultimately our conservation policies marshall et al 2019 such a reproductive scaling pattern has recently been described for a wide range of fish species barneche et al 2018 and implies that large females contribute more to the renewal of the population than do small females relatively to their body mass large females therefore have a higher conservation value and their protection should be prioritized over small females to increase the sustainability of the population birkeland and dayton 2005 ideally population dynamics models should be driven by an underlying model of bioenergetic processes that can explicitly capture the observed scaling of reproduction a number of growth models now exist including some derived from general theories of how metabolism works i e metabolic theories van der meer 2006 it was recently argued that the observed hyperallometric scaling of reproduction could not be explained using current bioenergetic models marshall and white 2019 if this were true and hyperallometric reproduction is indeed widespread it would call into question the generality of existing theory and limit our capacity to develop robust models of the life history and population dynamics for many species however a pattern of hyperallometric reproduction observed in wild populations is challenging to interpret when the age environmental life history and genetic background of the individuals displaying this relationship are unknown kearney 2019 this is the case for the data underlying hyperallometric reproduction in fish which derive almost entirely 98 from observations of wild individuals barneche et al 2018 investigating a fecundity to body mass scaling naturally results from the comparison of different sized individuals but what is driving this variability why are large individuals larger multiple biological explanations are possible first in nature there is no reason to believe that all animals encounter the same environmental conditions over their life history this is particularly true for species with wide geographical and habitat ranges riede 2004 wheeler 1975 including the atlantic cod and european sea bass comparing the weight and reproductive output of wild harvested individuals of such species necessarily involves confounding effects related to environmental history these effects are amplified when investigating the variability in weight without evaluating the age since large animals are more likely to have encountered better environments compared to small individuals of the same age second whether it is the consequence of predation of sudden environmental challenges or of human activities selective pressures in the wild are particularly numerous and diversified these multiple sources of selection are considered as the primary mechanisms of polymorphism in nature orr and smith 1998 metabolic capacities driving growth maturation reproduction and ultimately fitness are central phenotypic targets of selective pressures pettersen et al 2018 within a given population one can expect genetically based variability in metabolic capacities resulting in intrinsic individual differences in assimilation and growth capacity besson et al 2019 thus the life history patterns obtained from wild harvested individuals may also reflect the action of selection the environmental and genetic variation inherent in samples from wild populations means that one should be cautious in attributing a pattern of reproductive hyperallometry to metabolic mechanisms involved at the individual level rather than using such an empirical observation to dismiss existing models of individual growth and metabolism one can instead ask under what environmental and genetic circumstances the model would produce the empirical pattern in question this then leads to clear and testable predictions about what might be occurring in nature in parallel detailed laboratory experiments are critical to control and evaluate selective pressures and environmental variabilities and thereby evaluate theoretical expectations a common point of contention and misunderstanding in modelling growth centers around the distinction between phenomenological and mechanistic models white and marshall 2019 a phenomenological model provides a quantitative description of a process using a simple function thought to capture the essence of an underlying process often these are allometric functions in the case of growth models in contrast mechanistic models are derived through the explicit representation of processes occurring at a lower level to the phenomenon in question in growth models these processes are the chemical transformations from food to biomass which are modelled on the basis of physicochemical principles including energy and mass conservation successful mechanistic models can predict dynamics under complex sequences of environmental conditions with the same variables and parameters something phenomenological models cannot do without adding parameters or changing their functional form in this sense mechanistic modeling can help reconstruct environmental history when they are inverted to fit growth data from the wild lavaud et al 2019 pecquerie et al 2009 in this paper we explore the potential for reproductive hyperallometry under the framework of dynamic energy budget deb theory a general mechanistic metabolic theory that captures the environmental food temperature and internal chemical transformations and allocations constraints on development growth and reproduction from first principles kooijman 2010 1986 in particular we consider three working hypotheses fig 1 and illustrate them using the european sea bass dicentrarchus labrax a species shown to exhibit hyperallometric reproduction in the wild mayer et al 1990 1 the ontogenetic hypothesis that hyperallometric reproduction can emerge for an individual simulated under deb theory across its ontogeny 2 the environmental variation hypothesis that hyperallometric reproduction can be produced by realistic variation in feeding rate and temperature environments among individuals with the same metabolic capacities 3 the metabolic capacities variation hypothesis that inter individual variation in deb parameter values can lead to hyperallometric reproduction finally we provide empirical data on the allometric scaling of reproduction under controlled environmental conditions and limited selection pressure we discuss our results in the light of deb predictions under such environmental conditions since the deb model is generic between fish species only parameters vary the results of our study are transposable to most other fish species 2 method 2 1 the deb model for d labrax the deb parameters for d labrax used in our simulations are available online lika et al 2018 and are provided in supplementary tables 1 2 and 3 they were inversely estimated from observations on development times at multiple temperatures lengths and weights at birth hatch metamorphosis maturation and ultimate size as well as growth curves in length and weight reproduction and feeding rate vs weight and ammonia production vs temperature stavrakidis zachou et al 2019 the one to many relationship between parameter values and expected observations in the estimation procedure together with the requirement for physically permissible parameter values e g not violating mass or energy conservation strongly constrains the possible parameter values the standard deb model considers the organism to be made up of two macrochemical pools of fixed stoichiometry the reserve e and structure v which together with the maturity state e h and the reproduction buffer e r comprise the state variables of the model as depicted by the 4 compartments in fig 2 kooijman 2010 the theory assumes that an organism transforms food into a reserve compartment at a daily rate ṗa supplementary table 4 proportional to its structural surface v 2 3 the scaled functional response f and the deb parameter p am the f value is expressed as a fraction of the maximum possible feeding rate and therefore takes values between 0 starvation and 1 feeding ad libitum energy is then mobilized from the reserve compartment at a rate ṗc under 1st order dynamics fig 2 supplementary table 4 a fraction κ of this energy contributes to growth ṗg after having paid for the maintenance of the structure ṗs proportional to structural volume v while 1 κ goes to maturation ṗr and its associated maintenance ṗj the standard deb model assumes that κ remains constant throughout the life cycle of the animal consistent with the close fit of the pütter von bertalanffy growth model to empirical data kooijman 2010 maturity is achieved when total energy invested in maturation reaches e h p supplementary table 1 then ṗr becomes the amount of energy invested daily in reproduction fig 2 the model uses nine parameters supplementary table 1 to calculate these six energy fluxes ṗa ṗc ṗs ṗj ṗg and ṗr following the standard deb model kooijman 2010 in addition five parameters supplementary table 2 are used for the calculation of the thermal correction coefficient supplementary table 4 which modulates energy fluxes by temperature the deb model for d labrax assumes a metabolic acceleration between hatching and a transition phase called metamorphosis kooijman 2014 this acceleration common in fish species kooijman et al 2011 consists of a period where growth is not isometric but instead growth in structural surface is proportional to the growth of structural volume v supplementary table 4 acceleration ends when the amount of energy invested in maturation reaches e h j supplementary table 1 at a given time an organism is described by its stored reserves e structural volume v maturity eh and reproductive buffer er the dynamics of e l eh and er and the associated metabolic processes are presented in the supplementary table 4 we estimated the wet weight as the sum of stored reserves and total soma assuming a water content of 80 supplementary table 4 in contrast to kearney 2019 we excluded reproduction buffer from the weight calculation instead modeling the weight of a female post spawning no reproduction buffer handling rule was used since the total reproductive buffer was not affecting the total weight nor the daily investment in reproduction in our simulations 2 2 simulations based on our three hypotheses the deb model was run for d labrax at a body temperature of 19 c and a feeding rate set at 70 of the satiety while keeping all parameters equal across all simulations only one forcing variable temperature or feeding rate or one target deb parameter see below was modified according to the hypothesis being explored fig 1 to test the ontogenetic hypothesis reproductive output and weight over several ages post maturity were compared for the average d labrax living at 19 c and a 70 feeding rate to assess the environmental variation hypothesis weight and reproductive output of the animals were compared at 2000 days post fertilization dpf and we tested the effects of differences in whole life cycle body temperature from 15 to 23 c in 2 c intervals with a 70 feeding rate differences in feeding rate ranging from 60 to 80 of maximum feeding rate and body temperature at 19 c similarly the metabolic capacities variation hypothesis was tested on simulations performed at 19 c and 70 feeding rate and data were compared at 2000 dpf for individuals varying in one deb parameter at a time the effects of a variation from 10 to 10 around the average value available for d labrax lika et al 2018 was evaluated we tested all parameters of supplementary table 1 leading to a significant change in weight and reproductive investment at a given age and therefore focused on the following parameters the surface area specific maximum assimilation rate ṗ am in j d cm2 driving the maximum amount of energy the animal can assimilate per unit of structural surface when food is ad libitum the allocation fraction to soma κ specifying the fraction of energy mobilized from the reserve compartment allocated to the production and maintenance of structure the specific cost for structure e g j cm3 which represents the cost biomass and overhead to the animal of transforming the energy allocated towards growth ṗg in structure the somatic maintenance cost ṗ m j cm3 d corresponding to energy requirements to maintain a unit of structure the maturity at birth e h b the amount of energy invested in maturation needed to start feeding considered as birth the maturity at metamorphosis e h j the amount of energy invested in maturation needed to finish the acceleration phase 2 3 testing hypo iso or hyperallometry hyperallometry was tested by comparing deb model outputs for wet weight and daily investment in reproduction on log10 transformed axes a linear model was fitted to the simulated data and the hypothesis of hyperallometry was accepted if the model slope was higher than one fig 1 a scaling with a slope of one is considered isometric while a slope below one is called hypoallometric barneche et al 2018 2 4 empirical test of reproductive scaling an empirical test of hyperallometric reproduction was based on weight and total reproductive volume data available for d labrax from the research center in palavas ifremer in this research center animals were reared in identical environmental conditions at densities below 30kg m3 and selective pressure during the rearing was lowered as much as possible to maximize survival tanks were supplied with seawater at a temperature ranging from 13 to 25 c with an average of 18 01 c between years 2012 and 2019 oxygen concentration was maintained between 90 and 120 saturation via oxygen supplementation fish were reared under natural light and fed on demand with a commercial diet using a self feeder with a limit of 1 of the total biomass per day five days per week during the breeding season starting in january females weighing 3 3kg 1 5 s d at a near spawning stage were hormonally injected and the total volume spawn was measured the daily investment in reproduction was estimated over time using the deb model with a feeding rate of 71 4 corresponding to a feeding frequency of 5 days per week and a temperature of 18 c and compared against the weights measured in the empirical test 3 results fig 3 summarizes the outcomes of deb simulations leading to hypo iso or hyper allometric reproduction as a result of our three working hypotheses 3 1 ontogenetic hypothesis the deb model parameters for european sea bass generated a close to isometric scaling of reproduction under a constant environment from sexual maturity to 10000 days post fertilization dpf fig 3a this suggests that investment in reproduction relative to body mass is constant overtime thus the daily reproductive investment per body mass of the biggest female of the simulation 10000 dpf 2151g was comparable to that of the smallest 1200 dpf 659g with 7 87 and 7 5 j g wet weight respectively nevertheless between these two extreme points the scaling was not linear and the pattern observed in reproductive scaling depended on whether younger or older classes of fish were studied i e it varied with ontogeny if only younger fish less than 2000 dpf and 1324g were used for the relationship the scaling became hyperallometric red line in fig 3a on the contrary when the scaling was investigated for older individuals hyperallometry was lost and the relationship even became hypoallometric blue line in fig 3a 3 2 environmental variation hypothesis within the temperature range investigated here 15 23 c increasing temperature led to heavier fish at a same age purely due to the rate effects of temperature on growth fig 3b these fish also invested more in reproduction and this effect increased disproportionately with body mass an exponent of almost 2 1 97 was found for this thermal range this translates to an investment in reproduction relative to body mass two times 5 33 vs 11 65 j g wet weight greater for the biggest fish of the simulation compared to the smallest 806 vs 1778g growth and reproduction were also strongly positively influenced by the feeding rate fig 3b between individual variability in feeding rate over the range considered 60 80 also led to an apparent hyperallometry in the relationship for d labrax with an exponent of 1 34 fig 3b the females having assimilated more energy during their life history were heavier but they also invested more in reproduction than small females relative to their body mass 3 3 metabolic capacities variation hypothesis in deb theory variability in metabolic capacities among individuals translates to variability in deb parameters allowing deb parameters to vary individually around their estimated values lika et al 2018 can lead to apparent hypo iso or hyper metric reproduction fig 3c this was observed when comparing individuals of the same age here 2000 dpf with an identical environmental life history but varying some of their intrinsic metabolic capacities fig 3c a variability ranging from 10 to 10 in the relative allocation to reproduction κ can show strong hypoallometry fig 3c with an increase of κ weight rose but less energy was invested in reproduction individuals with higher κ allocated more energy towards structure and therefore grew faster fig 2 in parallel a lower fraction 1 κ of the energy was available for reproduction leading to shortened daily investment in reproduction females with lower eg became larger at a same age but they invested the same amount of energy in reproduction proportionally to their body mass leading to isometric scaling indeed a change in eg affects only the final transformation of energy to volume of the structure on the contrary a change in ṗ am resulted in hyperallometric relationship fig 3c in accordance with changes in feeding rate both involved proportionally in the same deb equation see calculation of the assimilation rate ṗa in supplementary table 4 a change in maturity thresholds e h b and e h j also resulted in hyperallometric reproduction supplementary fig 1 the decrease of e h b or the increase of e h j led to increased weight and energy invested in reproduction for d labrax of the same age the increase was nevertheless disproportionate with large individuals investing more than small individuals relative to body mass 3 4 empirical scaling in controlled conditions our laboratory data on reproductive scaling for weights ranging from 0 5 to 10 kg under constant food and temperature show that d labrax displayed a hypoallometric scaling of reproduction fig 4a the deb model for d labrax run using the ontogenetic hypothesis weight differences are the result of age differences on the same empirical weights predicted a similar hypoallometric reproduction fig 4b the exponents extracted from empirical and simulated scalings were comparable 0 843 vs 0 888 respectively 4 discussion collectively our results demonstrate that multiple biological explanations integrated in deb simulations can lead to the hyperallometric reproduction previously observed for a wide range of fish species in the wild barneche et al 2018 deb models have been used to capture the life cycle of more than 2000 animal species across all major phyla our results are therefore likely applicable to many other species kooijman et al 2020 we thus show that it is premature to conclude that patterns of hyperallometric reproduction in nature necessitate a major revision of all existing growth models marshall and white 2019 moreover our empirical data on d labrax obtained in controlled conditions are not consistent with the hyperallometric pattern seen in wild fish this striking contrast probably derives from the differences between wild and laboratory conditions wild caught animals are necessarily more varied in their environmental life histories or intrinsic metabolic capacities than their counterpart laboratory reared animals consequently laboratory conditions permit more powerful tests of ontogenetic scaling relationships because temperature food availability and water quality can be controlled in addition selective pressure is relaxed reducing the selection based on growth maturation or reproduction for all animals of the population it is surprising that so few laboratory data are available on the scaling of fish reproduction yet laboratory settings may also impose confounding factors for instance spawning in our laboratory study was induced by hormonal injection ako et al 1994 emata 2003 and we do not know whether this could influence the allometric pattern however assuming a concentration of 905 eggs per ml chatain 1994 our empirical data fall mean 150 118 58 800 eggs kg in the range of non induced spawning in european sea bass cerdá et al 1995 our deb simulations run using the empirical environmental conditions under the ontogenetic hypothesis where the weight of individuals was only differing according to age were very good at predicting the empiric hypoallometric scaling observed this hypoallometric reproduction was also observed in fig 3a on the heaviest and oldest animals with a weight starting at 1324g the females from the ifremer research station of palavas used for the scaling were much heavier mean above 3000g leading to an even more hypoallometric scaling than in fig 4a our results therefore suggest that the generalized hyperallometric reproduction observed in the wild is not the consequence of a metabolic change in reproductive allocation over life stages it is rather the result of differences in environmental history or metabolic capacities between the wild caught animals used for the scaling the deb model is able to incorporate these differences and we demonstrate that they can both lead to predicted hyperallometric reproduction our analyses investigating different thermal histories or feeding rates show that they both result in hyperallometry the associated simulations were obtained using very simple environmental scenarios where growth maturation and reproduction of d labrax were modeled at constant temperature or feeding rate varying around 19 c and 70 of satiety respectively future work should consider more complex environmental histories based on real natural conditions to see if hyperallometry could still arise the development of new tracking devices brownscombe et al 2019 biomonitoring tools hartman et al 2015 or molecular biomarkers of stress or aging anastasiadi and piferrer 2020 sadoul and geffroy 2019 will facilitate this goal our work also shows that variability in some deb parameters can lead to apparent hyperallometry when they modify the energy allocation towards reproduction and growth although little information is available on variability in deb parameters between individuals of a same species a change of 10 as used in our study is below the biological variability previously observed for key metabolic differences between european sea bass individuals in a controlled environment besson et al 2019 mckenzie et al 2014 a recent study investigated the intraspecies variability in deb parameters of the copepod nitocra spinipes and found that deb parameters were following a log normal distribution with a standard deviation above 0 15 koch and de schamphelaere 2020 the 10 of variability in deb parameters that we tested therefore fall within this empirical range while only one parameter was modified at a time in this study we can expect individuals to differ from one another for multiple parameters of the deb model however we show here using a simplified scenario that hyperallometry can also be the consequence of differences in metabolic capacities between individuals harvested in the wild further work is needed to quantify the genetic basis and heritability of this variability and therefore the evolutionary potential within a species similarly to our empirical data several previous studies have also observed iso to hypoallometric reproduction for other aquatic animals such as brachyuran crabs hines 1982 isopods glazier et al 2003 or turtles iverson et al 2019 out of our three hypotheses hypoallometry was obtained in old individuals within the ontogenetic hypothesis or through the variability of some specific metabolic capacities such as changes in the allocation fraction to soma κ or to a lesser extent ṗ m interestingly our work suggests that hypoallometric scaling cannot be obtained through differences in environmental life history consequently we make the supposition that hypoallometric scaling found in nature using individuals of various ages necessarily results from variability in intrinsic metabolic capacities probably mostly related to κ this parameter has been previously discussed as a potential candidate of physiological mode of actions of some contaminants jager et al 2010 differential exposure to contaminants or previous toxicological life history can explain such variabilities ashauer and jager 2018 sadoul et al 2019 variability in κ can probably also be the consequence of genetic differences within species nevertheless to our knowledge no studies have investigated the variability in this parameter between genetically different individuals 4 1 concluding remarks our study was motivated by recent arguments that current theories of growth are unable to explain the pattern of hyperallometric reproduction observed in fish and some other organisms and should therefore be substantially revised marshall and white 2019 white and marshall 2019 extending the arguments of kearney 2019 we have provided simple examples of how hyperallometric reproduction could plausibly emerge from dynamic energy budget theory depending on the ontogenetic stage considered within individuals of the same genotype i e parameter values the environmental histories experienced among individuals of the same genotype and the potential outcome of selection on individuals with different metabolic genotypes our empirical findings based on laboratory observations of fish reproduction emphasize the limits of making metabolic generalizations from scaling patterns obtained in nature this is mainly because of a combination of unknown ages and unknown environmental and selection histories of individuals harvested in the wild taken together our results highlight the potential biological complexity hidden behind a simple relationship between weight and reproduction in the wild we show that deb theory is very capable of explaining hyperallometric reproduction and that it provides a conceptual framework for deciphering the possible underlying biological mechanisms by which hyperallometric reproduction manifests in the wild our findings show that we have certainly not outgrown current growth models marshall and white

24764,hyperallometric reproduction whereby large females contribute relatively more to the renewal of the population than small females is purported to be widespread in wild populations especially in fish species bioenergetic models derived from a sufficiently general metabolic theory should be able to capture such a relationship but it was recently stated that no existing models adequately capture hyperallometric reproduction if this were true it would seriously challenge our capacity to develop robust predictions of the life history and population dynamics in changing environments for many species here using the european sea bass dicentrarchus labrax as a test case we demonstrate multiple ways that hyperallometric reproduction in a population may emerge from the dynamic energy budget deb theory some inherently related to the metabolism and life history and others related to plastic or genetically based intraspecific variation in addition we demonstrate an empirical and modelled hypoallometric scaling of reproduction in this species when environment is controlled this work shows how complex metabolic responses may underlie apparently simple relationships between weight and reproduction in the wild and provides new and testable hypotheses regarding the factors driving reproductive scaling relationships found in the wild keywords fishes dynamic energy budget scaling life history variability 1 introduction hyperallometric reproduction defined as a more than proportional increase of the fecundity relative to the body mass of individuals within a species has a wide range of consequences for our understanding of population dynamics our predictions in a changing environment and ultimately our conservation policies marshall et al 2019 such a reproductive scaling pattern has recently been described for a wide range of fish species barneche et al 2018 and implies that large females contribute more to the renewal of the population than do small females relatively to their body mass large females therefore have a higher conservation value and their protection should be prioritized over small females to increase the sustainability of the population birkeland and dayton 2005 ideally population dynamics models should be driven by an underlying model of bioenergetic processes that can explicitly capture the observed scaling of reproduction a number of growth models now exist including some derived from general theories of how metabolism works i e metabolic theories van der meer 2006 it was recently argued that the observed hyperallometric scaling of reproduction could not be explained using current bioenergetic models marshall and white 2019 if this were true and hyperallometric reproduction is indeed widespread it would call into question the generality of existing theory and limit our capacity to develop robust models of the life history and population dynamics for many species however a pattern of hyperallometric reproduction observed in wild populations is challenging to interpret when the age environmental life history and genetic background of the individuals displaying this relationship are unknown kearney 2019 this is the case for the data underlying hyperallometric reproduction in fish which derive almost entirely 98 from observations of wild individuals barneche et al 2018 investigating a fecundity to body mass scaling naturally results from the comparison of different sized individuals but what is driving this variability why are large individuals larger multiple biological explanations are possible first in nature there is no reason to believe that all animals encounter the same environmental conditions over their life history this is particularly true for species with wide geographical and habitat ranges riede 2004 wheeler 1975 including the atlantic cod and european sea bass comparing the weight and reproductive output of wild harvested individuals of such species necessarily involves confounding effects related to environmental history these effects are amplified when investigating the variability in weight without evaluating the age since large animals are more likely to have encountered better environments compared to small individuals of the same age second whether it is the consequence of predation of sudden environmental challenges or of human activities selective pressures in the wild are particularly numerous and diversified these multiple sources of selection are considered as the primary mechanisms of polymorphism in nature orr and smith 1998 metabolic capacities driving growth maturation reproduction and ultimately fitness are central phenotypic targets of selective pressures pettersen et al 2018 within a given population one can expect genetically based variability in metabolic capacities resulting in intrinsic individual differences in assimilation and growth capacity besson et al 2019 thus the life history patterns obtained from wild harvested individuals may also reflect the action of selection the environmental and genetic variation inherent in samples from wild populations means that one should be cautious in attributing a pattern of reproductive hyperallometry to metabolic mechanisms involved at the individual level rather than using such an empirical observation to dismiss existing models of individual growth and metabolism one can instead ask under what environmental and genetic circumstances the model would produce the empirical pattern in question this then leads to clear and testable predictions about what might be occurring in nature in parallel detailed laboratory experiments are critical to control and evaluate selective pressures and environmental variabilities and thereby evaluate theoretical expectations a common point of contention and misunderstanding in modelling growth centers around the distinction between phenomenological and mechanistic models white and marshall 2019 a phenomenological model provides a quantitative description of a process using a simple function thought to capture the essence of an underlying process often these are allometric functions in the case of growth models in contrast mechanistic models are derived through the explicit representation of processes occurring at a lower level to the phenomenon in question in growth models these processes are the chemical transformations from food to biomass which are modelled on the basis of physicochemical principles including energy and mass conservation successful mechanistic models can predict dynamics under complex sequences of environmental conditions with the same variables and parameters something phenomenological models cannot do without adding parameters or changing their functional form in this sense mechanistic modeling can help reconstruct environmental history when they are inverted to fit growth data from the wild lavaud et al 2019 pecquerie et al 2009 in this paper we explore the potential for reproductive hyperallometry under the framework of dynamic energy budget deb theory a general mechanistic metabolic theory that captures the environmental food temperature and internal chemical transformations and allocations constraints on development growth and reproduction from first principles kooijman 2010 1986 in particular we consider three working hypotheses fig 1 and illustrate them using the european sea bass dicentrarchus labrax a species shown to exhibit hyperallometric reproduction in the wild mayer et al 1990 1 the ontogenetic hypothesis that hyperallometric reproduction can emerge for an individual simulated under deb theory across its ontogeny 2 the environmental variation hypothesis that hyperallometric reproduction can be produced by realistic variation in feeding rate and temperature environments among individuals with the same metabolic capacities 3 the metabolic capacities variation hypothesis that inter individual variation in deb parameter values can lead to hyperallometric reproduction finally we provide empirical data on the allometric scaling of reproduction under controlled environmental conditions and limited selection pressure we discuss our results in the light of deb predictions under such environmental conditions since the deb model is generic between fish species only parameters vary the results of our study are transposable to most other fish species 2 method 2 1 the deb model for d labrax the deb parameters for d labrax used in our simulations are available online lika et al 2018 and are provided in supplementary tables 1 2 and 3 they were inversely estimated from observations on development times at multiple temperatures lengths and weights at birth hatch metamorphosis maturation and ultimate size as well as growth curves in length and weight reproduction and feeding rate vs weight and ammonia production vs temperature stavrakidis zachou et al 2019 the one to many relationship between parameter values and expected observations in the estimation procedure together with the requirement for physically permissible parameter values e g not violating mass or energy conservation strongly constrains the possible parameter values the standard deb model considers the organism to be made up of two macrochemical pools of fixed stoichiometry the reserve e and structure v which together with the maturity state e h and the reproduction buffer e r comprise the state variables of the model as depicted by the 4 compartments in fig 2 kooijman 2010 the theory assumes that an organism transforms food into a reserve compartment at a daily rate ṗa supplementary table 4 proportional to its structural surface v 2 3 the scaled functional response f and the deb parameter p am the f value is expressed as a fraction of the maximum possible feeding rate and therefore takes values between 0 starvation and 1 feeding ad libitum energy is then mobilized from the reserve compartment at a rate ṗc under 1st order dynamics fig 2 supplementary table 4 a fraction κ of this energy contributes to growth ṗg after having paid for the maintenance of the structure ṗs proportional to structural volume v while 1 κ goes to maturation ṗr and its associated maintenance ṗj the standard deb model assumes that κ remains constant throughout the life cycle of the animal consistent with the close fit of the pütter von bertalanffy growth model to empirical data kooijman 2010 maturity is achieved when total energy invested in maturation reaches e h p supplementary table 1 then ṗr becomes the amount of energy invested daily in reproduction fig 2 the model uses nine parameters supplementary table 1 to calculate these six energy fluxes ṗa ṗc ṗs ṗj ṗg and ṗr following the standard deb model kooijman 2010 in addition five parameters supplementary table 2 are used for the calculation of the thermal correction coefficient supplementary table 4 which modulates energy fluxes by temperature the deb model for d labrax assumes a metabolic acceleration between hatching and a transition phase called metamorphosis kooijman 2014 this acceleration common in fish species kooijman et al 2011 consists of a period where growth is not isometric but instead growth in structural surface is proportional to the growth of structural volume v supplementary table 4 acceleration ends when the amount of energy invested in maturation reaches e h j supplementary table 1 at a given time an organism is described by its stored reserves e structural volume v maturity eh and reproductive buffer er the dynamics of e l eh and er and the associated metabolic processes are presented in the supplementary table 4 we estimated the wet weight as the sum of stored reserves and total soma assuming a water content of 80 supplementary table 4 in contrast to kearney 2019 we excluded reproduction buffer from the weight calculation instead modeling the weight of a female post spawning no reproduction buffer handling rule was used since the total reproductive buffer was not affecting the total weight nor the daily investment in reproduction in our simulations 2 2 simulations based on our three hypotheses the deb model was run for d labrax at a body temperature of 19 c and a feeding rate set at 70 of the satiety while keeping all parameters equal across all simulations only one forcing variable temperature or feeding rate or one target deb parameter see below was modified according to the hypothesis being explored fig 1 to test the ontogenetic hypothesis reproductive output and weight over several ages post maturity were compared for the average d labrax living at 19 c and a 70 feeding rate to assess the environmental variation hypothesis weight and reproductive output of the animals were compared at 2000 days post fertilization dpf and we tested the effects of differences in whole life cycle body temperature from 15 to 23 c in 2 c intervals with a 70 feeding rate differences in feeding rate ranging from 60 to 80 of maximum feeding rate and body temperature at 19 c similarly the metabolic capacities variation hypothesis was tested on simulations performed at 19 c and 70 feeding rate and data were compared at 2000 dpf for individuals varying in one deb parameter at a time the effects of a variation from 10 to 10 around the average value available for d labrax lika et al 2018 was evaluated we tested all parameters of supplementary table 1 leading to a significant change in weight and reproductive investment at a given age and therefore focused on the following parameters the surface area specific maximum assimilation rate ṗ am in j d cm2 driving the maximum amount of energy the animal can assimilate per unit of structural surface when food is ad libitum the allocation fraction to soma κ specifying the fraction of energy mobilized from the reserve compartment allocated to the production and maintenance of structure the specific cost for structure e g j cm3 which represents the cost biomass and overhead to the animal of transforming the energy allocated towards growth ṗg in structure the somatic maintenance cost ṗ m j cm3 d corresponding to energy requirements to maintain a unit of structure the maturity at birth e h b the amount of energy invested in maturation needed to start feeding considered as birth the maturity at metamorphosis e h j the amount of energy invested in maturation needed to finish the acceleration phase 2 3 testing hypo iso or hyperallometry hyperallometry was tested by comparing deb model outputs for wet weight and daily investment in reproduction on log10 transformed axes a linear model was fitted to the simulated data and the hypothesis of hyperallometry was accepted if the model slope was higher than one fig 1 a scaling with a slope of one is considered isometric while a slope below one is called hypoallometric barneche et al 2018 2 4 empirical test of reproductive scaling an empirical test of hyperallometric reproduction was based on weight and total reproductive volume data available for d labrax from the research center in palavas ifremer in this research center animals were reared in identical environmental conditions at densities below 30kg m3 and selective pressure during the rearing was lowered as much as possible to maximize survival tanks were supplied with seawater at a temperature ranging from 13 to 25 c with an average of 18 01 c between years 2012 and 2019 oxygen concentration was maintained between 90 and 120 saturation via oxygen supplementation fish were reared under natural light and fed on demand with a commercial diet using a self feeder with a limit of 1 of the total biomass per day five days per week during the breeding season starting in january females weighing 3 3kg 1 5 s d at a near spawning stage were hormonally injected and the total volume spawn was measured the daily investment in reproduction was estimated over time using the deb model with a feeding rate of 71 4 corresponding to a feeding frequency of 5 days per week and a temperature of 18 c and compared against the weights measured in the empirical test 3 results fig 3 summarizes the outcomes of deb simulations leading to hypo iso or hyper allometric reproduction as a result of our three working hypotheses 3 1 ontogenetic hypothesis the deb model parameters for european sea bass generated a close to isometric scaling of reproduction under a constant environment from sexual maturity to 10000 days post fertilization dpf fig 3a this suggests that investment in reproduction relative to body mass is constant overtime thus the daily reproductive investment per body mass of the biggest female of the simulation 10000 dpf 2151g was comparable to that of the smallest 1200 dpf 659g with 7 87 and 7 5 j g wet weight respectively nevertheless between these two extreme points the scaling was not linear and the pattern observed in reproductive scaling depended on whether younger or older classes of fish were studied i e it varied with ontogeny if only younger fish less than 2000 dpf and 1324g were used for the relationship the scaling became hyperallometric red line in fig 3a on the contrary when the scaling was investigated for older individuals hyperallometry was lost and the relationship even became hypoallometric blue line in fig 3a 3 2 environmental variation hypothesis within the temperature range investigated here 15 23 c increasing temperature led to heavier fish at a same age purely due to the rate effects of temperature on growth fig 3b these fish also invested more in reproduction and this effect increased disproportionately with body mass an exponent of almost 2 1 97 was found for this thermal range this translates to an investment in reproduction relative to body mass two times 5 33 vs 11 65 j g wet weight greater for the biggest fish of the simulation compared to the smallest 806 vs 1778g growth and reproduction were also strongly positively influenced by the feeding rate fig 3b between individual variability in feeding rate over the range considered 60 80 also led to an apparent hyperallometry in the relationship for d labrax with an exponent of 1 34 fig 3b the females having assimilated more energy during their life history were heavier but they also invested more in reproduction than small females relative to their body mass 3 3 metabolic capacities variation hypothesis in deb theory variability in metabolic capacities among individuals translates to variability in deb parameters allowing deb parameters to vary individually around their estimated values lika et al 2018 can lead to apparent hypo iso or hyper metric reproduction fig 3c this was observed when comparing individuals of the same age here 2000 dpf with an identical environmental life history but varying some of their intrinsic metabolic capacities fig 3c a variability ranging from 10 to 10 in the relative allocation to reproduction κ can show strong hypoallometry fig 3c with an increase of κ weight rose but less energy was invested in reproduction individuals with higher κ allocated more energy towards structure and therefore grew faster fig 2 in parallel a lower fraction 1 κ of the energy was available for reproduction leading to shortened daily investment in reproduction females with lower eg became larger at a same age but they invested the same amount of energy in reproduction proportionally to their body mass leading to isometric scaling indeed a change in eg affects only the final transformation of energy to volume of the structure on the contrary a change in ṗ am resulted in hyperallometric relationship fig 3c in accordance with changes in feeding rate both involved proportionally in the same deb equation see calculation of the assimilation rate ṗa in supplementary table 4 a change in maturity thresholds e h b and e h j also resulted in hyperallometric reproduction supplementary fig 1 the decrease of e h b or the increase of e h j led to increased weight and energy invested in reproduction for d labrax of the same age the increase was nevertheless disproportionate with large individuals investing more than small individuals relative to body mass 3 4 empirical scaling in controlled conditions our laboratory data on reproductive scaling for weights ranging from 0 5 to 10 kg under constant food and temperature show that d labrax displayed a hypoallometric scaling of reproduction fig 4a the deb model for d labrax run using the ontogenetic hypothesis weight differences are the result of age differences on the same empirical weights predicted a similar hypoallometric reproduction fig 4b the exponents extracted from empirical and simulated scalings were comparable 0 843 vs 0 888 respectively 4 discussion collectively our results demonstrate that multiple biological explanations integrated in deb simulations can lead to the hyperallometric reproduction previously observed for a wide range of fish species in the wild barneche et al 2018 deb models have been used to capture the life cycle of more than 2000 animal species across all major phyla our results are therefore likely applicable to many other species kooijman et al 2020 we thus show that it is premature to conclude that patterns of hyperallometric reproduction

hyperallometric pattern seen in wild fish this striking contrast probably derives from the differences between wild and laboratory conditions wild caught animals are necessarily more varied in their environmental life histories or intrinsic metabolic capacities than their counterpart laboratory reared animals consequently laboratory conditions permit more powerful tests of ontogenetic scaling relationships because temperature food availability and water quality can be controlled in addition selective pressure is relaxed reducing the selection based on growth maturation or reproduction for all animals of the population it is surprising that so few laboratory data are available on the scaling of fish reproduction yet laboratory settings may also impose confounding factors for instance spawning in our laboratory study was induced by hormonal injection ako et al 1994 emata 2003 and we do not know whether this could influence the allometric pattern however assuming a concentration of 905 eggs per ml chatain 1994 our empirical data fall mean 150 118 58 800 eggs kg in the range of non induced spawning in european sea bass cerdá et al 1995 our deb simulations run using the empirical environmental conditions under the ontogenetic hypothesis where the weight of individuals was only differing according to age were very good at predicting the empiric hypoallometric scaling observed this hypoallometric reproduction was also observed in fig 3a on the heaviest and oldest animals with a weight starting at 1324g the females from the ifremer research station of palavas used for the scaling were much heavier mean above 3000g leading to an even more hypoallometric scaling than in fig 4a our results therefore suggest that the generalized hyperallometric reproduction observed in the

hyperallometry when they modify the energy allocation towards reproduction and growth although little information is available on variability in deb parameters between individuals of a same species a

distribution with a standard deviation above 0 15 koch and de schamphelaere 2020 the 10 of variability in deb parameters that we tested therefore fall within this empirical range while only one parameter was modified at a time in this study we can expect individuals to differ from one another for multiple parameters of the deb model however we show here using a simplified scenario that hyperallometry can also be the consequence of differences in metabolic capacities between individuals harvested in the wild further work is needed to quantify the genetic basis and heritability of this variability and therefore the evolutionary potential within a species similarly to our empirical data several previous studies have also observed iso to hypoallometric reproduction for other
