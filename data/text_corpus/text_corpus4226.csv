21130,structural damage identification is the core problem of structural health monitoring shm the traditional damage detection methods are restricted in the practical applications due to factors including the complete measured data and modal information required before and after damaged states strain damage indexes have attracted wide attention due to their high sensitivity to local damage this paper proposes a damage identification method based on the inverse finite element method ifem moreover only by the limited strain sensor values the strain field and the complete modal data are both obtained it greatly improves the practicality of directly using the strain data for damage identification the damage index is established only by the strain modal data after damage to localize damage in order to further verify the effectiveness of the ifem the proposed method is numerically demonstrated by a cantilever plate subjected to single damage and multi damage conditions the results show that the ifem can accurately reconstruct the deformation and the direct damage index strain mode difference based on the ifem can realize damage detection and provide a new research approach for shm keywords damage identification ifem reconstruct deformation direct damage index shm 1 introduction in the past few years structural health monitoring shm has attracted increasing attention in engineering and academia fields as the core problem of shm structural damage identification has been widely applied in many fields such as aerospace and civil engineering it is generally known that structural damage will lead to changes in modal parameters with the damage accumulation it will have a serious impact on structural safety and reliability and even cause major accidents over the past years damage identification methods based on the modal parameters mode shapes modal curvature and frequencies etc have been widely proposed by researchers ahmad et al 2019 koushik 2017 li et al 2019 navabian et al 2016 it is noteworthy that damage indexes established by stain mode have received increasing attention due to the high sensitivity to structural local damage than displacement mode cui et al 2019 however there is a problem of number limitation of measuring sensors by the traditional damage identification methods moreover it is difficult to be widely used in practical applications because it is difficult to obtain complete modal information before damage gu et al 2011 therefore to ensure the calculation accuracy it is necessary to arrange as many measuring points as possible but it seriously reduces the economic benefits in addition some damage indexes have higher requirements for modal testing in the actual projects in recent years further investigations demonstrate that the unique advantages of the inverse finite element method ifem for structural deformation monitoring provide an effective solution tessler and spangler 2004 the ifem originally developed by tessler and spangler 2003 for plate and shell structures has shown the superior performance in the large and complex structural health monitoring limited to the measuring points etc the proposed ifem is based on the least squares of the measured strain and the theoretical strain once the location of the strain measurement point is selected the displacement results are only related to the strain measurement information moreover there is no need to know the structural material properties and load conditions kefal and oterkus 2015 2016 proposed a four node inverse shell element iqs4 which improved the three node inverse shell element imin3 of the ifem applied for structural shape monitoring gherlone et al 2012 2014 extended the method to truss beam and frame structures and gave simulation and experimental results kefal et al 2020 compared the performance of flat and curved inverse shell elements i e imin3 iqs4 and ics8 for the ifem in terms of shape strain and stress monitoring and damage detection and the results showed that iqs4 had better shape and stress sensing than imin3 esposito and gherlone 2020 performed a comparative study of the modal method ko s displacement theory and ifem for the shape sensing of a composite wing box cerracchio et al 2015 improved the original ifem formulation by the kinematic assumptions of the refined zigzag theory this method is applied for the displacement monitoring of multi layer composite materials and sandwich structures tessler et al 2018 improved the ifem using an incremental procedure for real time monitoring of structures with large displacements xu et al 2020 proposed an algorithm by the ifem to improve the accuracy of reconstruction displacement above reviews mainly focuses on structural shape and stress monitoring abdollahzadeh et al 2020 cerracchio et al 2013 gherlone et al 2018 kefal et al 2017 li and kefal 2019 it is seemed that very few applications of the ifem to structural damage identification quach et al 2005 proposed a detection algorithm based on the ifem for potential structural anomalies yang et al 2017 proposed a damage method using strain mode differences based on the imin3 by the ifem colombo et al 2019 proposed a structural abnormality identification method based on the ifem and established an anomaly index by comparing the difference between reconstructed strain values by ifem and test strain values li et al 2020 proposed a new damage parameter and von mises strain based on the ifem for damage localization of thin walled cylindrical structure under different dent damaged conditions if the strain fields are obtained by limited number of measuring points the damage identification method can use directly the strain fields result gomes et al 2020 proposed a damage identification method based on strain fields in cfrp laminated plates zhang et al 2020 used the strain response reconstruction and statistical theory to propose a two step damage identification method without the response of healthy structure at present researchers have made a lot of significant theoretical research results in the fields of structural damage diagnosis damage identification but practical damage diagnosis methods are the rarity in actual engineering for one thing it often considers the modal data under both the healthy and damaged conditions for damage identification for another the main reason is the complexity of actual engineering structure itself and environment conditions as a consequence various unpredictable factors limit the theoretically feasible method in practical applications in order to solve the shortcomings of traditional damage indexes this paper proposes a damage identification study based on the ifem the unique advantages of the ifem can solve these problems the proposed method is independent from the materials and loading conditions the full modal information obtained by the ifem only needs the limited numbers of measuring points moreover only the modal data after damaged states are required the paper is organized as follows section 1 briefly introduces the present research situation of damage identification and the ifem the algorithm review of ifem and strain mode difference is provided in section 2 section 3 mainly investigates the deformation reconstruction and damage simulation to verify the efficiency of the proposed method finally section 4 mainly discusses the obtained results in detail 2 algorithm review 2 1 inverse finite element method formulation kefal et al 2016 developed a four node inverse quadrilateral shell iqs4 element and adopted to demonstrate the ifem formulation each node of the iqs4 element has six degrees of freedom dof in the local coordinates system x y z as shown in fig 1 because of the inclusion of drilling rotations θ zi the iqs4 element has less tendency toward shear locking as shown it is assumed that the iqs4 element has a thickness 2h and that z h h defines the thickness coordinate system where u i v i are the positive x y translations respectively θ xi θ yi are positive clockwise rotations around the x y axes respectively the x y coordinate in the reference plane of the iqs4 element is defined as a function of the bilinear shape function n i s t with s t 1 1 and the explicit forms are summarized in appendix a the element local nodal coordinates x i y i i 1 2 3 4 where s t is the isoparametric dimensionless coordinate as shown in fig 2 the mapping functions can be expressed by eq 1 1 x s t x i 1 4 n i x i y s t y i 1 4 n i y i the u and v membrane displacements are defined by 2 u x y u i 1 4 n i u i i 1 4 l i θ z i v x y v i 1 4 n i v i i 1 4 m i θ z i where l i m i are the shape functions that defined the relationship between drilling rotation dof and the membrane displacements and the explicit forms are shown in appendix a the transverse displacement w and the bending rotations θ x θ y are defined by the positive z translation w i and positive counter clockwise rotations θ xi θ yi 3 w x y w i 1 4 n i w i i 1 4 l i θ x i i 1 4 m i θ y i θ x x y θ x i 1 4 n i θ x i θ y x y θ y i 1 4 n i θ y i as shown in eqs 2 and 3 the components of the displacement vector of any point of the element can be expressed as 4 u x x y z u x u z θ y u y x y z u y v z θ x u z x y z u z w where u x u y are the in plane displacements u z is the transverse displacement across the uniform shell thickness according to the linear strain displacement relations of a linear elastic constitutive theory the other strain components are expressed as kefal et al 2016 5 ε x x u x x u x z θ y x ε y y u y y v y z θ x y γ x y u y x u x y v x u y z θ y y θ x x γ x z u z x u x z w x θ y γ y z u z y u y z w y θ x the kinematic relations of the iqs4 element are established based on the assumptions of the first order shear deformation theory the shape functions or interpolation functions explicitly given by kefal et al 2016 are used to describe membrane bending and transverse shear deformations of the iqs4 element the strain displacement relations are expressed as 6 ε x x ε y y γ x y e u e z k u e b e u e z b k u e 7 γ x z γ y z g u e b g u e 8 u e u 1 e u 2 e u 3 e u 4 e t 9 u i e u i v i w i θ x i θ y i θ z i t i 1 2 3 4 where u e is the element nodal displacement vector the matrices b e b k b g contain derivatives of the shape functions concerning the element membrane bending and shear response respectively which the explicit forms are summarized in appendix a kefal et al 2016 to calculate membrane and bending section strains experimentally considering measured surface strains at n discrete locations the stain rosettes should be located on the top and bottom surfaces of the element as shown in fig 3 in fig 3 the membrane and bending section strain at h distance from the middle of element are written in eq 10 where the superscript and denote the strain measurements on the top and bottom surfaces respectively 10 e i ε 1 2 ε x x ε x x ε y y ε y y γ x y γ x y i k i ε 1 2 h ε x x ε x x ε y y ε y y γ x y γ x y i the core formulas of the ifem are derived from the extreme value of the least squares functional it minimizes the error square sum between theoretical strain and measured strain by the least squares method the function can be written by minimizing the weighted least squares functional as follows 11 φ e λ u ω e e u e ε 2 ω k k u k ε 2 ω g g u g ε 2 12 e u e ε 2 1 n a e i 1 n e u e i e i ε d x d y 13 k u k ε 2 2 h 2 n a e i 1 n k u e i k i ε 2 d x d y 14 g u g ε 2 1 n a e i 1 n g u e i g i ε 2 d x d y 1 n a e i 1 n g u e i 2 d x d y where ωe ωk ωg are the positive weighting values respectively if every section strain element has a measured value ωe ωk ωg 1 if these strain less elements ωe ωk ωg 10 4 the unknown variable of the minimum error functional is the element node displacement in eq 11 according to the variational principle the condition for the minimum value of the function 15 φ e λ u e 2 k e u e f e 0 16 k e a e ω e b e t b e ω k 2 h 2 b k t b k ω g b g t b g d x d y 17 f e 1 n a e i 1 n ω e b e t e i ε ω k 2 h 2 b k t k i ε ω g b g t g i ε d x d y 18 ku f because the contribution of g i ε is much smaller than e i ε and k i ε it can be neglected in the calculation considering the conversion of displacement freedom from the local coordinate system to the overall coordinate system the standard finite element integration operation is performed and the element matrix of discrete structure is assembled into the linear equation system synthesizing the above formulas the structural global solution is shown in eq 18 2 2 strain mode difference damage index strain is the first derivative of displacement and strain mode is the inherent strain distribution state corresponding to each displacement mode generally the smoothed strain modal curve has an extreme value at the structural damaged position as one of the most common numerical methods for derivation the difference method has strong versatility in eq 19 ψ r ε is set as the r order strain modal function and it only changes with the coordinates it can be expanded into taylor series at the adjacent node i i 2 3 n 1 19 ψ r ε x ψ r ε x i d ψ r ε d x i x x i 1 2 d 2 ψ r ε d x 2 i x x i 2 1 3 d 3 ψ r ε d x 3 i x x i 3 where x i is the coordinate value of the node i x i i 1 h then x i 1 x i h assuming h is sufficiently small and excluding the terms of the third power and higher powers the equal difference basic difference scheme is established 20 d ψ r ε d x i ψ r ε x i 1 ψ r ε x i 1 2 h the variation degree of the curve is usually reflected by the derivative but there are differences and no comparability in the magnitude of the strain modal curves with all orders derivatives before being normalized besides there are some problems with the illusion of mutation caused by calculation errors etc for the damaged structure the damage location has a sudden change in the derivative zero value shown in fig 4 and the size of sudden change zone is the damage affected zone therefore as long as the mutation zero value is obtained the damage can be located the mathematical model of damage location index gu et al 2011 based on effective extreme point definition is as follows 21 i d j l y j 2 y j 1 x j 2 x j 1 max y 0 y 1 y 2 y q where i d j is the damage location index value of the j th effective zero points of the difference curve of a certain order strain model l is the overall span x j1 x j2 y j1 y j2 are the adjacent points of effective extreme point and corresponding extreme values respectively y 0 y 1 y 2 y q are the extreme values of effective extreme points q is the q th effective extreme point the index has definite position coordinates and the larger the value i d j the greater the possibility of damage combined with the change law of the difference curve the damage position can be determined 3 numerical results 3 1 deformation reconstruction a schematic of the proposed damage identification methodology has been provided in fig 5 to demonstrate the validity of ifem for damage identification a cantilever plate model fig 6 is considered for damage simulation calculation the size is 0 65m 0 3m 0 025m the material elastic modulus e 206 gpa poisson s ratio ν 0 33 and the concentrated force 98n is applied at the right end 5cm and the upper edge 10cm it is worth noting that the strain data required by ifem in the paper are obtained from fem simulation the fe model is established by shell181 and the boundary condition is fixed constraint approach to the left boundary to extract the strain data the fe model is divided into high fidelity meshing including 1248 uniformly distributed elements 7950 dofs and the loading position as shown in fig 7 the meshing of the inverse finite element model consists of 70 nodes and 52 measuring points as shown in fig 8 generally the layout and the number of measuring points have a certain impact on the structural deformation reconstruction in this paper based on the strain data obtained from 52 measured points the ifem is used to reconstruct structural deformation field furthermore the obtained complete modal information provides data information for subsequent damage calculation section 3 2 it should be noted that the strain input data of the discrete measured points are all from the fe model fig 7 in the inverse finite element model fig 8 the red dot is marked as the measuring point position placed at the centroid of the element table 1 shows the deformation results of nodes based on direct fem and ifem to clearly display the comparison of reconstruction results in appendix a as can be seen from fig 9 based on the ifem the inverse element iqs4 can be used for deformation reconstruction of the cantilever plate model the numerical results are not much different and the overall average error is 1 15 the reconstruction error of each node is less than 1 due to the influence of the measuring point layout parts of the deformation information of some nodes are not fully obtained leading to a bit larger errors in the partial reconstruction results the node reconstruction error increases at the position near the left end while it has little effect on the final deformation reconstruction result 3 2 damage simulation in section 3 1 the deformation reconstruction results are obtained to verify the effectiveness of the ifem applied to the structural deformation monitoring moreover the proposed damage identification method is studied by the ifem in this section including the stress field reconstructed and strain mode differences table 2 displays the random damaged conditions considered in the following study including single damage and multi damage conditions 3 2 1 stress contour plots reconstruction to further verify the effectiveness of structural deformation reconstruction based on the ifem this section will carry out reconstruction inversion of the stress field compared with the fem results and only the partial damaged conditions of table 2 are considered to show the damage identification results based on the ifem the explicit equations are given as follows 22 σ b σ x x σ y y σ x y d b ε b d b b e u e d b b k u e 23 d b e 1 ν 2 1 ν 0 ν 1 0 0 0 1 ν 2 where e ν are elastic modulus and poisson s ratio respectively σ x x σ y y and σ x y are the x direction stress y direction stress and xy direction stress in the section only the x y and xy directions stress fields reconstructed are considered under different damaged conditions in the following study the x direction stress results of partial elements under the damaged conditions of element 598 and element 950 are listed in tables 3 and 4 tables 7 and 8 display the y direction stress results of partial elements in appendix b in figs 10 13 the stress contour plots by fem and ifem are presented respectively according to the stress strain relationship the above figures show that the reconstruction of stress fields under different damaged conditions are established based on the displacement field reconstruction by the ifem moreover the reconstruction data are basically consistent with the fe results this section only selects the stress results of elements through the x axis at the damage location for analysis in table 3 it can be seen that the values of the stress results extracted according to fem and ifem are not much different and the percentage errors are basically within 5 in section 3 1 the structural deformation reconstruction is constructed based on the ifem with a relatively high accuracy in this section on the basis of section 3 1 the ifem is used to reconstruct the stress field tables 3 and 4 show that the x direction stress fields reconstructed based on the ifem are basically consistent with the stress nephograms obtained by the fem simulation and the errors are within 5 moreover there is no significant difference between the percentage errors of different elements under damaged state in summary combined with the displacement strain stress relationship the stress field can be quickly reconstructed based on the ifem and the result errors are relatively small comparing figs 12 and 13 it shows that because of quite a small difference between the two damaged conditions there is no significant difference between the changes of stress field values of them to easily distinguish different damaged conditions different damage location identifiers are marked it is worth noting that the damage situation cannot be accurately judged only based on the stress changes before and after damage since the damage calculations of element 950 are performed the stress fields are further reconstructed based on the displacement field reconstructed according to the ifem moreover the stress contour plots based on the fe simulations are basically identical with the stress fields reconstructed by the ifem and the errors are within 5 therefore the stress fields can be well inversely reconstructed in conclusion the effectiveness of the ifem is validated by the stress field reconstruction due to the small damage regions of damaged conditions the stress field values have relatively minor changes under different damaged conditions 3 2 2 strain mode differences index as described in section 3 1 since the ifem obtains a good reconstruction of the displacement fields with a small amount of discrete strain data this section demonstrates the availability of damage calculation based on the strain mode difference index by the ifem under different damaged conditions as shown in the following figures the contour plots of the strain mode difference of elements under different damaged conditions are given to analyze in detail fig 14 only displays the strain field contour plots of element 598 damage 10 with ifem the damage identification results for the damaged conditions are described in figs 15 25 generally only the modal data of the nodes can be obtained by the fe calculation however in order to improve the accuracy requirements of the strain mode difference index more node data are required a high fidelity fe model needs to be established simultaneously it will undoubtedly increase the computational load to a greater extent the strain fields are reconstructed with only a few measuring points by the ifem and then the strain differential damage index will be established moreover only the post damage modal data can be used to realize the damage location as the modal order increases the damage location effect is enhanced so the affected area of damage location is more concentrated however high order modal data are difficult to obtain accurately in practical engineering the following studies of this paper only consider the 1st order and 3rd order modal data because of the influence of the constraint conditions at the left end of cantilever plate on the modal data the constraint form can be adjusted appropriately in the subsequent research it can be seen from fig 15 that the strain mode differential damage index can effectively identify the damage location shown in the marked position in the figures as the damage degree increases the damage affected areas near the location of the damaged element are deepened to a certain extent when the damage degree is small the modal data change caused by the damage is small therefore the areas affected by the damage are correspondingly small fig 15a if the damage degree is large the damage causes a large change in modal parameters meanwhile the damaged areas involved are large fig 15d therefore the damage can be qualitatively judged while locating damage using the strain mode difference due to the fixed constraints imposed on the left end it greatly affects the extraction of modal data so the strain difference curve also has a peak change here to present the recognition effect of the damage index this paper will provide the strain difference curve at the location of the intercepted damaged element it is noteworthy that the damaged positions can be judged based on fig 4 according to the implications of damage index the peak value of strain mode difference is the peak of the mode rather than the damaged position the strain differential damage index is established based on the strain field reconstructed by the ifem it can be seen that the damage can be accurately located and the damage degree can be qualitatively judged according to the sudden change amplitude of the damage curve as the damage degree increases the sudden change of the curve becomes more pronounced in figs 16 and 17 it can be seen that the damage can be located with sufficient precision according to the 1st and 3rd order strain differential curves based on the strain field reconstructed by the ifem the damaged conditions simulation of element 598 are provided in the above figures the strain mode difference curve exhibits an obvious abrupt change at the location of damaged element 598 moreover only according to the 1st order strain mode difference the damage location is identified efficiently although the damage degree is different the mutation trends are basically identical under the same damaged element so that the damage location can be accurately determined due to the fixed constraint approach to the left end it has a certain influence on the modal data so strain mode difference curves also show abrupt changes rather than damaged positions compared with the damaged conditions of element 598 the strain mode difference curves of element 950 figs 18 and 19 can also accurately locate the damage and identify the damage degree qualitatively due to the fixed constraint conditions there are some peak values in the 1st and 3rd order strain mode differential curves approach to the left end it is noteworthy that according to the definition of damage index the zero points with sudden changes are the damaged positions otherwise it is the modal peak point position so the strain mode difference curves of element 950 by the ifem display that the damage location presents an obvious abrupt peak meanwhile the larger damage degree the greater the abrupt amplitude of the curves accordingly the change trend of the difference curves corresponding to different damage degree are basically identical and the damage location can be judged accordingly in summary by comparing figs 16 19 the direct index method based on the ifem can effectively localize the damage and it does not cause a poor impact on damage identification under different damage locations in figs 18 and 19 it can be seen that there is a significant difference of strain mode difference value between 1st order and 3rd order the main reason for this phenomenon lies in the large difference of the strain value results between them shown in fig 14 based on the strain field information by the ifem fig 15 displays the strain mode difference contour plots of element 598 it shows that the direct index value at the damage location is the largest and it is quite different from the direct value of the undamaged element moreover the values increase with the increase of the damage degree to a certain extent the effective extreme point values at the undamaged element locations are smaller and the difference among them is not significance tables 5 and 6 show the direct index values under damaged conditions of elements 598 and 950 respectively it can be seen that the direct index values reach the maximum and the values of other effective extreme points are relatively small therefore the damage location can be determined by the direct index of strain mode difference aiming at demonstrating the validity of the method furthermore without loss of generality the strain mode difference curves of multi damage conditions table 2 will be studied as following similarly in fig 21 under the multi damage condition strain mode difference index by the ifem can still accurately identify the damage locations and the damage identification accuracy is relatively higher however different from the single damage conditions the damage degree is not be identified qualitatively based on the mutation amplitude of strain difference curve under the same damage condition for example element 533 damage 15 and element 927 damage 25 in this paper the above figures only intercept the strain difference curves of the damage locations as shown in fig 21 the 1st order strain difference curve of condition 1 only abruptly changes at the damaged location while the curves are flat at other undamaged elements moreover the intercepting 1st order strain difference curve of condition 2 only shows abrupt changes at the damage position and the curves at other positions are relatively flat it is noteworthy that the proposed method does not cause a poor impact on the damage identification it improves the inadequacy of traditional damage index method although the element is close to the boundary or at the modal node the direct index method based on the ifem can effectively and accurately identify single damage or multi damage the above figures show that two damaged elements of conditions 3 and 4 are at the same axis position and thus only the strain differential data of this axis are provided if the damage degree is smaller the damage position can still be accurately identified according to the strain mode difference curves for example element 426 damage 10 of condition 3 fig 24 by comparatively analyzing figs 24 and 25 the strain mode difference curves display that the damage locations can be accurately distinguished but it fails to quantify the specific damage degree for example the difference of the curve mutation magnitude is relatively small between the element 426 damage 10 in condition 3 and element 426 damage 30 in condition 4 it has to be noticed that the damage index proposed is defined as positions information between damaged and undamaged conditions therefore the damage degree cannot be identified quantitatively by the strain mode difference future research will explore the quantified damage degree on structural damage identification 4 conclusions in this paper the inverse finite element iqs4 is used to obtain the displacement field based on the ifem for structural deformation reconstruction furthermore the direct damage index is established by the strain field data to identify damage location under different damaged conditions it improves the deficiencies of traditional damage identification methods for example complete modal information data before damage is required and a relatively high accuracy is limited by the number of measurement points in actual engineering the validity of the proposed method is confirmed based on the obtained results a cantilever plate is numerically demonstrated by a small amount of strain data under single damage and multi damage conditions meanwhile structural deformation field is reconstructed with sufficient precision by the ifem including the displacement field and stress field the results are not different from the fe results and most of errors are within 5 a significant sensitivity is noticed according to the 1st order strain mode difference based on the ifem moreover the damaged locations can be accurately identified the effect of qualitative damage degree identification under single damage conditions is better than multi damage conditions because the damage index is defined as the difference between the damaged positions information the damage degree is not identified quantitatively emphasis is placed on the damage identification method by the ifem while the influences of the measuring points arrangement and noise addition on the accuracy of the results are not considered in the paper further research will be carried out in detail in the subsequent work credit authorship contribution statement mengying li methodology numeral calculations

conditions if the strain fields are obtained by limited number of measuring points the damage identification method can use directly the strain fields result gomes et al 2020 proposed a damage identification method based on strain fields in cfrp laminated plates zhang et al 2020 used the strain response reconstruction and statistical theory to propose a two step damage identification method without the response of healthy structure at present researchers have made a lot of significant theoretical research results in the fields of structural damage diagnosis damage identification but practical damage diagnosis methods are the rarity in actual engineering for one thing it often considers the modal data under both the healthy and damaged conditions for damage identification for another the main reason is the complexity of actual engineering structure itself and environment conditions as a consequence various unpredictable factors limit the theoretically feasible method in practical applications in order to solve the shortcomings of traditional damage indexes this paper proposes a damage identification study based on the ifem the unique advantages of the ifem can solve these problems the proposed method is independent from the materials and loading conditions the full modal information obtained by the ifem only needs the limited numbers of measuring points moreover only the modal data after damaged states are required the paper is organized as follows section 1 briefly introduces the present research situation of damage identification and the ifem the algorithm review of ifem and strain mode difference is provided in section 2 section 3 mainly investigates the deformation reconstruction and damage simulation to verify the efficiency of the proposed method finally section 4 mainly discusses the obtained results in detail 2 algorithm review 2 1 inverse finite element method formulation kefal et al 2016 developed a four node inverse quadrilateral shell iqs4 element and adopted to demonstrate the ifem formulation each node of the iqs4 element has six degrees of freedom dof in the local coordinates system x y z as shown in fig 1 because of the inclusion of drilling rotations θ zi the iqs4 element has less tendency toward shear locking as shown it is assumed that the iqs4 element has a thickness 2h and that z h h defines the thickness coordinate system where u i v i are the positive x y translations respectively θ xi θ yi are positive clockwise rotations around the x y axes respectively the x y coordinate in the reference plane of the iqs4 element is defined as a function of the bilinear shape function n i s t with s t 1 1 and the explicit forms are summarized in appendix a the element local nodal coordinates x i y i i 1 2 3 4 where s t is the isoparametric dimensionless coordinate as shown in fig 2 the mapping functions can be expressed by eq 1 1 x s t x i 1 4 n i x i y s t y i 1 4 n i y i the u and v membrane displacements are defined by 2 u x y u i 1 4 n i u i i 1 4 l i θ z i v x y v i 1 4 n i v i i 1 4 m i θ z i where l i m i are the shape functions that defined the relationship between drilling rotation dof and the membrane displacements and the explicit forms are shown in appendix a the transverse displacement w and the bending rotations θ x θ y are defined by the positive z translation w i and positive counter clockwise rotations θ xi θ yi 3 w x y w i 1 4 n i w i i 1 4 l i θ x i i 1 4 m i θ y i θ x x y θ x i 1 4 n i θ x i θ y x y θ y i 1 4 n i θ y i as shown in eqs 2 and 3 the components of the displacement vector of any point of the element can be expressed as 4 u x x y z u x u z θ y u y x y z u y v z θ x u z x y z u z w where u x u y are the in plane displacements u z is the transverse displacement across the uniform shell thickness according to the linear strain displacement relations of a linear elastic constitutive theory the other strain components are expressed as kefal et al

established based on the assumptions of the first order shear deformation theory the shape functions or interpolation functions explicitly given by kefal et al 2016 are used to describe membrane bending and transverse shear deformations of the iqs4 element the strain displacement relations are expressed as 6 ε x x ε y y γ x y e u e z k u e b e u e z b k u e 7 γ x z γ y z g u e b g u e 8 u e u

concerning the element membrane bending and shear response respectively which the explicit forms are summarized in appendix a kefal et al 2016 to calculate membrane and bending section strains experimentally considering measured surface strains at n discrete locations the stain rosettes should be located on the top and bottom surfaces of the element as shown in fig 3 in fig 3 the membrane and bending section strain at h distance from the middle of element are written in eq 10 where the superscript and denote the strain measurements on the top and bottom surfaces respectively 10 e i ε 1 2 ε x x ε x x ε y y ε y y γ x y γ x y i k i ε 1 2 h ε x x ε x x ε y y ε y y γ x y γ x y i the core formulas of the ifem are derived from the extreme value of the least squares functional it minimizes the error square sum between theoretical strain and measured strain by the least squares method the function can be written by minimizing the weighted least squares functional as follows 11 φ e λ u ω

unknown variable of the minimum error functional is the element node displacement in eq 11 according to the variational principle the condition for the minimum value of the function 15 φ e λ u e 2 k e

ε is much smaller than e i ε and k i ε it can be neglected in the calculation considering the conversion of displacement freedom from the local coordinate system to the overall coordinate system the standard finite element integration operation is performed and the element matrix of discrete structure is assembled into the linear equation system synthesizing the above formulas the structural global solution is shown in eq 18 2 2 strain mode difference damage index strain is the first derivative of displacement and strain mode is the inherent strain distribution state corresponding to each displacement mode generally the smoothed strain modal curve has an extreme value at the structural damaged position as one of the most common numerical methods for derivation the difference method has strong versatility in eq 19 ψ r ε is set as the r order strain modal function and it only changes with the coordinates it can be expanded into taylor series at the adjacent node i i 2 3 n 1 19 ψ r ε x ψ r ε x i d ψ r ε d x i x x i 1 2 d 2 ψ r ε d x 2 i x x i 2 1 3 d 3 ψ r ε d x 3 i x x i 3 where x i is the coordinate value of the node i x i i 1 h then x i 1 x i h assuming h is sufficiently small and excluding the terms of the third power and higher powers the equal difference basic difference scheme is established 20 d ψ r ε d x i ψ r ε x i 1 ψ r ε x i 1 2 h the variation degree of the curve is usually reflected by the derivative but there are differences and no comparability in the magnitude of the strain modal curves with all orders derivatives before being normalized besides there are some problems with the illusion of mutation caused by calculation errors etc for the damaged structure the damage location has a sudden change in the derivative zero value shown in fig 4 and the size of sudden change zone is the damage affected zone therefore as long as the mutation zero value is obtained the damage can be located the mathematical model of damage location index gu et al 2011 based on effective extreme point definition is as follows 21 i d j l y j 2 y j 1 x j 2 x j 1 max y 0 y 1 y 2 y q where i d j is the damage location index value of the j th effective zero points of the difference curve of a certain order strain model l is the overall span x j1 x j2 y j1 y j2 are the adjacent points of effective extreme point and corresponding extreme values respectively y 0 y 1 y 2 y q are the extreme values of effective extreme points q is the q th effective extreme point the index has definite position coordinates and the larger the value i d j the greater the possibility of damage combined with the change law of the difference curve the damage position can be determined 3 numerical results 3 1 deformation reconstruction a schematic of the proposed damage identification methodology has been provided in fig 5 to demonstrate the validity of ifem for damage identification a cantilever plate model fig 6 is considered for damage simulation calculation the size is 0 65m 0 3m 0 025m the material elastic modulus e 206 gpa poisson s ratio ν 0 33 and the concentrated force 98n is applied at the right end 5cm and the upper edge 10cm it is worth noting that the strain data required by ifem in the paper are obtained from fem simulation the fe model is established by shell181 and the boundary condition is fixed constraint approach to the left boundary to extract the strain data the fe model is divided into high fidelity meshing including 1248 uniformly distributed elements 7950 dofs and the loading position as shown in fig 7 the meshing of the inverse finite element model consists of 70 nodes and 52 measuring points as shown in fig 8 generally the layout and the number of measuring points have a certain impact on the structural deformation reconstruction in this paper based on the strain data obtained from 52 measured points the ifem is used to reconstruct structural deformation field furthermore the obtained complete modal information provides data information for subsequent damage calculation section 3 2 it should be noted that the strain input data of the discrete measured points are all from the fe model fig 7 in the inverse finite element model fig 8 the red dot is marked as the measuring point position placed at the centroid of the element table 1 shows the deformation results of nodes based on direct fem and ifem to clearly display the comparison of reconstruction results in appendix a as can be seen from fig 9 based on the ifem the inverse element iqs4 can be used for deformation reconstruction of the cantilever plate model the numerical results are not much different and the overall average error is 1 15 the reconstruction error of each node is less than 1 due to the influence of the measuring point layout parts of the deformation information of some nodes are not fully obtained leading to a bit larger errors in the partial reconstruction results the node reconstruction error increases at the position near the left end while it has little effect on the final deformation reconstruction result 3 2 damage simulation in section 3 1 the deformation reconstruction results are obtained to verify the effectiveness of the ifem applied to the structural deformation monitoring moreover the proposed damage identification method is studied by the ifem in this section including the stress field reconstructed and strain mode differences table 2 displays the random damaged conditions considered in the following study including single damage and multi damage conditions 3 2 1 stress contour plots reconstruction to further verify the effectiveness of structural deformation reconstruction based on the ifem this section will carry out reconstruction inversion of the stress field compared with the fem results and only the partial damaged conditions of table 2 are considered to show the damage identification results based on the ifem the explicit equations are given as follows 22 σ b σ x x σ y y σ x y d b ε b d b b e u e d b b k u e 23 d b e 1 ν 2 1 ν 0 ν 1 0 0 0 1 ν 2 where e ν are elastic modulus and poisson s ratio respectively σ x x σ y y and σ x y are the x direction stress y direction stress and xy direction stress in the section only the x y and xy directions stress fields reconstructed are considered under different damaged conditions in the following study the x direction stress results of partial elements under the damaged conditions of element 598 and element 950 are listed in tables 3 and 4 tables 7 and 8 display the y direction stress results of partial elements in appendix b in figs 10 13 the stress contour plots by fem and ifem are presented respectively according to the stress strain relationship the above figures show that the reconstruction of stress fields under different damaged conditions are established based on the displacement field reconstruction by the ifem moreover the reconstruction data are basically consistent with the fe results this section only selects the stress results of elements through the x axis at the damage location for analysis in table 3 it can be seen that the values of the stress results extracted according to fem and ifem are not much different and the percentage errors are basically within 5 in section 3 1 the structural deformation reconstruction is constructed based on the ifem with a relatively high accuracy in this section on the basis of section 3 1 the ifem is used to reconstruct the stress field tables 3 and 4 show that the x direction stress fields reconstructed based on the ifem are basically consistent with the stress nephograms obtained by the fem simulation and the errors are within 5 moreover there is no significant difference between the percentage errors of different elements under damaged state in summary combined with the displacement strain stress relationship the stress field can be quickly reconstructed based on the ifem and the result errors are relatively small comparing figs 12 and 13 it shows that because of quite a small difference between the two damaged conditions there is no significant difference between the changes of stress field values of them to easily distinguish different damaged conditions different damage location identifiers are marked it is worth noting that the damage situation cannot be accurately judged only based on the stress changes before and after damage since the damage calculations of element 950 are performed the stress fields are further reconstructed based on the displacement field reconstructed according to the ifem moreover the stress contour plots based on the fe simulations are basically identical with the stress fields reconstructed by the ifem and the errors are within 5 therefore the stress fields can be well inversely reconstructed in conclusion the effectiveness of the ifem is validated by the stress field reconstruction due to the small damage regions of damaged conditions the stress field values have relatively minor changes under different damaged conditions 3 2 2 strain mode differences index as described in section 3 1 since the ifem obtains a good reconstruction of the displacement fields with a small amount of discrete strain data this section demonstrates the availability of damage calculation based on the strain mode difference index by the ifem under different damaged conditions as shown in the following figures the contour plots of the strain mode difference of elements under different damaged conditions are given to analyze in detail fig 14 only displays the strain field contour plots of element 598 damage 10 with ifem the damage identification results for the damaged conditions are described in figs 15 25 generally only the modal data of the nodes can be obtained by the fe calculation however in order to improve the accuracy requirements of the strain mode difference index more node data are required a high fidelity fe model needs to be established simultaneously it will undoubtedly increase the computational load to a greater extent the strain fields are reconstructed with only a few measuring points by the ifem and then the strain differential damage index will be established moreover only the post damage modal data can be used to realize the damage location as the modal order increases the damage location effect is enhanced so the affected area of damage location is more concentrated however high order modal data are difficult to obtain accurately in practical engineering the following studies of this paper only consider the 1st order and 3rd order modal data because of the influence of the constraint conditions at the left end of cantilever plate on the modal data the constraint form can be adjusted appropriately in the subsequent research it can be seen from fig 15 that the strain mode differential damage index can effectively identify the damage location shown in the marked position in the figures as the damage degree increases the damage affected areas near the location of the damaged element are deepened to a certain extent when the damage degree is small the modal data change caused by the damage is small therefore the areas affected by the damage are correspondingly small fig 15a if the damage degree is large the damage causes a large change in modal parameters meanwhile the damaged areas involved are large fig 15d therefore the damage can be qualitatively judged while locating damage using the strain mode difference due to the fixed constraints imposed on the left end it greatly affects the extraction of modal data so the strain difference curve also has a peak change here to present the recognition effect of the damage index this paper will provide the strain difference curve at the location of the intercepted damaged element it is noteworthy that the damaged positions can be judged based on fig 4 according to the implications of damage index the peak value of strain mode difference is the peak of the mode rather than the damaged position the strain differential damage index is established based on the strain field reconstructed by the ifem it can be seen that the damage can be accurately located and the damage degree can be qualitatively judged according to the sudden change amplitude of the damage curve as the damage degree increases the sudden change of the curve becomes more pronounced in figs 16 and 17 it can be seen that the damage can be located with sufficient precision according to the 1st and 3rd order strain differential curves based on the strain field reconstructed by the ifem the damaged conditions simulation of element 598 are provided in the above figures the strain mode difference curve exhibits an obvious abrupt change at the location of damaged element 598 moreover only according to the 1st order strain mode difference the damage location is identified efficiently although the damage degree is different the mutation trends are basically identical under the same damaged element so that the damage location can be accurately determined due to the fixed constraint approach to the left end it has a certain influence on the modal data so strain mode difference curves also show abrupt changes rather than damaged positions compared with the damaged conditions of element 598 the strain mode difference curves of element 950 figs 18 and 19 can also accurately locate the damage and identify the damage degree qualitatively due to the fixed constraint conditions there are some peak values in the 1st and 3rd order strain mode differential curves approach to the left end it is noteworthy that according to the definition of damage index the zero points with sudden changes are the damaged positions otherwise it is the modal peak point position so the strain mode difference curves of element 950 by the ifem display that the damage location presents an obvious abrupt peak meanwhile the larger damage degree the greater the abrupt amplitude of the curves accordingly the change trend of the difference curves corresponding to different damage degree are basically identical and the damage location can be judged accordingly in summary by comparing figs 16 19 the direct index method based on the ifem can effectively localize the damage and it does not cause a poor impact on damage identification under different damage locations in figs 18 and 19 it can be seen that there is a significant difference of strain mode difference value between 1st order and 3rd order the main reason for this phenomenon lies in the large difference of the strain value results between them shown in fig 14 based on the strain field information by the ifem fig 15 displays the strain mode difference contour plots of element 598 it shows that the direct index value at the damage location is the largest and it is quite different from the direct value of the undamaged element moreover the values increase with the increase of the damage degree to a certain extent the effective extreme point values at the undamaged element locations are smaller and the difference among them is not significance tables 5 and 6 show the direct index values under damaged conditions of elements 598 and 950 respectively it can be seen that the direct index values reach the maximum and the values of other effective extreme points are relatively small therefore the damage location can be determined by the direct index of strain mode difference aiming at demonstrating the validity of the method furthermore without loss of generality the strain mode difference curves of multi damage conditions table 2 will be studied as following similarly in fig 21 under the multi damage condition strain mode difference index by the ifem can still accurately identify the damage locations and the damage identification accuracy is relatively higher however different from the single damage conditions the damage degree is not be identified qualitatively based on the mutation amplitude of strain difference curve under the same damage condition for example element 533 damage 15 and element 927 damage 25 in this paper the above figures only intercept the strain difference curves of the damage locations as shown in fig 21 the 1st order strain difference curve of condition 1 only abruptly changes at the damaged location while the curves are flat at other undamaged elements moreover the intercepting 1st order strain difference curve of condition 2 only shows abrupt changes at the damage position and the curves at other positions are relatively flat it is noteworthy that the proposed method does not cause a poor impact on the damage identification it improves the inadequacy of traditional damage index method although the element is close to the boundary or at the modal node the direct index method based on the ifem can effectively and accurately identify single damage or multi damage the above figures show that two damaged elements of conditions 3 and 4 are at the same axis position and thus only the strain differential data of this axis are provided if the damage degree is smaller the damage position can still be accurately identified according to the strain mode difference curves for example element 426 damage 10 of condition 3 fig 24 by comparatively analyzing figs 24 and 25 the strain mode difference curves display that the damage locations can be accurately distinguished but it fails to quantify the specific damage degree for example the difference of the curve mutation magnitude is relatively small between the element 426 damage 10 in condition 3 and element 426 damage 30 in condition 4 it has to be noticed that the damage index proposed is defined as positions information between damaged and undamaged conditions therefore the damage degree cannot be identified quantitatively by the strain mode difference future research will explore the quantified damage degree on structural damage identification 4 conclusions in this paper the inverse finite element iqs4 is used to obtain the displacement field based on the ifem for structural deformation reconstruction furthermore the direct damage index is established by the strain field data to identify damage location under different damaged conditions it improves the deficiencies of traditional damage identification methods for example complete modal information data before damage is required and a relatively high accuracy is limited by the number of measurement points in actual engineering the validity of the proposed method is confirmed based on the obtained results a cantilever plate is numerically demonstrated by a small amount of strain data under single damage and multi damage conditions meanwhile structural deformation field is reconstructed with sufficient precision by the ifem including the displacement field and stress field the results are not different from the fe results and most of errors are within 5 a significant sensitivity is noticed according to the 1st order strain mode difference based on the ifem moreover the damaged locations can be accurately identified the effect of qualitative damage degree identification under single damage conditions is better than multi damage conditions because the damage index is defined as the difference between the damaged positions information the damage degree is not identified quantitatively emphasis is placed on the damage identification method by the ifem while the influences of the measuring points arrangement and noise addition on the accuracy of the

21131,previous studies have shown that the geometry of the trench affects the fatigue response of steel catenary risers scr fatigue performance of scr in the touchdown zone tdz has been investigated in several studies sometimes leading to contradictory results with no coherent agreement regarding if the effect of the trench on fatigue performance of scr would be beneficial or detrimental this paper aims at developing a model based on the well known boundary layer method blm to capture the trench effect on the fatigue performance of scr using analytical and numerical approaches a meaningful relationship was observed between the slope of trench shoulders the magnitude of the peak fatigue damage and its location in the trench it was also observed that the effect of trench formation on the fatigue performance of scr could be predicted by using tdp oscillations on a sloped seabed the study contributes to achieving a coherent agreement about the trench effect on fatigue keywords steel catenary riser boundary layer method trench touchdown point fatigue response 1 introduction steel catenary risers scrs are welded steel pipes suspended from the vessel to the seabed due to environmental and operational loads scrs are continuously oscillating and thus are vulnerable to fatigue loads the riser hang off point and the touchdown zone tdz are two important fatigue hot spots however the fatigue life assessment of the riser in tdz is a significant challenge due to complex non linear hysteretic riser seabed interaction several mechanisms contribute to the gradual formation of a trench underneath the scr within a few years after installation the influence of the seabed on fatigue response of scr has been investigated from different standpoints such as developing non linear hysteretic riser seabed interaction models e g bridge and howells 2007 nakhaee and zhang 2008 aubeny and biscontin 2009 randolph and quiggin 2009 zargar et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 investigation

essential for a reliable and cost effective scr design shoghi and shiri 2019 categorized the mechanisms involved in trench formation and mathematically proved that irrespective of the nature of the involved mechanism the ultimate result appears in the form of two important factors a the average of peak shear force in the tdz ṽ that is related to seabed soil stiffness and b the tdp oscillation amplitude δ tdp that is related to the trench geometry see fig 1 the authors then showed that the direct product of these two fundamental parameters i e ṽ δ tdp mimics the same variation trend as axial stress δσ or the fatigue damage this product is neither equal to nor an approximation to the axial stress range however it is a sensible parameter that follows the variation trends identical to axial stress or fatigue damage it is noteworthy that the fatigue damage in the touchdown zone is accumulated by variation of cross sectional stress which in turn is the result of dominant loads i e the bending moment and tension campbell 1999 therefore as recommended by dnv rp f204 2010 the oscillation of axial stress resultant from bending moment and tension load variation is considered for fatigue damage calculation instead of von mises stress because the shear force has no remarkable contribution to the cross sectional stress campbell 1999 the dominance of the tdp oscillation δ tdp was observed by shoghi ad shiri 2019 through analytical and numerical studies the authors then developed a set of rules for qualitative assessment of the trench impact on fatigue shoghi and shiri used the developed set of rules in 2019 to re assess most of the key studies conducted on the trench effect of scr fatigue the study showed that depending on the dominance of the low frequency vessel excursions that in turn depend on geographical location the trench effect can be beneficial or detrimental to the ultimate fatigue life also the authors showed that the trench effect rather appears in the form of large relocation of peak fatigue damage recently shoghi and shiri 2019 combined the conventional catenary equations with a boundary layer solution that was previously developed for the flat and linearly elastic seabed by pesce et al 2006 considering that the trench inserts a sloped seabed within its shoulders in both near and far direction this could trigger some inaccuracies in terms of proper capturing the natural riser profile around the tdp and consequently in the fatigue damage it should be observed that on a rigid and flat seabed the lowest point of the catenary is at the same level as that of the seabed moreover if both riser bending stiffness and soil elasticity are disregarded a discontinuity in curvature is obtained right at the tdp this would allow assuming a hinge type connection between the catenary and the supported pipeline such a curvature discontinuity at tdp may be removed by considering the riser bending stiffness as shown by aranha et al 1997 through a boundary layer technique what was proved valid experimentally by pesce 1997 nevertheless a discontinuity in the shear force remains if the soil is still considered to be rigid this discontinuity is removed if an elastic soil is finally considered as done in pesce et al 1998 for the static problem and in pesce et al 2006 for the quasi static condition however in the sloped seabed the lowest point of the catenary is slightly really below the tdp on the positive sloped shoulder of the trench and slightly virtually above the tdp at the negative sloped shoulder of the trench the methodology used by shoghi and shiri 2019 could cause these elevation offsets to affect the accuracy of assuming a hinge connection between the suspended and the supported part the catenary and the pipeline sides since violates the natural curvature of the riser around the tdp in the current study the static boundary layer solution proposed by pesce et al 1998 for elastic and horizontal seabeds is further developed to account for the seabed slope in the tdz aiming at better representing the shoulders of a real trench analytical and numerical analyses were conducted and compared with earlier studies the study extended the validity of the methodology developed by shoghi and shiri 2019 and consequently supported the re assessment results published by shoghi and shiri 2020 2 developing a boundary layer model the boundary layer solution proposed by pesce et al 1998 is further developed through the incorporation of the seabed slopes clockwise and counter clockwise representing the trench shoulders a numerical model is also constructed and results are compared with those obtained with the boundary layer analytical solution case studies are then conducted to further validate the developed model against the published data the tdp was closely monitored as a crucial point because a it is a non material point of the scr that sweeps the seabed surface constrained to the trench profile or the seabed geometry b the maximum curvature occurs within a close neighborhood of the tdp towards the suspended part c the tdp position is directly affected by seabed soil stiffness d it has a pivotal role in the continuity of shear force and bending moment distribution of the riser resting on a linear elastic seabed and e the tdp is affected by cyclic loads and could represent the location of peak fatigue damage fdmax i e the point having the least fatigue life in the scr it was observed that the magnitude of peak fatigue damage and its location present a close relation with the oscillation of the tdp on the sloped seabed which in turn is linked to the flexural response of scr in tdz following the standard of the boundary layer techniques the matching between inner and outer solutions inside and outside the tdz is achieved by solving a system of linear equations obtained by enforcing continuity of the solution and its derivatives up to fourth order first the equations were obtained for the rigid sloped seabed and then further extended to the sloped linear elastic seabed then the response of the tdp including oscillation amplitude and the relocation due to the seabed slope was investigated the current study has considered rigid and elastic seabeds and was conducted based upon the findings of earlier studies which incorporated nonlinear hysteretic riser seabed interaction some of these findings are as follow the riser seabed interaction is studied because of its impact on ultimate fatigue life in the touchdown zone which is challenging to assess rov surveys have proven that the trench formation underneath the riser happens only within 2 to three years after the riser installation bridge and howells 2007 then the riser is stabilized and the cyclic seabed soil stiffness no longer continues also the sea bottom currents and the water velocity fields created by the seawater entrapped between the oscillating riser and the seabed wash out the natural backfill considerably reducing the suction force that is generated in riser uplift episodes therefore after the ultimate trench formation in the early stages the trench remains constant and the seabed acts more like an elastic seabed two to three years is a negligible period compared with at least twenty five years of the scr service life therefore assuming an elastic seabed with a proper seabed stiffness evaluation and the trench geometry would sufficiently simulate the trench impact on fatigue the recent studies have further revealed the significance of the trench geometry compared with cyclic seabed stiffness degradation e g shoghi and shiri 2019 a b in addition the impact of the trench on fatigue life becomes more significant when the low frequency vessel excursion is simulated this in turn shows that assuming an elastic seabed with proper soil stiffness would not compromise the accuracy of soil simplification in terms of trench impact on fatigue the boundary layer method on elastic seabed provides less complicated but still robust tools for assessing the scr fatigue life affected by the seabed interaction at the early stages of design for system configuration this can almost eliminate the need for costly advanced finite element analysis in the concept development phases of the projects moreover the boundary layer on the rigid and elastic seabed can be effectively used for optimization studies in the early phases of design the existing popular non linear hysteretic riser seabed interaction models are all suffering from numerical premature stabilization dong and shiri 2018 these models are not able to explicitly model the observed trenches in the field i e 3d to 7d deep the maximum embedment depth that produced by the existing plastic models are less than 1d which cannot be called trench it is simply penetration in the context of trench geometry there is almost no difference between the key features of the trench profile created by using plastic riser seabed interaction and simple linear elastic seabed the non linear hysteretic plastic riser seabed interaction models are built upon several parameters that are challenging uncertain and costly to obtain in the field and calibrate the numerical model therefore it is less attractive in the industry where the linear elastic seabed is still dominantly preferred because of simplicity certainty and acceptable accuracy therefore the industry is still looking for some simplified reliable solutions preferably on the elastic seabed to incorporate the effect of non linear hysteretic riser seabed interaction and trench formation in fatigue analysis the current research work was conducted in response to this demand 2 1 sloped rigid seabed depending on the dominant direction of sea states the touchdown point tdp may move towards to or far from the offset zone noz foz fig 2 schematically shows these offset zones and the key parameters used for developing the boundary layer solution the tdp relocation causes peak fatigue damage to relocate and affect the fatigue performance of scr on trench shoulders for developing the boundary layer solution the foz and noz were simplified as straight sloped lines the realistic trench profile was also investigated in later stages however as shown by shoghi and shiri 2019 this kind of assumption has no negative impact on the objectives of the current study which is to looking for the trends of the trench impact on fatigue herein the main steps of developing the model for sloped seabeds are explained the reader is directed to pesce et al 1998 for derivations concerning the simpler linear elastic horizontal soil case and to the appendix for some basic results on rigid soil upon which both solutions are derived starting from the basics it is well known that the solution to the problem of a suspended cable that touches a flat and rigid bed leads to a curvature discontinuity at the tdp pesce et al 1998 aranha et al 1997 pesce 1997 in fact the tdp curvature at the suspended side reaches a maximum value of χ 0 1 ρ 0 q t 0 where χ 0 ρ 0 t 0 are respectively curvature the radius of curvature and tension at tdp and q is the immersed weight per unit length whereas from the supported side the curvature at tdp is null if bending stiffness is considered the local solution for the curvature in the suspended part reads appendix eq a 9 1 χ s χ 0 c 1 e s s f λ where s f is the new tdp arch length coordinate herein named ideal position and λ is the flexural parameter that relates bending stiffness to geometrical rigidity effects λ e i t 0 see fig 3 increasing the tension due to far vessel offset causes an increase in the effective tension in tdp and a reduction of the curvature consequently therefore a small length of the boundary layer is set to overcome the discontinuity of curvature in the near vessel offset the tension is reduced and the flexural length is increased this in turn resolves the discontinuity of curvature for both suspended and supported parts let us now consider a curved seabed and the following definitions χ s f χ s b and c 1 χ s b χ 0 which transforms eq 1 into the form 2 χ s χ 0 χ s b χ 0 e s s f λ where χ s b 1 ρ s b is the seabed curvature at tdp see fig 2 obviously for a horizontal seabed eq 2 recovers the results of pesce et al 1998 following pesce et al 1998 this equation can once again be integrated over s to find the angle along the suspended part of the scr 3 θ s χ 0 s χ s b χ 0 λ e s s f λ c 3 taking the flexural length λ as a length scale in the far field i e far enough from tdp such that s s f λ we can write s ρ 0 θ s therefore c 3 0 pesce 1997 the matching equation θ s f θ s b gives the non dimensional ideal tdp position s f λ the tdp relocation may be then obtained as a function of the flexural length parameter and the seabed slope as follow 4 s f λ 1 χ s b χ 0 tan θ s b λ χ 0 1 r χ r θ where r χ χ s b χ 0 and r θ tan θ s b λ χ 0 are hereinafter called perturbation parameters of the seabed geometry concerning curvature and slope of the seabed which affects the riser solution around the seabed touching point likewise eq 2 eq 4 recovers the results of pesce et al 1998 for a horizontal seabed eq 4 shows how the so called ideal tdp is related to seabed geometric characteristics and may be relocated by considering the flexural stiffness of the riser around tdp the non dimensional tdp relocation eq 4 is assessed qualitatively for different seabed geometries in table 1 the shear force at tdp on the suspended part q 0 is then given by deriving eq 2 and taking s s f as 5 q 0 q λ 1 r χ r θ t 0 tan θ s b on the supported part the shear force at the tdp is zero if the seabed is rigid considering a sloped seabed such that tan θ s b θ s b and substituting r θ in eq 5 the shear force at tdp reduces to q 0 q λ in accordance with a result obtained in pesce et al 1998 for a horizontal seabed it should be mentioned that the curvature is a continuous function but there is a discontinuity in shear force distribution along the riser at tdp on the rigid seabed which will be resolved in the next session for the linear elastic seabed eq 3 can be integrated to find the scr configuration y taking the origin at the known ideal tdp recalling that c 3 0 then 6 y s χ 0 s 2 s f 2 2 χ s b χ 0 λ 2 e s s f λ c 4 continuity of riser configuration y s at the ideal tdp shall be satisfied for both suspended and supported parts s s f this will result in c 4 y s b s f χ s b χ 0 λ 2 generalizing the results in pesce et al 1998 for a sloped seabed the nondimensional forms of shear force curvature angle and configuration functions around the ideal tdp are then given by the following equations 7 q 0 q λ h s λ s f λ e s λ s f λ s s f 8 χ s χ 0 1 e s λ s f λ s λ s f

s f λ the local shear force distribution in tdz as well as the curvature angle and configuration of the riser for both suspended and supported part on the straight sloped rigid seabed were then obtained these quantities are clearly affected by seabed geometry through the ideal tdp position and the perturbation parameters 2 2 sloped elastic seabed 3 continuity of shear force at tdp holds if the soil is considered to be deformable pesce et al 1998 it can also be shown that the flexural stiffness effect slightly alters the curvature diagram the tdp moves towards the supported zone causing an elastic inflection over the support as in pesce et al 1998 a simplified model will be here considered in which the soil reaction on the line is characterized only by a linear restoration coefficient k considering y s as the elastic curve function the static penetration of the riser into the soil far enough from tdp is simply y s t q k for simplicity it is assumed that the supported part of the riser on the seabed does not stand out from the ground if s s f where s f indicates the position of the contact or touchdown point eq 11 below governs the static equilibrium of the riser on the supported elastic seabed notice that in the contact region within a second order error in θ d y d x the following approximations are valid s x and χ s χ x d 2 y d x 2 where x is horizontal coordinate therefore the equation under consideration can be written as 11 d 4 y d x 4 d d x 1 λ 2 y k e i y k e i y s b q e i in eq 11 y s b is the seabed configuration function straight line in dimensionless form with ξ x λ and η y λ eq 11 is written 12 η i v η k η χ 0 λ k η s b where the dimensionless parameter of stiffness k is defined as k λ 4 k e i λ 2 k t 0 k e i t 0 pesce et al 1998 for usual applications k is much larger than one k 1 so eq 12 can be approximated as follows 13 η i v k η χ 0 λ k η s b the solution to this equation shall satisfy the following conditions 14 lim ξ η ξ χ 0 λ lim ξ k η s b 15 lim ξ ξ f η ξ η s b ξ f for the linear elastic sloped seabed eq 16 below is considered as the first approximation for a general form of the seabed 16 η s b ξ tan θ s b ξ m ξ the solution on the supported part measured relative to the static penetration due to the riser weight and its derivatives take the following forms 17 η ξ c 1 e r ξ ξ f sin r ξ ξ f m ξ 18 η ξ c 1 r e

of soil stiffness and seabed slope 29 ξ f k 0 25 k 0 25 2 k 0 25 r θ it should be mentioned that the geometric parameter r θ is a function of the seabed slope which recovers asymptotically the known solution for a horizontal seabed taking θ 0 pesce et al 1998 also for the straight flat seabed when k 1 and θ 0 ξ f 1 recovering the result in pesce et al 1998 the effect of soil deformability causes the contact point ideal tdp to move towards the vessel direction however at this new contact point the line is not tangent to the seabed for enough soft soils the complete asymptotic solution around

next section the developed boundary layer solution will be used to investigate the influence of trench geometry on scr response by monitoring tdp relocation the blm solution will be compared with the numerical results obtained by using orcaflex software 3 perturbation of the tdp on the sloped seabed the effect of tdp relocation on both sloped clockwise foz and counter clockwise noz seabed is investigated by locally studying the static distribution of the riser angle the shear force and the curvature a numerical model was constructed in orcaflex for a typical scr pesce et al 2006 fig 4 shows the configuration of the numerical model with the main parameters given in table 2 a range of model parameters was considered to perform a sensitivity analysis and compare the results of the numerical model with the developed blm solution 3 1 effect of seabed geometry and soil stiffness the sensitivity of tdp location to different seabed slopes and soil stiffness is studied with both blm and numerical analysis inextensibility of scr in orcaflex was enforced by considering the axial stiffness as a hundred times the value of the real riser s to use inextensible clebsh love formulation love 1927 the different seabed with positive slope which represents a near shoulder noz negative slope which represents a far shoulder foz and null slope representing the ideal trench bottom were considered fig 5 shows the non dimensional results for horizontal positive and negative seabed slopes obtained with the blm analytical solution where θ χ 0 λ represents the non dimensional angle with respect to the horizontal χ χ 0 the non dimensional curvature q q λ the non dimensional shear force and η s c r χ 0 λ 2 r θ the non dimensional configuration of the scr whereas η s c r χ 0 λ 2 r θ represents the non dimensional configuration of the seabed respectively it should be taken into account that the vessel position is considered fixed for both analyzed cases positive and negative slope variations and tdp relocations are obtained locally as a pure influence of seabed due to riser flexural stiffness in tdz fig 5 shows that the non dimensional slope of the riser is matched with the non dimensional slope of the seabed for the supported part of the riser the curvature is matched with zero at tdp on the flat seabed also it had already been observed pesce et al 1998 that the typical matching length is about 4 to 5λ this means that beyond this length along the riser regardless of the seabed configuration results will merge smoothly in other words the trench geometry affects the fatigue performance of riser locally and fatigue study should be investigated somewhere around or close to the tdp in tdz within a range of circa 5λ fig 6 represents the non dimensional tdp position on the horizontal seabed s f λ and the normalized tdp position on positive and negative sloped seabeds s f λ r θ for a range of seabed soil stiffness it should be mentioned that in this figure the non dimensional tdp position on the horizontal seabed is related to the first term in eq 29 referring to the soil property in the horizontal seabed r θ 0 recovering results obtained in pesce et al 1998 when the soil is considered very rigid k 1 this term recovers the equation for infinitely rigid seabed pesce et al 1998 in this case for k k 0 25 k 0 25 2 k 0 25 1 for the sloped seabed 2 the tdp position is normalized by that on a rigid seabed for these slopes r θ 8 56 the tdp relocates towards the vessel in noz positive slope seabed and foz negative slope seabed as the soil gets softer the non dimensional results of the curvature slope and shear force distributions around the tdp obtained via blm are compared with oracflex in fig 7 to fig 9 fig 7 shows the non dimensional results of blm and oracflex on the flat seabed the obtained non dimensional real tdp location via blm in fig 5 a s f λ 1 is precise and close to the numerical result fig 7 a and d show the non dimensional slope along the riser in the tdz the peak value of the negative slope in the riser and region of the negative slope increases for softer soils due to further riser penetration fig 7 b and e show a smooth distribution of the curvature variation around tdp the softer the soil the smoother is the curvature variation as shown in fig 7 c and f the maximum shear force occurs on the suspended part of the riser near to the tdp this point further approaches the tdp as the soil stiffness increases the results of blm and finite element analysis are in excellent agreement for higher values of seabed stiffness however the agreement loses accuracy as the seabed becomes very soft this happens because of less adaptability of the elastic soil assumption on very soft soils i e s x and χ s χ x d 2 y d x 2 fig 8 compares the non dimensional results of blm and oracflex on the positive sloped seabed noz the location of non dimensional real tdp that was obtained by blm in fig 5 b s f λ 7 5 is precise and close to the numerical result as shown in fig 8 a and d the softer soil results in further riser penetration and a smoother curvature variation on the positive sloped seabed noz also the maximum shear force is still approaching the tdp on the stiffer seabed fig 9 shows the non dimensional results of blm and oracflex on the negative sloped seabed foz where the location of non dimensional real tdp obtained from blm fig 5 c s f λ 9 5 is well close to the numerical result similar trends were observed on the negative sloped seabed with a good agreement between the blm analytical solution and fea results these validation results show that the developed blm has sufficient accuracy to be used for qualitative assessment of the trench impact on fatigue and even the fatigue life assessment of the riser in early design stages however an accurate assessment of the ultimate fatigue life needs performing numerical fatigue analysis 3 2 discussion on tdp relocation on sloped seabed the non dimensional local tdp relocation obtained in eq 4 can be rewritten in terms of tdp effective tension as follow 34 s f λ 1 tan θ s b q e i t 0 1 5 eq 34 shows that in the case of creating a noz shoulder θ s b 0 the tdp relocation will be positive meaning that the tdp moves towards the vessel on the other hand for foz shoulder θ s b 0 the tdp moves to the riser s anchored end for the analytical investigation of tdp relocation the magnitude of slope in the near side noz was considered approximately two times greater than the far side foz due to the general configuration of the proposed ladle shape trenches in the literature see fig 10 fig 10 shows that the proposed mathematical trenches may include a convex point curvature and different slopes in foz and noz an analytical study was conducted to find tdp relocation s f λ trend on the created foz and noz seabed for a typical scr configuration shown in fig 4 the three pairs of slopes were considered including 0 5 1 and 1 5 clockwise for creating foz and 1 2 and 3 counter clockwise for creating noz it was assumed that the slope of noz shoulder is twice the foz one the tdp relocations for each of the created seabed were calculated using eq 34 and normalized by tdp relocation in foz the obtained results are shown in table 3 for each pair table 3 shows that the tdp relocation on foz is smaller than on noz also an increase of the seabed slope results in a significant tdp relocation which either migrates towards the vessel on noz or moves away from the vessel on foz the tdp relocation ratio of foz to noz as a function of seabed slope θ s b 0 for foz was written as follows 35 s f λ f o z s f λ n o z 1 tan θ s b q e i t 0 1 5 1 tan 2 θ s b q e i t 0 1 5 fig 11 shows the analytical trend of the tdp relocation ratio given by eq 35 versus a range of slopes the results show that the tdp relocation ratio given in eq 35 remains less than 1 for 0 θ 45 which means the tdp relocation on foz is less than tdp relocation on noz this is an interesting finding because the majority of distorted fatigue results in the literature have been reported to happen in the noz and trench mouth randolph et al 2013 sharma and aubeny 2011 these results show the significance of the methodology that is used to incorporate the trench effect in fatigue analysis simple incompatibilities between the trench profile and the riser profile in noz will result in non reliable predictions because of unwanted pressure hot spots in the trench mouth shoghi and shiri 2019 2020 3 3 discussion on tdp oscillation amplitude the tdp oscillation amplitude δ tdp under the vessel motion towards the far and near offset was performed analytically fig 12 and fig 13 show a local view of the foz and noz shoulders both sloped in clockwise and counter clockwise directions around the tdp the tdp oscillation trends were investigated on the trench shoulders by using the developed blm identical vessel motions were used to obtain the tdp oscillation amplitude in both foz and noz quasi statically without applying low frequency excursions the study was conducted in two steps first the initial tdp relocation on the trench shoulder sloped seabed was found for the near vessel offset second a tdp was set for the far vessel position on sloped shoulders the initial tdp location for far vessel excursions is assumed to be almost the same in the different sloped seabed because of its less significance the primary influence of the seabed on tdp oscillation amplitude is on the initial tdp relocation the tdp oscillation amplitude δ tdp was defined as the difference between the position of the tdp in both near and far vessel offsets as follow 36 δ tdp θ 2 s f λ θ 2 n e a r s f λ f a r 37 δ tdp θ 1 s f λ θ 1 n e a r s f λ f a r where the first and the second subscripts denote the sloped seabed and the vessel position and θ 2 θ 1 ignoring the slope effect on tdp position of the far vessel offset for noz or foz the following equation was obtained 38 δ tdp θ 2 δ tdp θ 1 s f λ θ 2 n e a r s f λ θ 1 n e a r substituting eq 34 into eq 38 and rearranging a meaningful relationship was obtained as follow 39 δ t d p θ 2 δ t d p θ 1 t 0 q λ tan θ 2 tan θ 1 a qualitative assessment of tdp oscillation amplitude on foz or noz respecting the seabed slope on each zone resulted in the following relations 40 δ t d p θ 2 δ t d p θ 1 i n f o z θ 2 θ 1 δ t d p θ 2 δ t d p θ 1 i n n o z θ 2 θ 1 eq 40 shows that the absolute value of the seabed slope on noz or foz affects the tdp oscillation amplitude in each zone eq 40 also indicates that the tdp oscillation amplitude decreases with a steeper slope in foz and increases with a steeper slope in noz which is in a perfect agreement with the findings of shoghi and shiri 2019 in other words as shown by shoghi and shiri 2019 the tdp oscillation amplitude δtdp dominates the peak average shear force and properly mimics the overall variation trend of the axial stress range δσ or the fatigue damage this will be examined in the next section through fea fatigue analysis and by reviewing a critical case study published in the literature randolph et al 2013 4 numerical fatigue analysis and the trench effect a series of finite element fatigue analysis was conducted using orcaflex the class e of dnv rp f204 material was considered to define the s n curve with the parameters m 3 log a 11 61 and a stress concentration factor scf of 1 15 since the fatigue analysis was to only observe the trends a single regular wave of 6 m high with a period of 7 s and a sufficiently large number of occurrence in a year was applied on the vessel to obtain the resultant damage the typical scr model shown in fig 4 was studied to verify the validity of analytical findings through a fatigue analysis instead of axial stress range variation δσ the rigid seabed was taken and hinge boundaries were considered at both ends of the riser at the hang off point and the anchored end the hydrodynamic coefficients of drag inertia and added mass were taken as 1 2 1 0 and 1 0 respectively three different seabed geometries were incorporated in the tdz through relocating the seabed slope around the tdp by 0 5 1 and 1 5 clockwise for creating foz and 1 2 and 3 counter clockwise for creating noz see fig 14 fig 15 shows the results of the fatigue analysis and the corresponding local seabed slopes fig 15 shows that different local seabed configurations result in a different fatigue performance for an identical wave frequency vessel motion the low frequency vessel excursion was not considered in this analysis to obtain the pure influence of the seabed on fatigue it was observed that the magnitude of the peak fatigue damage is less on foz compared to that noz the peak fatigue damage fdmax which presents the least fatigue life can be qualitatively expressed on a sloped seabed as follow 41 f d 1 f d 2 f d 3 f o r n o z s h o u l d e r f d 0 5 f d 1 f d 1 5 f o r f o z s h o u l d e r the location of the peak fatigue damage moves toward the vessel for the created local noz as a result of the positive slope of shoulders results show that the steeper seabed causes more relocation see strong solid line curve in fig 15 b which is in agreement with the analytical result in the previous section the location of the peak fatigue damage moves away from the vessel for created local foz as a result of the negative slope of the trench shoulders in the foz case the steeper seabed causes more relocation see strong solid line curve in fig 15 a fig 15 shows that the fatigue damages curves for scr on foz are narrow and the relocation is less compared with noz this is in agreement with the earlier observations see fig 11 5 re assessing of a case study in this section a previously published study that has investigated the trench effect on scr fatigue will be re assessed using the findings of the current study randolph et al 2013 randolph et al 2013 examined the effect of different trenches and various vessel oscillations including combined wf lf motions on scr fatigue see fig 16 randolph et al 2013 studied cases in the gulf of mexico gom and western australia wa and assumed linear a soil stiffness of 300 kpa for gom and 1000 kpa for wa and nonlinear seabed models for lf excursions predominant far near and cross directions were considered for re assessment the langner s mathematical trench and the stepped trench were considered the variation of seabed slope throughout the trench was extracted and shown in fig 17 fig 17 shows that the langner s trench is steeper in noz compared to the stepped seabed although the stepped seabed holds the minimum absolute value of slope throughout the trench the locally different absolute values are observed for some areas in the foz fig 17 the fatigue life results of the study are shown in fig 18 a to d for the noz and e to h for foz to facilitate the re assessment the key fatigue life data in fig 18 was extracted and shown in table 4 and table 5 also the peak damage relocations fdmax were extracted and shown in table 6 the results in table 7 show that as predicted by the blm solution developed in the current study the dominant peak damage relocation occurs in langner s trench where the slopes of the trench shoulder are steeper in both noz and foz the ratios for foz are in agreement with the absolute value of the trenches but there is a sharp increase in the damage relocation at foz for the wa case for the vessel excursion towards the near direction and compared to the flat seabed the points with the least fatigue life fdmax on noz shoulder are relocated toward the vessel on both linear and nonlinear seabed fig 18 a d also fig 18 a to d show that the maximum damage relocations for both linear and nonlinear seabed occur in the trench with the steeper shoulder in noz which belongs to the langner s trench likewise the minimum damage relocations correspond to the stepped trench which holds the minimum absolute value of slope in noz see fig 17 as expected these damage relocations correlate with the slopes of the trench shoulders in the far vessel excursions fig 18 e and h compared with the flat seabed the points with the least fatigue life fdmax on foz shoulder move away from the vessel towards the pipeline side fig 18 e and f show that the damage relocations are not significant for the soft seabed gom due to the overall similarity of the trenches in foz see fig 16 however significant damage relocations were observed in the foz under the far vessel excursion in the stiff seabed wa fig 18 g and h a closer look at the fatigue curves for langner s trench in fig 18 a d shows potential pressure hotspots in foz due to incompatibility between the trench and riser profiles the same is observed in all of the cases near the trench mouth when the vessel moves towards the near direction and the tdp moves to noz the incompatibility between the trench and riser profiles could be due to the significance of riser flexural stiffness in the tdz which has been emphasized as an important factor in this paper the unwanted pressure hotspots can exacerbate the local fatigue damage particularly for the stiff soil overall a steeper shoulder in noz compared to foz results in a larger peak damage relocation compared with the flat seabed this happens due to the differences between the absolute value of the trench slopes in noz and foz which was predicted by the developed blm solution see fig 11 the influence of the local trench slope on the magnitude of the fatigue life is interestingly observed in the results reported by randolph et al 2013 table 8 and table 9 show the normalized fatigue lives by stepped trench on different trench shoulders in near and far vessel excursions that were extracted from fig 18 it was observed that in the noz shoulder the magnitude of fatigue life is decreased for langner s trench damage has increased due to increasing the slope of noz as predicted by blm also the magnitude of fatigue life is decreased for langner s trench on foz compared with the stepped seabed a closer look at fig 17 shows that there is a change in the magnitude of the slope for inserted trenches in foz next to langner s peak the local slope of the langner s trench has decreased at fdmax which may explain the discrepancy in comparison with the stepped seabed also stress hotspots in the wa case are more significant because of the stiffer seabed compared to gom the re assessment of this case study showed that as predicted by the blm analytical solution the peak fatigue damage on the trench could be increased or decreased in both trench shoulders due to the difference of the local seabed slope which affects the tdp oscillation amplitude these findings denote the case dependence of the trench effect on fatigue and agree with the earlier study conducted by shoghi and shiri 2019 and 2020 6 conclusions the beneficial or detrimental effect of the trench on scr fatigue in the tdz is still an open question and there is no coherent agreement amongst the researchers in the literature the recently developed methodologies for assessing this problem by using the boundary layer solutions are limited to the flat seabed to examine the validity of the recent solutions in a more realistic trench with sloped shoulders a boundary layer solution was developed to account for the seabed slope and resolve the discontinuity of the scr profile on the trench the model was validated by finite element analysis and re assessing a well known case study from the literature the results supported the validity of the recently proposed analytical solutions for assessing the trench effect on riser fatigue it was observed that there is a direct relationship between the tdp oscillations on the trench with the magnitude and relocation of the peak fatigue damage of scr in the tdz the study further supported the idea that the fatigue response of scr is a case dependent problem heavily influenced by the low frequency vessel excursions and the wave directions that may have the highest contribution to the fatigue damage accumulation in any case the slopes of trench shoulders play an important role where steeper shoulder benefits fatigue life in foz and deteriorate in noz it means depending on the geographical location and the dominant direction of lf vessel excursions the trench may increase or decrease the fatigue life substituting s c 0 which represents the tdp the χ 0 c q t 0 c is obtained as curvature at the tdp

21131,previous studies have shown that the geometry of the trench affects the fatigue response of steel catenary risers scr fatigue performance of scr in the touchdown zone tdz has been investigated in several studies sometimes leading to contradictory results with no coherent agreement regarding if the effect of the trench on fatigue performance of scr would be beneficial or detrimental this paper aims at developing a model based on the well known boundary layer method blm to capture the trench effect on the fatigue performance of scr using analytical and numerical approaches a meaningful relationship was observed between the slope of trench shoulders the magnitude of the peak fatigue damage and its location in the trench it was also observed that the effect of trench formation on the fatigue performance of scr could be predicted by using tdp oscillations on a sloped seabed the study contributes to achieving a coherent agreement about the trench effect on fatigue keywords steel catenary riser boundary layer method trench touchdown point fatigue response 1 introduction steel catenary risers scrs are welded steel pipes suspended from the vessel to the seabed due to environmental and operational loads scrs are continuously oscillating and thus are vulnerable to fatigue loads the riser hang off point and the touchdown zone tdz are two important fatigue hot spots however the fatigue life assessment of the riser in tdz is a significant challenge due to complex non linear hysteretic riser seabed interaction several mechanisms contribute to the gradual formation of a trench underneath the scr within a few years after installation the influence of the seabed on fatigue response of scr has been investigated from different standpoints such as developing non linear hysteretic riser seabed interaction models e g bridge and howells 2007 nakhaee and zhang 2008 aubeny and biscontin 2009 randolph and quiggin 2009 zargar et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 investigation

beneficial trench effect e g langner 2003 wang and low 2016 randolph et al 2013 and some opposing that e g shiri 2014a rezazadeh et al 2012 shiri 2010 finding a robust answer to this question is essential for a reliable and cost effective scr design shoghi and shiri 2019 categorized the mechanisms involved in trench formation and mathematically proved that irrespective of the nature of the involved mechanism the ultimate result appears in the form of two important factors a the average of peak shear force in the tdz ṽ that is related to seabed soil stiffness and b the tdp oscillation amplitude δ tdp that is related to the trench geometry see fig 1 the authors then showed that the direct product of these two fundamental parameters i e ṽ δ tdp mimics the same variation trend as axial stress δσ or the fatigue damage this product is neither equal to nor an approximation to the axial stress range however it is a sensible parameter that follows the variation trends identical to axial stress or fatigue damage it is noteworthy that the fatigue damage in the touchdown zone is accumulated by variation of cross sectional stress which in turn is the result of dominant loads i e the bending moment and tension campbell 1999 therefore as recommended by dnv rp f204 2010 the oscillation of axial stress resultant from bending moment and tension load variation is considered for fatigue damage calculation instead of von mises stress because the shear force has no remarkable contribution to the cross sectional stress campbell 1999 the dominance of the tdp oscillation δ tdp was observed by shoghi ad shiri 2019 through analytical and numerical studies the authors then developed a set of rules for qualitative assessment of the trench impact on fatigue shoghi and shiri used the developed set of rules in 2019 to re assess most of the key studies conducted on the trench effect of scr fatigue the study showed that depending on the dominance of the low frequency vessel excursions that in turn depend on geographical location the trench effect can be beneficial or detrimental to the ultimate fatigue life also the authors showed that the trench effect rather appears in the form of large relocation of peak fatigue damage recently shoghi and shiri 2019 combined the conventional catenary equations with a boundary layer solution that was previously developed for the flat and linearly elastic seabed by pesce et al 2006 considering that the trench inserts a sloped seabed within its shoulders in both near and far direction this could trigger some inaccuracies in terms of proper capturing the natural riser profile around the tdp and consequently in the fatigue damage it should be observed that on a rigid and flat seabed the lowest point of the catenary is at the same level as that of the seabed moreover if both riser bending stiffness and soil elasticity are disregarded a discontinuity in curvature is obtained right at the tdp this would allow assuming a hinge type connection between the catenary and the supported pipeline such a curvature discontinuity at tdp may be removed by considering the riser bending stiffness as shown by aranha et al 1997 through a boundary layer technique what was proved valid experimentally by pesce 1997 nevertheless a discontinuity in the shear force remains if the soil is still considered to be rigid this discontinuity is removed if an elastic soil is finally considered as done in pesce et al 1998 for the static problem and in pesce et al 2006 for the quasi static condition however in the sloped seabed the lowest point of the catenary is slightly really below the tdp on the positive sloped shoulder of the trench and slightly virtually above the tdp at the negative sloped shoulder of the trench the methodology used by shoghi and shiri 2019 could cause these elevation offsets to affect the accuracy of assuming a hinge connection between the suspended and the supported part the catenary and the pipeline sides since violates the natural curvature of the riser around the tdp in the current study the static boundary layer solution proposed by pesce et al 1998 for elastic and horizontal seabeds is further developed to account for the seabed slope in the tdz aiming at better representing the shoulders of a real trench analytical and numerical analyses were conducted and compared with earlier studies the study extended the validity of the methodology developed by shoghi and shiri 2019 and consequently supported the re assessment results published by shoghi and shiri 2020 2 developing a boundary layer model the boundary layer solution proposed by pesce et al 1998 is further developed through the incorporation of the seabed slopes clockwise and counter clockwise representing the trench shoulders a numerical model is also constructed and results are compared with those obtained with the boundary layer analytical solution case studies are then conducted to further validate the developed model against the published data the tdp was closely monitored as a crucial point because a it is a non material point of the scr that sweeps the seabed surface constrained to the trench profile or the seabed geometry b the maximum curvature occurs within a close neighborhood of the tdp towards the suspended part c the tdp position is directly affected by seabed soil stiffness d it has a pivotal role in the continuity of shear force and bending moment distribution of the riser resting on a linear elastic seabed and e the tdp is affected by cyclic loads and could represent the location of peak fatigue damage fdmax i e the point having the least fatigue life in the scr it was observed that the magnitude of peak fatigue damage and its location present a close relation with the oscillation of the tdp on the sloped seabed which in turn is linked to the flexural response of scr in tdz following the standard of the boundary layer techniques the matching between inner and outer solutions inside and outside the tdz is achieved by solving a system of linear equations obtained by enforcing continuity of the solution and its derivatives up to fourth order first the equations were obtained for the rigid sloped seabed and then further extended to the sloped linear elastic seabed then the response of the tdp including oscillation amplitude and the relocation due to the seabed slope was investigated the current study has considered rigid and elastic seabeds and was conducted based upon the findings of earlier studies which incorporated nonlinear hysteretic riser seabed interaction some of these findings are as follow the riser seabed interaction is studied because of its impact on ultimate fatigue life in the touchdown zone which is challenging to assess rov surveys have proven that the trench formation underneath the riser happens only within 2 to three years after the riser installation bridge and howells 2007 then the riser is stabilized and the cyclic seabed soil stiffness no longer continues also the sea bottom currents and the water velocity fields created by the seawater entrapped between the oscillating riser and the seabed wash out the natural backfill considerably reducing the suction force that is generated in riser uplift episodes therefore after the ultimate trench formation in the early stages the trench remains constant and the seabed acts more like an elastic seabed two to three years is a negligible period compared with at least twenty five years of the scr service life therefore assuming an elastic seabed with a proper seabed stiffness evaluation and the trench geometry would sufficiently simulate the trench impact on fatigue the recent studies have further revealed the significance of the trench geometry compared with cyclic seabed stiffness degradation e g shoghi and shiri 2019 a b in addition the impact of the trench on fatigue life becomes more significant when the low frequency vessel excursion is simulated this in turn shows that assuming an elastic seabed with proper soil stiffness would not compromise the accuracy of soil simplification in terms of trench impact on fatigue the boundary layer method on elastic seabed provides less complicated but still robust tools for assessing the scr fatigue life affected by the seabed interaction at the early stages of design for system configuration this can almost eliminate the need for costly advanced finite element analysis in the concept development phases of the projects moreover the boundary layer on the rigid and elastic seabed can be effectively used for optimization studies in the early phases of design the existing popular non linear hysteretic riser seabed interaction models are all suffering from numerical premature stabilization dong and shiri 2018 these models are not able to explicitly model the observed trenches in the field i e 3d to 7d deep the maximum embedment depth that produced by the existing plastic models are less than 1d which cannot be called trench it is simply penetration in the context of trench geometry there is almost no difference between the key features of the trench profile created by using plastic riser seabed interaction and simple linear elastic seabed the non linear hysteretic plastic riser seabed interaction models are built upon several parameters that are challenging uncertain and costly to obtain in the field and calibrate the numerical model therefore it is less attractive in the industry where the linear elastic seabed is still dominantly preferred because of simplicity certainty and acceptable accuracy therefore the industry is still looking for some simplified reliable solutions preferably on the elastic seabed to incorporate the effect of non linear hysteretic riser seabed interaction and trench formation in fatigue analysis the current research work was conducted in response to this demand 2 1 sloped rigid seabed depending on the dominant direction of sea states the touchdown point tdp may move towards to or far from the offset zone noz foz fig 2 schematically shows these offset zones and the key parameters used for developing the boundary layer solution the tdp relocation causes peak fatigue damage to relocate and affect the fatigue performance of scr on trench shoulders for developing the boundary layer solution the foz and noz were simplified as straight sloped lines the realistic trench profile was also investigated in later stages however as shown by shoghi and shiri 2019 this kind of assumption has no negative impact on the objectives of the current study which is to looking for the trends of the trench impact on fatigue herein the main steps of developing the model for sloped seabeds are explained the reader is directed to pesce et al 1998 for derivations concerning the simpler linear elastic horizontal soil case and to the appendix for some basic results on rigid soil upon which both solutions are derived starting from the basics it is well known that the solution to the problem of a suspended cable that touches a flat and rigid bed leads to a curvature discontinuity at the tdp pesce et al 1998 aranha et al 1997 pesce 1997 in fact the tdp curvature at the suspended side reaches a maximum value of χ 0 1 ρ 0 q t 0 where χ 0 ρ 0 t 0 are respectively curvature the radius of curvature and tension at tdp and q is the immersed weight per unit length whereas from the supported side the curvature at tdp is null if bending stiffness is considered the local solution for the curvature in the suspended part reads appendix eq a 9 1 χ s χ 0 c 1 e s s f λ where s f is the new tdp arch length coordinate herein named ideal position and λ is the flexural parameter that relates bending stiffness to geometrical rigidity effects λ e i t 0 see fig 3 increasing the tension due to far vessel offset causes an increase in the effective tension in tdp and a reduction of the curvature consequently therefore a small length of the boundary layer is set to overcome the discontinuity of curvature in the near vessel offset the tension is reduced and the flexural length is increased this in turn resolves the discontinuity of curvature for both suspended and supported parts let us now consider a curved seabed and the following definitions χ s f χ s b and c 1 χ s b χ 0 which transforms eq 1 into the form 2 χ s χ 0 χ s b χ 0 e s s f λ where χ s b 1 ρ s b is the seabed curvature at tdp see fig 2 obviously for a horizontal seabed eq 2 recovers the results of pesce et al 1998 following pesce et al 1998 this equation can once again be integrated over s to find the angle along the suspended part of the scr 3 θ s χ 0 s χ s b χ 0 λ e s s f λ c 3 taking the flexural length λ as a length scale in the far field i e far enough from tdp such that s s f λ we can write s ρ 0 θ s therefore c 3 0 pesce 1997 the matching equation θ s f θ s b gives the non dimensional ideal tdp position s f λ the tdp relocation may be then obtained as a function of the flexural length parameter and the seabed slope as follow 4 s f λ 1 χ s b χ 0 tan θ s b λ χ 0 1 r χ r θ where r χ χ s b χ 0 and r θ tan θ s b λ χ 0 are hereinafter called perturbation parameters of the seabed geometry concerning curvature and slope of the seabed which affects the riser solution around the seabed touching point likewise eq 2 eq 4 recovers the results of pesce et al 1998 for a horizontal seabed eq 4 shows how the so called ideal tdp is related to seabed geometric characteristics and may be relocated by considering the flexural stiffness of the riser around tdp the non dimensional tdp relocation eq 4 is assessed qualitatively for different seabed geometries in table 1 the shear force at tdp on the suspended part q 0 is then given by deriving eq 2 and taking s s f as 5 q 0 q λ 1 r χ r θ t 0 tan θ s b on the supported part the shear force at the tdp is zero if the seabed is rigid considering a sloped seabed such that tan θ s b θ s b and substituting r θ in eq 5 the shear force at tdp reduces to q 0 q λ in accordance with a result obtained in pesce et al 1998 for a horizontal seabed it should be mentioned that the curvature is a continuous function but there is a discontinuity in shear force distribution along the riser at tdp on the rigid seabed which will be resolved in the next session for the linear elastic seabed eq 3 can be integrated to find the scr configuration y taking the origin at the known ideal tdp recalling that c 3 0 then 6 y s χ 0 s 2 s f 2 2 χ s b χ 0 λ 2 e s s f λ c 4 continuity of riser configuration y s at the ideal tdp shall be satisfied for both suspended and supported parts s s f this will result in c 4 y s b s f χ s b χ 0 λ 2 generalizing the results in pesce et al 1998 for a sloped seabed the nondimensional forms of shear force curvature angle and configuration functions around the ideal tdp are then given by the following equations 7 q 0 q λ h s λ s f λ e s λ s f λ s s f 8 χ s χ 0 1 e s λ s f λ s λ s f

s f λ the local shear force distribution in tdz as well as the curvature angle and configuration of the riser for both suspended and supported part on the straight sloped rigid seabed were then obtained these quantities are clearly affected by seabed geometry through the ideal tdp position and the perturbation parameters 2 2 sloped elastic seabed 3 continuity of shear force at tdp holds if the soil is considered to be deformable pesce et al 1998 it can also be shown that the flexural stiffness effect slightly alters the curvature diagram the tdp moves towards the supported zone causing an elastic inflection over the support as in pesce et al 1998 a simplified model will be here considered in which the soil reaction on the line is characterized only by a linear restoration coefficient k considering y s as the elastic curve function the static penetration of the riser into the soil far enough from tdp is simply y s t q k for simplicity it is assumed that the supported part of the riser on the seabed does not stand out from the ground if s s f where s f indicates the position of the contact or touchdown point eq 11 below governs the static equilibrium of the riser on the supported elastic seabed notice that in the contact region within a second order error in θ d y d x the following approximations are valid s x and χ s χ x d 2 y d x 2 where x is horizontal coordinate therefore the equation under consideration can be written as 11 d 4 y d x 4 d d x 1 λ 2 y k e i y k e i y s b q e i in eq 11 y s b is the seabed configuration function straight line in dimensionless form with ξ x λ and η y λ eq 11 is written 12 η i v η k η χ 0 λ k η s b where the dimensionless parameter of stiffness k is defined as k λ 4 k e i λ 2 k t 0 k e i t 0 pesce et al 1998 for usual applications k is much larger than one k 1 so eq 12 can be approximated as follows 13 η i v k η χ 0 λ k η s b the solution to this equation shall satisfy the following conditions 14 lim ξ η

the contact point ideal tdp to move towards the vessel direction however at this new contact point the line is not tangent to the seabed for enough soft soils the complete asymptotic solution around

next section the developed boundary layer solution will be used to investigate the influence of trench geometry on scr response by monitoring tdp relocation the blm solution will be compared with the numerical results obtained by using orcaflex software 3 perturbation of the tdp on the sloped seabed the effect of tdp relocation on both sloped clockwise foz and counter clockwise noz seabed is investigated by locally studying the static distribution of the riser angle the shear force and the curvature a numerical model was constructed in orcaflex for a typical scr pesce et al 2006 fig 4 shows the configuration of the numerical model with the main parameters given in table 2 a range of model parameters was considered to perform a sensitivity analysis and compare the results of the numerical model with the developed blm solution 3 1 effect of seabed geometry and soil stiffness the sensitivity of tdp location to different seabed slopes and soil stiffness is studied with both blm and numerical analysis inextensibility of scr in orcaflex was enforced by considering the axial stiffness as a hundred times the value of the real riser s to use inextensible clebsh love formulation love 1927 the different seabed with positive slope which represents a near shoulder noz negative slope which represents a far shoulder foz and null slope representing the ideal trench bottom were considered fig 5 shows the non dimensional results for horizontal positive and negative seabed slopes obtained with the blm analytical solution where θ χ 0 λ represents the non dimensional angle with respect to the horizontal χ χ 0 the non dimensional curvature q q λ the non dimensional shear force and η s c r χ 0 λ 2 r θ the non dimensional configuration of the scr whereas η s c r χ 0 λ 2 r θ represents the non dimensional configuration of the seabed respectively it should be taken into account that the vessel position is considered fixed for both analyzed cases positive and negative slope variations and tdp relocations are obtained locally as a pure influence of seabed due to riser flexural stiffness in tdz fig 5 shows that the non dimensional slope of the riser is matched with the non dimensional slope of the seabed for the supported part of the riser the curvature is matched with zero at tdp on the flat seabed also it had already been observed pesce et al 1998 that the typical matching length is about 4 to 5λ this means that beyond this length along the riser regardless of the seabed configuration results will merge smoothly in other words the trench geometry affects the fatigue performance of riser locally and fatigue study should be investigated somewhere around or close to the tdp in tdz within a range of circa 5λ fig 6 represents the non dimensional tdp position on the horizontal seabed s f λ and the normalized tdp position on positive and negative sloped seabeds s f λ r θ for a range of seabed soil stiffness it should be mentioned that in this figure the non dimensional tdp position on the horizontal seabed is related to the first term in eq 29 referring to the soil property in the horizontal seabed r θ 0 recovering results obtained in pesce et al 1998 when the soil is considered very rigid k 1 this term recovers the equation for infinitely rigid seabed pesce et al 1998 in this case for k k 0 25 k 0 25 2 k 0 25 1 for the sloped seabed 2 the tdp position is normalized by that on a rigid seabed for these slopes r θ 8 56 the tdp relocates towards the vessel in noz positive slope seabed and foz negative slope seabed as the soil gets softer the non dimensional results of the curvature slope and shear force distributions around the tdp obtained via blm are compared with oracflex in fig 7 to fig 9 fig 7 shows the non dimensional results of blm and oracflex on the flat seabed the obtained non dimensional real tdp location via blm in fig 5 a s f λ 1 is precise and close to the numerical result fig 7 a and d show the non dimensional slope along the riser in the tdz the peak value of the negative slope in the riser and region of the negative slope increases for softer soils due to further riser penetration fig 7 b and e show a smooth distribution of the curvature variation around tdp the softer the soil the smoother is the curvature variation as shown in fig 7 c and f the maximum shear force occurs on the suspended part of the riser near to the tdp this point further approaches the tdp as the soil stiffness increases the results of blm and finite element analysis are in excellent agreement for higher values of seabed stiffness however the agreement loses accuracy as the seabed becomes very soft this happens because of less adaptability of the elastic soil assumption on very soft soils i e s x and χ s χ x d 2 y d x 2 fig 8 compares the non dimensional results of blm and oracflex on the positive sloped seabed noz the location of non dimensional real tdp that was obtained by blm in fig 5 b s f λ 7 5 is precise and close to the numerical result as shown in fig 8 a and d the softer soil results in further riser penetration and a smoother curvature variation on the positive sloped seabed noz also the maximum shear force is still approaching the tdp on the stiffer seabed fig 9 shows the non dimensional results of blm and oracflex on the negative sloped seabed foz where the location of non dimensional real tdp obtained from blm fig 5 c s f λ 9 5 is well close to the numerical result similar trends were observed on the negative sloped seabed with a good agreement between the blm analytical solution and fea results these validation results show that the developed blm has sufficient accuracy to be used for qualitative assessment of the trench impact on fatigue and even the fatigue life assessment of the riser in early design stages however an accurate assessment of the ultimate fatigue life needs performing numerical fatigue analysis 3 2 discussion on tdp relocation on sloped seabed the non dimensional local tdp relocation obtained in eq 4 can be rewritten in terms of tdp effective tension as follow 34 s f λ 1 tan θ s b q e i t 0 1 5 eq 34 shows that in the case of creating a noz shoulder θ s b 0 the tdp relocation will be positive meaning that the tdp moves towards the vessel on the other hand for foz shoulder θ s b 0 the tdp moves to the riser s anchored end for the analytical investigation of tdp relocation the magnitude of slope in the near side noz was considered approximately two times greater than the far side foz due to the general configuration of the proposed ladle shape trenches in the literature see fig 10 fig 10 shows that the proposed mathematical trenches may include a convex point curvature and different slopes in foz and noz an analytical study was conducted to find tdp relocation s f λ trend on the created foz and noz seabed for a typical scr configuration shown in fig 4 the three pairs of slopes were considered including 0 5 1 and 1 5 clockwise for creating foz and 1 2 and 3 counter clockwise for creating noz it was assumed that the slope of noz shoulder is twice the foz one the tdp relocations for each of the created seabed were calculated using eq 34 and normalized by tdp relocation in foz the obtained results are shown in table 3 for each pair table 3 shows that the tdp relocation on foz is smaller than on noz also an increase of the seabed slope results in a significant tdp relocation which either migrates towards the vessel on noz or moves away from the vessel on foz the tdp relocation ratio of foz to noz as a function of seabed slope θ s b 0 for foz was written as follows 35 s f λ f o z s f λ n o z 1 tan θ s b q e i t 0 1 5 1 tan 2 θ s b q e i t 0 1 5 fig 11 shows the analytical trend of the tdp relocation ratio given by eq 35 versus a range of slopes the results show that the tdp relocation ratio given in eq 35 remains less than 1 for 0 θ 45 which means the tdp relocation on foz is less than tdp relocation on noz this is an interesting finding because the majority of distorted fatigue results in the literature have been reported to happen in the noz and trench mouth randolph et al 2013 sharma and aubeny 2011 these results show the significance of the methodology that is used to incorporate the trench effect in fatigue analysis simple incompatibilities between the trench profile and the riser profile in noz will result in non reliable predictions because of unwanted pressure hot spots in the trench mouth shoghi and shiri 2019 2020 3 3 discussion on tdp oscillation amplitude the tdp oscillation amplitude δ tdp under the vessel motion towards the far and near offset was performed analytically fig 12 and fig 13 show a local view of the foz and noz shoulders both sloped in clockwise and counter clockwise directions around the tdp the tdp oscillation trends were investigated on the trench shoulders by using the developed blm identical vessel motions were used to obtain the tdp oscillation amplitude in both foz and noz quasi statically without applying low frequency excursions the study was conducted in two steps first the initial tdp relocation on the trench shoulder sloped seabed was found for the near vessel offset second a tdp was set for the far vessel position on sloped shoulders the initial tdp location for far vessel excursions is assumed to be almost the same in the different sloped seabed because of its less significance the primary influence of the seabed on tdp oscillation amplitude is on the initial tdp relocation the tdp oscillation amplitude δ tdp was defined as the difference between the position of the tdp in both near and far vessel offsets as follow 36 δ tdp θ 2 s f λ θ 2 n e a r s f λ f a r 37 δ tdp θ 1 s f λ θ 1 n e a r s f λ f a r where the first and the second subscripts denote the sloped seabed and the vessel position and θ 2 θ 1 ignoring the slope effect on tdp position of the far vessel offset for noz or foz the following equation was obtained 38 δ tdp θ 2 δ tdp θ 1 s f λ θ 2 n e a r s f λ θ 1 n e a r substituting eq 34 into eq 38 and rearranging a meaningful relationship was obtained as follow 39 δ t d p θ 2 δ t d p θ 1 t 0 q λ tan θ 2 tan θ 1 a qualitative assessment of tdp oscillation amplitude on foz or noz respecting the seabed slope on each zone resulted in the following relations 40 δ t d p θ 2 δ t d p θ 1 i n f o z θ 2 θ 1 δ t d p θ 2 δ t d p θ 1 i n n o z θ 2 θ 1 eq 40 shows that the absolute value of the seabed slope on noz or foz affects the tdp oscillation amplitude in each zone eq 40 also indicates that the tdp oscillation amplitude decreases with a steeper slope in foz and increases with a steeper slope in noz which is in a perfect agreement with the findings of shoghi and shiri 2019 in other words as shown by shoghi and shiri 2019 the tdp oscillation amplitude δtdp dominates the peak average shear force and properly mimics the overall variation trend of the axial stress range δσ or the fatigue damage this will be examined in the next section through fea fatigue analysis and by reviewing a critical case study published in the literature randolph et al 2013 4 numerical fatigue analysis and the trench effect a series of finite element fatigue analysis was conducted using orcaflex the class e of dnv rp f204 material was considered to define the s n curve with the parameters m 3 log a 11 61 and a stress concentration factor scf of 1 15 since the fatigue analysis was to only observe the trends a single regular wave of 6 m high with a period of 7 s and a sufficiently large number of occurrence in a year was applied on the vessel to obtain the resultant damage the typical scr model shown in fig 4 was studied to verify the validity of analytical findings through a fatigue analysis instead of axial stress range variation δσ the rigid seabed was taken and hinge boundaries were considered at both ends of the riser at the hang off point and the anchored end the hydrodynamic coefficients of drag inertia and added mass were taken as 1 2 1 0 and 1 0 respectively three different seabed geometries were incorporated in the tdz through relocating the seabed slope around the tdp by 0 5 1 and 1 5 clockwise for creating foz and 1 2 and 3 counter clockwise for creating noz see fig 14 fig 15 shows the results of the fatigue analysis and the corresponding local seabed slopes fig 15 shows that different local seabed configurations result in a different fatigue performance for an identical wave frequency vessel motion the low frequency vessel excursion was not considered in this analysis to obtain the pure influence of the seabed on fatigue it was observed that the magnitude of the peak fatigue damage is less on foz compared to that noz the peak fatigue damage fdmax which presents the least fatigue life can be qualitatively expressed on a sloped seabed as follow 41 f d 1 f d 2 f d 3 f o r n o z s h o u l d e r f d 0 5 f d 1 f d 1 5 f o r f o z s h o u l d e r the location of the peak fatigue damage moves toward the vessel for the created local noz as a result of the positive slope of shoulders results show that the steeper seabed causes more relocation see strong solid line curve in fig 15 b which is in agreement with the analytical result in the previous section the location of the peak fatigue damage moves away from the vessel for created local foz as a result of the negative slope of the trench shoulders in the foz case the steeper seabed causes more relocation see strong solid line curve in fig 15 a fig 15 shows that the fatigue damages curves for scr on foz are narrow and the relocation is less compared with noz this is in agreement with the earlier observations see fig 11 5 re assessing of a case study in this section a previously published study that has investigated the trench effect on scr fatigue will be re assessed using the findings of the current study randolph et al 2013 randolph et al 2013 examined the effect of different trenches and various vessel oscillations including combined wf lf motions on scr fatigue see fig 16 randolph et al 2013 studied cases in the gulf of mexico gom and western australia wa and assumed linear a soil stiffness of 300 kpa for gom and 1000 kpa for wa and nonlinear seabed models for lf excursions predominant far near and cross directions were considered for re assessment the langner s mathematical trench and the stepped trench were considered the variation of seabed slope throughout the trench was extracted and shown in fig 17 fig 17 shows that the langner s trench is steeper in noz compared to the stepped seabed although the stepped seabed holds the minimum absolute value of slope throughout the trench the locally different absolute values are observed for some areas in the foz fig 17 the fatigue life results of the study are shown in fig 18 a to d for the noz and e to h for foz to facilitate the re assessment the key fatigue life data in fig 18 was extracted and shown in table 4 and table 5 also the peak damage relocations fdmax were extracted and shown in table 6 the results in table 7 show that as predicted by the blm solution developed in the current study the dominant peak damage relocation occurs in langner s trench where the slopes of the trench shoulder are steeper in both noz and foz the ratios for foz are in agreement with the absolute value of the trenches but there is a sharp increase in the damage relocation at foz for the wa case for the vessel excursion towards the near direction and compared to the flat seabed the points with the least fatigue life fdmax on noz shoulder are relocated toward the vessel on both linear and nonlinear seabed fig 18 a d also fig 18 a to d show that the maximum damage relocations for both linear and nonlinear seabed occur in the trench with the steeper shoulder in noz which belongs to the langner s trench likewise the minimum damage relocations correspond to the stepped trench which holds the minimum absolute value of slope in noz see fig 17 as expected these damage relocations correlate with the slopes of the trench shoulders in the far vessel excursions fig 18 e and h compared with the flat seabed the points with the least fatigue life fdmax on foz shoulder move away from the vessel towards the pipeline side fig 18 e and f show that the damage relocations are not significant for the soft seabed gom due to the overall similarity of the trenches in foz see fig 16 however significant damage relocations were observed in the foz under the far vessel excursion in the stiff seabed wa fig 18 g and h a closer look at the fatigue curves for langner s trench in fig 18 a d shows potential pressure hotspots in foz due to incompatibility between the trench and riser profiles the same is observed in all of the cases near the trench mouth when the vessel moves towards the near direction and the tdp moves to noz the incompatibility between the trench and riser profiles could be due to the significance of riser flexural stiffness in the tdz which has been emphasized as an important factor in this paper the unwanted pressure hotspots can exacerbate the local fatigue damage particularly for the stiff soil overall a steeper shoulder in noz compared to foz results in a larger peak damage relocation compared with the flat seabed this happens due to the differences between the absolute value of the trench slopes in noz and foz which was predicted by the developed blm solution see fig 11 the influence of the local trench slope on the magnitude of the fatigue life is interestingly observed in the results reported by randolph et al 2013 table 8 and table 9 show the normalized fatigue lives by stepped trench on different trench shoulders in near and far vessel excursions that were extracted from fig 18 it was observed that in the noz shoulder the magnitude of fatigue life is decreased for langner s trench damage has increased due to increasing the slope of noz as predicted by blm also the magnitude of fatigue life is decreased for langner s trench on foz compared with the stepped seabed a closer look at fig 17 shows that there is a change in the magnitude of the slope for inserted trenches in foz next to langner s peak the local slope of the langner s trench has decreased at fdmax which may explain the discrepancy in comparison with the stepped seabed also stress hotspots in the wa case are more significant because of the stiffer seabed compared to gom the re assessment of this case study showed that as predicted by the blm analytical solution the peak fatigue damage on the trench could be increased or decreased in both trench shoulders due to the difference of the local seabed slope which affects the tdp oscillation amplitude these findings denote the case dependence of the trench effect on fatigue and agree with the earlier study conducted by shoghi and shiri 2019 and 2020 6 conclusions the beneficial or detrimental effect of the trench on scr fatigue in the tdz is still an open question and there is no coherent agreement amongst the researchers in the literature the recently developed methodologies for assessing this problem by using the boundary layer solutions are limited to the flat seabed to examine the validity of the recent solutions in a more realistic trench with sloped shoulders a boundary layer solution was developed to account for the seabed slope and resolve the discontinuity of the scr profile on the trench the model was validated by finite element analysis and re assessing a well known case study from the literature the results supported the validity of the recently proposed analytical solutions for assessing the trench effect on riser fatigue it was observed that there is a direct relationship between the tdp oscillations on the trench with the magnitude and relocation of the peak fatigue damage of scr in the tdz the study further supported the idea that the fatigue response of scr is a case dependent problem heavily influenced by the low frequency vessel excursions and the wave directions that may have the highest contribution to the fatigue damage accumulation in any case the slopes of trench shoulders play an important role where steeper shoulder benefits fatigue life in foz and deteriorate in noz it means depending on the geographical location and the dominant direction of lf vessel excursions the trench may increase or decrease the fatigue life substituting s c 0 which represents the tdp the χ 0 c q t 0 c is obtained as curvature at the tdp

21132,this discussion is based on the paper by pang et al 2020 hereafter identified as the original authors and the original paper or the reference paper the original authors employed the endurance time analysis eta and incremental dynamic analysis ida techniques to investigate the probabilistic response of a deep water bridge in a reservoir they derived multiple fragility curves using both techniques derivation of eta based fragility functions in the original paper is not fully consistent with the nature of seismic fragility curves the underpinning concept of fragility curves is tied with ground motion record to record rtr variability while the conventional eta does not offer such an ability we discussed several underlying assumptions in the eta method as well as different sources of ground motion rtr variability from ida technique which may affect the logarithmic dispersion in a fragility curve and it is unseen in conventional eta method 1 introduction developing fragility functions is the heart of the performance based earthquake engineering pbee framework originally proposed by the pacific earthquake engineering research center peer cornell and krawinkler 2000 a fragility function essentially presents the probability of exceeding a specific damage state such as collapse given an intensity measure of a given earthquake porter 2003 developing the seismic fragility curves is computationally intensive and in fact is the main obstacle for practicing engineers in full implementation of pbee in some cases the engineers simulate the response of a real structure with a simplified numerical model which by itself introduces multiple sources of uncertainty into the estimation of seismic response this becomes more critical with respect to retrofit of existing infrastructure because of typical budget constraints to repair the existing infrastructure systems a risk based metric could enable decision makers to take more informed decisions on prioritizing mitigation funds the reference paper pang et al 2020 investigates the application of the endurance time analysis eta method estekanchi et al 2007 in nonlinear seismic assessment of bridges including the fluid structure interaction fsi among others they mainly focused on three main topics 1 general applicability of the eta method for the coupled systems with fsi 2 comparison of capacity curves hariri ardebili and saouma 2017 generated by eta and incremental dynamic analysis ida vamvatsikos and cornell 2002 methods and 3 developing seismic fragility curves this is an interesting paper with a considerable contribution in the field of seismic assessment of infrastructures however it appears that there is a misunderstanding of the eta based fragility curves that must be considered the original paper does not provide a proper comprehensive evaluation and justification on adaptation of conventional eta method with seismic fragility function derivation the discussers would like to contribute to the topic by offering the following comments and suggestions 2 applied endurance time analysis eta is a dynamic pushover procedure used to estimate the seismic performance of structures when subjected to pre designed intensifying excitation estekanchi et al 2019 these synthetic acceleration functions shake the structure from a low excitation level with a structural response intended to be in the elastic range to a medium excitation level where the structure experiences some nonlinearity and ultimately to a high excitation level causing failure hariri ardebili et al 2016d all these response ranges are experienced using a single time history analysis the key parameter in successful implementation of the eta method lies in generating a reliable endurance time excitation function etefs in general the procedure starts with creating a stationary random acceleration function fig 1 a next a series of mathematical operations are performed which include 1 converting to non stationary form 2 filtering in the frequency domain 3 adjusting to a linear form 4 optimizing in time and frequency domains and finally 5 modifying the number of effective cycles ductility and hysteresis energy content mashayekhi et al 2018 2019a the outcome of one realization is shown in fig 1 b since the initial step in etef generation is random one may technically generate optimize an infinite number of signals which have different acceleration values at different time lapses fig 1 c shows the acceleration ratio of two etef realizations in the logarithmic scale having an etef one can generate an eta function and the corresponding capacity function as follows develop the numerical model and apply the etef record the time history of the engineering demand parameter edp of interest e g displacement compute the maximum value of the absolute edp at τ for any time interval 0 t using eq 1 the outcome of this step is a step wise increasing function 1 ω edp t max abs edp τ τ 0 t smooth the eta function for any practical purpose because an etef has a stochastic nature this curve is called the eta function hariri ardebili et al 2016a and is presented in the edp time domain adjust the edp time coordinate system to make it time edp in this way the independent variable i e time is on vertical axis analogous to an ida curve convert the time parameter to its equivalent intensity measure im parameter to obtain the so called capacity curve hariri ardebili and saouma 2017 the most straightforward im parameter is peak ground acceleration pga that can be obtained directly as 2 ω pga t max abs u g τ τ 0 t fig 1 d compares ω pga t of three etefs from e series the linear relationship between peak acceleration and time is intuitive moreover fig 1 e compares the ratio of three time dependent ω pga t neglecting the initial spike the ratio of three etefs varies between 0 8 to 1 2 this shows consistency of etefs over time for more efficient im parameters vamvatsikos and cornell 2005 one may establish a relation among time t period t and an im parameter fig 2 a shows for example such a relationship between spectral acceleration s a t with t and t the time parameter t can be further converted to its equivalent pga and presented in a vector im form see fig 2 b although this procedure is applicable only with single etef in order to reduce the uncertainty due to the random nature of the initial white noise typically a mean of three etefs is used li et al 2019 3 fragility function derivation in the context of the peer pbee approach and according to the total probability theorem the mean annual frequency of exceedance of a decision variable dv is baker and cornell 2008 der kiureghian 2005 3 λ dv d v d m e d p i m p dv d v dm d m d p dm d m edp e d p d p edp e d p im i m d λ im i m where p x x y y denotes the conditional complementary cumulative distribution function ccdf of random variable x given y y therefore the conditional probability p edp e d p im i m is called fragility or demand fragility mackie and stojadinovic 2005a a fragility function is capable of quantifying the uncertainties in 1 ground motion record to record rtr variability 2 material uncertainties and 3 modeling assumptions in this discussion we focus only on ground motion rtr variability variability in ground motion records is usually addressed using one of the following three methods 1 ida 2 multiple stripe analysis and 3 cloud analysis mackie and stojadinovic 2005b among those three the ida is widely used because it adapts a relatively small set of ground motions compared to cloud analysis in ida a total of n capacity curves are constructed for n scaled ground motions the source of dispersion among these curves is due to the aleatory nature of ground motion rtr variability fig 3 a illustrates a typical multi record ida function which is developed on a simple cantilever reinforced concrete rc column the outcome of ida is presented as 1 16 50 median and 84 fractile curves and 2 the corresponding fragility curve when it comes to the fragility curve dispersion among the individual curves need to be quantified it is well accepted that a log normal distribution can be fitted to the response quantities either in the form of im edp the red curve in fig 3 a or edp im the blue curve in fig 3 a bakalis and vamvatsikos 2018 such a simplified method needs a logarithmic mean η and a standard deviation β both these quantities can be easily obtained from post processing the ida method baker 2015 on the other hand several researchers compared the average mean of three etefs with the median of ida method results hariri ardebili et al 2014b a rahimi and estekanchi 2015 tafakori et al 2017 guo et al 2017 bai et al 2018 2019 avanaki et al 2020 mirfarhadi and estekanchi 2020 and nearly in all cases they reported a good agreement therefore the eta method provides a reliable η over various im edp values however the conventional eta method is not capable of providing ground motion rtr variability β there are multiple concerns in estimating β based on eta and developing a fragility function we will address them as follows note that the third one is adopted in the reference paper 3 1 scaling etefs scaling etefs either in time or acceleration may leads to capacity curve to curve variation however the resulted dispersion is not due to ground motion rtr variability acceleration scaling in fig 3 b a sample etef i e eta20e02 is linearly scaled in acceleration by multiplying u g in a scale factor λ sf im 0 5 3 0 the resulted scaled etefs are then applied to a rc cantilever column and the capacity curves are developed as seen there is a considerable dispersion hereafter it is called β among the capacity curves the nature of conventional rtr dispersion β is different from scaling induced dispersion β in fact acceleration scaling of an etef is not a right approach because its time variant pga ω pga t increases linearly by time fig 1 d let us assume an sample etef u e 1 see fig 1 b the value of ω pga t 5 s see eq 2 is about 0 34 g therefore the projected value of ω pga t 10 s should be twice i e 0 68 g the exact value is 0 66 g this is an underlying assumption in generation of etefs in which their time variant acceleration increases with a linear profile ω pga t t t 0 ω pga t 0 hariri ardebili et al 2016a moreover let us assume that the structural responses ω edp t see eq 1 are δ 5 and δ 10 for our hypothetical system at time 5 and 10 se respectively now assume that a scale factor λ sf im 2 is applied to this etef the value of the ω pga t 5 s will be then 2 0 34 0 68 g in this scaled etef and the value of ω edp t 5 s will be δ 10 ε the parameter ε is controlled by the number of effective cycles down scaling an etef increases the number of effective cycles to reach a target intensity and vice versa for a structural system with a constitutive model insensitive to the number of cycles in the applied load the value of ε 0 while it is crucial for brittle materials hariri ardebili 2020 for the case study in fig 3 b i e an rc column with concrete tensile strength model and linear tension softening the ε causes a large curve to curve variation time scaling in fig 3 c a same experiment is implemented however the time parameter of the sample etef i e eta40e01 is scaled using λ sf t 0 3 3 0 again the nature of the resulting dispersion β which is identical to β is different from ground motion rtr variability β a sample of such a scaling method can be found in tavazo and ranjbaran 2017 in which the following procedure is followed to scale the etefs three etefs pairs are selected for each pair the srss of two horizontal spectra is computed it is not clear at which time as etef s response spectrum is time dependent for each of n ground motion records from reference ida ground motion set an etef s srss response spectrum is randomly assigned from three available ones the selected etef s response spectrum is then scaled to be higher than the target ground motions srss response spectrum over the period range 0 2 t n 1 5 t n finally a total of n scaled etefs are used for dynamic analysis which may result in a misleading dispersion 3 2 multiple etefs one may use a total of n etefs more than 3 and calculate the dispersion among those curves according to estekanchi 2020 there exists over 10 series of different etefs each one includes three excitation functions using all or subset of those etefs to excite a structure may lead to a curve to curve variability β which is again different from ground motion rtr variability β fig 3 d illustrates variability in 30 etefs all applied to the same rc cantilever column the associated variability β is only due to variability in different techniques to generate various etef generations and it does not reflect the conventional rtr variability this figure also shows dependency of a numerical model to etef and the sensitivity in the selection of proper etef 3 3 generic dispersion as already stated the eta provides an acceptable estimate of η with reference to ida method to be used in generating a fragility function since ida may lead to the response bias when using a large scaling factor this may happen for the eta too in some of the previous studies rahimi and estekanchi 2015 basim and estekanchi 2015 mirfarhadi and estekanchi 2020 as well as the reference paper pang et al 2020 a fixed value for dispersion β is used basically claimed to be a codified value discussers believe that using a deterministic dispersion value might be misleading to generate an eta based fragility function for the following reasons existing literature such as that published in federal emergency management agency fema p695 provide a general recommendation for rtr variability dispersion in some specific type of structures and conditions according to fema p695 β r t r 0 35 0 45 is fairly consistent among various building types the dependency of rtr variability dispersion and the ductility μ t for reinforced concrete frames from collapse data is shown in fig 3 e results are presented for both ordinary moment frames omf and special moment frames smf a simplified relationship found in fema p695 for systems that have little or no period elongation is fema p695 2009 4 β r t r 0 1 0 1 μ t 0 4 where β r t r must be greater than or equal to 0 2 as opposed to fixed based buildings i e 4 there is no significant correlation between β r t r and μ t for seismically isolated structures shao and mahin 2020 figs 3 f and 3 g illustrate the ida based and eta based fragility curves presented in the reference paper pang et al 2020 as well as the uncertainty quantification uq in eta based curves by discussers using the β range of 0 35 0 45 proposed by fema p695 while the original authors claimed to use a dispersion of 0 40 for all fragility curves due to the reason that the eta underestimates the record to record variability an approximate recommended fragility dispersion 0 4 was used for the generation of fragility curves according the existing literature digitizing fig 9 of the reference paper it reveals that a eta based fragility for a complete damage state ds has a higher dispersion of 0 48 the rtr variability β is indirectly affected by the modeling uncertainty for an example shao and mahin 2020 reported a dependency between β r t r in an isolator design to its strength and post yield period different combinations of strength and post yield period generates dispersion β r t r 0 1 0 35 the cumulative frequency of β r t r is shown in fig 3 h thus using a generic β is not recommended for eta based fragility curves the rtr variability β also depends on the structure type a same ground motion set will lead to different scalar or vectorized β values in steel bojórquez et al 2012 and rc framed structures with and without infill panels sattar 2013 shear wall buildings shafei et al 2011 bridge piers choi et al 2004 2d gravity dams hariri ardebili and saouma 2016b 3d gravity dams sevieri et al 2020 arch dams gasser et al 2019 embankment dams pang et al 2018 nuclear power plants jin and gong 2020 and jacket type offshore platforms abyani et al 2019 therefore the authors are encouraged to use the results of similar studies i e similar structural archetype and similar damage state for the new case study the rtr variability β depends also on the ground motion suite and the number of records azarbakht and dolšek 2007 kiani et al 2018 for example kiani et al 2018 developed a series of fragility curves for an eight story steel frame they used eight different sets of ground motions with 7 10 15 20 25 30 40 and 100 records the resulted fragility curves using the sum of squared error method are digitized and re plotted in fig 3 i while they present a considerable variability among themselves it demonstrates that one cannot compare the eta based fragility curve with ida because this comparison may yields to a good or bad result with no justification in a separate research uribe et al 2019 studied the impact of ground motion selection techniques on response variability of steel moment frame building this implies that the resulted fragility curves also might be different the codified constant β is usually recommended to be used for generating a collapse fragility curve in the case that fragility functions should be derived for other dss one should use a variable β values for example fig 3 j shows the variation of β r t r as a function of θ m a x for steel moment resisting frames curves are presented only for four and nine story 4s and 9s 2d frames in the case of the 9s frame plasticity is considered only for beam bp only for column cp and both bcp as seen there is a considerable variation in β r t r values and thus one cannot adopt a constant value for all the dss the original authors in the reference paper claimed to use constant dispersion for four different dss the codified constant β and also the dispersion value from the literature is usually recommended for the fragility functions which are constructed based on the first mode spectral acceleration s a t 1 this is one of the optimal im parameters in seismic performance assessment of majority of structures padgett et al 2008 hariri ardebili and saouma 2016c however one should notice that the β value highly depends on choice of im therefore if the fragility curves are developed on an im different from s a t 1 an appropriate dispersion value should be used which is specific to this new im hariri ardebili et al 2014a fig 3 k shows the rtr dispersion in acceleration based im parameters only for the collapse ds obtained for a gravity dam as seen depending on the choice of im the collapse level dispersion takes a wide range of 0 08 0 45 finally the value of β also depends on the selected edp while in majority of cases displacement based edp e g θ m a x is used in framed structures floor acceleration can be also used as a demand parameter to quantify rtr dispersion zhang and he 2019 4 probabilistic etefs so far the options in section 3 i e conventional eta method fail to provide a probabilistic response prediction mashayekhi et al 2019b proposed a probabilistic etef method which indirectly accounts for various ordinates of response prediction in this method a new series of etefs should be generated for the considered mean response spectra of real ground motions while the average of scaled ground motions response spectra is assumed to be median i e 50 spectrum the 16 and 84 spectra or any other exceedance probability are also generated fig 3 l these spectra are then used to generate the new etefs during the optimization process of etef the target spectra are modified as mashayekhi et al 2019b 5 s a p t a r g e t t exp φ 1 1 p σ ln s a t μ ln s a t s u p t a r g e t t exp φ 1 1 p σ ln s u t μ ln s u t where φ is cumulative normal distribution p denotes the exceedance probability of p and μ and σ are the median and the standard deviation operators respectively again three etefs are generated for each of response spectrum and are applied to the structure the capacity curves are developed for each of spectral ordinates having the eta based estimated 16 50 and 84 capacity curves the dispersion can be estimated as to be used in generating the fragility function vamvatsikos and fragiadakis 2010 6 β r t r 1 2 ln s a 84 ln s a 16 where s a 84 and s a 16 are the 84 and 16 values of s a t 1 5 capacity while this new technique accounts for the probabilistic nature of the fragility curves it preserves the efficiency of the eta method yet it adds another step of generating the new etefs and it may not be possible to use a series of generic etefs for different structures 5 final recommendation one of the original author s main intention is to develop eta based fragility curves for various damage states and compare it with ida method discussers briefly explained the fundamental assumptions of the conventional eta method and its limitations to be applied in ground motion uncertainty quantification and seismic fragility function derivation discussers collected a series of non constant dispersion values for different structural systems and damage states discussers believe that the comparison of conventional eta based constant β fragility curves with those from ida is very approximate and depends on many factors which may yield a good or bad comparison discussers recommend to use an uncertainty region for the conventional eta based fragility function and not a single curve to emphasize on the epistemic uncertainty in derivation of eta based fragility curves moreover it is important to note that practitioners should not adopt and use the conventional eta based fragility curves for advance analyses unless they understand all aspects of the available uncertainties and address them in their calculations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
21132,this discussion is based on the paper by pang et al 2020 hereafter identified as the original authors and the original paper or the reference paper the original authors employed the endurance time analysis eta and incremental dynamic analysis ida techniques to investigate the probabilistic response of a deep water bridge in a reservoir they derived multiple fragility curves using both techniques derivation of eta based fragility functions in the original paper is not fully consistent with the nature of seismic fragility curves the underpinning concept of fragility curves is tied with ground motion record to record rtr variability while the conventional eta does not offer such an ability we discussed several underlying assumptions in the eta method as well as different sources of ground motion rtr variability from ida technique which may affect the logarithmic dispersion in a fragility curve and it is unseen in conventional eta method 1 introduction developing fragility functions is the heart of the performance based earthquake engineering pbee framework originally proposed by the pacific earthquake engineering research center peer cornell and krawinkler 2000 a fragility function essentially presents the probability of exceeding a specific damage state such as collapse given an intensity measure of a given earthquake porter 2003 developing the seismic fragility curves is computationally intensive and in fact is the main obstacle for practicing engineers in full implementation of pbee in some cases the engineers simulate the response of a real structure with a simplified numerical model which by itself introduces multiple sources of uncertainty into the estimation of seismic response this becomes more critical with respect to retrofit of existing infrastructure because of typical budget constraints to repair the existing infrastructure systems a risk based metric could enable decision makers to take more informed decisions on prioritizing mitigation funds the reference paper pang et al 2020 investigates the application of the endurance time analysis eta method estekanchi et al 2007 in nonlinear seismic assessment of bridges including the fluid structure interaction fsi among others they mainly focused on three main topics 1 general applicability of the eta method for the coupled systems with fsi 2 comparison of capacity curves hariri ardebili and saouma 2017 generated by eta and incremental dynamic analysis ida vamvatsikos and cornell 2002 methods and 3 developing seismic fragility curves this is an interesting paper with a considerable contribution in the field of seismic assessment of infrastructures however it appears that there is a misunderstanding of the eta based fragility curves that must be considered the original paper does not provide a proper comprehensive evaluation and justification on adaptation of conventional eta method with seismic fragility function derivation the discussers would like to contribute to the topic by offering the following comments and suggestions 2 applied endurance time analysis eta is a dynamic pushover procedure used to estimate the seismic performance of structures when subjected to pre designed intensifying excitation estekanchi et al 2019 these synthetic acceleration functions shake the structure from a low excitation level with a structural response intended to be in the elastic range to a medium excitation level where the structure experiences some nonlinearity and ultimately to a high excitation level causing failure hariri ardebili et al 2016d all these response ranges are experienced using a single time history analysis the key parameter in successful implementation of the eta method lies in generating a reliable endurance time excitation function etefs in general the procedure starts with creating a stationary random acceleration function fig 1 a next a series of mathematical operations are performed which include 1 converting to non stationary form 2 filtering in the frequency domain 3 adjusting to a linear form 4 optimizing in time and frequency domains and finally 5 modifying the number of effective cycles ductility and hysteresis energy content mashayekhi et al 2018 2019a the outcome of one realization is shown in fig 1 b since the initial step in etef generation is random one may technically generate optimize an infinite number of signals which have different acceleration values at different time lapses fig 1 c shows the acceleration ratio of two etef realizations in the logarithmic scale having an etef one can generate an eta function and the corresponding capacity function as follows develop the numerical model and apply the etef record the time history of the engineering demand parameter edp of interest e g displacement compute the maximum value of the absolute edp at τ for any time interval 0 t using eq 1 the outcome of this step is a step wise increasing function 1 ω edp t max abs edp τ τ 0 t smooth the eta function for any practical purpose because an etef has a stochastic nature this curve is called the eta function hariri ardebili et al 2016a and is presented in the edp time domain adjust the edp time coordinate system to make it time edp in this way the independent variable i e time is on vertical axis analogous to an ida curve convert the time parameter to its equivalent intensity measure im parameter to obtain the so called capacity curve hariri ardebili and saouma 2017 the most straightforward im parameter is peak ground acceleration pga that can be obtained directly as 2 ω pga t max abs u g τ τ 0 t fig 1 d compares ω pga t of three etefs from e series the linear relationship between peak acceleration and time is intuitive moreover fig 1 e compares the ratio of three time dependent ω pga t neglecting the initial spike the ratio of three etefs varies between 0 8 to 1 2 this shows consistency of etefs over time for more efficient im parameters vamvatsikos and cornell 2005 one may establish a relation among time t period t and an im parameter fig 2 a shows for example such a relationship between spectral acceleration s a t with t and t the time parameter t can be further converted to its equivalent pga and presented in a vector im form see fig 2 b although this procedure is applicable only with single etef in order to reduce the uncertainty due to the random nature of the initial white noise typically a mean of three etefs is used li et al 2019 3 fragility function derivation in the context of the peer pbee approach and according to the total probability theorem the mean annual frequency of exceedance of a decision variable dv is baker and cornell 2008 der kiureghian 2005 3 λ dv d v d m e d p i m p dv d v dm d m d p dm d m edp e d p d p edp e d p im i m d λ im i m where p x x y y denotes the conditional complementary cumulative distribution function ccdf of random variable x given y y therefore the conditional probability p edp e d p im i m is called fragility or demand fragility mackie and stojadinovic 2005a a fragility function is capable of quantifying the uncertainties in 1 ground motion record to record rtr variability 2 material uncertainties and 3 modeling assumptions in this discussion we focus only on ground motion rtr variability variability in ground motion records is usually addressed using one of the following three methods 1 ida 2 multiple stripe analysis and 3 cloud analysis mackie and stojadinovic 2005b among those three the ida is widely used because it adapts a relatively small set of ground motions compared to cloud analysis in ida a total of n capacity curves are constructed for n scaled ground motions the source of dispersion among these curves is due to the aleatory nature of ground motion rtr variability fig 3 a illustrates a typical multi record ida function which is developed on a simple cantilever reinforced concrete rc column the outcome of ida is presented as 1 16 50 median and 84 fractile curves and 2 the corresponding fragility curve when it comes to the fragility curve dispersion among the individual curves need to be quantified it is well accepted that a log normal distribution can be fitted to the response quantities either in the form of im edp the red curve in fig 3 a or edp im the blue curve in fig 3 a bakalis and vamvatsikos 2018 such a simplified method needs a logarithmic mean η and a standard deviation β both these quantities can be easily obtained from post processing the ida method baker 2015 on the other hand several researchers compared the average mean of three etefs with the median of ida method results hariri ardebili et al 2014b a rahimi and estekanchi 2015 tafakori et al 2017 guo et al 2017 bai et al 2018 2019 avanaki et al 2020 mirfarhadi and estekanchi 2020 and nearly in all cases they reported a good agreement therefore the eta method provides a reliable η over various im edp values however the conventional eta method is not capable of providing ground motion rtr variability β there are multiple concerns in estimating β based on eta and developing a fragility function we will address them as follows note that the third one is adopted in the reference paper 3 1 scaling etefs scaling etefs either in time or acceleration may leads to capacity curve to curve variation however the resulted dispersion is not due to ground motion rtr variability acceleration scaling in fig 3 b a sample etef i e eta20e02 is linearly scaled in acceleration by multiplying u g in a scale factor λ sf im 0 5 3 0 the resulted scaled etefs are then applied to a rc cantilever column and the capacity curves are developed as seen there is a considerable dispersion hereafter it is called β among the capacity curves the nature of conventional rtr dispersion β is different from scaling induced dispersion β in fact acceleration scaling of an etef is not a right approach because its time variant pga ω pga t increases linearly by time fig 1 d let us assume an sample etef u e 1 see fig 1 b the value of ω pga t 5 s see eq 2 is about 0 34 g therefore the projected value of ω pga t 10 s should be twice i e 0 68 g the exact value is 0 66 g this is an underlying assumption in generation of etefs in which their time variant acceleration increases with a linear profile ω pga t t t 0 ω pga t 0 hariri ardebili et al 2016a moreover let us assume that the structural responses ω edp t see eq 1 are δ 5 and δ 10 for our hypothetical system at time 5 and 10 se respectively now assume that a scale factor λ sf im 2 is applied to this etef the value of the ω pga t 5 s will be then 2 0 34 0 68 g in this scaled etef and the value of ω edp t 5 s will be δ 10 ε the parameter ε is controlled by the number of effective cycles down scaling an etef increases the number of effective cycles to reach a target intensity and vice versa for a structural system with a constitutive model insensitive to the number of cycles in the applied load the value of ε 0 while it is crucial for brittle materials hariri ardebili 2020 for the case study in fig 3 b i e an rc column with concrete tensile strength model and linear tension softening the ε causes a large curve to curve variation time scaling in fig 3 c a same experiment is implemented however the time parameter of the sample etef i e eta40e01 is scaled using λ sf t 0 3 3 0 again the nature of the resulting dispersion β which is identical to β is different from ground motion rtr variability β a sample of such a scaling method can be found in tavazo and ranjbaran 2017 in which the following procedure is followed to scale the etefs three etefs pairs are selected for each pair the srss of two horizontal spectra is computed it is not clear at which time as etef s response spectrum is time dependent for each of n ground motion records from reference ida ground motion set an etef s srss response spectrum is randomly assigned from three available ones the selected etef s response spectrum is then scaled to be higher than the target ground motions srss response spectrum over the period range 0 2 t n 1 5 t n finally a total of n scaled etefs are used for dynamic analysis which may result in a misleading dispersion 3 2 multiple etefs one may use a total of n etefs more than 3 and calculate the dispersion among those curves according to estekanchi 2020 there exists over 10 series of different etefs each one includes three excitation functions using all or subset of those etefs to excite a structure may lead to a curve to curve variability β which is again different from ground motion rtr variability β fig 3 d illustrates variability in 30 etefs all applied to the same rc cantilever column the associated variability β is only due to variability in different techniques to generate various etef generations and it does not reflect the conventional rtr variability this figure also shows dependency of a numerical model to etef and the sensitivity in the selection of proper etef 3 3 generic dispersion as already stated the eta provides an acceptable estimate of η with reference to ida method to be used in generating a fragility function since ida may lead to the response bias when using a large scaling factor this may happen for the eta too in some of the previous studies rahimi and estekanchi 2015 basim and estekanchi 2015 mirfarhadi and estekanchi 2020 as well as the reference paper pang et al 2020 a fixed value for dispersion β is used basically claimed to be a codified value discussers believe that using a deterministic dispersion value might be misleading to generate an eta based fragility function for the following reasons existing literature such as that published in federal emergency management agency fema p695 provide a general recommendation for rtr variability dispersion in some specific type of structures and conditions according to fema p695 β r t r 0 35 0 45 is fairly consistent among various building types the dependency of rtr variability dispersion and the ductility μ t for reinforced concrete frames from collapse data is shown in fig 3 e results are presented for both ordinary moment frames omf and special moment frames smf a simplified relationship found in fema p695 for systems that have little or no period elongation is fema p695 2009 4 β r t r 0 1 0 1 μ t 0 4 where β r t r must be greater than or equal to 0 2 as opposed to fixed based buildings i e 4 there is no significant correlation between β r t r and μ t for seismically isolated structures shao and mahin 2020 figs 3 f and 3 g illustrate the ida based and eta based fragility curves presented in the reference paper pang et al 2020 as well as the uncertainty quantification uq in eta based curves by discussers using the β range of 0 35 0 45 proposed by fema p695 while the original authors claimed to use a dispersion of 0 40 for all fragility curves due to the reason that the eta underestimates the record to record variability an approximate recommended fragility dispersion 0 4 was used for the generation of fragility curves according the existing literature digitizing fig 9 of the reference paper it reveals that a eta based fragility for a complete damage state ds has a higher dispersion of 0 48 the rtr variability β is indirectly affected by the modeling uncertainty for an example shao and mahin 2020 reported a dependency between β r t r in an isolator design to its strength and post yield period different combinations of strength and post yield period generates dispersion β r t r 0 1 0 35 the cumulative frequency of β r t r is shown in fig 3 h thus using a generic β is not recommended for eta based fragility curves the rtr variability β also depends on the structure type a same ground motion set will lead to different scalar or vectorized β values in steel bojórquez et al 2012 and rc framed structures with and without infill panels sattar 2013 shear wall buildings shafei et al 2011 bridge piers choi et al 2004 2d gravity dams hariri ardebili and saouma 2016b 3d gravity dams sevieri et al 2020 arch dams gasser et al 2019 embankment dams pang et al 2018 nuclear power plants jin and gong 2020 and jacket type offshore platforms abyani et al 2019 therefore the authors are encouraged to use the results of similar studies i e similar structural archetype and similar damage state for the new case study the rtr variability β depends also on the ground motion suite and the number of records azarbakht and dolšek 2007 kiani et al 2018 for example kiani et al 2018 developed a

ida because this comparison may yields to a good or bad result with no justification in a separate research uribe et al 2019 studied the impact of ground motion selection techniques on response variability of steel moment frame building this implies that the resulted fragility curves also might be different the codified constant β is usually recommended to be used for generating a collapse fragility curve in the case that fragility functions should be derived for other dss one should use a variable β values for example fig 3 j shows the variation of β r t r as a function of θ m a x for steel moment resisting frames curves are presented only for four and nine story 4s and 9s 2d frames in the case of the 9s frame plasticity is considered only for beam bp only for column cp and both bcp as seen there is a considerable variation in β r t r values and thus one cannot adopt a constant value for all the dss the original authors in the reference paper claimed to use constant dispersion for four different dss the codified constant β and also the dispersion value from the literature is usually recommended for the fragility functions which are constructed based on the first mode spectral acceleration s a t 1 this is one of the optimal im parameters in seismic performance assessment of majority of structures padgett et al 2008 hariri ardebili and saouma 2016c however one should notice that the β value highly depends on choice of im therefore if the fragility curves are developed on an im different from s a t 1 an appropriate dispersion value should be used which is specific to this new im hariri ardebili et al 2014a fig 3 k shows the rtr dispersion in acceleration based im parameters only for the collapse ds obtained for a gravity dam as seen depending on the choice of im the collapse level dispersion takes a wide range of 0 08 0 45 finally the value of β also depends on the selected edp while in majority of cases displacement based edp e g θ m a x is used in framed structures floor acceleration can be also used as a demand parameter to quantify rtr dispersion zhang and he 2019 4 probabilistic etefs so far the options in section 3 i e conventional eta method fail to provide a probabilistic response prediction mashayekhi et al 2019b proposed a probabilistic etef method which indirectly accounts for various ordinates of response prediction in this method a new series of etefs should be generated for the considered mean response spectra of real ground motions while the average of scaled ground motions response spectra is assumed to be median i e 50 spectrum the 16 and 84 spectra or any other exceedance probability are also generated fig 3 l these spectra are then used to generate the new etefs during the optimization process of etef the target spectra are modified as mashayekhi et al 2019b 5 s a p t a r g e t t exp φ 1 1 p σ ln s a t μ ln s a t s u p t a r g e t t exp φ 1 1 p σ ln s u t μ ln s u t where φ is cumulative normal distribution p denotes the exceedance probability of p and μ and σ are the median and the standard deviation operators respectively again three etefs are generated for each of response spectrum and are applied to the structure the capacity curves are developed for each of spectral ordinates having the eta based estimated 16 50 and 84 capacity curves the dispersion can be estimated as to be used in generating the fragility function vamvatsikos and fragiadakis 2010 6 β r t r 1 2 ln s a 84 ln s a 16 where s a 84 and s a 16 are the 84 and 16 values of s a t 1 5 capacity while this new technique accounts for the probabilistic nature of the fragility curves it preserves the efficiency of the eta method yet it adds another step of generating the new etefs and it may not be possible to use a series of generic etefs for different structures 5 final recommendation one of the original author s main intention is to develop eta based fragility curves for various damage states and compare it with ida method discussers briefly explained the fundamental assumptions of the conventional eta method and its limitations to be applied in ground motion uncertainty quantification and seismic fragility function derivation discussers collected a series of non constant dispersion values for different structural systems and damage states discussers believe that the comparison of conventional eta based constant β fragility curves with those from ida is very approximate and depends on many factors which may yield a good or bad comparison discussers recommend to use an uncertainty region for the conventional eta based fragility function and not a single curve to emphasize on the epistemic uncertainty in derivation of eta based fragility curves moreover it is important to note that

21133,discussers hariri ardebili and sattar address the paper seismic assessment of deep water bridges in reservoir considering hydrodynamic effects using endurance time analysis written by the coauthors of this response they present the fundamental assumptions on the generation of endurance time excitation functions etefs and the derivation of fragility functions by endurance time analysis eta since the fragility functions of bridge piers derived in the discussed paper are based on a deterministic fragility dispersion ζ discussers criticize that the record to record variability β r t r of ground motions and fragility dispersion ζ cannot be captured by eta which can be affected by many factors e g damage states intensity measures ims and levels of engineering demand parameters edps and consequently consider it inappropriate for deriving the fragility curves by assuming a constant ζ the discussers also provide a probabilistic etef approach to estimate the β r t r coauthors appreciate the discussions on the determination of the fragility dispersion ζ for eta based fragility analysis and welcome the new approach to estimate fragility dispersions for eta but disagree with the discussers characterization of fragility dispersions and consider that it is appropriate to develop the eta based fragility curves by assuming a constant ζ for a specified type of structures as presented in the discussed paper 1 summary of the discussion by hariri ardebili and sattar 2020 the discussion by hariri ardebili and sattar 2020 presents the fundamental assumptions for generation of endurance time excitation functions etefs and the derivation of fragility functions by endurance time analysis eta they found that both scaling and multiple etefs yield unreliable estimates of β r t r when compared to ida results they also collect a series of the dispersion β r t r of seismic demands due to the record to record variability and fragility dispersion ζ from previous studies they believe that the fragility dispersion ζ depends on many factors which cannot be considered as a constant value as presented in the discussed paper pang et al 2020 the main statements are summarized as following 1 discussers state that it is inappropriate to derive the eta based fragility curves by assuming a constant dispersion ζ across different damage states since they observed that the β r t r has a considerable variation across different levels of engineering demand parameters edps they also claim that a constant value of fragility dispersion ζ should be recommended for collapse fragility curves however if the fragility curves should be derived for other damage states one should use variable values of ζ 2 discussers state that the fragility dispersion ζ highly depends on the choice of intensity measures ims since the β r t r varies significantly across different ims such as asi i a and a rms in figure 3 of the discussion usually the eta based fragility functions should be developed based on the spectral acceleration at the fundamental period s a t 1 which is an optimal im for the majority of structures so if other ims are adopted in eta for developing fragility curves different dispersion values should be used for different ims discussers also state that dispersion ζ depends on the selected edp 3 discussers state that the value of the dispersion β r t r is significantly affected by different ground motion suites the number of records modeling uncertainty and structural types they recommend to use the uncertainty region to emphasize on the epistemic uncertainty in derivation of eta based fragility curves they further state that a new probabilistic etef method proposed by mashayekhi et al 2019 can be used to estimate the β r t r 2 response of the coauthors the discussed paper is focused at investigating the potential and effectiveness of eta for estimating the seismic induced hydrodynamic effect of highway bridges which do not intend to give the eta based fragility analysis for structures however coauthors appreciate the discussion presented by discussers hariri ardebili and sattar on the determination of the fragility dispersion ζ for eta since this is a major problem which will be encountered when eta is employed for seismic performance evaluation of structures under performance based earthquake engineering pbee framework since the discussers do not distinguish β rtr and ζ strictly in their discussion the coauthors want to distinguish between them in order to make this response clearly under the assumption of the log normal distribution cornell et al 2002 the fragility function can be expressed as follows 1 p f d s im i m φ ln μ d μ c β c 2 β r t r 2 φ ln i m ln m ς where p f ds im im conditional fragility probability at a im level of im for a damage state ds φ is the cumulative distribution function of standard normal distribution μ d median value μ d of seismic demands μ c capacity median β c capacity dispersion m fragility median it can be observed in eq 1 that the dispersion β r t r is not the fragility dispersion ζ by using the cloud analysis as an example the relationship between β rtr and ζ can be obtained based on the edp im relationship μ d a im b a and b regression coefficients jalayer et al 2017 as 2 ς β c 2 β r t r 2 b it can be seen from eq 2 that the fragility dispersion ζ is not directly related with β rtr thus coauthors consider it inappropriate to use the variation of β rtr by the discussers in majority of statements to criticize the choice of the fragility dispersion ζ in the discussed paper by assuming that the discussers mean the fragility dispersion ζ when the β rtr is mentioned the coauthors respond to the previously summarized statements of the discussion as following 1 with all due respect the coauthors disagree with the statements by the discussers that it is inappropriate to derive eta based fragility curves by assuming a constant ζ across different damage states the constant ζ across different damage states are widely used in cloud analysis when the capacity dispersion β c is not taken into account as shown in eq 2 since cloud analysis has long been recognized as an efficient and accuracy for developing the fragility curves zhang and huo 2009 jalayer et al 2017 the coauthors think it suitable to use a fixed ζ for different damage states to develop eta based fragility curves the constant ζ may be due to the reason that the variation of ζ for the optimal edp is usually stable before the collapse of structures jalayer et al 2017 however after the collapse the structure goes into the dynamic instability which can cause considerable variation in β rtr and b due to the collapse data jalayer et al 2017 thus changing the value of ζ significantly note that the complete damage state in the discussed paper is derived according to the previous studies priestley et al 1996 muntasir billah and alam 2015 which is a near collapse damage state other than the actual collapse damage additionally fixed fragility dispersions are usually used in seismic fragility analysis of bridges to avoid intersection between fragility curves in the existing literature shinozuka et al 2000 alipour et al 2011 vishwanath and banerjee 2019 thus we think that it is proper to use a fixed dispersion across different damage states for deriving fragility curves in the discussed paper and it is inappropriate to assume a constant ζ for the collapse fragility analysis 2 the coauthors disagree with the statement by the discussers that the fragility dispersion ζ depends on the selected im in the fragility analysis the optimal im e g spectral acceleration at the fundamental period s a t 1 in the discussed paper is usually recommended in order to establish the efficient edp im models mackie and stojadinovic 2004 if the optimal im is used for fragility analysis of bridges the fragility dispersion ζ should be insensitive to the optimal ims this is because the fragility dispersion ζ is usually served as a primary factor in the selection process for an optimal im padgett et al 2008 for example in the study wang et al 2018 fragility dispersions for the five optimal ims hi s a 2s pgv cav and cav 5 have similar values around 0 5 similarly it can be also found in the study padgett et al 2008 that fragility dispersions for four widely used optimal ims pgv s a 02s s a 1s and s a gm ranges between 0 45 and 0 50 if a non optimal im is adopted in the fragility analysis the dispersion ζ can be extremely large as shown in the study padgett et al 2008 three ims i a i v and cad produce the fragility dispersion of 0 72 1 0 and 0 96 respectively furthermore coauthors disagree with the statement that the value of dispersion ζ depends on the selected edp since different edps e g the base curvature of pier and drift ratio of top pier of the bridge pier are highly correlated they should produce similar fragility dispersions which can be evident from the existing literature padgett et al 2008 wang et al 2018 note that in the fragility analysis the selected edp should also be an optimal edps wang et al 2019 which is highly related with the structural damage in the seismic loadings 3 coauthors argue that the dispersion ζ is not significantly affected by the number of records the effect of the number of records comes from the uncertainty of fragility estimates which is usually described by confidence intervals confidence intervals of the fragility probability p f i m at a given intensity level im can be estimated by the wald confidence intervals given as follows 3 p l b p u b p f i m χ α 2 p f i m 1 p f i m n where n number of ground motions χ α 2 1 α 2 quantile of the standard normal distribution p l b and p u b lower and upper bound of the wald confidence intervals it is illustrated from eq 3 that significant uncertainty exists in the fragility curves when using a small number of ground motion records which may lead to a relatively large errors thus when using a large number of ground motions in fragility analysis reliable fragility estimates can yield similar dispersions which can be found in previous studies padgett et al 2008 wang et al 2018 zhong et al 2019 the coauthors disagree that different fragility dispersions can be obtained when using different ground motion suites the optimal im used in fragility analysis should be statistically independent of ground motion characteristics which is known as sufficiency jalayer et al 2012 the sufficiency means that similar fragility dispersions of bridge piers should be obtained by using different suites of ground motions which can be also observed in previous studies padgett et al 2008 wang et al 2018 zhong et al 2019 furthermore modeling uncertainties have been found to have slight effect on the fragility dispersions pang et al 2014 the coauthors only agree with the discussers that the fragility dispersion ζ may depend on the structure type for a particular structural type e g bridge piers if optimal edps and ims are employed with a large number of ground motions to conduct the fragility analysis the fragility dispersion ζ should varied in a small range e g the range between 0 35 and 0 45 as shown in figure 3 f in the discussion such small range of fragility dispersions will lead to small differences of fragility curves which have no statistical significance p values 0 05 from homogeneity of variance tests thus it is encouraged by coauthors to develop a generic value of fragility dispersion ζ for different structures which could facilitate the eta based fragility analysis in addition a new technique called probabilistic etefs is suggested by the discussers to estimate the β rtr for eta the coauthors do not know the probabilistic etefs clearly and thus refrain from commenting on whether it is accuracy for estimating the β r t r 3 conclusions in summary the coauthors appreciate the discussers effort to explain the fundamental assumptions of eta and collect a series of dispersion values for different structural systems and damage states which can help to improve the understanding of eta and facilitate the eta based fragility analysis in coauthors opinions the major advantage of eta for fragility analysis is that it can significantly reduce the computational effort which can be useful for engineers and researchers to give a rapid seismic assessment of bridges as concluded in the discussed paper in this regard a constant ζ for a specified structure instead of an uncertainty region can be efficient and helpful for the practical usage furthermore if someone wants to employ the eta for highly fidelity seismic assessment coauthors think that future work is still necessary to develop a new method even by adding additional computational time to eta in order to give more accurate estimates of fragility functions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
21133,discussers hariri ardebili and sattar address the paper seismic assessment of deep water bridges in reservoir considering hydrodynamic effects using endurance time analysis written by the coauthors of this response they present the fundamental assumptions on the generation of endurance time excitation functions etefs and the derivation of fragility functions by endurance time analysis eta since the fragility functions of bridge piers derived in the discussed paper are based on a deterministic fragility dispersion ζ discussers criticize that the record to record variability β r t r of ground motions and fragility dispersion ζ cannot be captured by eta which can be affected by many factors e g damage states intensity measures ims and levels of engineering demand parameters edps and consequently consider it inappropriate for deriving the fragility curves by assuming a constant ζ the discussers also provide a probabilistic etef approach to estimate the β r t r coauthors appreciate the discussions on the determination of the fragility dispersion ζ for eta based fragility analysis and welcome the new approach to estimate fragility dispersions for eta but disagree with the discussers characterization of fragility dispersions and consider that it is appropriate to develop the eta based fragility curves by assuming a constant ζ for a specified type of structures as presented in the discussed paper 1 summary of the discussion by hariri ardebili and sattar 2020 the discussion by hariri ardebili and sattar 2020 presents the fundamental assumptions for generation of endurance time excitation functions etefs and the derivation of fragility functions by endurance time analysis eta they found that both scaling and multiple etefs yield unreliable estimates of β r t r when compared to ida results they also collect a series of the dispersion β r t r of seismic demands due to the record to record variability and fragility dispersion ζ from previous studies they believe that the fragility dispersion ζ depends on many factors which cannot be considered as a constant value as presented in the discussed paper pang et al 2020 the main statements are summarized as following 1 discussers state that it is inappropriate to derive the eta based fragility curves by assuming a constant dispersion ζ across different damage states since they observed that the β r t r has a considerable variation across different levels of engineering demand parameters edps they also claim that a constant value of fragility dispersion ζ should be recommended for collapse fragility curves however if the fragility curves should be derived for other damage states one should use variable values of ζ 2 discussers state that the fragility dispersion ζ highly depends on the choice of intensity measures ims since the β r t r varies significantly across different ims such as asi i a and a rms in figure 3 of the discussion usually the eta based fragility functions should be developed based on the spectral acceleration at the fundamental period s a t 1 which is an optimal im for the majority of structures so if other ims are adopted in eta for developing fragility curves different dispersion values should be used for different ims discussers also state that dispersion ζ depends on the selected edp 3 discussers state that the value of the dispersion β r t r is significantly affected by different ground motion suites the number of records modeling uncertainty and structural types they recommend to use the uncertainty region to emphasize on the epistemic uncertainty in derivation of eta based fragility curves they further state that a new probabilistic etef method proposed by mashayekhi et al 2019 can be used to estimate the β r t r 2 response of the coauthors the discussed paper is focused at investigating the potential and effectiveness of eta for estimating the seismic induced hydrodynamic effect of highway bridges which do not intend to give the eta based fragility analysis for structures however coauthors appreciate the discussion presented by discussers hariri ardebili and sattar on the determination of the fragility dispersion ζ for eta since this is a major problem which will be encountered when eta is employed for seismic performance evaluation of structures under performance based earthquake engineering pbee framework since the discussers do not distinguish β rtr and ζ strictly in their discussion the coauthors want to distinguish between them in order to make this response clearly under the assumption of the log normal distribution cornell et al 2002 the fragility function can be expressed as follows 1 p f d s im i m φ ln μ d μ c β c 2 β r t r 2 φ ln i m ln m ς where p f ds im im conditional fragility probability at a im level of im for a damage state ds φ is the cumulative distribution function of standard normal distribution μ d median value μ d of seismic demands μ c capacity median β c capacity dispersion m fragility median it can be observed in eq 1 that the dispersion β r t r is not the fragility dispersion ζ by using the cloud analysis as an example the relationship between β rtr and ζ can be obtained based on the edp im relationship μ d a im b a and b regression coefficients jalayer et al 2017 as 2 ς β c 2 β r t r 2 b it can be seen from eq 2 that the fragility dispersion ζ is not directly related with β rtr thus coauthors consider it inappropriate to use the variation of β rtr by the discussers in majority of statements to criticize the choice of the fragility dispersion ζ in the discussed paper by assuming that the discussers mean the fragility dispersion ζ when the β rtr is mentioned the coauthors respond to the previously summarized statements of the discussion as following 1 with all due respect the coauthors disagree with the statements by the discussers that it is inappropriate to derive eta based fragility curves by assuming a constant ζ across different damage states the constant ζ across different damage states are widely used in cloud analysis when the capacity dispersion β c is not taken into account as shown in eq 2 since cloud analysis has long been recognized as an efficient and accuracy for developing the fragility curves zhang and huo 2009 jalayer et al 2017 the coauthors think it suitable to use a fixed ζ for different damage states to develop eta based fragility curves the constant ζ may be due to the reason that the variation of ζ for the optimal edp is usually stable before the collapse of structures jalayer et al 2017 however after the collapse the structure goes into the dynamic instability which can cause considerable variation in β rtr and b due to the collapse data jalayer et al 2017 thus changing the value of ζ significantly note that the complete damage state in the discussed paper is derived according to the previous studies priestley et al 1996 muntasir billah and alam 2015 which is a near collapse damage state other than the actual collapse damage additionally fixed fragility dispersions are usually used in seismic fragility analysis of bridges to avoid intersection between fragility curves in the existing literature shinozuka et al 2000 alipour et al 2011 vishwanath and banerjee 2019 thus we think that it is proper to use a fixed dispersion across different damage states for deriving fragility curves in the discussed paper and it is inappropriate to assume a constant ζ for the collapse fragility analysis 2 the coauthors disagree with the statement by the discussers that the fragility dispersion ζ depends on the selected im in the fragility analysis the optimal im e g spectral acceleration at the fundamental period s a t 1 in the discussed paper is usually recommended in order to establish the

21134,monopile towers used for offshore wind turbines are sensitive to vortex induced vibration viv here their structural response to viv was experimentally investigated with models of a partially and a fully immerged offshore monopile the partially and fully immersed model cylinders had aspect ratios of 18 75 and 28 13 respectively they were subject to reduced velocities of up to 9 78 and 5 45 respectively corresponding to reynolds numbers of up to 77120 and 63680 respectively normalised transverse motion amplitudes of up to 1 19 were measured strouhal like numbers down to 0 13 were obtained and they decreased with increasing flow velocity and corresponding motion amplitude the 3d digital image correlation dic processing method was used to measure response without influencing model properties and the flow field to assess the suitability of dic for viv investigations results obtained from the conventional technique using triaxial accelerometers were compared the influence of different processing methods pattern designs and their assemblies the repeatability of the model tests and the influence of ventilation were investigated also additionally forces and torques were measured directly results from these three measurement techniques were compared and discussed keywords experimental study optical measurement vortex induced vibration digital image correlation fluid structure interaction 1 introduction flexible cylindrical structures are often subject to vortex induced vibration viv typical examples are offshore wind turbine towers when standing upright for storage at the harbour when transported by the installation vessel or when mounted offshore without the gondola in place resonant conditions may occur if the frequency of the shed vortices matches a natural frequency of the structure later with the gondola in place damping provided by the mass of the mounted gondola usually prevents the occurrence of resonance at resonance oscillations in the transverse direction to the flow may affect the monopile s structural integrity and its fatigue life chou and tu 2011 reviewed and analysed failures of wind turbine towers concluding that viv may be the primary reason for structural damage for marine risers viv is a well known and extensively investigated phenomenon as this is not the case for offshore wind turbines we investigated model scale towers subject to viv khalak and williamson 1996 and wang et al 2017 studied experimentally elastic mounted rigid cylinders of very low mass and damping in one degree of freedom the authors measured forces and response motion amplitudes indicating resonance region and deduce response branches in dependence to the mass damping parameter 0 01 m ζ 1 khalak and williamson 1999 and gabbai and benaroya 2005 reviewed experiments on viv focusing on response branch transitions oscillation frequency rations and vortex shedding patterns for low mass damping m ζ 0 2 parameters an existing upper branch increases response amplitudes contrary jauvtis and williamson 2003 2004 considered a cylinder oscillating in two degrees of freedom they show initial streamwise response branches where longitudinal motions dominate here transverse motion amplitudes increase with decreasing mass damping parameter leading to a super upper branch for m c a ζ 0 013 where c a 1 is the added mass coefficient of a cylinder additionally motion trajectories and vortex shedding pattern are associated to the response branches blevins and coughran 2009 investigated the influence of damping and mass ratio on viv for cylinders with one and two degrees of freedom and show response amplitudes frequencies and trajectories the authors focus on the dependence of the ratio of longitudinal and transverse oscillation frequencies from the mass damping parameter showing frequency ratios tend to stay approximately one in the lock in region or increase linearly with increasing flow velocity williamson and govardhan 2004 reviewed free and forced cylinder oscillations in dependence of the reduced flow velocity and cylinder mass damping parameter and related response amplitudes with vortex shedding patterns modir at al 2016 studied experimentally the influence of mass ratio m on transverse motion amplitudes here response amplitudes increase and the lock in region expands with decreasing mass ratio leong and wei 2008 examined a cylinder of very low mass damping parameter showing the decreasing strouhal number for cylinder oscillating with large amplitudes gao et al 2017 studied rigid and flexible cylinders of huge aspect ratio showing a multi modal response changing over the cylinder length for flexible cylinders monreal jiménez et al 2020 examined cylinders of different diameter length and material yielding the classification of four different response groups according to their response amplitudes the authors discuss response amplitudes vorticities drag coefficients and mass damping parameters for each classification group jiménez gonzález and huera huarte 2017 spatially resolved shed vortices of a cylinder in one degree of freedom using piv and analyse the sensitivity of vortices for local perturbations as a foundation for viv suppression franzini at al 2013 investigated cylinders of varying yaw angle showing that the yaw angle has a small influence on response amplitudes below the flow velocity corresponding to the response peak during lock in afterwards the yaw angle reduces the response amplitude here yaw angles against the flow directions damp structural responses stronger than angles in flow direction cylinders of low mass parameter are usually bended in flow direction du to dynamic pressure at high flow velocities inducing a cylinder yaw angle thus this phenomenon yields a minor reduction of structural response compared to rigid cylinders contrary to the fully submerged cylinders which are the subject of the mentioned publications offshore wind turbine towers monopiles are partially submerged few authors focus on the viv phenomenon of partially submerged cylinders lang and gharib 2000 used shadowgraph technique to capture vortex patterns of a surface piecing cylinder for varying surface tensions here the surface tension influences vortex pattern through redirecting vorticity components fukuoka et al 2016 examined the influence of the free surface using particle image velocimetry piv and measured forces on a surface piercing cylinder the authors show how the cylinders aspect ratio influences its drag coefficient and indicate the surface piercing cylinders induce a vertical velocity component in the flow field disturbing boundary layers near the cylinder surface suh et al 2011 investigated numerically drag and lift coefficients vortex patterns and the free surface displacement and ventilation in the wake of surface piercing cylinders gonçalves et al 2012 2013 experimentally studied surface piercing cylinders of high mass ratio and low aspect ratio show response amplitudes and oscillation and shedding frequencies indicating the dominating influence of the aspect ratio and mass ratio on structural responses prastianto et al 2009 analysed a partially submerged cylinder of higher aspect ratio show significant lower ratios of the dominant longitudinal and transverse oscillation frequency compared to gonçalves et al 2012 2013 the mentioned publications demonstrate the complexity of viv thus research results strongly depend on cylinders structural parameters e g mass ratio damping and aspect ratio this leads to a variance of studies focusing on different aspects and yielding similar but different results regarding response amplitudes frequencies and vortex patterns however viv is becoming even more complex for surface piercing applications structural responses can differ additionally through the influence of surface tension on ventilation and the free surface the flow field becomes three dimensionally through an induced vertical velocity component in the cylinder wake making capturing vortex pattern more challenging thus numerous experimental and computational studies have been carried out to capture all parameters influencing viv during experiments sensors placed inside or attached outside the model e g strain gauges or accelerometers affect either its structural properties such as its stiffness and mass distribution or these devices disturb the cylindrical shape of the body consequently the natural frequencies and damping properties are affected causing the vortex shedding frequencies and motion amplitudes to be modified alternatively optical measuring techniques allow capturing the motions without affecting the flow past the test object or its structural properties digital image correlation dic requires applying a speckle pattern to the test body surface the pattern is optically captured by synchronised high speed cameras the deformation and displacement of the test body is evaluated from the relative pattern shift between subsequent images of each camera later pattern shifts are correlated between both cameras to evaluate the three dimensional deformations and displacements the spatial accuracy of the dic method is typically in the order of less than one pixel of camera resolution this technology is widely applied to measure strains during material testing chu et al 1985 introduced the dic technique for experimental applications by comparing measured displacements with actual displacements for uniform translation rigid body rotation and motions at constant angular velocities they obtained an accuracy of more than 90 pan et al 2009 reviewed the theoretical background of 2d dic and discussed error sources and the influence of displacement field calculation algorithms sutton and hild 2015 reviewed the development of dic documented examples of micro and macro applications and discussed future trends and challenges hild and roux 2006 reviewed algorithmic strategies to determine subpixel displacement fields and discussed the associated uncertainties additionally they demonstrated full field measurement techniques on a brazilian test disc sutton et al 2017 briefly reviewed the history of dic and demonstrated the suitability of dic for civil engineering applications via experimental investigations of displacements and strains of a wall structure a composite material and a concrete beam these publications illustrate the high accuracy of dic measurements for totally different applications in experimental investigations however the variety of error sources is also apparent making high accuracy measurements challenging over the last years several authors used dic for full field displacement deformation and strain measurements indicating the suitability of the technique for static and dynamic applications chen et al 2013 used a multi camera arrangement with overlapping fields of view to reconstruct the surface of a of 350 250 25 mm3 plate and compared dic and height gauge results helfrick et al 2011 monitored full field vibrations of a large cabinet panel of 710 710 mm they used stereo dic to measure out of plane displacements below 0 1 mm shao et al 2016 used stereo dic to measure strains caused by a drop impact load for an iron vessel of 1500 mm height and 1200 mm diameter the authors demonstrated how to calibrate dic systems without a calibration plate using the specimen itself however it was only possible to obtain dimensionless parameter e g strains zappa and hasheminejad 2017 used dic to record deformations of a deformable vibrating aluminium beam they studied dic uncertainties for dynamic applications by varying the camera exposure time these cited publications demonstrate the possibility to monitor large fields of view to capture full field displacements of large complex specimens with high temporal and spatial resolution and high measurement accuracy in addition to slow deformation and vibration measurements investigations of dynamic displacements due to for example fluid structure interactions are becoming more prominent banks et al 2015 measured displacements caused by fluid structure interaction of a curved airfoil in a wind tunnel using 3d dic bleischwitz et al 2018 investigated flat plates and membrane wings in a wind tunnel using synchronised stereo dic stereo piv and force torque measurements wood et al 2020 investigated dynamic heave and pitch displacements of an aero elastic airfoil in wind tunnel tests and discussed systematic errors the majority of published studies considered air as the fluid medium however few publications dealt with underwater dic measurements gupta et al 2014 used stereo dic to investigate underwater implosions of cylindrical tubes flores et al 2017 carried out water entry tests with flat plates at 1 88 m s impact velocity and measured the resulting structural displacements using dic zhang and porfiri 2019 performed a combined study using dic and piv they induced an impact on a fixed plate at the water surface and measured the structural response and flow velocities underneath the plate we measured the structural response of model scale monopiles subject to viv in water our results represent the continued analysis of the experiments of tödter et al 2019 we considered a partially and fully immersed cylinder with low mass damping ratios of 0 0152 and 0 0051 respectively at reduced velocities of up to 10 5 and reynolds numbers of up to 7 68 104 we measured structural displacements using the dic processing method and compared results with classical measurements of triaxial accelerometers obtained from two fold integration additionally we evaluated and discussed the influence of different post processing techniques and air trapping on dic and compared two different patterns applied to the test body for dic measurements our objective was to assess the suitability of using the dic for viv investigations due to its advantage of not influencing the flow field in future dic may become the state of the art measurement technique to experimentally investigate fluid structure interactions additionally we provided viv measurements of a fully submerged cylinder of low mass ratio m 0 556 and the two degrees of freedom motions of a surface piercing cylinder although extensive literature does exist on the topic of viv experimental data dealing with these two kinds of cylinders is still lacking 2 experimental setup the physical tests were performed in a circulating water channel of the institute of ship technology ocean engineering and transport systems ismt of the university of duisburg essen the channel s test section had a depth of 670 mm width of 1470 mm and length of 6000 mm the channel s maximum inflow velocity was about 2 4 m s the turbulence of the flow at the channel s centre of 300 mm breadth varied between 2 37 and 3 66 for flow velocities between 0 5 m s and 2 3 m s the tank walls were made of glass to allow optical access we considered two hollow circular cylinders of different length and identical diameter both cylinders were composed of polyvinyl chloride pvc with an outer diameter of 32 mm an inner diameter of 28 6 mm and a wall thickness of 1 7 mm the length of the partially immersed cylinder was 900 mm and it extended through the free surface the fully immersed cylinder was 600 mm long free decay tests obtained the cylinders natural frequencies and damping ratios these tests were performed using a mechanism that initially deflected a cylinder holding it and then releasing it a fast fourier transformation fft of the measured accelerometer signal yielded the first natural frequency the damping ratio ζ was calculated via equation 1 where n is the peak number and y n and y n 1 are two successive peaks of the decaying oscillations table 1 lists dimensions and properties of the two cylinders tödter et al 2019 1 1 n ln y n y n 1 2 π ζ 1 ζ 2 both cylinders were equipped with triaxial accelerometers of type disynet da3802 15g the sensors measured static and dynamic accelerations up to 15 g and weighed 0 015 kg each due to their size of 15 15 15 mm3 the sensors were placed inside the cylinders an uncertainty of 0 3 characterised the accelerometer measurements we used an hbm quantumx data acquisition system having a sampling rate of 2400 hz the fully immersed cylinder was equipped with one accelerometer located 40 mm underneath the top a cap of 25 mm height weighing 0 019 kg was plugged into the upper opening of the cylinder to prevent flooding the partially immersed cylinder was equipped with three accelerometers one accelerometer was placed at the top the other two 510 mm and 610 mm below the top to compare measured data obtained from the dic and the accelerometers both methods had to consider identical positions thus at least some of the accelerometers had to be placed far below the free surface because the dic method was able to capture the displacement at the same position without being affected by ventilation the cables connecting the sensors were guided through the bottom end of the cylinders to minimise the influence of the cables on the dynamic displacements the cylinders were fixed to a force torque sensor located underneath the tank bottom we used the force torque sensor schunk theta 68 si 1500 240 having a force resolution of 0 5 n with a measurement range of 1500 n and a torque resolution of 0 05 nm with a measurement range of 240 nm its general measurement uncertainty was less than 1 but its uncertainty was 5 at the lower end of the measurement range a vertical gap of 5 mm was specified between the bottom and the cylinder fig 1 depicts the experimental setup and sensor arrangements of both cylinders the global flow velocity was measured 500 mm in front of the test cylinders using a schiltknecht miniwater 20 velocity meter flow velocity measurements were within an overall accuracy of 2 the flow meter was removed after the channel flow speed was reached and before the start of each measurement run 2 1 optical setup and calibration two phantom v9 1 high speed cameras captured images for the stereoscopic 3d dic measurements the distance between the cameras and the cylinder was 1 0 m for the fully immersed cylinder and 1 2 m for the partially immersed cylinder the angle between the optical axes of both cameras was 23 7 both cameras were equipped with lenses of 50 mm focal length set to apertures of f 5 6 images were acquired with a frame rate of 300 fps and an exposure time of 800 μs a total of 1500 images were captured during each run which corresponded to 5 0 s measurement duration graph a of fig 2 shows an image of the experimental setup and graph b of fig 2 depicts the setup schematically four spotlights each equipped with 12 white high power leds illuminated the area of interest a black coated perspex plate was placed inside the tank at the opposite side wall of the channel and served as a uniform background to avoid reflections due to the small angle between the cameras cylinder motions in the direction of flow were most likely detected in the focal plane while cylinder motions in the direction transverse to the flow were observed normal to the focal plane software lavision davis 10 with the strainmaster module was used to reconstruct the monopile surface and to compute displacements a high speed controller obtained precise high speed records of synchronised dic and accelerometer measurements before the tests the optical setup was calibrated using a suitable volumetric calibration target the fields of view for the partially and the fully immersed cylinders were specified as 148 350 and 210 285 mm2 respectively the target enclosed the entire width of both fields of view but they did not cover their heights completely a third order polynomial function approximated the calibrated image distortion thus the optical resolutions for the partially and the fully immersed cylinders were 4 623 and 5 723 pixel mm respectively root mean square rms values of 0 1948 and 0 1495 were obtained by applying the calibration for the upper and lower target levels respectively of the fully immersed cylinder for the partially immersed cylinder rms values of 0 1704 and 0 1564 respectively were obtained for the upper and lower target levels it was challenging to estimate measurement uncertainties using dic because of the variety of parameters influencing these measurements such uncertainties included for example the camera setup specifically the distance between the cameras and the specimen other uncertainties comprised the angle between the cameras the cameras resolution illumination and the speckle patterns and subset sizes one possibility to quantify these uncertainties was to deflect a specimen and to compare the measurements with the reference condition unfortunately it was impossible to assess these uncertainties banks et al 2105 and giovannetti et al 2017 measured uncertainties for comparable setups banks et al 2015 determined uncertainties of less than 1 for deflections between 0 5 and 25 mm and giovannetti et al 2017 obtained uncertainties of less than 3 for deflections larger than 0 5 mm and uncertainties of less than 0 5 for deflection larger than 10 mm table 2 compares main features of setups documented in the literature and the setup we used here the distance between cameras and specimen and the resolutions we used were similar to those of banks et al 2015 however the angle between the cameras differed markedly and the patterns were not comparable wang et al 2011 showed that the measurement accuracy of out of plane motions here the transverse displacements increases with increasing angle between cameras they found that decreasing the camera angle from 40 to 20 increases the measurement uncertainty by about 85 7 additionally we had to estimate the influence of the pattern on accuracy fig 15 shows that dic results obtained with the dabbed sponge pattern compare less favourable with accelerometer results than dic results obtained with a dotted speckle pattern as seen for the motion amplitude of about a 0 3 the difference between the resulting normalised motion amplitudes for both measurement techniques is 0 0344 for the dabbed pattern and 0 0227 for the dotted speckle pattern therefore we estimated that the dabbed pattern increased our measurement uncertainties by about 51 5 accounting for the uncertainties assessed by banks et al 2015 and the uncertainties regarding the influence of our camera angles and our dabbed pattern yielded a total uncertainty for our measured transverse displacements of about 2 81 for in plane motions in our case the longitudinal motions wang et al 2011 showed that at a camera angle of 20 measurement uncertainties amount to about 20 of measurement uncertainties for out of plane motions based on these findings this yielded an uncertainty of 0 56 for our measurement of longitudinal motions measurement uncertainties using the dotted speckle pattern were smaller compared to the dabbed pattern because the negative influences of the dabbed pattern ceased this led to measurement uncertainties of 1 86 for our transverse motions and 0 37 for our longitudinal motions 2 2 pattern designs and application we used two different speckle patterns to depict their influence on dic measurements graph a of fig 3 shows the first pattern which was applied by dabbing a sponge and water resistant varnish onto the cylinder surface this pattern type was applied to the fully and the partially immersed cylinders graph b of fig 3 depicts the second pattern which was obtained using the lavision random pattern generator the diameter of the dots was 2 0 mm and the minimum distance between them was 1 0 mm the pattern was printed on an adhesive heavy duty foil which was stuck on the partially immersed cylinder after the dabbed pattern was removed generally foils should not have been used for dic measurements because they may induce strains themselves thus our comparison of both of these patterns had to consider also the suitability of foils for viv tests 2 3 data processing we used the software lavision davis 10 with the module strainmaster to process the images and to compute the displacements fig 4 depicts the applied processing workflow starting with the raw image and finishing with the time series of e g the transverse displacement first one camera identified a raw image of the cylinder with the attached speckle pattern in front of a dark background and the area of interest was masked to speed up the subsequent computations and to avoid influences of patterns that were not associated with the test body four initial subsets shown as blue squares in the left graph of fig 4 specify the local references which were tracked and used to compute the deformations each subset had to be large enough to contain a sufficiently distinctive intensity pattern and small enough to compute reasonably accurate displacements pan et al 2008 recommended using small subsets our subsets consisted of 31 31 pixels and step sizes were 10 pixels the step size defined the distance between the centres of two subsets during processing every pattern shift was computed relative to the first image characterised by the highest specified level of accuracy next the 3d body surface was reconstructed and displacements as well as strains were computed and mapped onto the cylinder surface results for the upper end of the cylinder could not be obtained because the ventilation which was depicted on the images prevented recognition of the speckle pattern the third step defined virtual strain gauges and computed time series of the displacements here two strain gauges red squares were chosen to plot the local displacements the adjustable strain gauge size of 15 15 mm2 corresponded to the dimensions of the accelerometers finally displacements were plotted as time series to visualise their dynamic behaviour as the displacements were calculated relative to the first image in which some displacements may already have been present and as it was not the start of the vibration the time series were not symmetric about the abscissa oscillation amplitudes were statistically evaluated by calculating their median value over the measurement duration when comparing the structural response between different flow velocities this was necessary because the motion amplitude varied with time using the median instead of the average value was beneficial because it was considered to be more robust against outliers when the number of entities was small a 20 hz low pass filter of fifth order was applied to the raw accelerometer signals to remove high frequency accelerations and thus to focus on the fundamental oscillation the two fold integration was performed using the trapezoidal rule afterwards a 1 0 hz high pass filter of fifth order was applied to the integrated signal only then was it possible to compare the displacements resulting from the dic measurements with the displacements obtained from the two fold integrated acceleration signals fig 5 depicts the raw and the filtered accelerometer signals of transverse oscillation of the partially immersed cylinder at a reduced velocity of 4 86 3 results graph a in fig 6 shows the longitudinal and transverse median acceleration amplitudes for the partially and the fully immersed cylinders at small reduced velocities of less than about 4 0 the longitudinal amplitude is larger than the transverse amplitude indicating a lower streamwise branch the transverse amplitude increases above the longitudinal amplitude at higher reduced velocities indicating the resonance region the partially immersed cylinder attains its maximum transverse acceleration amplitude of 22 2 m s2 at a reduced velocity of 7 29 the fully immersed cylinder reaches its maximum acceleration amplitude of 123 0 m s2 at a reduced velocity of 5 18 the maximum longitudinal amplitudes are 7 9 and 190 6 m s2 at reduced velocities of 8 51 and 5 18 respectively graphs b and c in fig 6 depict comparative normalised median motion amplitudes versus reduced velocity of the above time series obtained from the dic and the accelerometers via two fold integration for the partially b and the fully c immersed cylinders here the normalised motion amplitude is a a d and the reduced velocity is u u f d where a is the motion amplitude u is the free stream velocity f is the oscillating frequency and d is the cylinders outer diameter for the partially immersed cylinder these amplitudes were based on the accelerations of accelerometer acc 2 as seen in graph b of fig 6 the longitudinal motion amplitude was dominant up to a reduced velocity of 2 84 afterwards resonance occurred generating relatively large amplitude transverse oscillations up to a reduced velocity of 9 72 at resonance the longitudinal motion was negligibly small at the beginning of measurements the cylinders were already longitudinally deflected by the flow as this deflection was not captured the longitudinal deflections contained a quasi static component for the fully immersed cylinder the motion amplitudes were based on the accelerations of accelerometer acc 1 as seen in graph c of fig 6 at low reduced velocities of up to 3 29 longitudinal motion amplitudes were dominant whereas at higher flow velocities transverse oscillations were dominant again indicating the viv effect the longitudinal amplitudes increased slowly up to a reduced velocity of 3 83 and then followed the trend of the transverse amplitudes the resonance peak supposedly occurred at a reduced velocity of about 5 48 fatigue damage as a consequence of the vortex induced loads destroyed this fully immersed cylinder when the reduced velocity reached 5 75 consequently the complete lock in region of the fully immersed cylinder could not be investigated however the maximum flow velocity of the circulating towing tank was not large enough to display the complete lock in region graph d of fig 6 displays the relation between the dominant frequency of the longitudinal oscillation f l and of the transverse oscillation f t for the fully immersed cylinder the frequency ratio equals 2 0 under resonance conditions compare goncalves et al 2012 2013 here the frequency ratio for the fully immersed cylinder approaches about 2 0 at reduced velocities exceeding 3 29 indicating the lock in region the frequency ratio remains constant at higher reduced velocities thus our experiments did not capturer the end of resonance i e the complete lock in region the frequency relation for the partially submerged cylinder under resonance conditions was not as clearly determined as for the fully submerged cylinder graph b in fig 6 indicates the beginning of resonance occurring at a reduced velocity of 2 88 this corresponds to a sudden drop of the frequency relation for the partially immersed cylinder in graph d in fig 6 the frequency relation decreases slightly with increasing reduced velocity this might have been caused by the increased ventilation affecting the mass ratio m and the immersed share of the cylinder based on these results the frequency relation for a partially immersed cylinder at resonance conditions was deduced as follows 2 f l f t 2 m l air l water u start u here the number 2 represents the frequency ratio for a fully submerged cylinder l air is the cylinder length in air l water is the cylinder length in water u start is the reduced velocity at the beginning of resonance and u is the reduced velocity in the resonance region graph d in fig 6 displays the deduced relation as a dashed black line and shows that for the partially immersed cylinder the considered reduced velocities do not exceed the resonance region the strouhal like number s t f t d u was calculated using the transverse oscillation frequency f t assuming that it represented the vortex shedding frequency f s compare goncalves et al 2013 for the fully submerged cylinder the strouhal like number varies between 0 16 and 0 18 for reduced velocities below 3 83 at increased reduced velocities the strouhal like number decreases down to 0 129 thus the strouhal like number decreases with increasing motion amplitude for the partially submerged cylinder the strouhal like number varies randomly for small reduced velocities below 2 62 where longitudinal motions dominate this might have resulted from small transverse motions in this region which were challenging to resolve between reduced velocities of 2 62 and 7 86 the strouhal like number first decreases to 0 143 corresponding to increasing transverse motion amplitudes and then increases to 0 16 corresponding to decreasing transverse motion amplitudes at higher reduced velocities the strouhal like number decreases again down to 0 127 which might have been caused by increased longitudinal accelerations additionally we measured transverse flow velocities in the wake of the partially immersed cylinder with a laser doppler velocimeter ldv for two different free stream velocities the resulting time series had to be interpolated for uniform time steps to perform ffts to obtain the shedding frequencies f s for a reduced velocity of 4 05 the shedding frequency was 5 50 hz for a reduced velocity of 6 08 the shedding frequency was 6 83 hz this corresponded to strouhal numbers of s t f s d u of 0 176 and 0 146 respectively and indicated that the strouhal number decreased with increasing motion amplitudes the resulting strouhal numbers compare favourably to the calculated strouhal like numbers confirming the usage of the strouhal like number the differences between strouhal and strouhal like numbers were due to the fact that they were obtained in different test runs fig 7 plots the strouhal and strouhal like numbers versus reduced velocities for the fully and the partially submerged cylinder the strouhal number for stationary cylinders is generally estimated as s t 0 2 compare griffin 1978 leong and wei 2008 obtained a strouhal number of 0 16 for large oscillations a y 2 a x 2 5 thus confirming our results fig 8 presents comparative two second close up time series of structural response for the partially immersed cylinder at reduced velocities of 3 24 4 86 7 29 and 8 10 determined by the dic processing method and a two fold integration of the accelerations of accelerometer acc 2 graphs a and b of fig 8 plot longitudinal and transverse displacements respectively and graph c of fig 8 shows the associated amplitude spectra for a five second measurement duration obtained by fft fig 9 shows comparative motion trajectories over ten oscillations of the partially immersed cylinder at the same reduced velocities considered in fig 8 obtained from both measuring methods these trajectories are here displayed on a cartesian coordinate plane where the abscissa identifies longitudinal displacements and the ordinate transverse displacements as seen motion amplitudes were strongly affected by the flow velocity at the reduced velocity of 3 24 transverse amplitudes were larger than longitudinal amplitudes ending up in a crescent shaped trajectory with increasing flow velocities transverse amplitudes increased markedly as resonant conditions were approached and the trajectories took on a vertical shape at the beginning of resonance the fft frequency plots in graph c of fig 8 show a sharp peak indicating that the cylinder oscillated at a single constant frequency when approaching the resonance frequency the frequency peak became wider and covered a broader band of frequencies beyond resonance at the reduced velocity of 9 72 the associated frequency plot contains several small peaks over a wider range of frequencies the trajectories at reduced velocities of 8 10 and 9 72 show that at higher flow velocities beyond the resonance peak transverse oscillations decreased significantly and the cylinder s structural response became erratic under resonance conditions the fft frequency plots did not identify distinct amplitude peaks of the longitudinal displacement nevertheless it was typical that for the fully immersed cylinder the longitudinal oscillation frequency was twice the transverse oscillation frequency graph c of fig 10 depicts this behaviour analogously figs 10 and 11 present the structural response of the fully immersed cylinder at reduced velocities of 2 74 3 29 3 83 and 5 48 obtained from the two measuring methods here the longitudinal oscillation was dominant at a reduced velocity of 2 74 with the beginning of resonance at a reduced velocity of 3 29 longitudinal oscillations became more prominent as the flow velocity increased at the reduced velocity of 2 74 the shape of the cylinder s trajectory was a strongly squeezed figure eight however at reduced velocities that caused large amplitude transverse resonance oscillations the trajectory s shape changed becoming crescent shaped at reduced velocities that caused transverse peak oscillations here motion trajectories repeatedly obtained from the dic processing method were closer to each other than those from accelerometer measurements and a more curved crescent characterised the shape of their trajectories at resonant reduced velocities around 4 93 and 5 48 longitudinal and transverse amplitudes were significantly larger compared to those at a reduced velocity of 3 83 furthermore for this fully immersed cylinder the amplitudes of longitudinal oscillations were relatively large as they turned out to be about two thirds as large as the amplitudes of the transverse oscillation recall that this was not the case for the partially immersed cylinder see figs 8 and 9 our comparative results demonstrated that the agreement was sufficiently favourable between deformations and motions evaluated using the dic processing method and the accelerometer measurements for transverse motion amplitudes between 3 and 10 mm for motion amplitudes below 3 mm the results differed slightly there were two possible explanations for this deviation on the one hand the dic pattern might have been too coarse to depict the small motions thus leading to a lack of spatial resolution on the other hand smaller motions corresponded to reduced accelerations at constant or similar frequencies which may have been resolved less accurately by the accelerometers thus the source of this deviation could not be clearly identified for transverse motion amplitudes larger than of 5 0 mm the deviation between both measurement techniques first increased slightly up to amplitudes of 7 5 mm for the partially immersed cylinder and up to amplitudes of 20 mm for the fully immersed cylinder the pattern on both cylinders was applied manually by dabbing with a sponge consequently the patterns differed thus potentially causing different deviations for the partially immersed cylinder the deviation increased until the transverse motion amplitude reached its maximum afterwards the deviation declined with decreasing motion amplitude for the fully immersed cylinder the deviation increased strongly for transverse motions amplitudes over 20 mm under these conditions the accelerometer operated in its over range region which influenced its measuring accuracy regarding the dic processing method the dabbed sponge pattern may not have been suitable for displacements of this order of magnitude on the other hand the transverse motion occurred primarily along the optical axis of the cameras and thus they were affected by the depth of field furthermore these displacements may have been too large to be captured correctly by our camera setup as the reliability of our results depended especially on the angle between cameras the transverse motion deviation increased at larger transverse displacement which was also shown by sutton et al 2008 the longitudinal oscillations obtained from both measurement techniques agreed favourably due to the fact that longitudinal motions were in plane motions and these motions were captured more accurately with our setup had further tests been performed the optical setup should have been modified that is the focal plane then should have been oriented in accordance with the vertical and transverse axes of the test cylinder nevertheless the dic processing method was capable and suitable for experimental viv investigations and delivered sufficiently accurate results for the test cases we considered 3 1 influence of the dic processing techniques on displacements the software we used for the dic processing method provides several alternative techniques to analyse the captured images we compared two such techniques to evaluate their influence on the dic results the relative to first rtf technique evaluated the pattern shift by analysing every recorded image relative to the first image the sum of differentials sod technique evaluated the pattern shift by analysing subsequent images and summing up the pattern shifts up to the considered image additionally we considered and compared three levels of computational accuracy here referred to as the accurate the medium and the fast levels the interpolation procedure and convergence criteria differed for these three levels furthermore we investigated the influence of an additional second order displacement gradient caused by nonlinear deformations this gradient increased the accuracy for large deformations lu and cary 2000 and yielded fewer systematic errors schreier and sutton 2002 fig 12 shows the resulting displacement time series as well as a close up at the last depicted motion peak calculated by applying different processing techniques on the raw data of a typical test here for the partially immerged cylinder at a reduce velocity of 4 86 as seen the influence of computational accuracy and the second order displacement gradient on the resulting displacement was relatively small the deviation between peak values resulting from the accurate and the fast computational levels shown in the close up in fig 12 was only 0 037 the peak considering second order displacements deviated by only 0 016 from the accurate result thus this particular case was not significantly affected by nonlinear displacements however a significant difference was obtained from the rtf and the sod techniques the sod technique delivered a displacement at the first peak which was compared to the other technique about 0 12 mm larger in the transverse direction the software supplier recommends using the rtf technique for processing because the sod technique is considered to be prone to sequential errors considering the entire measurement duration of 5 s the first and last peaks deviated by 1 75 and 1 70 respectively between these peaks the maximum deviation was 2 58 thus the error did not sequentially increase in this case but it varied with time however the deviation of the motion amplitude in the depicted time interval was relatively small and thus tolerable 3 2 repeatability and statistical influences the turbulent flow caused motion amplitudes to vary with time as previously shown in figs 8 and 9 thus the measurement duration needed to be long enough to balance those fluctuations statistically this was challenging for the dic processing method because the duration of the acquisition interval was limited by the cameras memory capacity reducing the frame rate would have allowed increasing the duration of the acquisition interval but at the cost of a reduced temporal discretisation graph a of fig 13 depicts three repetitive measured time series of accelerations for the partially immersed cylinder at three different reduced velocities of 2 43 4 86 and 6 52 the measured motion amplitudes of theses repeated time series were of the same order of magnitude but their evolutions over the time differed this was not considered to be due to the inaccuracy of the measurement technique because such variations of the oscillating motion amplitudes were observed even in high speed video recordings furthermore each repetitive time series was characterised by an individual motion history of the test cylinder as it did not start when the flow velocity was zero graph b of fig 13 displays the ffts of the time series depicted in graph a as seen there is no resonance at a reduced velocity of 2 43 blue curves thus no distinct peaks exist but the curves behave favourably as the resonance region is reached the three ffts of the time series at a reduced velocity of 4 86 red curves show clear peaks however these peaks still differ slightly for two repetitions but strongly for a third repetition for the resonance peak at a reduced velocity of 6 52 green curve all three ffts show sharp peaks which are identical for two repetitions but differ slightly for a third repetition however the frequencies at the peaks of the ffts of all three repetitions compare favourably for each flow velocity thus the cylinder oscillated at a similar frequency for each repetition although the motions amplitude varied for the three repetitive time series of longitudinal and transverse amplitudes graph c of fig 13 plots the associated median motion amplitudes and their standard deviations obtained from the dic processing method and from accelerometer measurements for the partially submerged cylinder at the reduced velocity of 4 86 generally the amplitudes and standard deviations decrease with increasing measurement duration specifically for the time series of 5 s duration the transverse amplitude is 5 39 0 56 mm whereas for the time series of 180 s duration the transverse amplitude decreases to a nearly constant value of 4 78 0 01 mm analogously for the time series of 70 s duration the longitudinal amplitude decreases from 0 342 0 067 mm to 0 285 0 011 mm thus measurement durations of at least 160 s ensured small standard deviations between repetitive time series of 0 21 in the transverse and 3 86 in the longitudinal direction respectively incidentally median values and small standard deviations of 0 281 0 007 mm for the longitudinal and 4 83 0 16 mm for the transverse amplitudes here for the three repetitive time series obtained from the dic processing method demonstrated that the relatively short measurement duration was also capable to produce repeatable results nevertheless short measurement durations could not ensure reliable results therefore when using the dic processing method we felt it necessary to maximise the measurement duration or to repeat the measurements especially if statistical measures were sought after this prolonged the test campaigns and subjected the test cylinders to higher fatigue loads fig 14 shows comparative median longitudinal and transverse motion amplitudes captured with 150 300 and 600 frames per second from the dic processing method for the partially submerged cylinder at reduced velocity of 6 52 we considered this velocity because it was within the resonance region where transverse displacements were larger and more difficult to capture the accelerometer sampling rate remained at 2400 hz to ensure capturing all peaks correctly the difference between motion amplitudes obtained from the dic processing method and from acceleration measurements was similar for each frame rate thus the median amplitude did not depend on the frame rate used but it varied with the repetitions considered because the results based on the accelerometer measurements also varied when their sampling rate remained constant therefore it was suitable to reduce the frame rate to extend the measurement duration 3 3 pattern influences fig 15 plots comparative transverse normalised median motion amplitudes versus reduced flow velocity for the partially submerged cylinder with the printed dot pattern and with the dabbed sponge pattern for the dot pattern the peak of the median transverse motion amplitudes occur at a lower flow velocity and this peak exceeds the comparative peak for the dabbed sponge pattern differences between amplitudes based on the dic processing method and the accelerometer measurements are significantly larger for the dabbed sponge pattern than for the dot pattern for the sponge pattern the percentage deviation of the maximum median transverse motion amplitude of 10 52 mm is 22 15 and the total deviation is 2 33 mm in comparison for the dot pattern this percentage deviation of 13 02 mm is only 9 55 and the total deviation is 1 24 mm as the kind of pattern did not influence the accuracy of the accelerometer readings we concluded that the dot pattern allowed more accurate dic measurements than the sponge pattern however the foil did affect the structural properties of the cylinder its natural frequency is shifted to 7 86 hz and its mass ratio to 0 725 furthermore the cylinder surface became smoother and smoother surfaces tended to cause larger resonant motion amplitudes at lower velocities compared to raw surfaces gao et al 2015 our results demonstrated that the patterns we printed on foils were suitable for optical displacement measurements however the surface roughness should have been monitored when dealing with viv 3 4 influence of ventilation the partially submerged surface piercing cylinder induced significant ventilation which grew with increasing flow velocities and transverse motion amplitudes nevertheless less ventilation was observed at flow velocities that did not induce resonance graph a of fig 16 shows a bubble pattern with vortices shed from the cylinder at a reduced velocity of 7 29 at this velocity the amount of ventilation reaches its maximum the bubble structures covered the cylinder surface and this prevented obtaining optical measurements using the dic processing method graph b of fig 16 shows the region where the dic processing method was able to recognise the pattern on the test body and graph c of fig 16 depicts the 3d surface reconstruction including the cut out caused by ventilation consequently although ventilation reduced the region that can be analysed using the dic processing method the application of this method was not completely disqualified 3 5 force and torque measurements graph a of fig 17 depicts comparative measured median transverse and longitudinal force amplitudes for the partially and the fully immersed cylinder in addition calculated absolute potential added mass forces are plotted for both cylinders dashed lines they were calculated as follows 3 f p c a m d a 4 f t f p f v here c a is the potential added mass coefficient c a 1 0 for cylinders m d the displaced mass m d 0 25 π d 2 l ρ and a the acceleration amplitude displayed in graph a of fig 6 the total transverse force f t consists of the potential added mass force f p and the vortex force f v jauvtis and williamson 2004 recall that small force amplitudes were within the sensor s resolution range of 0 5 n and therefore they had to be considered critically generally the median force amplitudes follow the trend of the median motion amplitudes in graphs b and c of fig 6 for both cylinders for the partially immersed cylinder the force amplitudes show an initial streamwise branch at low reduced velocities the resonance region starts as reduced velocities increase whereby the transverse force amplitude is larger than the longitudinal force amplitude in contrast to motion amplitudes longitudinal force amplitudes increase slowly in the resonance region and rapidly at reduced velocities above 8 00 indicating the end of resonance the acceleration amplitudes in graph a of fig 6 show the same trend for the fully immersed cylinder longitudinal force amplitudes are dominant up to a reduced velocity of 1 12 at higher reduced velocities transverse and longitudinal force amplitudes increase strongly here transverse force amplitudes are dominant indicating resonance in addition graph b of fig 17 plots the calculated lift and drag coefficients c l f l 0 5 ρ a v 2 and c d f t 0 5 ρ a v 2 where f l and f t are the total longitudinal and transverse forces respectively ρ is the fluid density v is the free stream velocity and a d l is the projected area of the cylinder s immersed length l and diameter d here the initial streamwise branch of drag coefficients for the partially and the fully immersed cylinders attain their maxima at low flow velocities for the fully submerged cylinder the initial streamwise branch of the drag coefficient is even higher than in the lock in region where motion amplitudes and longitudinal forces are maximal nevertheless lift coefficients for the partially and the fully immersed cylinders follow the trend of their respective force and motion amplitudes graph c of fig 17 depicts longitudinal and transverse median torque amplitudes and calculated torques i e the product of force and cylinder length for the fully immersed cylinder longitudinal torque amplitudes are dominant at reduced velocities below 1 12 and transverse torque amplitudes are dominant at reduced velocities above 1 12 the calculated torques amplitudes dotted lines compare favourably to measured torque amplitudes indicating that the force attacked the top of the cylinder for the partially immersed cylinder the longitudinal torque amplitudes are dominant at reduced velocities below 2 43 and the transverse torque amplitudes are dominant at higher reduced velocities the calculated transverse torque amplitudes force amplitude multiplied with the immersed cylinder length compare favourably to the measured results at reduced velocities below 3 65 and above 8 51 in between measured torque amplitudes are larger than the calculated amplitudes indicating that the point of attack of the force was located above the calm water surface this might have been caused by an increased water surface surrounding the oscillating cylinder as seen our calculated longitudinal torque amplitudes do not match the measured amplitudes at reduced velocities below 2 84 and above 7 70 our calculations overestimate the torque amplitudes at reduced velocities between 2 84 and 7 70 however our calculations underestimate the torque amplitudes these differences might have been caused by the inadequate resolutions of the sensor and its associated insufficient accuracy at the lower measurement range recall that the sensor s force resolution of 0 5 n was relatively large compared to its finer torque resolution of 0 05 nm consequently torque measurements were more accurate within the considered measurement range graph d of fig 17 plots frequency ratio of the dominant longitudinal and transverse frequency for the force and torque oscillation respectively versus reduced velocity as seen for the fully immersed cylinder the frequency ratios of these oscillations reach the value of 2 0 after passing through its resonance region however for the partially immersed cylinder the corresponding frequency ratio of these oscillations reaches the value of 1 0 after passing through its resonance region for the partially immersed cylinder the frequency ratio of torque oscillations is unity until the reduced velocity attains a value of 8 87 at higher reduced velocities this frequency ratio increases reaching a value of up to 4 85 at reduced velocities between 4 46 and 7 29 the frequency ratio for the force oscillations also attains the value of 1 0 at lesser reduced velocities the frequency ratio fluctuates between 1 00 and 2 86 at reduced velocities greater than 7 29 the frequency ratio reaches the value of 4 04 and then decreases slowly again this behaviour contradicted the frequency ratio obtained from accelerometer based results the disparity could have resulted from the less reliable measurements of the force torque sensor as they were obtained near the resolution limit of this sensor the finally resolved accelerometer based results were more trustworthy our comparative force torque measurements showed the occurrence of the same lower stream wise branch and consequently the same resonance region for both cylinders as the force torque sensor was placed underneath the tank bottom it did not influence the flow field or the cylinders properties making it a suitable measurement technique with an easy setup however for the sensor we used the resolution of the lower boundary of the measurement region was limited thus results had to be analysed critically this might have caused the oscillation frequencies obtained from the force torque sensor to differ from the frequencies obtained from the accelerometers or the dic however amplitudes could not be obtained from the force torque sensor which turned out to be a major drawback for our viv investigations 4 conclusions extensive experimental investigations of the vortex induced vibration viv of a fully and a partially immersed cylinder exposed to water flow were carried out the structural response was measured using 3d digital image correlation dic processing method as well as a set of triaxial accelerometers and a force torque sensor a speckle pattern was applied to both cylinders to perform the dic measurements the results of both measurement methods were compared and discussed in the context of their suitability for viv investigations results from both methods agreed favourably for medium transverse motion amplitudes however for small motion amplitudes the speckle pattern required some improvement the pattern design and optical arrangement influenced the measurements of large transverse motion amplitudes measured force and torque amplitudes agreed favourably with the trend of accelerometer and dic results however small amplitudes were difficult to capture due to the sensor s limited resolution additionally we studied the influence of processing techniques for the dic method the relative to first pattern shift computation technique provided the best results different accuracy levels were compared but their influence was negligibly small for the test conditions we considered to obtain results within a short period of time the low level accuracy was sufficient as its deviation from the high level accuracy was only 0 14 whereas its computational effort was about 60 less furthermore we obtained and compared dic measurements using two different speckle patterns the first pattern was dapped manually with a sponge while the second dot pattern was printed on a heavy duty adhesive foil attached to the cylinder the dot pattern delivered measurements that deviated less from the accelerometer based measurements and thus they were more accurate measurements nevertheless the attached foil influenced the viv results by smoothing the surface roughness this led to larger transverse motion amplitudes at lower flow velocities yet the cylinders natural frequency and mass ratios hardly changed we investigated the repeatability of dic measurements for turbulent flows a certain measurement duration was necessary to analyse the structural response statistically for our test cases we required an acquisition time of at least 160 s however such a long acquisition time was not obtainable at reasonable cost using the dic method the cameras memory was the limiting factor the acquisition duration could have been extended by reducing the frame rate without a significant reduction of measurement accuracy fortunately for our viv investigation only a relatively low frame rate was necessary because the most relevant oscillations occurred at the lowest natural frequencies furthermore it was possible to combine results from several subsequent image acquisition periods to process statistical data for a single test condition the major challenge when applying the dic method was that an optical access was inevitably required we showed that ventilation disturbed the dic measurements however the method could still be applied as long as parts of the speckle patterns were recognisable using the dic method required a rather complex experimental setup considering the implementation of optical and electrical equipment and the associated cabling the influence of inappropriately distributed masses for acceleration measurements was another major issue nevertheless using accelerometers allowed us to obtain measurements at high acquisition rates over long durations at relatively low cost compared to high speed imaging furthermore the dic measuring process required a complex processing technique compared to the relatively straight forward integration of

21134,monopile towers used for offshore wind turbines are sensitive to vortex induced vibration viv here their structural response to viv was experimentally investigated with models of a partially and a fully immerged offshore monopile the partially and fully immersed model cylinders had aspect ratios of 18 75 and 28 13 respectively they were subject to reduced velocities of up to 9 78 and 5 45 respectively corresponding to reynolds numbers of up to 77120 and 63680 respectively normalised transverse motion amplitudes of up to 1 19 were measured strouhal like numbers down to 0 13 were obtained and they decreased with increasing flow velocity and corresponding motion amplitude the 3d digital image correlation dic processing method was used to measure response without influencing model properties and the flow field to assess the suitability of dic for viv investigations results obtained from the conventional technique using triaxial accelerometers were compared the influence of different processing methods pattern designs and their assemblies the repeatability of the model tests and the influence of ventilation were investigated also additionally forces and torques were

structure interaction 1 introduction flexible cylindrical structures are often subject to vortex induced vibration viv typical examples are offshore wind turbine towers when standing upright for storage at the harbour when transported by the installation vessel or when mounted offshore without the gondola in place resonant conditions may occur if the frequency of the shed vortices matches a natural frequency of the structure later with the gondola in place damping provided by the mass of the mounted gondola usually prevents the occurrence of resonance at resonance oscillations in the transverse direction to the flow may affect the monopile s structural integrity and its fatigue life chou and tu 2011 reviewed and analysed failures of wind turbine towers concluding that viv may be

cylinders with one and two degrees of freedom and show response amplitudes frequencies and trajectories the authors focus on the dependence of the ratio of longitudinal and transverse oscillation frequencies from the mass damping parameter showing frequency ratios tend to stay approximately one in the lock in region or increase linearly with increasing flow velocity williamson and govardhan 2004 reviewed free and forced cylinder oscillations in dependence of the reduced flow velocity and cylinder mass damping parameter and related response amplitudes with vortex shedding patterns modir at al 2016 studied experimentally the influence of mass ratio m on transverse motion amplitudes here response amplitudes increase and the lock in region expands with decreasing mass ratio leong and wei 2008 examined a cylinder of very low mass damping parameter showing the decreasing strouhal number for cylinder oscillating with large amplitudes gao et al 2017 studied rigid and flexible cylinders of huge aspect ratio showing a multi modal response changing over the cylinder length for flexible cylinders monreal jiménez et al 2020 examined cylinders of different diameter length and material yielding the classification of four different response groups according to their response amplitudes the authors discuss response amplitudes vorticities drag coefficients and mass damping parameters for each classification group jiménez gonzález and huera huarte 2017 spatially resolved shed vortices of a cylinder in one degree of freedom using piv and analyse the sensitivity of vortices for local perturbations as a foundation for viv suppression franzini at al 2013 investigated cylinders of varying yaw angle showing that the yaw angle has a small influence on response amplitudes below the flow velocity corresponding to the response peak during lock in afterwards the yaw angle reduces the response amplitude here yaw angles against the flow directions damp structural responses stronger than angles in flow direction cylinders of low mass parameter are usually bended in flow direction du to dynamic pressure at high flow velocities inducing a cylinder yaw angle thus this phenomenon yields a minor reduction of structural response compared to rigid cylinders contrary to the fully submerged cylinders which are the subject of the mentioned publications offshore wind turbine towers monopiles are partially submerged few authors focus on the viv phenomenon of partially submerged cylinders lang and gharib 2000 used shadowgraph technique to capture vortex patterns of a surface piecing cylinder for varying surface tensions here the surface tension influences vortex pattern through redirecting vorticity components fukuoka et al 2016 examined the influence of the free surface using particle image velocimetry piv and measured forces on a surface piercing cylinder the authors show how the cylinders aspect ratio influences its drag coefficient and indicate the surface piercing cylinders induce a vertical velocity component in the flow field disturbing boundary layers near the cylinder surface suh et al 2011 investigated numerically drag and lift coefficients vortex patterns and the free surface displacement and ventilation in the wake of surface piercing cylinders gonçalves et al 2012 2013 experimentally studied surface piercing cylinders of high mass ratio and low aspect ratio show response amplitudes and oscillation and shedding frequencies indicating the dominating influence of the aspect ratio and mass ratio on structural responses prastianto et al 2009 analysed a partially submerged cylinder of higher aspect ratio show significant lower ratios of the dominant longitudinal and transverse oscillation frequency compared to gonçalves et al 2012 2013 the mentioned publications demonstrate the complexity of viv thus research results strongly depend on cylinders structural parameters e g mass ratio damping and aspect ratio this leads to a variance of studies focusing on different aspects and yielding similar but different results regarding response amplitudes frequencies and vortex patterns however viv is becoming even more complex for surface piercing applications structural responses can differ additionally through the influence of surface tension on ventilation and the free surface the flow field becomes three dimensionally through an induced vertical velocity component in the cylinder wake making capturing vortex pattern more challenging thus numerous experimental and computational studies have been carried out to capture all parameters influencing viv during experiments sensors placed inside or attached outside the model e g strain gauges or accelerometers affect either its structural properties such as its stiffness and mass distribution or these devices disturb the cylindrical shape of the body consequently the natural frequencies and damping properties are affected causing the vortex shedding frequencies and motion amplitudes to be modified alternatively optical measuring techniques allow capturing the motions without affecting the flow past the test object or its structural properties digital image correlation dic requires applying a speckle pattern to the test body surface the pattern is optically captured by synchronised high speed cameras the deformation and displacement of the test body is evaluated from the relative pattern shift between subsequent images of each camera later pattern shifts are correlated between both cameras to evaluate the three dimensional deformations and displacements the spatial accuracy of the dic method is typically in the order of less than one pixel of camera resolution this technology is widely applied to measure strains during material testing chu et al 1985 introduced the dic technique for experimental applications by comparing measured displacements with actual displacements for uniform translation rigid body rotation and motions at constant angular velocities they obtained an accuracy of more than 90 pan et al 2009 reviewed the theoretical background of 2d dic and discussed error sources and the influence of displacement field calculation algorithms sutton and hild 2015 reviewed the development of dic documented examples of micro and macro applications and discussed future trends and challenges hild and roux 2006 reviewed algorithmic strategies to determine subpixel displacement fields and discussed the associated uncertainties additionally they demonstrated full field measurement techniques on a brazilian test disc sutton et al 2017 briefly reviewed the history of dic and demonstrated the suitability of dic for civil engineering applications via experimental investigations of displacements and strains of a wall structure a composite material and a concrete beam these publications illustrate the high accuracy of dic measurements for totally different applications in experimental investigations however the variety of error sources is also apparent making high accuracy measurements challenging over the last years several authors used dic for full field displacement deformation and strain measurements indicating the suitability of the technique for static and dynamic applications chen et al 2013 used a multi camera arrangement with overlapping fields of view to reconstruct the surface of a of 350 250 25 mm3 plate and compared dic and height gauge results helfrick et al 2011 monitored full field vibrations of a large cabinet panel of 710 710 mm they used stereo dic to measure out of plane displacements below 0 1 mm shao et al 2016 used stereo dic to measure strains caused by a drop impact load for an iron vessel of 1500 mm height and 1200 mm diameter the authors demonstrated how to calibrate dic systems without a calibration plate using the specimen itself however it was only possible to obtain dimensionless parameter e g strains zappa and hasheminejad 2017 used dic to record deformations of a deformable vibrating aluminium beam they studied dic uncertainties for dynamic applications by varying the camera exposure time these cited publications demonstrate the possibility to monitor large fields of view to capture full field displacements of large complex specimens with high temporal and spatial resolution and high measurement accuracy in addition to slow deformation and vibration measurements investigations of dynamic displacements due to for example fluid structure interactions are becoming more prominent banks et al 2015 measured displacements caused by fluid structure interaction of a curved airfoil in a wind tunnel using 3d dic bleischwitz et al 2018 investigated flat plates and membrane wings in a wind tunnel using synchronised stereo dic stereo piv and force torque measurements wood et al 2020 investigated dynamic heave and pitch displacements of an aero elastic airfoil in wind tunnel tests and discussed systematic errors the majority of published studies considered air as the fluid medium however few publications dealt with underwater dic measurements gupta et al 2014 used stereo dic to investigate underwater implosions of cylindrical tubes flores et al 2017 carried out water entry tests with flat plates at 1 88 m s impact velocity and measured the resulting structural displacements using dic zhang and porfiri 2019 performed a combined study using dic and piv they induced an impact on a fixed plate at the water surface and measured the structural response and flow velocities underneath the plate we measured the structural response of model scale monopiles subject to viv in water our results represent the continued analysis of the experiments of tödter et al 2019 we considered a partially and fully immersed cylinder with low mass damping ratios of 0 0152 and 0 0051 respectively at reduced velocities of up to 10 5 and reynolds numbers of up to 7 68 104 we measured structural displacements using the dic processing method and compared results with classical measurements of triaxial accelerometers obtained from two fold integration additionally we evaluated and discussed the influence of different post processing techniques and air trapping on dic and compared two different patterns applied to the test body for dic measurements our objective was to assess the suitability of using the dic for viv investigations due to its advantage of not influencing the flow field in future dic may become the state of the art measurement technique to experimentally investigate fluid structure interactions additionally we provided viv measurements of a fully submerged cylinder of low mass ratio m 0 556 and the two degrees of freedom motions of a surface piercing cylinder although extensive literature does exist on the topic of viv experimental data dealing with these two kinds of cylinders is still lacking 2 experimental setup the physical tests were performed in a circulating water channel of the institute of ship technology ocean engineering and transport systems ismt of the university of duisburg essen the channel s test section had a depth of 670 mm width of 1470 mm and length of 6000 mm the channel s maximum inflow velocity was about 2 4 m s the turbulence of the flow at the channel s centre of 300 mm breadth varied between 2 37 and 3 66 for flow velocities between 0 5 m s and 2 3 m s the tank walls were made of glass to allow optical access we considered two hollow circular cylinders of different length and identical diameter both cylinders were composed of polyvinyl chloride pvc with an outer diameter of 32 mm an inner diameter of 28 6 mm and a wall thickness of 1 7 mm the length of the partially immersed cylinder was 900 mm and it extended through the free surface the fully immersed cylinder was 600 mm long free decay tests obtained the cylinders natural frequencies and damping ratios these tests were performed using a mechanism that initially deflected a cylinder holding it and then releasing it a fast fourier transformation fft of the measured accelerometer signal yielded the first natural frequency the damping ratio ζ was calculated via equation 1 where n is the peak number and y n and y n 1 are two successive peaks of the decaying oscillations table 1 lists dimensions and properties of the two cylinders tödter et al 2019 1 1 n ln y n y n 1 2 π ζ 1 ζ 2 both cylinders were equipped with triaxial accelerometers of type disynet da3802 15g the sensors measured static and dynamic accelerations up to 15 g and weighed 0 015 kg each due to their size of 15 15 15 mm3 the sensors were placed inside the cylinders an uncertainty of 0 3 characterised the accelerometer measurements we used an hbm quantumx data acquisition system having a sampling rate of 2400 hz the fully immersed cylinder was equipped with one accelerometer located 40 mm underneath the top a cap of 25 mm height weighing 0 019 kg was plugged into the upper opening of the cylinder to prevent flooding the partially immersed cylinder was equipped with three accelerometers one accelerometer was placed at the top the other two 510 mm and 610 mm below the top to compare measured data obtained from the dic and the accelerometers both methods had to consider identical positions thus at least some of the accelerometers had to be placed far below the free surface because the dic method was able to capture the displacement at the same position without being affected by ventilation the cables connecting the sensors were guided through the bottom end of the cylinders to minimise the influence of the cables on the dynamic displacements the cylinders were fixed to a force torque sensor located underneath the tank bottom we used the force torque sensor schunk theta 68 si 1500 240 having a force resolution of 0 5 n with a measurement range of 1500 n and a torque resolution of 0 05 nm with a measurement range of 240 nm its general measurement uncertainty was less than 1 but its uncertainty was 5 at the lower end of the measurement range a vertical gap of 5 mm was specified between the bottom and the cylinder fig 1 depicts the experimental setup and sensor arrangements of both cylinders the global flow velocity was measured 500 mm in front of the test cylinders using a schiltknecht miniwater 20 velocity meter flow velocity measurements were within an overall accuracy of 2 the flow meter was removed after the channel flow speed was reached and before the start of each measurement run 2 1 optical setup and calibration two phantom v9 1 high speed cameras captured images for the stereoscopic 3d dic measurements the distance between the cameras and the cylinder was 1 0 m for the fully immersed cylinder and 1 2 m for the partially immersed cylinder the angle between the optical axes of both cameras was 23 7 both cameras were equipped with lenses of 50 mm focal length set to apertures of f 5 6 images were acquired with a frame rate of 300 fps and an exposure time of 800 μs a total of 1500 images were captured during each run which corresponded to 5 0 s measurement duration graph a of fig 2 shows an image of the experimental setup and graph b of fig 2 depicts the setup schematically four spotlights each equipped with 12 white high power leds illuminated the area of interest a black coated perspex plate was placed inside the tank at the opposite side wall of the channel and served as a uniform background to avoid reflections due to the small angle between the cameras cylinder motions in the direction of flow were most likely detected in the focal plane while cylinder motions in the direction transverse to the flow were observed normal to the focal plane software lavision davis 10 with the strainmaster module was used to reconstruct the monopile surface and to compute displacements a high speed controller obtained precise high speed records of synchronised dic and accelerometer measurements before the tests the optical setup was calibrated using a suitable volumetric calibration target the fields of view for the partially and the fully immersed cylinders were specified as 148 350 and 210 285 mm2 respectively the target enclosed the entire width of both fields of view but they did not cover their heights completely a third order polynomial function approximated the calibrated image distortion thus the optical resolutions for the partially and the fully immersed cylinders were 4 623 and 5 723 pixel mm respectively root mean square rms values of 0 1948 and 0 1495 were obtained by applying the calibration for the upper and lower target levels respectively of the fully immersed cylinder for the partially immersed cylinder rms values of 0 1704 and 0 1564 respectively were obtained for the upper and lower target levels it was challenging to estimate measurement uncertainties using dic because of the variety of parameters influencing these measurements such uncertainties included for example the camera setup specifically the distance between the cameras and the specimen other uncertainties comprised the angle between the cameras the cameras resolution illumination and the speckle patterns and subset sizes one possibility to quantify these uncertainties was to deflect a specimen and to compare the measurements with the reference condition unfortunately it was impossible to assess these uncertainties banks et al 2105 and giovannetti et al 2017 measured uncertainties for comparable setups banks et al 2015 determined uncertainties of less than 1 for deflections between 0 5 and 25 mm and giovannetti et al 2017 obtained uncertainties of less than 3 for deflections larger than 0 5 mm and uncertainties of less than 0 5 for deflection larger than 10 mm table 2 compares main features of setups documented in the literature and the setup we used here the distance between cameras and specimen and the resolutions we used were similar to those of banks et al 2015 however the angle between the cameras differed markedly and the patterns were not comparable wang et al 2011 showed that the measurement accuracy of out of plane motions here the transverse displacements increases with increasing angle between cameras they found that decreasing the camera angle from 40 to 20 increases the measurement uncertainty by about 85 7 additionally we had to estimate the influence of the pattern on accuracy fig 15 shows that dic results obtained with the dabbed sponge pattern compare less favourable with accelerometer results than dic results obtained with a dotted speckle pattern as seen for the motion amplitude of about a 0 3 the difference between the resulting normalised motion amplitudes for both measurement techniques is 0 0344 for the dabbed pattern and 0 0227 for the dotted speckle pattern therefore we estimated that the dabbed pattern increased our measurement uncertainties by about 51 5 accounting for the uncertainties assessed by banks et al 2015 and the uncertainties regarding the influence of our camera angles and our dabbed pattern yielded a total uncertainty for our measured transverse displacements of about 2 81 for in plane motions in our case the longitudinal motions wang et al 2011 showed that at a camera angle of 20 measurement uncertainties amount to about 20 of measurement uncertainties for out of plane motions based on these findings this yielded an uncertainty of 0 56 for our measurement of longitudinal motions measurement uncertainties using the dotted speckle pattern were smaller compared to the dabbed pattern because the negative influences of the dabbed pattern ceased this led to measurement uncertainties of 1 86 for our transverse motions and 0 37 for our longitudinal motions 2 2 pattern designs and application we used two different speckle patterns to depict their influence on dic measurements graph a of fig 3 shows the first pattern which was applied by dabbing a sponge and water resistant varnish onto the cylinder surface this pattern type was applied to the fully and the partially immersed cylinders graph b of fig 3 depicts the second pattern which was obtained using the lavision random pattern generator the diameter of the dots was 2 0 mm and the minimum distance between them was 1 0 mm the pattern was printed on an adhesive heavy duty foil which was stuck on the partially immersed cylinder after the dabbed pattern was removed generally foils should not have been used for dic measurements because they may induce strains themselves thus our comparison of both of these patterns had to consider also the suitability of foils for viv tests 2 3 data processing we used the software lavision davis 10 with the module strainmaster to process the images and to compute the displacements fig 4 depicts the applied processing workflow starting with the raw image and finishing with the time series of e g the transverse displacement first one camera identified a raw image of the cylinder with the attached speckle pattern in front of a dark background and the area of interest was masked to speed up the subsequent computations and to avoid influences of patterns that were not associated with the test body four initial subsets shown as blue squares in the left graph of fig 4 specify the local references which were tracked and used to compute the deformations each subset had to be large enough to contain a sufficiently distinctive intensity pattern and small enough to compute reasonably accurate displacements pan et al 2008 recommended using small subsets our subsets consisted of 31 31 pixels and step sizes were 10 pixels the step size defined the distance between the centres of two subsets during processing every pattern shift was computed relative to the first image characterised by the highest specified level of accuracy next the 3d body surface was reconstructed and displacements as well as strains were computed and mapped onto the cylinder surface results for the upper end of the cylinder could not be obtained because the ventilation which was depicted on the images prevented recognition of the speckle pattern the third step defined virtual strain gauges and computed time series of the displacements here two strain gauges red squares were chosen to plot the local displacements the adjustable strain gauge size of 15 15 mm2 corresponded to the dimensions of the accelerometers finally displacements were plotted as time series to visualise their dynamic behaviour as the displacements were calculated relative to the first image in which some displacements may already have been present and as it was not the start of the vibration the time series were not symmetric about the abscissa oscillation amplitudes were statistically evaluated by calculating their median value over the measurement duration when comparing the structural response between different flow velocities this was necessary because the motion amplitude varied with time using the median instead of the average value was beneficial because it was considered to be more robust against outliers when the number of entities was small a 20 hz low pass filter of fifth order was applied to the raw accelerometer signals to remove high frequency accelerations and thus to focus on the fundamental oscillation the two fold integration was performed using the trapezoidal rule afterwards a 1 0 hz high pass filter of fifth order was applied to the integrated signal only then was it possible to compare the displacements resulting from the dic measurements with the displacements obtained from the two fold integrated acceleration signals fig 5 depicts the raw and the filtered accelerometer signals of transverse oscillation of the partially immersed cylinder at a reduced velocity of 4 86 3 results graph a in fig 6 shows the longitudinal and transverse median acceleration amplitudes for the partially and the fully immersed cylinders at small reduced velocities of less than about 4 0 the longitudinal amplitude is larger than the transverse amplitude indicating a lower streamwise branch the transverse amplitude increases above the longitudinal amplitude at higher reduced velocities indicating the resonance region the partially immersed cylinder attains its maximum transverse acceleration amplitude of 22 2 m s2 at a reduced velocity of 7 29 the fully immersed cylinder reaches its maximum acceleration amplitude of 123 0 m s2 at a reduced velocity of 5 18 the maximum longitudinal amplitudes are 7 9 and 190 6 m s2 at reduced velocities of 8 51 and 5 18 respectively graphs b and c in fig 6 depict comparative normalised median motion amplitudes versus reduced velocity of the above time series obtained from the dic and the accelerometers via two fold integration for the partially b and the fully c immersed cylinders here the normalised motion amplitude is a a d and the reduced velocity is u u f d where a is the motion amplitude u is the free stream velocity f is the oscillating frequency and d is the cylinders outer diameter for the partially immersed cylinder these amplitudes were based on the accelerations of accelerometer acc 2 as seen in graph b of fig 6 the longitudinal motion amplitude was dominant up to a reduced velocity of 2 84 afterwards resonance occurred generating relatively large amplitude transverse oscillations up to a reduced velocity of 9 72 at resonance the longitudinal motion was negligibly small at the beginning of measurements the cylinders were already longitudinally deflected by the flow as this deflection was not captured the longitudinal deflections contained a quasi static component for the fully immersed cylinder the motion amplitudes were based on the accelerations of accelerometer acc 1 as seen in graph c of fig 6 at low reduced velocities of up to 3 29 longitudinal motion amplitudes were dominant whereas at higher flow velocities transverse oscillations were dominant again indicating the viv effect the longitudinal amplitudes increased slowly up to a reduced velocity of 3 83 and then followed the trend of the transverse amplitudes the resonance peak supposedly occurred at a reduced velocity of about 5 48 fatigue damage as a consequence of the vortex induced loads destroyed this fully immersed cylinder when the reduced velocity reached 5 75 consequently the complete lock in region of the fully immersed cylinder could not be investigated however the maximum flow velocity of the circulating towing tank was not large enough to display the complete lock in region graph d of fig 6 displays the relation between the dominant frequency of the longitudinal oscillation f l and of the transverse oscillation f t for the fully immersed cylinder the frequency ratio equals 2 0 under resonance conditions compare goncalves et al 2012 2013 here the frequency ratio for the fully immersed cylinder approaches about 2 0 at reduced velocities exceeding 3 29 indicating the lock in region the frequency ratio remains constant at higher reduced velocities thus our experiments did not capturer the end of resonance i e the complete lock in region the frequency relation for the partially submerged cylinder under resonance conditions was not as clearly determined as for the fully submerged cylinder graph b in fig 6 indicates the beginning of resonance occurring at a reduced velocity of 2 88 this corresponds to a sudden drop of the frequency relation for the partially immersed cylinder in graph d in fig 6 the frequency relation decreases slightly with increasing reduced velocity this might have been caused by the increased ventilation affecting the mass ratio m and the immersed share of the cylinder based on these results the frequency relation for a partially immersed cylinder at resonance conditions was deduced as follows 2 f l f t 2 m l air l water u start u here the number 2 represents the frequency ratio for a fully submerged cylinder l air is the cylinder length in air l water is the cylinder length in water u start is the reduced velocity at the beginning of resonance and u is the reduced velocity in the resonance region graph d in fig 6 displays the deduced relation as a dashed black line and shows that for the partially immersed cylinder the considered reduced velocities do not exceed the resonance region the strouhal like number s t f t d u was calculated using the transverse oscillation frequency f t assuming that it represented the vortex shedding frequency f s compare goncalves et al 2013 for the fully submerged cylinder the strouhal like number varies between 0 16 and 0 18 for reduced velocities below 3 83 at increased reduced velocities the strouhal like number decreases down to 0 129 thus the strouhal like number decreases with increasing motion amplitude for the partially submerged cylinder the strouhal like number varies randomly for small reduced velocities below 2 62 where longitudinal motions dominate this might have resulted from small transverse motions in this region which were challenging to resolve between reduced velocities of 2 62 and 7 86 the strouhal like number first decreases to 0 143 corresponding to increasing transverse motion amplitudes and then increases to 0 16 corresponding to decreasing transverse motion amplitudes at higher reduced velocities the strouhal like number decreases again down to 0 127 which might have been caused by increased longitudinal accelerations additionally we measured transverse flow velocities in the wake of the partially immersed cylinder with a laser doppler velocimeter ldv for two different free stream velocities the resulting time series had to be interpolated for uniform time steps to perform ffts to obtain the shedding frequencies f s for a reduced velocity of 4 05 the shedding frequency was 5 50 hz for a reduced velocity of 6 08 the shedding frequency was 6 83 hz this corresponded to strouhal numbers of s t f s d u of 0 176 and 0 146 respectively and indicated that the strouhal number decreased with increasing motion amplitudes the resulting strouhal numbers compare favourably to the calculated strouhal like numbers confirming the usage of the strouhal like number the differences between strouhal and strouhal like numbers were due to the fact that they were obtained in different test runs fig 7 plots the strouhal and strouhal like numbers versus reduced velocities for the fully and the partially submerged cylinder the strouhal number for stationary cylinders is generally estimated as s t 0 2 compare griffin 1978 leong and wei 2008 obtained a strouhal number of 0 16 for large oscillations a y 2 a x 2 5 thus confirming our results fig 8 presents comparative two second close up time series of structural response for the partially immersed cylinder at reduced velocities of 3 24 4 86 7 29 and 8 10 determined by the dic processing method and a two fold integration of the accelerations of accelerometer acc 2 graphs a and b of fig 8 plot longitudinal and transverse displacements respectively and graph c of fig 8 shows the associated amplitude spectra for a five second measurement duration obtained by fft fig 9 shows comparative motion trajectories over ten oscillations of the partially immersed cylinder at the same reduced velocities considered in fig 8 obtained from both measuring methods these trajectories are here displayed on a cartesian coordinate plane where the abscissa identifies longitudinal displacements and the ordinate transverse displacements as seen motion amplitudes were strongly affected by the flow velocity at the reduced velocity of 3 24 transverse amplitudes were larger than longitudinal amplitudes ending up in a crescent shaped trajectory with increasing flow velocities transverse amplitudes increased markedly as resonant conditions were approached and the trajectories took on a vertical shape at the beginning of resonance the fft frequency plots in graph c of fig 8 show a sharp peak indicating that the cylinder oscillated at a single constant frequency when approaching the resonance frequency the frequency peak became wider and covered a broader band of frequencies beyond resonance at the reduced velocity of 9 72 the associated frequency plot contains several small peaks over a wider range of frequencies the trajectories at reduced velocities of 8 10 and 9 72 show that at higher flow velocities beyond the resonance peak transverse oscillations decreased significantly and the cylinder s structural response became erratic under resonance conditions the fft frequency plots did not identify distinct amplitude peaks of the longitudinal displacement nevertheless it was typical that for the fully immersed cylinder the longitudinal oscillation frequency was twice the transverse oscillation frequency graph c of fig 10 depicts this behaviour analogously figs 10 and 11 present the structural response of the fully immersed cylinder at reduced velocities of 2 74 3 29 3 83 and 5 48 obtained from the two measuring methods here the longitudinal oscillation was dominant at a reduced velocity of 2 74 with the beginning of resonance at a reduced velocity of 3 29 longitudinal oscillations became more prominent as the flow velocity increased at the reduced velocity of 2 74 the shape of the cylinder s trajectory was a strongly squeezed figure eight however at reduced velocities that caused large amplitude transverse resonance oscillations the trajectory s shape changed becoming crescent shaped at reduced velocities that caused transverse peak oscillations here motion trajectories repeatedly obtained from the dic processing method were closer to each other than those from accelerometer measurements and a more curved crescent characterised the shape of their trajectories at resonant reduced velocities around 4 93 and 5 48 longitudinal and transverse amplitudes were significantly larger compared to those at a reduced velocity of 3 83 furthermore for this fully immersed cylinder the amplitudes of longitudinal oscillations were relatively large as they turned out to be about two thirds as large as the amplitudes of the transverse oscillation recall that this was not the case for the partially immersed cylinder see figs 8 and 9 our comparative results demonstrated that the agreement was sufficiently favourable between deformations and motions evaluated using the dic processing method and the accelerometer measurements for transverse motion amplitudes between 3 and 10 mm for motion amplitudes below 3 mm the results differed slightly there were two possible explanations for this deviation on the one hand the dic pattern might have been too coarse to depict the small motions thus leading to a lack of spatial resolution on the other hand smaller motions corresponded to reduced accelerations at constant or similar frequencies which may have been resolved less accurately by the accelerometers thus the source of this deviation could not be clearly identified for transverse motion amplitudes larger than of 5 0 mm the deviation between both measurement techniques first increased slightly up to amplitudes of 7 5 mm for the partially immersed cylinder and up to amplitudes of 20 mm for the fully immersed cylinder the pattern on both cylinders was applied manually by dabbing with a sponge consequently the patterns differed thus potentially causing different deviations for the partially immersed cylinder the deviation increased until the transverse motion amplitude reached its maximum afterwards the deviation declined with decreasing motion amplitude for the fully immersed cylinder the deviation increased strongly for transverse motions amplitudes over 20 mm under these conditions the accelerometer operated in its over range region which influenced its measuring accuracy regarding the dic processing method the dabbed sponge pattern may not have been suitable for displacements of this order of magnitude on the other hand the transverse motion occurred primarily along the optical axis of the cameras and thus they were affected by the depth of field furthermore these displacements may have been too large to be captured correctly by our camera setup as the reliability of our results depended especially on the angle between cameras the transverse motion deviation increased at larger transverse displacement which was also shown by sutton et al 2008 the longitudinal oscillations obtained from both measurement techniques agreed favourably due to the fact that longitudinal motions were in plane motions and these motions were captured more accurately with our setup had further tests been performed the optical setup should have been modified that is the focal plane then should have been oriented in accordance with the vertical and transverse axes of the test cylinder nevertheless the dic processing method was capable and suitable for experimental viv investigations and delivered sufficiently accurate results for the test cases we considered 3 1 influence of the dic processing techniques on displacements the software we used for the dic processing method provides several alternative techniques to analyse the captured images we compared two such techniques to evaluate their influence on the dic results the relative to first rtf technique evaluated the pattern shift by analysing every recorded image relative to the first image the sum of differentials sod technique evaluated the pattern shift by analysing subsequent images and summing up the pattern shifts up to the considered image additionally we considered and compared three levels of computational accuracy here referred to as the accurate the medium and the fast levels the interpolation procedure and convergence criteria differed for these three levels furthermore we investigated the influence of an additional second order displacement gradient caused by nonlinear deformations this gradient increased the accuracy for large deformations lu and cary 2000 and yielded fewer systematic errors schreier and sutton 2002 fig 12 shows the resulting displacement time series as well as a close up at the last depicted motion peak calculated by applying different processing techniques on the raw data of a typical test here for the partially immerged cylinder at a reduce velocity of 4 86 as seen the influence of computational accuracy and the second order displacement gradient on the resulting displacement was relatively small the deviation between peak values resulting from the accurate and the fast computational levels shown in the close up in fig 12 was only 0 037 the peak considering second order displacements deviated by only 0 016 from the accurate result thus this particular case was not significantly affected by nonlinear displacements however a significant difference was obtained from the rtf and the sod techniques the sod technique delivered a displacement at the first peak which was compared to the other technique about 0 12 mm larger in the transverse direction the software supplier recommends using the rtf technique for processing because the sod technique is considered to be prone to sequential errors considering the entire measurement duration of 5 s the first and last peaks deviated by 1 75 and 1 70 respectively between these peaks the maximum deviation was 2 58 thus the error did not sequentially increase in this case but it varied with time however the deviation of the motion amplitude in the depicted time interval was relatively small and thus tolerable 3 2 repeatability and statistical influences the turbulent flow caused motion amplitudes to vary with time as previously shown in figs 8 and 9 thus the measurement duration needed to be long enough to balance those fluctuations statistically this was challenging for the dic processing method because the duration of the acquisition interval was limited by the cameras memory capacity reducing the frame rate would have allowed increasing the duration of the acquisition interval but at the cost of a reduced temporal discretisation graph a of fig 13 depicts three repetitive measured time series of accelerations for the partially immersed cylinder at three different reduced velocities of 2 43 4 86 and 6 52 the measured motion amplitudes of theses repeated time series were of the same order of magnitude but their evolutions over the time differed this was not considered to be due to the inaccuracy of the measurement technique because such variations of the oscillating motion amplitudes were observed even in high speed video recordings furthermore each repetitive time series was characterised by an individual motion history of the test cylinder as it did not start when the flow velocity was zero graph b of fig 13 displays the ffts of the time series depicted in graph a as seen there is no resonance at a reduced velocity of 2 43 blue curves thus no distinct peaks exist but the curves behave favourably as the resonance region is reached the three ffts of the time series at a reduced velocity of 4 86 red curves show clear peaks however these peaks still differ slightly for two repetitions but strongly for a third repetition for the resonance peak at a reduced velocity of 6 52 green curve all three ffts show sharp peaks which are identical for two repetitions but differ slightly for a third repetition however the frequencies at the peaks of the ffts of all three repetitions compare favourably for each flow velocity thus the cylinder oscillated at a similar frequency for each repetition although the motions amplitude varied for the three repetitive time series of longitudinal and transverse amplitudes graph c of fig 13 plots the associated median motion amplitudes and their standard deviations obtained from the dic processing method and from accelerometer measurements for the partially submerged cylinder at the reduced velocity of 4 86 generally the amplitudes and standard deviations decrease with increasing measurement duration specifically for the time series of 5 s duration the transverse amplitude is 5 39 0 56 mm whereas for the time series of 180 s duration the transverse amplitude decreases to a nearly constant value of 4 78 0 01 mm analogously for the time series of 70 s duration the longitudinal amplitude decreases from 0 342 0 067 mm to 0 285 0 011 mm thus measurement durations of at least 160 s ensured small standard deviations between repetitive time series of 0 21 in the transverse and 3 86 in the longitudinal direction respectively incidentally median values and small standard deviations of 0 281 0 007 mm for the longitudinal and 4 83 0 16 mm for the transverse amplitudes here for the three repetitive time series obtained from the dic processing method demonstrated that the relatively short measurement duration was also capable to produce repeatable results nevertheless short measurement durations could not ensure reliable results therefore when using the dic processing method we felt it necessary to maximise the measurement duration or to repeat the measurements especially if statistical measures were sought after this prolonged the test campaigns and subjected the test cylinders to higher fatigue loads fig 14 shows comparative median longitudinal and transverse motion amplitudes captured with 150 300 and 600 frames per second from the dic processing method for the partially submerged cylinder at reduced velocity of 6 52 we considered this velocity because it was within the resonance region where transverse displacements were larger and more difficult to capture the accelerometer sampling rate remained at 2400 hz to ensure capturing all peaks correctly the difference between motion amplitudes obtained from the dic processing method and from acceleration measurements was similar for each frame rate thus the median amplitude did not depend on the frame rate used but it varied with the repetitions considered because the results based on the accelerometer measurements also varied when their sampling rate remained constant therefore it was suitable to reduce the frame rate to extend the measurement duration 3 3 pattern influences fig 15 plots comparative transverse normalised median motion amplitudes versus reduced flow velocity for the partially submerged cylinder with the printed dot pattern and with the dabbed sponge pattern for the dot pattern the peak of the median transverse motion amplitudes occur at a lower flow velocity and this peak exceeds the comparative peak for the dabbed sponge pattern differences between amplitudes based on the dic processing method and the accelerometer measurements are significantly larger for the dabbed sponge pattern than for the dot pattern for the sponge pattern the percentage deviation of the maximum median transverse motion amplitude of 10 52 mm is 22 15 and the total deviation is 2 33 mm in comparison for the dot pattern this percentage deviation of 13 02 mm is only 9 55 and the total deviation is 1 24 mm as the kind of pattern did not influence the accuracy of the accelerometer readings we concluded that the dot pattern allowed more accurate dic measurements than the sponge pattern however the foil did affect the structural properties of the cylinder its natural frequency is shifted to 7 86 hz and its mass ratio to 0 725 furthermore the cylinder surface became smoother and smoother surfaces tended to cause larger resonant motion amplitudes at lower velocities compared to raw surfaces gao et al 2015 our results demonstrated that the patterns we printed on foils were suitable for optical displacement measurements however the surface roughness should have been monitored when dealing with viv 3 4 influence of ventilation the partially submerged surface piercing cylinder induced significant ventilation which grew with increasing flow velocities and transverse motion amplitudes nevertheless less ventilation was observed at flow velocities that did not induce resonance graph a of fig 16 shows a bubble pattern with vortices shed from the cylinder at a reduced velocity of 7 29 at this velocity the amount of ventilation reaches its maximum the bubble structures covered the cylinder surface and this prevented obtaining optical measurements using the dic processing method graph b of fig 16 shows the region where the dic processing method was able to recognise the pattern on the test body and graph c of fig 16 depicts the 3d surface reconstruction including the cut out caused by ventilation consequently although ventilation reduced the region that can be analysed using the dic processing method the application of this method was not completely disqualified 3 5 force and torque measurements graph a of fig 17 depicts comparative measured median transverse and longitudinal force amplitudes for the partially and the fully immersed cylinder in

added mass force f p and the vortex force f v jauvtis and williamson 2004 recall that small force amplitudes were within the sensor s resolution range of 0 5 n and therefore they had to be considered critically generally the median force amplitudes follow the trend of the median motion amplitudes in graphs b and c of fig 6 for both cylinders for the partially immersed cylinder the force amplitudes show an initial streamwise branch at low reduced velocities the resonance region starts as reduced velocities increase whereby the transverse force amplitude is larger than the longitudinal force amplitude in contrast to motion amplitudes longitudinal force amplitudes increase slowly in the resonance region and rapidly at reduced velocities above 8 00 indicating the end of resonance the acceleration amplitudes in graph a of fig 6 show the same trend for the fully immersed cylinder longitudinal force amplitudes are dominant up to a reduced velocity of 1 12 at higher reduced velocities transverse and longitudinal force amplitudes increase strongly here transverse force amplitudes are dominant indicating resonance in addition graph b of fig 17 plots the calculated lift and drag coefficients c l f l 0 5 ρ a v 2 and c d f t 0 5 ρ a v 2 where f l and f t are the total longitudinal and transverse forces respectively ρ is the fluid density v is the free stream velocity and a d l is the projected area of the cylinder s immersed length l and diameter d here the initial streamwise branch of drag coefficients for the partially and the fully immersed cylinders attain their maxima at low flow velocities for the fully submerged cylinder the initial streamwise branch of the drag coefficient is even higher than in the lock in region where motion amplitudes and longitudinal forces are maximal nevertheless lift coefficients for the partially and the fully immersed cylinders follow the trend of their respective force and motion amplitudes graph c of fig 17 depicts longitudinal and transverse median torque amplitudes and calculated torques i e the product of force and cylinder length for the fully immersed cylinder longitudinal torque amplitudes are dominant at reduced velocities below 1 12 and transverse torque amplitudes are dominant at reduced velocities above 1 12 the calculated torques amplitudes dotted lines compare favourably to measured torque amplitudes indicating that the force attacked the top of the cylinder for the partially immersed cylinder the longitudinal torque amplitudes are dominant at reduced velocities below 2 43 and the transverse torque amplitudes are dominant at higher reduced velocities the calculated transverse torque amplitudes force amplitude multiplied with the immersed cylinder length compare favourably to the measured results at reduced velocities below 3 65 and above 8 51 in between measured torque amplitudes are larger than the calculated amplitudes indicating that the point of attack of the force was located above the calm water surface this might have been caused by an increased water surface surrounding the oscillating cylinder as seen our calculated longitudinal torque amplitudes do not match the measured amplitudes at reduced velocities below 2 84 and above 7 70 our calculations overestimate the torque amplitudes at reduced velocities between 2 84 and 7 70 however our calculations underestimate the torque amplitudes these differences might have been caused by the inadequate resolutions of the sensor and its associated insufficient accuracy at the lower measurement range recall that the sensor s force resolution of 0 5 n was relatively large compared to its finer torque resolution of 0 05 nm consequently torque measurements were more accurate within the considered measurement range graph d of fig 17 plots frequency ratio of the dominant longitudinal and transverse frequency for the force and torque oscillation respectively versus reduced velocity as seen for the fully immersed cylinder the frequency ratios of these oscillations reach the value of 2 0 after passing through its resonance region however for the partially immersed cylinder the corresponding frequency ratio of these oscillations reaches the value of 1 0 after passing through its resonance region for the partially immersed cylinder the frequency ratio of torque oscillations is unity until the reduced velocity attains a value of 8 87 at higher reduced velocities this frequency ratio increases reaching a value of up to 4 85 at reduced velocities between 4 46 and 7 29 the frequency ratio for the force oscillations also attains the value of 1 0 at lesser reduced velocities the frequency ratio fluctuates between 1 00 and 2 86 at reduced velocities greater than 7 29 the frequency ratio reaches the value of 4 04 and then decreases slowly again this behaviour contradicted the frequency ratio obtained from accelerometer based results the disparity could have resulted from the less reliable measurements of the force torque sensor as they were obtained near the resolution limit of this sensor the finally resolved accelerometer based results were more trustworthy our comparative force torque measurements showed the occurrence of the same lower stream wise branch and consequently the same resonance region for both cylinders as the force torque sensor was placed underneath the tank bottom it did not influence the flow field or the cylinders properties making it a suitable measurement technique with an easy setup however for the sensor we used the resolution of the lower boundary of the measurement region was limited thus results had to be analysed critically this might have caused the oscillation frequencies obtained from the force torque sensor to differ from the frequencies obtained from the accelerometers or the dic however amplitudes could not be obtained from the force torque sensor which turned out to be a major drawback for our viv investigations 4 conclusions extensive experimental investigations of the vortex induced vibration viv of a fully and a partially immersed cylinder exposed to water flow were carried out the structural response was measured using 3d digital image correlation dic processing method as well as a set of triaxial accelerometers and a force torque sensor a speckle pattern was applied to both cylinders to perform the dic measurements the results of both measurement methods were compared and discussed in the context of their suitability for viv investigations results from both methods agreed favourably for medium transverse motion amplitudes however for small motion amplitudes the speckle pattern required some improvement the pattern design and optical arrangement influenced the measurements of large transverse motion amplitudes measured force and torque amplitudes agreed favourably with the trend of accelerometer and dic results however small amplitudes were difficult to capture due to the sensor s limited resolution additionally we studied the influence of processing techniques for the dic method the relative to first pattern shift computation technique provided the best results different accuracy levels were compared but their influence was negligibly small for the test conditions we considered to obtain results within a short period of time the low level accuracy was sufficient as its deviation from the high level accuracy was only 0 14 whereas its computational effort was about 60 less furthermore we obtained and compared dic measurements using two different speckle patterns the first pattern was dapped manually with a sponge while the second dot pattern was printed on a heavy duty adhesive foil attached to the cylinder the dot pattern delivered measurements that deviated less from the accelerometer based measurements and thus they were more accurate measurements nevertheless the attached foil influenced the viv results by smoothing the surface roughness this led to larger transverse motion amplitudes at lower flow velocities yet the cylinders natural frequency and mass ratios hardly changed we investigated the repeatability of dic measurements for turbulent flows a certain measurement duration was necessary to analyse the structural response statistically for our test cases we required an acquisition time of at least 160 s however such a long acquisition time was not obtainable at reasonable cost using the dic method the cameras memory was the limiting factor the acquisition duration could have been extended by reducing the frame rate without a significant reduction of measurement accuracy fortunately for our viv investigation only a relatively low frame rate was necessary because the most relevant oscillations occurred at the lowest natural frequencies furthermore it was possible to combine results from several subsequent image acquisition periods to process statistical data for a single test condition the major challenge when applying the dic method was that an optical access was inevitably required we showed that ventilation disturbed the dic measurements however the method could still be applied as long as parts of the speckle patterns were recognisable using the dic method required a rather complex experimental setup considering the implementation of optical and electrical equipment and the associated cabling the influence of inappropriately distributed masses for acceleration measurements was another major issue nevertheless using accelerometers allowed us to obtain measurements at high acquisition rates over long durations at relatively low cost compared to high speed imaging furthermore the dic measuring process required a complex processing technique compared to the relatively straight forward integration of
